You can get this full seminar to stream on demand any time – the whole thing – five sessions included with your membership deal for Black Friday. The five sessions are: Each session from the seminar is about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes long (we started at 10:00 am and went to around 5:30 pm), and I packed an incredible amount of info on this day. I have toured the country with my Lightroom Live seminar, and tickets cost $99 (either live or to stream it), but now you can get this free with our KelbyOne Membership Black Friday Deal. Here’s the link with details (or to sign up and get this deal), and you’ll see the full Black Friday deal we’ve put together is pretty mind-blowing (and includes our “Ultimate Lightroom Bundle” and so much more.

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/100-things-im-thankful-for-this-year/",
    "description": "Today is a big holiday in the US; it’s a day when we take time off to celebrate all the things we’re thankful for. We get together with family, over-eat a traditional Thanksgiving Day meal, and then watch football until we pass out. It’s just about a perfect day. I feel especially grateful for the many blessings I enjoy all year long, and I wanted to take a few minutes to share the things I’m thankful for this Thanksgiving Day. I believe counting your blessings is one of the best things a person can do (and that this list of 100 is only a start is a real blessing to me for sure). Here they are (in no particular order). I’m thankful…. 2. that my wife found the Netflix romantic comedy series, “Nobody Wants This.” It’s so good – we cannot wait for Season Two. 3. for all the time’s Larry Becker brings me some great new Keto food he’s found, like Quest’s Blueberry Bake Shop Muffins. Only 3 Net Carbs per muffin. Larry is the low-carb king! 4. for the “beware of dogs” signs on our fence that keep people from being eaten by our very protective doggos. 5. that my son and daughter-in-law live so close and pop in several times a week just to hang out. We are so lucky. 6. that Seinfeld reruns are on Netflix on demand. I love to have it on in the background while I’m editing photos. 7. that for Black Friday all the software plug-ins I use in my music production are on ridiculous discount sales – some as much as 80% off. I live for these deals! 8. that my daughter still cares that I bake my special “Christmas Cookies” each year when we put up the tree (and I’m grateful she thinks Pillsbury means ‘special’). 9. for Chicky Nando. I love that guy. Everybody does! 10. for the wonderful photographers that come to my workshops around the world. These are about the most fun things I get to do all year, and I’m so grateful for the friends I’ve made on them. 11. to the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa, whose Roulette Wheel paid for my new red Fender Telecaster. I’m not a gambler, but I was that day. LOL!! 12. for Eric Hathaway on our video team. He’s been here a few years now, and he fits the team like a glove, and I’m glad I get to work with him. 13. for the wonderful Christmas music already playing in our house all day. 14. that my wife makes me a completely separate dinner at Thanksgiving every year since she knows I don’t like Turkey, stuffing, or pretty much any of the traditional Thanksgiving foods. 15. that KFC has a pretty incredible spicy Chicken Sandwich, and there’s a fairly new KFC near me (for those non-Keto moments). 16. for all the cool stuff they keep adding to Photoshop. 17. that I get to work at home most days, and when I do go in, I get to work with the most awesome people. 18. for how wonderful my daughter-in-law treats my son. They’ve been married a few years now, but they treat each other like they’re on their honeymoon. 19. that Bryce Young is starting to have some success on The Panthers. He’s a great kid, and a gifted player, on a pretty bad team, but I think the rest of the NFL is waking up to that. 20. to have Terry and Victoria White as my dear friends. You could not ask for better friends. 21. for any time there’s an empty middle seat. 22. that I got to go to Tokyo with my whole family and that we had such a very special time in a very special place. Truly an unforgettable trip. 23. for all the times when my wife knows exactly what to say and how to say it 24. that there’s going to be another season of Ted Lasso. 25. to see my wife’s beautiful face each morning and her smile that still melts my heart. 26. for the free updates this year to Logic Pro X (the software I use for music production). It keeps getting better and better. 27. that our Christmas Tree is already up 28. that we have so many family dinners together. There’s so much laughter and love all around.  29. that the girl of my dreams and I celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary this year. 30. for Rick Sammon. He. Is. The. Best! 31. for everyone who tunes in to watch “The Grid.” We’re in something like our 11th year, and I still love it. 32. for all the awesome photographers who attended our online conferences this year. 33. that my daughter got my wife’s sense of humor. She cracks me up (and she’s so much fun to be around). 34. for Christina Sauer – the head of our video operations. She is the queen of video production, and a joy to work with. 35. for Sola’s low-carb blueberry bagels. The best I’ve had so far. 36. for all the Phillips Hue smart home gear. They make it all so easy. 37. for the little tool on Amazon that fixes all the lights on your Christmas Tree that are out. It literally works like magic! 38. for our three absolutely wonderful, fun-filled, hilarious doggos. They bring our family so much joy every single day. 39. that my daughter has such great friends, and she’s so committed to them (and they to her). 40. for Coffeemate. I freakin’ love it! 41. getting up and hearing my son’s voice in the kitchen because he once again brought my wife her favorite bagel that morning. 42. for the “Christmas Essentials” playlist on Apple Music. 43. to see how happy it makes my wife Kalebra when one of us, any of us, eats a vegetable of any kind. 44. for all the times my wife texts me a heart emoji 45.

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

    "description": "Now that Canon has released the R1 and Sony has updated its a1 II platform, the Nikon Z9 has stiff competition. The title of \"flagship camera\" represents the pinnacle of each company's technological abilities and becomes the outward face of that company for all to judge. Should a flagship camera be able to handle anything that is thrown at it? And is there such a thing as a \"best\" right now? [Read More]",
