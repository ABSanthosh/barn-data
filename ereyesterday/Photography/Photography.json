    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/how-to-remove-things-more-efficiently-in-lightroom/",
    "description": "This relatively new addition to the AI-powered remove tool makes choosing what you want to remove faster and easier. Check it out: Above: Here’s the original image. The lantern on the far right is partially cut off (and I don’t like the fact that we have an even number of lanterns), so we’ll remove it by first clicking on the Remove icon (or just pressing the letter Q on your keyboard to bring up that panel). STEP ONE: In the Remove panel, click on the first icon of tools (the one that looks like an eraser), and then turn on the ‘Use Generative AI’ checkbox (as shown here). STEP TWO: The way this tool works is that you paint FULLY over the object you want to remove (in this case, the lantern on the right), as seen here where I’m painting over the inside area of the lantern. This is where our tip today is coming in – it saves you from having to paint over the entire object and instead lets Lightroom help you get that part done much faster. STEP THREE: The trick is to turn on the “Detect Objects” checkbox (as shown above) before you begin painting over your object. Now, you just have to paint around the outside of the object (as seen with my large brush stroke going around the lantern, as seen above. The center still needs painting over, but now LIghtroom is going to paint that in for me automatically, thanks to the Detect Objects featre. STEP FOUR: When you release the mouse button, it automatically detects the object you just painted over and fills in the rest automatically. That might not seem like a huge shortcut with an object as simple as this lantern, but it can be a big time-saver for more complex objects. STEP FIVE: Once it’s painted in for you, just click the ‘Remove’ button (as shown here), and a status dialog appears for a few seconds (as seen above), while it works its magic. Above: Now the lantern is gone, and Lightroom helped you make selecting it even faster and easier. Just paint a loose brush stroke around the outside of the object you want to select, and it will fill in the inside automatically with ‘Delete Objects” turned on. Hope you found that helpful. Announcing the 2025 KelbyOne VIP Program (and a free webinar all about how it’s helped a group of photographers make a huge leap forward) This is about becoming part of a small group who have the opportunity to grow like never before.

    "description": "Morning, everybody. I just got back from San Francisco, attending Adobe’s Photography Community Summit. They brought together 24 photographers, content creators, and educators from around the world to connect directly with Adobe’s Lightroom team (I met photographers from Japan, Finland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Australia, and more, and it was really great to hang out with these two fine gents above). It was a really great opportunity to meet directly with the Lightroom team and share our thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and anything we thought might be valuable to help steer, nudge, or influence the future development of Lightroom (and yes, I carried the messages you all have let me know matter to you. I talked with the team about them directly. To Death. I’ll be surprised if they ever ask me back). Anyway, it was a fantastic three days – I met some absolutely great people, from the photographers and educators I met to the Adobe folks, who are so incredibly dedicated to making a really great experience and an excellent product for their customers. They are really passionate about it, and you feel that when you talk with them, and I’m glad this group of folks are behind the product that means a lot to us all. Hope you all have a great weekend. Catch you next week. 🙂 -Scott P.S. In the thumbnail shot you saw on the previous page, that’s (from L to R); Me, Matt, Glyn, Aaron, Pye, and Ron.

    "link": "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2024/06/ive-been-working-on-something.html",
    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
