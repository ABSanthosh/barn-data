    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/friday-lightroom-tip-how-to-dock-the-masks-panel-in-the-right-side-panels/",
    "description": "I get asked this question a lot since in all my tutorials, my Mask panel appears near the top of my right side panels rather than at its default location, where it’s floating over the top right corner of the image (ugh!). It’s easy (and here’s how): Above: Here you can see the Masks panel in its default location, where it’s covering part of your image. It is floating, so you can click on the title bar and move it, but I thought that was supposed to be one of the original great things about Lightroom’s interface – it didn’t let a bunch of panels ‘float’ over and interfere with your image area. So, let’s get it docked with the right side panels. STEP ONE: Click and hold right at the top of the Masks panel, up in its title bar (as seen here), and drag it over to the top of the Right Side Panels. When you get it over there, a blue horizontal line will appear (as shown here), and once you see that blue line, all you have to do is release your mouse button, and the Masks panel docks into that position – right below the toolbar (handy location, right?). Also, it’s not visible all the time – it only appears when and while masking. Above: Here’s how it looks when docked near the top of the right side panels. Done. 🙂 The Lightroom Conference is Coming Next Month! It’s May 13th and 14th (with a free bonus pre-con session on May 12th). It’s two+ full days, with two simultaneous training tracks and an instructor team of the very best in the business. Best of all, it’s all online and so affordable that anybody can be a part of it. Head over to KelbyOneLive.com right now to reserve your spot (and save a whopping $150 by registering early). Have a great weekend, everybody. The Sun n’ Fun Aerospace Expo is this weekend, and I’ll be shooting with the crew over there, so hopefully I’ll have some new images to share next week. -Scott The post Friday Lightroom Tip: How to “Dock” The Masks Panel In The Right Side Panels appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
