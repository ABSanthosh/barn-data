    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/adobe-max-release-updates/",
    "description": "Happy Adobe MAX day to all who celebrate! If you check your Adobe Application Manager app you should start to see new versions of your favorite Adobe software starting to appear. Don’t worry if you don’t see it right away as they tend to roll software out to different global regions at different times in a staggered approach, but it will show up soon. Look for a new Lightroom Classic version 14, Lightroom for Mac/Windows version 8, Lightroom for Android/iOS version 10, and Camera Raw version 17 (as well as a new version of Photoshop). Along with support for new cameras, new lenses, and bug fixes, there are a few important new features to be aware of in both Lightroom Classic and Lightroom. Some of the new features are the same in both, but some are also unique to each application. Let’s start with some new features you’ll find just in Lightroom Classic (LrC). New Catalog Upgrade (LrC) As with each new version number change (from 13 to 14 in this case), you will be required to upgrade a copy of the LrC catalog you want to open in the new version. As soon as you launch the new LrC you’ll be prompted through this process. Once new aspect this time around you won’t see the option to rename the new catalog here, but don’t worry as there is a new feature for renaming catalogs we’ll look at in a bit. Additionally, note that this process now includes a step where a compressed copy of the old catalog is created at the same time. This is only to preserve your old catalog in case you need to roll back to the previous version of the software for some unforeseen reason. It is worth checking the new minimum requirements for running the new version before you install. Click Upgrade to begin. When finished, the upgraded copy of the catalog will open in the new version. Rename Catalog (LrC) If you now wish to rename your LrC catalog file (which is entirely optional and only for your benefit), head over to the File menu and look for the new Rename Catalog option there. Clicking that will open the Rename Catalog dialog box, which will auto-populate with the current name of the catalog. Enter in your new name and click the Rename button, which causes LrC to quit and restart with the new name. Optionally, you can check the box to rename the parent folder too. Before relaunching it will confirm the catalog has been renamed, then click OK to have the program launch. Thankfully, the process is also smart enough to update the preferences to use the renamed catalog if you have changed the Default Catalog setting (Preferences \u003e General) to open the specific catalog instead of Most recent. I don’t know why it took 14 versions to get this, but grateful it is here. Preview Cache Size Limit (LrC) On the subject of catalogs and preferences and such, on the General tab of the Catalog Settings dialog, there is a new option in the Preview Storage Management section that allows us to set an upper limit on the size of the preview cache. The goal of the preview cache is to speed up performance by storing ready made versions of imported photos so they load fast in Library while moving through folders and collections (as well as modules other than Develop), so having a large cache is a good thing for performance. However, if left unchecked (as it has been all this time) it can get very large over time. The idea is that you set a storage size limit that you are comfortable with from the perspective of available disk space on the drive where your catalog is stored, and once that limit is reached LrC will automatically purge the oldest preview files to make room for new ones. In my case, my preview cache is currently 14GB (as shown above). I try to keep 300GB or so of free space on that drive, so I do have room to grow. I decided to check the box and limit that cache to 20GB and we’ll see how that goes. Note that you will be notified when the cache reaches 90% of that amount, and again when older previews are about to be purged. Keep in mind that LrC will automatically generate missing previews when you view an older folder. The only problem I can foresee is if you have older photos stored offline, as LrC can’t create previews of offline photos until you bring them online again. One last LrC only thing to note is for Nikon photographers who shoot tethered on Silicon Macs is that you no longer need to run LrC in emulation mode, and support for the Zfc, Z9, and Z6 III has been added. Let’s look at a few things added to both LrC and Lightroom (Lr). Generative Remove out of Early Access (LrC and Lr) Originally added as an Early Access feature, the Generative Remove feature within the Remove suite of tools is a full-functioning feature. The first time you use it you’ll be asked to agree to Adobe’s User Guidelines for generative AI and then see a few tips to get started. The panel has been refined, and I’m sure we’ll do a deeper dive on the way it works here soon, but Scott wrote about it when it first added. Content Credentials (LrC and Lr) This is being introduced as an Early Access feature, so not fully developed yet. Content credentials is a new type of metadata that allows content creators to add more information about themselves and their work as part of the export/output process. This is a new endeavor through the Content Authenticity Initiative that will likely become more important as the amount of generative AI content grows. You can find the option to include content credentials on the Export dialog in LrC: Or as part of the Share dialog […] The post Adobe MAX Release Updates appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
