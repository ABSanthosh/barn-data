  "text": "The Canon EOS RV will be a new segment in Canon’s APS-C lineup of cameras. We have written about that topic in the past. We expect to see 3 new camera segments in the EOS R lineup. Both APS-C and Full Frame sensor cameras.We also have a new 1.4″ sensor size in the Canon PowerShot V1, and while the PowerShot name has historical value, we think you can consider the new PowerShot lineup as a fourth new segment from Canon.Over the last couple of months, we have reported that both a Canon EOS “RC” and Canon EOS “R50 V” are coming, we think the latter is what we have here in the Canon EOS RV.The Canon EOS RV: Specification PredictionsWe don’t have any sort of specifications at this point, but we can make some educated predictions from the leaked image of the camera. We think that there will be a lot of overlap in features with the Canon PowerShot V1.Canon PowerShot V1Which Image Sensor Will Canon Use?This is probably the biggest question about the Canon EOS RV. While conventional wisdom would suggest Canon will re-use their current 24.2mp sensor that we find in the Canon EOS R50 and Canon EOS R10, we hope that’s not the case. While it’s a very capable sensor, we do hope for a resolution bump over the Canon PowerShot V1’s 22mp 1.4″ sensor.What about using the 32mp sensor from the Canon EOS R7?There are some people out there that think the sensor in the PowerShot V1 is a smaller version of the Canon EOS R7 image sensor. If it is, it would make sense for Canon to have some synergy between the two cameras.As mentioned earlier, we think there will be a lot of overlap between the two. 32mp resolution would also give it a perceived advantage over the 26mp resolution of the hugely popular Sony ZV-E10 II and the 20.9mp equipped Nikon Z30.Canon EOS R7The Canon EOS R7 sensor also has a faster readout speed than the 24.2mp sensor in the lower end APS-C cameras from Canon.At this point, Canon would have already made the money on the sensor, and we don’t think it would cost more to manufacture. If the thinking is true that the 1.4″ sensor is just a smaller wafer than the 32mp sensor, economies of scale are probably in play here as well.Active CoolingWe think that it’s possible that we’ll see active cooling in the Canon EOS RV when we look at the leaked image. There appears to be a large grill on the top of the camera. It’s not the built-in microphone. The Canon PowerShot V1 has an air vent on the side as well as on the top of the camera.We have not seen every angle of the Canon EOS RV as of yet.What About The Video CapabilitiesThis is an area which we think the 32.5mp sensor of the Canon EOS R7 will be an advantage over the 24.2mp sensor in the Canon EOS R10.The Canon EOS R7 is capable of 4K60 10-bit video with HDR-PQ and C-Log 3 without a crop when shooting at 60P. We think it would be a mistake for this camera to have a crop for 4K60 video like the EOS R10 and PowerShot V1.The Sony ZV-E10 II does 4K60 without a crop, so we really hope that the “Canon Cripple Hammer” doesn’t return. Canon has done so well specification wise, and met or exceeded cameras from competitors in similar segments.Is the Canon EOS RV For Photographers?We think there is a lot here for photographers looking for a camera that is close to the size of the much-loved Canon EOS M6 Mark II. Sure there’s no EVF, but for the customers that have been yearning for an RF mount EOS M style body, they don’t care.We hope that the Canon EOS RV is also equipped with IBIS, as the Sony ZV-E10 II has sensor based SteadyShot. The Nikon Z30 uses electronic stabilization but also costs significantly less than the Sony.In the Canon PowerShot V1, the stabilization is in the lens instead of the sensor, which is perfectly fine for a fixed lens camera.Canon EVF-DC1 For EOS MWe also expect to see a hot shoe mount EVF and we hope Canon has improved on the EVF-DC1. Something like the Leica VIsoflex 2 would be amazing. Hopefully it wouldn’t be $800 though!Will There Be More and Better RF-S Lenses?Yes, there will be. As we see from the leaked image, there is an unreleased lens mounted to EOS RV. It looks very small in stature and is likely a wide-angle zoom that will cover the similar 35mm equivalent 16-50mm of the PowerShot V1. We can’t tell for sure though.We have been told in the past that there would be “Z” lenses for APS-C, and it looks like the new lens has built-in Power Zoom. We expect to see a trio of APS-C Power Zoom lenses over the next year.Both Sony and Nikon have PZ lenses with the function built into the lens, unlike the RF 24-105mm f/2.8L IS USM Z and Canon RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Z that require an external, and insanely overpriced Canon PZ-E2 Power Zoom adapters.When Will We Know More?We hope to learn more soon, we have our normal feelers out for information regarding the Canon EOS RV. We’d love to have basic specifications and predicted announcement date sometime this week. However, what we want doesn’t always come to fruition.ConclusionThe Canon EOS RV is going to be a big seller for Canon and it’s about time Canon entered this segment. We think we’re going to see a lot of compelling APS-C products as Canon has the brand power to absolutely own the APS-C market.Again, this is just what we hope to see in the Canon EOS RV, and aren’t confirmed specifications. We’re just excited to see where the APS-C lineup is going to go.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
