Kolari is moving away from using Canon compact cameras, not because they are poor for the job but because they are getting too expensive to purchase on the used market. I see this over in Asia; everything small from Canon is costly.Back to the report. This is a look at November’s data. I think the entire year will be interesting to see.In all, it’s a good report. Shipments of mirrorless and compact cameras are up, and DSLRs are down. From January through November, shipments of compacts rose by 9%, and mirrorless shipments grew by 16%. Overall, that makes the entire year up 9% for all cameras combined.China still holds the vast majority of the gains (sans compact cameras; it seems the Chinese don’t like those, or perhaps they get source compact cameras from their Chinese manufacturers?), but ILCs in China are up 30% when compared to 2023, leading the recovery of the industry. The Chinese market is by far the largest mirrorless interchangeable region globally, and it’s not even close. Just as important, Asia, considering Japan and China, is nearing 50% of the camera market.The Americas, which includes all of South, Central and North America (dominated in sales from the United States, of course), even showed growth in compacts (2%). This led to the thought that this madness was spreading even to Americans. Mirrorless shipments grew 6% from January through November as compared to 2023.It’s hard to find a bad point about the report unless you wanted DSLRs to return to glory from its underdog status, but its day is over.You can review all the data in the PDF at this location.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
