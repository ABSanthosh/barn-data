This is a newly developed sensor from Canon, and it certainly appears to be different as its a size that no one has done before. The rumour details this as slightly larger than an m43’s sensor, and it’s expected to be 1.4″ in size. For reference, a Micro 43 sensor has a size of around 1.35″.It’s been interesting how the sensor size information has slowly evolved. It does appear to be an m43 “ish” size, as we were originally told.Let’s get into the brain-aching part you have all been anticipating.First, we don’t know if this sensor will be in 4:3 or 3:2 format, so the sensor’s physical size could be slightly different. For those unaware, 1″ refers to the sensor’s diagonal, and 1″ usually is around 16mm in diagonal. A rabbit hole of historical reference to this dates back to the dawn of time. Therefore, a 1.4″ sensor should be around 22mm diagonal or 1.4 times that of a 1″ sensor. Yes, that hurts my head too.So, the two 1″ sensor sizes are either 17.6 x 13.2mm for a 4:3 ratio or 18.3 x 12.2mm for a 3:2 ratio sensor size.Here’s roughly how the sensors would look as compared to each other.We feel pretty confident that this is close. Our source, who is rarely wrong, said it was slightly larger than m4/3, and we have received further confirmation of 1.4″ – which is, yes, a little larger than an m4/3 sensor.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
