Canon is going to announce two new “V” series EOS R APS-C cameras along with the global announcement of the Canon PowerShot V1.Why the delay with the PowerShot V1?It’s likely Canon wanted to show the camera at CP+. We also think it makes sense to launch the PowerShot V1 as part of a “V” series of fixed and interchangeable lens cameras.The announcement is expected to happen on or around March 26, 2025 depending on where you are on the planet. Which is consistent with what we were reporting last month.Canon PowerShot V1We all know about the PowerShot V1, Canon’s reinvention of the PowerShot lineup. The PowerShot V1 will be the first of two new PowerShot V series cameras coming in 2025.As a side note, we’re not including a possible PowerShot V10 replacement in the two new V series cameras.That last we heard, the PowerShot V1 will launch at $899 USD. We do not have euro or pound pricing currently.Canon EOS R50Canon EOS R50 VThat Canon EOS R50 V will be the entry level APS-C ILC in what looks like a “V” line of EOS R cameras.Could we see a full-frame cousin in the future?We don’t have detailed specifications for the EOS R50 V, but we think that it will be equipped with the current 24.2mp sensor found in the EOS R50 and EOS R10.We also suspect it will share a lot of the same capabilities as the PowerShot V1, minus active cooling and a larger APS-C sensor instead of Canon’s new 1.4″ sensor found in the PowerShot V1.We also expect the EOS R50 V to be small. We wouldn’t be shocked if it was close to the size of the EOS M6 Mark II.We expect the EOS R50 V to come in at about $650. However, we don’t have a confirmed price currently.Canon PowerShot V1 Active CoolingCanon EOS RVThe Canon EOS RV is going to be the most capable of the trio. We don’t have detailed specifications yet, but we think we’re going to see a better sensor used than the 24.2mp sensor that will likely be featured in the EOS R50 V.We’re also confident that we’re going to see active cooling in the EOS RV.We wouldn’t be surprised to see the EOS RV come in at around $1000 USD. If it goes above that pricepoint, we certainly hope its capabilities will justify it.New RF-S Power Zoom LensesWe expect to see at least one Power Zoom RF-S wide angle zoom lens to be announced. It would be great if they announced a trio of Power Zoom lenses with the launch of these cameras.It would be great to have a “complete” system right from the get-go.SummaryIf there’s one area Canon has done a poor job, it’s appealing to younger generations. They simply haven’t had appealing products for that demographic. Canon is a smart company, but it seems to have taken a while to address this issue.It may bug some people, but Canon still has the best brand power in the industry, and it’s about time they flexed their muscles to the next generation of photographers and videographers.So there you have it, 3 cameras will be announced globally along with at least one RF-S lens.We will be able to report more detailed information in the very near future. We’re excited about the new segment(s) of the EOS R APS-C lineup and seeing some synergy with the new PowerShot V1.More to come.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
