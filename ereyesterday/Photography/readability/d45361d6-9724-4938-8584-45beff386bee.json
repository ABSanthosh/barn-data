  "description": "Check out this Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal we’re running: I did a full-day Lightroom seminar in front of a live audience, and our video team captured the entire day. You can get this full seminar to stream on demand any time – the whole thing – five sessions included with your membership deal for Black Friday. The five sessions are: Each session from the seminar is about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes long (we started at 10:00 am and went to around 5:30 pm), and I packed an incredible amount of info on this day. I have toured the country with my Lightroom Live seminar, and tickets cost $99 (either live or to stream it), but now you can get this free with our KelbyOne Membership Black Friday Deal. Here’s the link with details (or to sign up and get this deal), and you’ll see the full Black Friday deal we’ve put together is pretty mind-blowing (and includes our “Ultimate Lightroom Bundle” and so much more. It’s the best, most comprehensive deal we’ve ever offered. Thanks for letting me tell you about this (we’re pretty excited about it), and I hope you had a fantastic Thanksgiving, and here’s wishing you a great holiday weekend. 🙂 -Scott P.S. If you want to buy the full-day seminar by itself, you can do that at this link (It’s $99 for the full day of training).
