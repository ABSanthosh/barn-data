The major camera manufacturers all announced in advance, but the third-party manufacturers have all jumped in and launched a dizzying array of new products.Viltrox, TTArtisan, Laowa, 7Artisans and Samyang have all announced new products or are showing them off at CP+. The details are sketchy, but we hope to hear more about them soon. We will update this article as we receive more information, so stay tuned!Laowa has already announced its brand new macro tilt shift lenses, and as well, 5 new lenses are in the works and will be announced at the show. These lenses will be available for the RF mount, so we look forward to hearing more about them in the near future.Viltrox has also announced new AF lenses for their supported mount (which sadly does not include the Canon RF mount for now). These lenses include the AF 35mm F1.2 LAB FE, AF 85mm F1.4 Pro FE, and AF 50mm F2.0 Air lenses.Viltrox did make AF lenses for the EOS-M mount, so hopefully, they will decide to make RF mount lenses in the future.TTArtisan has also announced its first camera. And wow, I want it. I’ll share more on that as I work on that article and get more details.The details are limited on this camera, but it’s a foldable design with bellows and a fully mechanical design, including a spring-loaded shutter that does not require batteries to operate. Yes, that’s right, this is fully manual, and no batteries are required. The lens is a legacy-era cooker element design.7Artisans has also announced 4 new lenses, 3 for APS-C and one for full frame. I’m not sure right now if Canon RF is a supported mount variant for these lenses. These lenses include the APS-C AF 25mm F1.8, AF 35mm F1.8, AF 50mm F1.8 and the full frame 35mm F2.8.Samyang is also showing off a brand new 14-24 F2.8 full-frame lens for the Sony E mount. It bears the names Schneider Kreuznach and Samyang. According to the literature at CP+, this is the first 14-24mm F2.8 that allows the use of front filters.That’s an interesting design, and it will be great to see how they managed that. The Nikkor 14-24mm F2.8 did allow for front filters, but the filters were attached to the lens hood, not the lens itself.CP+ is now the largest trade show for camera manufacturers. It is held annually at the Yokohama Convention Center in Yokohama, Japan. This show usually lasts four days and is held in the last few days of February and the first few days of March.All the major camera manufacturers attend this show, and unlike Photokina, the trade show is still going strong. Usually, we know most of the announcements before the show, but it seems that the third-party manufacturers have decided to keep the announcements until the start of the show.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
