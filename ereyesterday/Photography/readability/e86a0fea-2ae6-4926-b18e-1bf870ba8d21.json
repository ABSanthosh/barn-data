  "text": "It’s been a fun year, and as I sit here in Asia waiting for the clock to strike 12 in less than 6 hours, I thought I’d write up a summary about 2024 here at CanonRumors.First, Craig and I both tried to do other stuff other than simply report on rumors and releases. I amused myself and annoyed some by writing some opinions, and this one I must have linked a bazillion times in forum posts. This opinion was critical because it delved into some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that happened here at CanonRumors this year. I delved back in time looking at Canon’s ergonomics, and it was one of my favourite articles that I wrote here on CanonRumors.Oh, and Canon, I’m still waiting for my Canon R5s.Craig did a great article on Canon USA, which we had hoped would have led to some improvements, but we haven’t heard anything. Naturally, Canon USA ignores our emails ;)It was a slow start of the year for Canon, with no cameras released in the first six months and people getting antsy. We knew things were coming, and it didn’t take a genius to know that the R1 would be released on an Olympic year. The EOS R1 was officially announced in May of 2024 as a development announcement, and then we were back waiting again. The release date rumours kept changing on Craig, which caused him all sorts of headaches trying to piece it together for us, and finally, on July 17th, Canon announced the EOS R1, and then this happened.The internet wasn’t satisfied with 24MP, but let’s not go down that path.Yes, I’m Canon’s Flagship!At the same time as the Canon EOS R1, Canon also announced the Canon EOS R5 Mark II, with some amazing features and, for the first time in a mirrorless camera, an expandable cooling solution via an addon grip. Canon certainly hit this one out of the park, which is why it has assumed it’s rightful place on most prosumer and professional sales charts since it was available. For a time, Canon Japan had a 6-month waiting list, and from our understanding, retailers from around the globe are still working through their reorder lists. Yes, it’s that good.The R5 Mark II – Canon’s best 5 series camera. Ever.We had a lot of rumors, but I think Canon may have pulled back on releasing any other new cameras else and wanted to wait until 2025. It would probably be a good idea if this were the case, as this would allow them to focus their efforts on their two top professional cameras. Canon did, however, release a video camera for the RF mount, the Canon C80. Basically, they stuffed the guts of a C400 in a smaller mirrorless camera and sold it for cheaper. Everyone wins.The Canon C80 with the badass Canon CN-R 85mm T1.3For lenses, Canon was hardly any better than cameras (like seriously, writing here was hard the first 5 months of the year – it’s a lot more fun with new products). Finally, a lens that has been eagerly anticipated since the letters R and F appeared was announced on June 5, the Canon RF 35mm f1.4L VCM. It used a different auto-focus motor (thus the “VCM”), which is a voice coil motor. It’s not a very original acronym from Canon, so do better, Canon.Finally! An RF 35mm F1.4!It was a great-looking lens with good optics, and everyone who used it has been relatively happy. I mean, there isn’t going to be a perfect lens mass-produced for $1500 dollars. I think I did a TED talk on that not too long ago here.Right after that announcement, Canon gave out a surprise announcement (the date of June 10th was the surprise – they had been showing off the lenses since CP+), which was a couple of dual lenses for VR. The Canon RF-S 3.9mm F3.5 STM Dual Fisheye was to bring dual fisheye video to the R7, while the other lens was best left forgotten, the Canon RF-S 7.8mm F4 STM Dual. It was so popular that Canon officially snuck it out the door at the end of October, and I’m not aware of anyone actually buying it. I’m not sure the Canon RF-S 3.9mm F3.5 STM Dual Fisheye sold well, either. We live in a time when almost everything Canon releases ends up on some backorder list. Neither of these did. Maybe Canon is playing 4-D chess here (pun intended).A lens that everyone was asking for – the RF-S 3.9mm F3.5 STM Dual FisheyeIt was very unlike Canon up to this point, only having released three lenses, so we knew that we were going to get some lenses nearer to the end of the year, and the rumours were telling us that, too. The first one that came out in the last 4 months of the year was on September 12, the Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STM. I’m sure you are tired of telling me how much I like this lens, so I won’t (only this time, though).However, the rest of the world wasn’t happy with its price tag, so my advice is if you want this lens and can wait, I would expect to see sales happening next Thanksgiving for it, which may make it more budget-palatable. I predict this lens will become one of those favorite bang-for-the-buck OEM lenses.Then, on October 30th, Canon did some serious shock and awe and released the Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM Z, Canon RF 24mm F1.4L VCM and .. to the joy of 50mm users everywhere that have been waiting for Canon to make a modern 50mm 1.4, yes, the Canon RF 50mm F1.4L VCM. After being rumored for, well, ages, it started to feel like poor Charlie Brown and Lucy.Not this time, Lucy!But finally, Canon didn’t pull a Lucy on us and gave us a lens we have all been looking forward to.Rest in Peace, Canon EF 50mm F1.4 USM. 1993-2024.The Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Z was Canon’s second Z lens and was a rather surprising 70-200mm because Canon created two versions, one light and one dark. Now, users can go to the full “dark side” with a Canon professional 70-200. I guess this would be useful for those Nikon users wanting to use a real camera and don’t want their friends to know ;)The Epic Battle between light and dark awaits you.Not to be outdone, at the same time, another eagerly desired lens for the RF mount came out on October 30th – the Canon RF 24mm F1.4L VCM. This completed the trinity of primes for Canon in lovely red rings and VCM: 24, 35 and 50mm, all of them 1.4. It was a great way for Canon to end the year on the lens front.Intermixed with Canon stuff, there were a few notable releases that I liked this year, and I hope Canon listens to me (for once) and does some products similar to them on the RF mount. The first product is one I have talked (whined) about a lot here, but that’s my job – part complainer and part R100 hater.I honestly did a double take on the release date, I can’t believe it was all the way back in May. However, on May 22, Panasonic launched the compact full-frame Lumix DC-S9. Basically, everything I want in a small travel camera is right there. The Canon EOS R8 is no slouch either, but the S9 wins for me regarding portability. Maybe I should explain, usually i have 2 or 3 of the same body – but one or two with different sensor filters (for instance, 720nm and full spectrum) and of course, color. Compact soap bar-styled cameras can simply fit in a smaller area when you carry more than one. And the Panasonic comes in multiple colours – which, for me, is amazingly handy. I’m not guessing which camera is the full spectrum camera. My favorite setup that I one day I hope I can replicate with the Canon RF mount was the original EOS-M’s.Make it so, Canon!Now, I know some of you expect me to mention one of the Sony camera releases, but you’re on the wrong website if you expect me to write anything nice about Sony. Well, that’s not fair. I like PlayStation consoles.For the last product I’m going to babble about here, I turn to Fuji and the midrange X-T50 that Fuji announced all the way back on May 16. Sporting a 40MP APS-C sensor, and great looks, this makes me jealous. Canon needs to up its APS-C game, and it’s totally time to do a classic camera look.It was an interesting year here at CanonRumors, but it would be nice if Canon would spread things out a bit. It was a bit frantic the last 4-5 months of the year, and we probably didn’t cover stories as well as we could have.We have many exciting things planned for 2025, some of which we may even accomplish in 2025. We wish all our readers a happy new year and the best for 2025.

Maybe Canon is playing 4-D chess here (pun intended).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNTAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDUwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-src=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1718037615_1834625.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1718037615_1834625.jpg 500w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1718037615_1834625-168x168.jpg 168w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1718037615_1834625-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1718037615_1834625-450x450.jpg 450w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA lens that everyone was asking for – the RF-S 3.9mm F3.5 STM Dual Fisheye\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was very unlike Canon up to this point, only having released three lenses, so we knew that we were going to get some lenses nearer to the end of the year, and the rumours were telling us that, too.

This completed the trinity of primes for Canon in lovely red rings and VCM: 24, 35 and 50mm, all of them 1.4. It was a great way for Canon to end the year on the lens front.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntermixed with Canon stuff, there were a few notable releases that I liked this year, and I hope Canon listens to me (for once) and does some products similar to them on the RF mount. The first product is one I have talked (whined) about a lot here, but that’s my job – part complainer and part R100 hater.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI honestly did a double take on the release date, I can’t believe it was all the way back in May. However, on May 22, Panasonic launched the compact full-frame Lumix DC-S9. Basically, everything I want in a small travel camera is right there. The Canon EOS R8 is no slouch either, but the S9 wins for me regarding portability. Maybe I should explain, usually i have 2 or 3 of the same body – but one or two with different sensor filters (for instance, 720nm and full spectrum) and of course, color. Compact soap bar-styled cameras can simply fit in a smaller area when you carry more than one. And the Panasonic comes in multiple colours – which, for me, is amazingly handy. I’m not guessing which camera is the full spectrum camera. My favorite setup that I one day I hope I can replicate with the Canon RF mount was the original EOS-M’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNTAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDUwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-src=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1716375999_IMG_2248205.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1716375999_IMG_2248205.jpg 500w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1716375999_IMG_2248205-168x168.jpg 168w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1716375999_IMG_2248205-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1716375999_IMG_2248205-450x450.jpg 450w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMake it so, Canon!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I know some of you expect me to mention one of the Sony camera releases, but you’re on the wrong website if you expect me to write anything nice about Sony.
