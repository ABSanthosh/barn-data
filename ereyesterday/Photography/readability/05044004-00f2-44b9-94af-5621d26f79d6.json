Photo by Jackie Hope But there are rarely any real measures launched to combat it and this might be in part due to how lucrative it is. That’s all about to change, at least in the state of Texas in the USA. A recent proposed law will ban social media accounts for users under 18 in a measure that is somewhat akin to the prohibition against purchasing tobacco that many states have in place. Is social media as dangerous to the health of young Texans as tobacco? It would seem so, and there’s more than just anecdotal evidence to underpin this. But back to this being a big industry: It remains to be seen whether or not this survives the Texas Senate. The state would not be unique in a ban of some form but would pioneer new avenues in terms of age. Currently, Florida bans social media accounts for users under 14, PetaPixel reports. As we have documented on this blog multiple times, social media does not promote the best behavior or choices. Even so, it is a massive industry that has made many people, some younger creators included, very rich. Perhaps a ban is too extreme but a viable middle ground isn’t really forthcoming. Part of this might be a lack of imagination on all our parts, but a large part of it is probably just due to the inertia of how things are. We can’t imagine a world without it, but we also need a world where it is a little more under control than it is now. How to thread that line is a question for the future. Any thoughts you might have on the influence of social media on society are welcome in the comments. Check out some other photography news at this link.
