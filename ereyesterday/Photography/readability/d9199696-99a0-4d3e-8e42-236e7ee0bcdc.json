We are seeing new films launched yearly from companies like Lomography, Cinestill and others. Even Pentax launched a new film camera last year.Point and Shoot film cameras are generally the least expensive way to start playing around with film photography. The price of film and development can be expensive, so saving money on the camera to learn the art instead is a good idea for a lot of people.I found using a point \u0026 shoot film camera helped me find the films that I liked using before moving to a medium format Mamiya 6 MF. 120 film and development is epxensive, especially considering you get 12 shots a roll.With a 35mm camera, you can get anywhere from 24 to 36 or even up to 72 shots roll if you’re use a half frame camera like the recently launched Pentax 17.There are Point \u0026 Shoot cameras can be extremely expensive. These are cameras that have amazing build quality, terrific lenses and are somewhat repairable.You can spend well over $1000 and sometimes multiple thousands for cameras like the Contax T3, Leica Minilux Zoom, Minolta TC-1 and Nikon 35Ti. The later being my favourite point \u0026 shoot film camera ever. If you fall in love with film and want to treat yourself one day, the Nikon 35Ti deserves consideration.When purchasing a Canon Sure Shot camera, you’ll find that each model has different names for North American, European and Japanese markets. You may want to search for cameras based on the regional model names depending where you’re located.Canon Sure Shot HistoryCanon made a lot of point and shoot film cameras. They launched the Sure Shot line of cameras in 1979 and they were extremely successful.Before everyone says “what about the Canonet QL series?” We wanted to focus on autofocus point and shoot cameras that are affordable and provide great value.There really isn’t a Canon Sure Shot that is as legendary as the above mentioned cameras, but they did make some very good point \u0026 shoot film cameras.Canon Sure Shot Reliability and RepairAnything can be repaired, but in the case of this list, it’s more affordable to just buy another working camera. There will be repair shops that have spare parts from other cameras, but you’re paying labour and those sorts of things.A Sure Shot camera will die eventually and it’s usually the focus rewind motor or zoom motor if equipped. I wouldn’t worry too much, you may get years of trouble free use of one of these cameras.So unless you have a sentemental attachment to that specific camera, it’s probaly not worth the effort to find someone that can repair the camera.The Best Place to Buy a Canon Sure Shot?There are two places that everyone knows that you will find a lot of Canon point \u0026 shoot cameras, and that’s Amazon and ebay.ebay is probably the best place to buy cameras that have been fully inspected by extpert technications and refurbished as close to new as possible. You will pay more most of the time from these sellers, but it mayu be worth it.I have personally purchased my film cameras from a couple of different Japanese ebay stores. I have always received exactly what was described and I have had no issues with cameras dying as of yet.1. CANON SURE SHOT TELEJapan: Autoboy Tele/Tele QD | Europe: TOP TWIN/TWIN QDRelease: October 1986 | Current Market Price: $150-$250SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully Automatic Autofocus | Lens: 40mm f/2.8 \u0026 70mm f/4.9 | Viewfinder: 0.45x at 40mm \u0026 0.72x at 70mm | Built-in Flash: Guide No 10.5 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 134 x 79 x 62mm, 400gOVERVIEWThe Canon Autoboy Tele, also known in some regions as the Canon Sure Shot Tele, is a 35mm point-and-shoot film camera that was quite popular for its ease of use and dual focal length lens.At the wide end, there is a 40mm f/2.8, and a 70mm f/4.9 at the telephoto end. This is a great walkaround focal range. There’s the bonus of no zoom motors to break, which makes the camera a bit more reliable.As a value proposition? The Canon Sure Shot Tele holds up quite well to the more expensive Contax, Yashica and Minolta point and shoot film cameras of the day.Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot Tele Series at AmazonCanon Sure Shot Tele Series at ebay2. CANON SURE SHOT ACEJapan: Autoboy Prisma | Europe: PRIMA SHOTRelease: October 1988 | Current Market Price: $80-$200SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully Automatic Autofocus | Lens: 35mm f/3.5 | Viewfinder: 0.45x magnification and 85% coverage | Built-in Flash: Guide No 9 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 139 x 76 x 50mm, 335gOVERVIEWThe Canon Sure Shot Ace is one of, if not our favourite Canon point \u0026 shoot film camera. We have a soft spot for prime lenses. The Canon Sure Shot Ace has 35mm f/3.5 lens which is quite good.The light meter is another big plus with the Canon Sure Shot Ace, it is bang on and outperforms far more expensive point \u0026 shoot film cameras.The Canon Sure Shot Ace was the first camera in the world to have the ability to use a wireless remote. This may have been the first selfie camera ever made. The remote used an IR beam, so yes, you could take a picture of yourself, or actually be in the family photo.If there is one negative about this camera, it’s how noisy it is. That could be distracting in certain environments. Like that moment at a wedding you didn’t think was going to be dead quiet. You’ll get some looks.The Canon Sure Shot Ace is quite affordable and you can find working cameras for as little as $100 USD. You could expect to pay up to $200 for mint condition copies from the higher-end online dealers that have in-house technicians to refurbish and fully test the cameras.Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot Ace Prices at AmazonCanon Sure Shot Ace Prices at ebay3. CANON SURE SHOT A-1Japan: Autoboy D5 | Europe: PRIMA AS-1Release: April 1994 | Current Market Price: $60-$200SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully automatic 35mm lens-shutter AF Waterproof to 5M | Lens: 32mm f/3.5 | Viewfinder: 0.42x and 84% coverage | Built-in Flash: Guide No. 7.5 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 133 x 88 x 56mm, 385gOVERVIEWWhen the Canon Sure Shot A-1 launched, it was the smallest and lightest land-based underwater camera on the market. The Sure Shot A-1 can be taken up to 5M under the water, which is pretty good for shooting fish and reefs when snorkelling.The Canon Sure Shot A-1 is one of my favourite cameras aesthetically. It also feels like it’s well built and can take a hit or two if you’re a bit clumsy like I am.The lens is pretty good, but not the top end of the Sure Shot lineup.When buying one of these cameras, I’d purchase from one of the known retailers on ebay or Amazon who refurbish cameras before selling them. The seals should be well checked, especially if you plan to actually use it underwater.You can’t go wrong with a Canon Sure Shot A-1!Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot A-1 at AmazonCanon Sure Shot A-1 at ebay4. CANON SURE SHOT SLEEKJapan: Autoboy F XL | Europe: PRIMA MINI IIRelease: March 1996 | Current Market Price: $50-$100SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully automatic 35mm lens-shutter AF | Lens: 32mm f/3.5 | Viewfinder: 0.32x and 84% coverage | Built-in Flash: Guide No. 7.5 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 120 x 62 x 41mm, 185gOVERVIEWThe Canon Sure Shot Sleek was certainly sleek when it came to market. The Sure Shot Sleek is small and lightweight. The way the lens is built into the body keeps it somewhat protected when sticking it in a bag or jacket pocket.The lens on the Canon Sure Shot Sleek isn’t going to win any awards, but sometimes that can make a negative all that more special with the right film. I love using this camera with black \u0026 white film at higher ISO.The wide 32mm lens is definitely a plus if you want to do some street shooting as well as some landscapes. At the current market price, this camera is worth your consideration.Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot Sleek at AmazonCanon Sure Shot Sleek at ebay5. CANON SURE SHOT 80UJapan: Autoboy N80 | Europe: Prima Zoom 80uRelease: April 2003 | Current Market Price: $25-$75SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully automatic 35mm lens-shutter AF | Lens: 38-80mm f/4.7-9.4 | Viewfinder: Wide: 0.37x; Tele: 0.88x | Built-in Flash: Wide: 10.6; Tele: 12.5 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 107.2 x 58.7 x 42.8mm, 185gOVERVIEWThe Canon Sure Shot 80u was launched in 2003, as Canon was nearing the end of producing 35mm compact cameras. The Sure Shot 90u II Date was the last of them in 2005.The Sure Shot 80u is definitely for someone that wants to learn about film photography, is looking for something easy to use with a zoom lens and would rather spend money on film and developing than the camera itself.You can find a Canon Sure Shot 80u in great condition for $50, and we’ve seen them cost even less.The 38-80mm f/4.7-9.4 isn’t going to win any awards, but it will definite do the job and produce very good results.Any Sure Shot of this era is affordable, and you can’t go wrong with any of them.Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot 80u at AmazonCanon Sure Shot 80u at ebay6. CANON SURE SHOT TELE MAXJapan: Autoboy Mini T | Europe: PRIMA TWIN SRelease: September 1991 | Market Price: $50-$150SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully automatic 35mm lens-shutter AF | Lens: 38mm f/3.5 \u0026 70mm f/6 | Viewfinder: 0.37x – 0.64x 85% Coverage | Built-in Flash: Guide No. 10.7 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 125 x 68 x 53mm, 255gOVERVIEWThe Canon Sure Shot Telemax is another point \u0026 shoot camera with two prime lenses instead of a zoom. At the wide end you have a 38mm f/3.5 and a 70mm f/6 for the telephoto.By the standards of today’s cameras, 38mm isn’t all that wide, but you have to consider the era. This is a camera that I would probably be shooting at 38mm most of the time, unless I wnated to get into some higher speed film for the telephoto end. The lens is very good at both focal lengths.The Sure Shot Tele Max is relatively small and should easily fit in most jacket pockets.Purchase OptionsCanon Sure Shot Tele Max at AmazonCanon Sure Shot Tele Max at ebay7. CANON PHOTURA 135 /CAPTIONJapan: JET135 | Europe: EPOCA 135 / CAPTIONRelease: March 1992 | Market Price: $30-150SPECIFICATIONSType: Fully automatic 35mm lens-shutter AF | Lens: 38-135mm f/3.2-8 | Viewfinder:  0.35x – 1.14x | Built-in Flash: Guide No. 14 – 30 at ISO 100 | Film Rewind: Automatic | Dimensions \u0026 Weight: 100 x 74 x 170mm, 700gOVERVIEWI’m going to be honest, the Canon Photura is on this list because it just may be the weirdest Canon Point \u0026 Shoot 35mm camera ever made.The Photura is a bit of clunky camera to use with its camcorder shape. However, for how inexpensive these cameras are, getting one just to have the shooting experience would be a lot of fun.The Photura is equipped with a 30-135mm f/3.2-8 lens. That’s a good zoom range and is decently wide, but optically it is lacking somewhat. The shutter release lag was one of its selling points, being only 0.018 seconds. That was extremely quick for an autofocus point and shoot camera.Purchase OptionsCanon Photura 135 at AmazonCanon Photura 135 at ebaySUMMARYWe chose this group of Canon Sure Shot cameras because they’re great value in the current film point \u0026 shoot camera market. They are also readily available on the used market.Canon has many other Sure Shot cameras that will also give you great results as a value proposition. These are just the cameras that I have used, and yes, the Photura 135 is more an exercise in using oddball design and ergonomics.Enjoy your film experience if you do take the plunge. There’s still something about waiting to see what you actually captured.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
