  "description": "Adobe’s own in-house image magician, Russell Preston Brown, has an awesome old-school color correction tip using Lr Mobile for anyone who shoots Raw on their iPhone (he shares his exact color correction moves – the ones he applies every time). Check it out below: Pretty sweet, right? Russell is legend! I’m Speaking At The BILD Conference in New York City This June Heads up: The BILD Expo Photography and Video Conference is up in New York City at the Javits Center next month (produced by the folks at B\u0026H Photo), and once again, it’s shaping up to be a HUGE event (the last one was amazing!). Over 90,000 sq. feet of exhibits from all the big-name camera companies and leading vendors, plus a huge education track live and in person (I’m teaching one of the conference sessions – whoo hoo!!). Details and tickets at this link. Here’s wishing you a kick-butt week! -Scott The post Color Correction: Going “Old School” in Lightroom Mobile appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
