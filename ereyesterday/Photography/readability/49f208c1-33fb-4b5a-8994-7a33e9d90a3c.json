  "description": "Don’t know if you’ve heard the news, but Adobe has made some price changes to their Photography Plan pricing, and I’m here today to help you navigate the new changes (and still keep paying the old price. What? Yup – I’ll show you how).  I put together a quick Q\u0026A to explain the new pricing: Q. Did Adobe increase the price for the photography bundle (the one with Lightroom and Photoshop, which has always been around $9.99 a month)? A. Yes, but the price increase only applies to two groups:  (1) People who pay monthly (but I’ll explain a way around the price increase) (2) New users who are not already on the photography plan (but there’s a way around that, too, as I’ll explain in a moment). Q. But I don’t want to pay more.A. Then switch to an annual plan, paid upfront, and you won’t have to. Q. So, are you saying if I pay for my existing yearly plan upfront (rather than monthly), my price doesn’t go up? A. That’s what I’m saying.  Q. Are you sure?A. That’s straight from Adobe. Here’s a link to their blog post explaining the new pricing and the affected plans.  Q. Did all photography plans increase in price? A. The price of the Photography plan that includes Lr \u0026 Ps with 1TB of cloud storage didn’t change. Q. So, let me get this straight – I pay upfront for the year at the old price ($119.88 here in the US), and I don’t have to pay the higher price?A. That is correct.  Q. What if I’m not subscribed to the Photography Plan? What will my price be next year?A. If you sign up before January 15, 2025, you can lock in the old rate (which works out to $9.99 per month), but again – you have to pay the $119.88 upfront to get that rate.  Q. What if I miss the January 15th deadline? Will I have to pay $14.99 a month? A. Don’t miss that deadline, or it gets worse. For photographers who sign up after January 15th, it’s $19.99 a month, but at least it includes one terabyte of cloud storage space, so there’s that.  Q. So, what would you recommend?A. If I were you, I would pay $119.99 upfront to keep your photography plan the same as it always was—you do that, and really, nothing changes for you. If you’re one of those folks who never subscribed, I would definitely sign up before January 15th. Otherwise, you’ll be paying $19.99 a month if you decide to subscribe later. Q. What about the plan that’s just Lightroom ‘Cloud’ (as I call it) with one terabyte of storage? Does that monthly subscription increase? A. Yes – it goes from $9.99 a month to $11.99 a month unless you switch it to the yearly plan and pay the year upfront; then your price stays the same – no increase.  Well, there ya have it – that’s the price increase (and how to avoid it) in a nutshell. If you have any questions, pop ‘em in the comments.  Have a great holiday season Monday, everybody! -Scott P.S. Here’s a link to a pricing FAQ Adobe put together that’s very helpful.
