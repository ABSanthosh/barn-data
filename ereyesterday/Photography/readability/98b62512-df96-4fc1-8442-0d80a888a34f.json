  "description": "First, a big thanks to everybody who came by to see me at the BILD Conference, either on the main Photography stage or at Adobeâ€™s booth theater (shown above â€“Â photo by Terry White). What an incredible event the folks at B\u0026H Photo pulled off â€“ it was jam-packed the whole time, it was a huge show floor, lots of great sessions, and it was so great to see a big show in New York, like back in the pre-COVID days. Seriously, fantastic event from start to finish. My hats off to B\u0026H Photo for pulling off an event of this scale, and my thanks to them and Adobe for the honor of having me speak at the show. Canâ€™t wait until the next one! My Favorite Underrated Feature One feature that kind of slipped by a lot of folks, because of all the big features (like people and reflection removal, and the super handy landscape masking features), is a big change to the AI noise reduction feature, called â€˜Denoise.â€™ When you used this in the past, first you had to know where to find it (it was a bit buried), and then when you did use it it created a separate DNG file, so you had the original image, and then a duplicate that had Denoise applied, and it was just kind of a clunky workflow. Now, after the June update, Denoise is not only right there in the Detail panel (along with Super Resolution), but applying it no longer creates a separate DNG â€“ itâ€™s applied to your raw photo, but of course, itâ€™s still 100% non-destructive and easily undoable. Itâ€™s a little thing, but it makes a big difference. Hope you all have a great Monday. ðŸ™‚ -Scott The post The Most Underrated Lightroom Classic Update From the June Adobe Update appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
