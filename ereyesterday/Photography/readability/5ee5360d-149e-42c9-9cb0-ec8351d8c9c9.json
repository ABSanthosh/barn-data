However, they’re using it create the necessary files so the software can make a 3D image from them.As a Canon engineer explainedThat means two photodiodes in one pixel. Currently, we are using that for the autofocus. However, we can use that pixel to [produce] 3D.“So we can take a photo as RAW data – we call it DPRAW, the extension is .CR3 – and then we made special application software for 3D.” From Digital Camera WorldThe app processes this data, turning a single photo into a 3D image. During the demonstration shown to DCW, a standard EOS R5 with a regular lens captured an image of a doll.When viewed on a screen, the image could be rotated, revealing its three-dimensional nature. This capability rivals the 180-degree 3D modeling of Canon’s costly Dual Fisheye lens, but at a fraction of the cost.You currently need a lens such as the Canon RF 5.2mm f/2.8 L Dual Fisheye 3D VR For This ApplicationCanon showcased the creation of 360-degree 3D images. By placing an object on a rotating turntable and capturing multiple images, the app combines these photos into a fully rotatable 3D model. This was demonstrated on a large touchscreen, where users could interact with the 3D images by panning, zooming, and rotating them.Currently, to achieve any sort of 3D output from an EOS R camera, you need a lens such as the Canon RF 5.2mm f/2.8 L Dual Fisheye 3D VR. and that generally runs between $1500-$2000. Making it a significant investment even just to play around.Canon also has APS-C dual lens lenses such as the Canon RF-S 3.9mm f/3.5 STM Dual Fisheye, Canon RF-S 7.8mm f/4 STM Dual Lens for VR and Spatial video.When Will The Application Be Released?The demonstration confirms proof of concept and appears to work well. However, we may be a long way off from seeing this application released to the public. Canon made no mention of when we might expect it.Digital Camera World has posted some visual examples of Canon’s 3D demonstration with the Canon EOS R5 and standard lens.Source: Digital Camera WorldWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
