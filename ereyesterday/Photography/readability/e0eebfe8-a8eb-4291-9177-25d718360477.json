Unlike the traditional method of waiting by breathing holes in the ice, aquatic stalking involves the bear swimming stealthily through open water or diving under ice to approach seals resting on the ice’s edge.

This method requires patience, strength, and precise timing, as seals are highly alert and quick to escape into the water. Aquatic stalking is a hunting technique used by polar bears to catch seals. Aquatic stalking is a hunting technique used by polar bears to catch seals. Unlike the more passive method of waiting by breathing holes in the ice, aquatic stalking involves the bear swimming stealthily through open water or diving under the ice to approach seals resting at the ice’s edge. Aquatic stalking is particularly seen during the warming months of spring (April and May) \u2028in regions where sea ice fasten to the land is still present, such as the protected inner fjords \u2028of the Spitsbergen area. This behavior demonstrates the polar bear’s adaptability and skill as \u2028a top predator in the Arctic ecosystem. Polar bears use aquatic stalking to hunt seals, especially in spring when seal pups are born. \u2028The bears know this is a key time—female bearded seals often leave their newborn pups \u2028resting alone on the ice while they circle nearby in the water, checking for predators. \u2028Polar bears are widely aware of this behavior. Once it chooses a target, the bear quietly enters the water to get closer from one ice flow to \u2028the next. Here, this incredibly clever bear is very gently getting out of the water before \u2028entering again, swimming slowly and silently beneath the surface to reach its next ice \u2028platform. From a distance, the polar bear may spot the seal pup resting on the ice from above the \u2028surface. But before making a move, it dips its head into the water to look beneath. By \u2028watching the mother seal swim below and tracing the shapes of the ice from underneath, the \u2028bear creates a mental map of the area. This behavior helps the bear pinpoint its position \u2028once it’s underwater, so it can swim silently and approach the exact spot beneath the ice \u2028where the pup is lying above — ready to strike with precision. Polar bears are not only powerful swimmers but also highly strategic hunters. One of their \u2028remarkable abilities is to stay submerged underwater for up to two minutes, allowing them \u2028to silently approach prey without being detected.\u2028The bears can dive and resurface at a calculated distance, minimizing noise and visibility. In addition to their breath-holding capability, polar bears are known to travel large and \u2028deliberate distances in the water to reach specific points of attack. These locations are not \u2028chosen randomly — they often target areas where seal activity is high, such as cracks in the \u2028ice, haul-out zones, or breathing holes. By combining swimming endurance, patience, and \u2028precise timing, polar bears can surprise their prey with deadly efficiency. The strike; this exact moment of the polar bear’s explosive appearance—the brutal climax \u2028of a long underwater stalk. After being briefly diverted by the mother seal’s appearing here \u2028on the right side, and her desperate attempt to protect her pup, the bear launches from the \u2028icy water with force and precision. \u2028 The pup, resting on the ice floe, becomes the target in this split-second of violent motion. \u2028It’s a tough, emotional moment that reflects the harsh survival dynamics of the polar world, \u2028where every life hangs in a fragile balance. The apex predator rises slowly from the cold water onto the ice, its broad back to us.\u2028In its mouth, a bearded seal pup hangs turned toward its fate. There is no struggle, no fight\u2028 — only a soft stillness as if the pup has already let go, as if the world, so new and full of \u2028light just moments ago, had suddenly turned too heavy to bear. A kind of gentle surrender that speaks louder than struggle ever could. \u2028The face of a soul that trusted the world — and was met with silence. The power of the scene lies in its brutal stillness — the final moment suspended in time, just \u2028before the inevitable. The bearded seal pup lies sprawled on the ice, its wide eyes fixed on \u2028the open water freedom. The bear’s claws dig into the ice, muscles coiled with raw force, jaws parted. The seal’s last \u2028sight is not the horizon, not the cold Arctic sky, but the unstoppable force of nature bearing \u2028down. It is the split second where survival ends and silence takes over — \u2028a moment where everything changes forever. Spring in Svalbard is a pivotal season for polar bears, offering essential hunting \u2028opportunities before the rapid retreat of fast ice. Fast ice, the sea ice attached to coastlines \u2028and fjords, provides a vital platform for polar bears to hunt their primary prey — seals. In \u2028early spring, seals haul out onto the ice to rest and give birth in snow dens, making them \u2028more accessible to polar bears. The bears rely heavily on this period to build up fat reserves \u2028that will sustain them through the leaner months when hunting becomes more difficult. As temperatures rise, the fast ice begins to break up and drift away from the land, reducing \u2028the area over which polar bears can effectively hunt. This shrinking ice cover forces the \u2028bears to adapt quickly, often requiring them to travel longer distances in search of food, \u2028either across increasingly unstable ice. Each day of hunting opportunity becomes more \u2028valuable, as successful hunts now must compensate for the longer periods of food scarcity \u2028later in the year. An eventual rise in average spring temperatures is likely to trigger an earlier and faster \u2028retreat of the ice, shortening the hunting season even further. This accelerating process \u2028threatens the delicate balance of survival in the Arctic. In this way, spring represents both a brief window of abundance and a turning point, \u2028emphasizing the fragile balance polar bears must navigate in a rapidly changing Arctic \u2028environment.
