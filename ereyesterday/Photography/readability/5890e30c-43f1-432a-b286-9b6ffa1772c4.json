Both are targeted at video creators but are more than capable tools for photographers as well.There was some confusion in these parts over the last month with both the “EOS RV” and “EOS R50 V” being written about. Our original report about a coming EOS R50 V back in early February came to fruition, even after a leaked image of a camera branded “EOS RV” muddied the waters a bit. In the end, that turned out to be the branding on the front of the EOS R50 V.Canon EOS R50 V \u0026 RF-S 14-30mm f/4-6.3 IS STM PZAre More V and RV Cameras Coming?Yes, there will be at least two more coming this year. We have already reported on the PowerShot V3, which we think will be coming in Q4 of 2025. We don’t know at this time how the V3 would be segmented when compared to the PowerShot V1.We have been told that here will be another EOS “RV” series camera this year as well. However, we don’t know what it will be to any degree of certainty.We have reported about a potential EOS R7 V coming this year.We do know Canon has grand plans with the APS-C lineup, and it makes sense to make a higher-end model for crop sensors. We think we’re going to see a camera body that is more than just an evolution of the current EOS R7 and could see both an EOS R7 Mark II and EOS R7 V making their way into the lineup soon.Canon EOS R6 Mark IIFull Frame EOS RV Camera?We haven’t heard anything about a full frame “RV” series camera a the time of writing this. Logically, it looks like Canon is all-in on this segment and a full-frame RV camera is a logical next step.We have the EOS R50 V that evolved from the EOS R50, so which full-frame camera could get the V treatment? If we had to guess, the 6 series is probably the sweet spot for such a camera. An EOS R6 V?We don’t believe Canon is going to use the 5 series for such a camera, based on price and the fact that the Cinema EOS C80 exists. Leaving 8K video to the 5 series keeps it well segmented in the linup.Canon could also do something with the 8 series, but the EOS R8 isn’t really known for its video chops, even if it is a great value full frame camera.Canon PowerShot V1SummaryIt’s safe to expect more cameras like the PowerShot V1 and EOS R50 V soon as Canon puts their muscle behind new segments of cameras to directly compete with the likes of Sony as well as lead the charge in other areas.Canon has said that they are going to be aggressive with new camera capabilities, and with the announcements this past week based on price? That appears to be the case.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...
