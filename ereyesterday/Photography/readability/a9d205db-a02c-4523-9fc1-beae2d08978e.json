White Android smartphone showing Instagram landing page. Photo by Gabrielle Henderson Producing quality content on social media is one of the hallmarks of a polished account versus someone just dabbling but getting that content is both harder and easier when it comes to the assembly process. Sure, dedicated apps have made things much more accessible for everyone yet major features remain locked to more professional software or those who know what they’re doing. It looks like Edits, like its competitors, wants to break this. Seamless connection with Meta’s major apps is one such feature that will help Edits break through, but it is the more technical side of things that has us interested. So, what can you do with Edits?  Transitions, green screen, clip-level editing, transitions and a load of data to help you shape the most compelling content. The app also sports a longer camera than Instagram and boasts quality of life and project management features to help power creators keep track of everything.  Looking ahead, Meta promises some more features including: “Keyframes: Pinpoint exact moments for adjustments to your video’s timing, motion and effects. Modification: Quickly change the look and feel of your videos with AI effects. Collaboration: Easily share drafts with friends, other creators or brands for feedback and creative builds. Creativity: More fonts, text animations, transitions, voice effects, filters and music options, including royalty-free” Definitely geared towards people who are comfortable working in an app format, Edits is nonetheless interesting from a content creation perspective since it is ostensibly free and has some pretty interesting features. Whether it will be powerful enough for anything beyond social media remains to be seen but it looks like yet another powerful addition to the arms race to make social media content. Whether Edits will continue in this format or eventually be integrated into Instagram is something else we will be watching out for as the one caveat with adopting these standalone “free” solutions is that the company can, without notice, pull the plug on your workflow.  Any thoughts you might have on Edits or CapCut are welcome in the comments.  We have some other news you might like at this link.
