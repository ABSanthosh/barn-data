Full Discolosure: This story sponsored by Excire. From Monday, November 25th through Monday, December 2nd, you can grab a lifetime license for either of Excire’s flagship programs at a 48% discount. The sale includes: Excire Foto 2024, the standalone photo organizer that boasts cutting-edge features such as automatic keywording, AI-powered prompt search, duplicate detection, people search, and AI aesthetic ratings. Excire Search 2024, the Lightroom Classic plugin that offers essentially all of the same features as Excire Foto 2024 (including prompt search, automatic keywording, AI aesthetic ratings, people search, and much more) but is seamlessly integrated into the Lightroom interface. Each product normally costs $189, yet for the next eight days, you can purchase Excire’s software for just $99 – and finally get your image catalog under control! To take advantage of this huge Cyberweek deal, simply head over to the Excire shop and follow the checkout instructions. Just make sure you buy before December 2nd; otherwise, the discount will expire and you’ll have missed your chance. Why Is Excire’s Photo-Management Software So Special? Whether it’s finding that one elusive photo, keywording your files, or culling images from your latest photoshoot, Excire streamlines your workflow processes with advanced AI technology. Here are just a few of the futuristic features packed into the latest Excire programs: Search and Retrieve With Prompt-Search AI Remember those times you wished you could just describe an image and have it appear without searching through your image library? Thanks to X-prompt AI, that dream is now a reality. Here’s how it works: Input a description: Type in a sentence, like “golden retriever playing in autumn leaves,” into the provided search field. Instant retrieval: In seconds, you’ll see the image you had in mind, no matter how deep it was buried in your archive. Expert Photo Evaluations With Pioneering AI Technology Excire’s X-tetics AI software, trained on hundreds of thousands of photos and input from top-tier photographers, provides an Aesthetics Score to help you select your top shots for sharing on social media and with clients. Instant Organization With AI Keywording Say goodbye to tedious manual keywording! Excire’s X-tags AI applies keywords to your photos automatically – and in the most recent releases, Excire’s engineers have completely revamped the AI engine to ensure up to 10x better content detection. Find People and Clean Up Your Catalog With Powerful Face- and Duplicate-Detection Whether you’re hunting for photos of specific individuals or trying to sort through \u0026 delete your near-duplicate images, Excire’s trailblazing X-face \u0026 X-alike AI tools can help. You can even search for photos featuring certain facial features (e.g., a smile). Incorporating Excire Into Your Existing Workflow You’re probably wondering: Will Excire’s software work with my current post-processing workflow? What about Lightroom, Photoshop, Capture One, or Luminar – do I have to give up all those programs to use Excire’s AI tech? Fortunately, the answer is no. Excire is not designed to replace your existing editing workflow; rather, it’s meant to supplement and improve it. As mentioned above, you can use Excire in two different ways: As a standalone program, called Excire Foto 2024. EF 2024 is designed to work alongside image editing software such as Lightroom, Luminar, Photoshop, Capture One, and Affinity Photo; that way, you can manage your images with Excire’s amazing tools, and you can process your photos using your favorite editor. As a Lightroom plugin, called Excire Search 2024. Excire Search integrates seamlessly with Lightroom Classic, so you can use all of Excire’s most powerful features inside the existing Lightroom interface. If you’re not heavily invested in Lightroom Classic, I’d recommend grabbing Excire Foto 2024 (the standalone software). The interface is intuitive, and using Excire’s various tools is unbelievably easy, even for a complete beginner. (You can learn more about Excire Foto 2024 on the company website.) If you’re a dedicated Lightroom user, the Excire Search plugin is the better route. Like we said, the integration is seamless, and adding Excire’s AI to Lightroom’s existing image-management features is an absolute game-changer. (You can learn more about Excire Search 2024 on the company website.) Save Time and Get Organized With Excire! Managing your photos used to be tedious and time-consuming. But with Excire, it’s rapid, it’s simple, and it’s even (dare I say it?) fun. So don’t miss out. Head over to the Excire website and grab your discounted copy of Excire Foto 2024 or Excire Search 2024 before Cyber Monday ends! So you can spend less time on mindless, repetitive tasks – and more time doing what you love. Full Discolosure: This story sponsored by Excire.",
