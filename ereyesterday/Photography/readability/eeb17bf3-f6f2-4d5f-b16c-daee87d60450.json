  "text": "Canon has made a splash already in 2025 with the announcement of the EOS R50 V, RF-S 14-30mm f/4-6.3 IS STM PZ and RF 20mm f/1.4L VCM, which is Canon’s widest f/1.4 lens ever. There will be more announcements from Canon before July, as well as late August or early Septmember. The order of what’s coming this year is unknown, as it goes most of the time with announcement dates. Canon EOS R7 Mark II We expect to see the new flagship APS-C camera in late August along with some new lenses, perhaps even higher end RF-S constant aperture zooms that we have reported on in the past. We do know that the follow-up will be heading “up-market” and will be for the wildlife and sports shooters that don’t want to spent car money on full-frame options. Canon EOS R6 Mark III We have been expecting the Canon EOS R6 Mark III for quite some time, but it hasn’t hit the market as of yet, and we don’t have a solid date as to when it might. We thought that it could appear in late May, but we haven’t heard anything in regards to the camera yet. We think there is a problem with the LP-E6P and/or other hardware or software issues. It’s always possible a battery issue, could delay a camera that would be using the same battery. We’ll talk more about the battery issues in the near future, but there have been plenty of forum threads on the topic. Full Frame V Camera We were told recently that Canon will be releasing a full-frame “V” series camera, which would also include the PowerShot V1 and EOS R50 V. It’s likely going to be based off a current full frame camera, and the EOS R6 Mark III seems like the best camera platform to go with. We reported recently that there would never be a direct replacement for the EOS R5 C, but a new “V” camera to fill the void is highly likely. There have also been talks about an EOS R7 V, but we haven’t heard anything about that in a while, and it’s possible that the full-frame V camera was what was coming all along. Canon EOS R10 Other Cameras We expect to see a new APS-C line of cameras, but we’re not sure what that would be at the moment. The EOS R10 could probably benefit from a refresh, as it was announced alongside the EOS R7 back in 2022. There will be a longer zoom PowerShot V camera late this year, possibly called the PowerShot V3. There are also rumblings of a refreshed “G” series for photographers, it may not be called “G”, but there is something coming in that regard. Retro ILC? It’ll come, late this year or early next year to celebrate the 50th anniversary for the AE-1. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.
