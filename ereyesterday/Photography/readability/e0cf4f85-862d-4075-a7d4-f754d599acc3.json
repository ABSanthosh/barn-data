As always, nailing down announcements dates is not an exact science, as there are so many variables that go into picking a day to announce a product.The Canon EOS R7 Mark II looks like it’ll be going upmarket with the latest bits of information that we have received from a solid source, though they haven’t been perfect over the years.Canon EOS R7Canon EOS R7 Mark II Rumored SpecificationsWe have been told that the camera will get a resolution bump to “about 40mp” and that it will shoot 8K video. That’s a lot of pixels on an APS-C sensor, but Fujifilm seems to have done a good job with it.Also expect an increase in the size of the body, but it will remain as light as everything else in the Canon lineup. The ergonomics of the camera will be more like the EOS R5 Mark II than what we currently see with the Canon EOS R7.That would be a terrific “upgrade”, as I don’t like the way the EOS R7 is laid out.It was also suggested that current accessories for the EOS R5 Mark II, such as the cooling grip, will be compatible.We’re not big fans of where the joystick and scroll wheel are locatedNo Mechanical Shutter?Can we also expect a faster readout speed?There have been suggestions that the EOS R7 Mark II will do away with the mechanic shutter and rely solely on an e-shutter. As many know, that would require an extremely fast readout speed, especially for the target market for the speedy Canon crop camera.I think that’s a 50/50 proposition, there is still a time and place for mechanical shutters, though removing it could reduce some costs making the camera. I hope the mechanical shutter remains.Perhaps the rumored EOS R7 V would be the one to do away with the mechanical shutter.What about the rumored global shutter equipped camera body that is apparently in the pipeline? It was suggested that we’d see a global shutter appear in an APS-C camera before a full-frame one. None of the sources of information in this article mentioned anything about a global shutter.We can also expect a CFexpress Type B slot, along with the UHS-II SD card slot. If they didn’t do dual CFexpress cards with the EOS R5 Mark II, it’s not happening with an EOS R7 Mark II.ConclusionThe above information comes from various people that we have known for the last few years, so we think there is a lot of truth here. Unfortunately, no one is 100% correct with leaks, but things are generally close.If the rumors are true about a coming EOS R7 V, then there’s a possibility that some specifications are going to be attributed to the wrong camera model.We have no further information at this time. The EOS R7 Mark II is still a way away and detailed specifications rarely come out this early.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
