  "text": "Earlier in the week we quickly evolved intitial assumptions of the Canon PowerShot V1 being vlogging camera to it becoming a whole new line of Canon PowerShot compact cameras.We are definitely happy about that quick evolution of the rumor.It was also interesting to see Canon actually mention the compact camera segment in their end of year 2024 financial reports. I don’t remember the last time they were mentioned in any meaningful way.Canon has likely learned an important lesson over the last bunch of years. It’s better to embrace an upcoming market from the start, than be playing catch-up once again. Though they do seem be able to find success as the tortoise.The projected market hype of compact cameras may fizzle out, but instant cameras and film cameras haven’t shown any signs of slowing down. It’ll be fun to watch nonetheless.This looks like the “G” moniker that has been around since 2000 will be laid to rest, and that’s probably a very smart move. We don’t expect the first V series camera to simply be a PowerShot G7 X Mark IV.Rumored Sensor Size for the PowerShot V1The most asked question that we’ve had about the PowerShot V1 is in regards to the sensor size. How big is it going to be?We have now had two sources that are saying that that it’ll be “approximately” be a Micro 4/3 sensor size.For reference, a Micro 4/3 sensor measures 18mm x 13.5mm. The PowerShot G7 X Mark III was equipped with a Sony made 1″ sensor, or 13.1mm x 8.8mm.Sensor Size ComparisonThe Canon PowerShot G1 X Mark III was the only Canon compact camera with an APS-C sensor, which generally measures in at 22.3mm x 14.9mm. APS-C sensor sizes aren’t identical across brands, so there can be variations as to what “APS-C” is.The image sensors for the initial PowerShot V cameras are said to be made by Canon themselves. They have the manufacturing ability to do it, and it’s also good for marketing. I don’t think at this point Sony and Canon are going to have much of a collaboration on these sorts of things going forward.So the PowerShot V1 will sit between both PowerShot G7 X Mark III \u0026 G1 X Mark III when it comes image sensor size. The Micro 4/3 sensor size should provide much better image quality than a 1″ sensor and also bring the benefit of keeping lens and camera body size down if the design calls for it.When Will The PowerShot V1 Be Announced? We still don’t know with any level of certainty. We’re hoping that changes soon.I’ll add, we have heard nothing at all about the potential of an APS-C PowerShot camera.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
