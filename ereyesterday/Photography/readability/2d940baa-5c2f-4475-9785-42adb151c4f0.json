One of the most interesting design features is the customizable “Film Simulation” (FS) dial that features an indicator window. Image via Fujifilm The Fujifilm-X-E5 allows you to navigate between Fujifilm's own presets via the FS dial and also allows the user to save their own three customizable film simulation settings. Fujifilm has used the term “recipes” for the film simulation settings, much like the presets that users develop and save in some mobile photo apps as recipes. The X-E5 has a compact design and comes with a 40.2MP APS-C sensor. It features a five-axis in-body image stabilization, AI powered autofocus and many other interesting features for aadvanced image capture. Here are some of the most important features of the Fujifilm X-E5: 40.2MP APS-C, X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor X-Processor 5 imaging engine Five-axis sensor-shift IBIS 3″ touchscreen LCD with three-axis tilting Single SD/SDHC/SDXC card slot Captures videos up to 6.2K Lower base ISO of 125, improving low light performance Latest AF Algorithm, subject detection AF Teleconverter with digital zoom settings of 1.4 and 2.0x Continuous shooting for uncompressed Raw images – up to 20 fps Long exposure up to 1 hour in bulb mode 20 unique Film Simulation modes Maximum frame rate of 29.97 fps in 6.2K, 59.94 fps in 4K, and 240 fps in Full HD Weight approximately 445 g Built-in Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2  USB-C power input for charging More details about the Fujifilm X-E5 can be found here.
