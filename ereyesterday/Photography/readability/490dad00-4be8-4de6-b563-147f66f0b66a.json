  "text": "Photo credit: Kris Kuganathan, left, David Gonzalez, right. Over a period of a few months, photographer Bryce Way traipsed around Los Angeles capturing the city’s diverse beauty. The Californian city is famous for its beaches, downtown area, and, Hollywood Hills. Way tells PetaPixel that he set out to showcase all of this. “L.A. is unique because it offers such a wide range of environments, from the city’s architecture to its natural landscapes, the city feels alive and constantly shifting,” Way says. “Whether it’s the sun setting over the ocean or the city streets at night, there’s always something new to capture.” Bryce Way Way captured L.A.’s famous landmarks and hidden gems to document a full view of the city and reveal its character. “My approach was to highlight the contrasts in the city, from downtown L.A. to the Hollywood Hills then the Coast. I looked for scenes that told a story and conveyed the energy of the place,” explains Way. Jack Landau Alex Ramirez Alex Ramirez Way’s photos, along with his fellow photographers, have been collated into a new book titled Trope Los Angeles, part of Trope’s City Edition series. “Shooting over a longer period gave me the chance to capture L.A. in various conditions and times of day, showing how the city changes with the light and weather,” says Way. “This approach helped me convey the city’s atmosphere and character.” Andy Shigekawa Selene Sari Josh Luten Drones give a unique perspective, letting photographers see familiar places from entirely new angles.| David Gonzalez Way employed drones to shoot the project with but says generally his “gear setup is pretty minimal” but adds that his drone “never leaves my bag since aerial shots are a bit part of how I capture a city.” Advice for Fellow Photographers Way says that a top tip for photographers wanting to shoot their own cityscapes is to use Google Earth as a location-scouting tool. “You’d be surprised at how many spots you can find that way. It makes a huge difference to plan out parking and frame your shot beforehand, so you can get there ready to shoot,” says Way. “Beyond that, always keep shooting and experimenting. Try different times of day, angles, and weather conditions to see how they affect your images. Consistency and exploration are key to developing your own style and truly connecting with the scene.” Matt Weitz Neal Kumar Jeffery Xin Trope Los Angeles is available to pre-order now from the Trope website.
