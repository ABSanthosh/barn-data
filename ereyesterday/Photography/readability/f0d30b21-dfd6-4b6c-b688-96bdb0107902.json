While that is not that newsworthy on their own, they certainly did tease that Zeiss was coming out with something soon.Zeiss had all but disappeared from the consumer market, focusing mostly on industrial lenses. The Batis and Loxia lines have been discontinued and Zeiss themselves have not created a consumer / professional stills camera lens for over six years.It certainly seems as if Zeiss is doing something, and a new Otus 85mm F1.4 would be a fantastic starting point. SonyAlphaRumors received word from one of their sources;Half a year ago, a guy I know who works for Zeiss in PR (and was also involved in marketing for the unfortunately failed ZX1) told me Zeiss is bringing out new lenses in a few months. Now if you look at zeiss imaging on instagram they are teasing something with an owl, so I guess it might be something Otus line related. May guess is an Otus line for mirrorless cameras as E-Mount and the like.While that seems to be encouraging it’s certainly not a slam dunk.Otus lenses if you recall had no electronic connections to the EF mount. They are still available for the EF mount, for a mere $14,995 USD.Zeiss Otus Kit for the EF mountZeiss has been hesitant on bringing electronic connected lenses to the EF mount in the past, because they are above the reverse engineering that third party EF lens manufacturers had to do. Given that mirrorless cameras overall play far nicer with lens data, I would imagine that Zeiss is looking to create the new mirrorless Otus lineup with electronic connections to the camera. Since they have done this before with the Batis and Loxia lineup for the E-mount, they do have some experience with this.SAR thinks that it’s possible we will see these Otus for mounts other than the E mount, and quite possibly for the RF mount. I think we will as well, as this wouldn’t be something that Canon would feel threatened with, and it’s possible that the lens communication is redimentary enough for Canon to quickly sign off on it. Or, Zeiss could keep with the Otus mystery and simply have a mechanical mount, and camera communcation be damned. If it’s simply a mechanical lens mount with no connections, then I would put the RF mount as a near certainty.The Zeiss Otus 85mm F1.4 for the DSLR mounts was a insanely great lens, with a equallly high price tag. You got what you paid for. Let’s pause and relieve memory lane from 10 years ago via Zeiss’s video. Craig and I were used lens lusting a few weeks ago, and I said he needed to get the Contax/Yashica 21mm f/2.8 lens. Primarily because I wanted to borrow it from him.Contax / Yashica 21mm f/2.8 – Still a beautiful lensI have long used Contax lenses on my EF cameras, and I miss that clinical sharpness and microcontrast that you get out of Zeiss. It will be good to see them re-enter the market, even if they decide to skip the RF mount for now.What do you all think? Are you ready to sell a few kidneys to get some Zeiss primes?Source: SonyAlphaRumorsWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
