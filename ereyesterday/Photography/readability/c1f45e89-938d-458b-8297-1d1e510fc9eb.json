For those of you that watch the news, there’s a little bit of a trade war going on between the USA and its trading partners. And while tariffs aren’t the buzzword everyone expected for 2025, it’s certainly become a part of the popular zeitgeist. Issued to achieve some political and economic goal – some say moving product back to the United States or just to get people to the bargaining table – the tariffs are, nonetheless, going to become less of a theoretical thing and more of a real hit to the wallets of citizens in the USA that buy a range of products. Leica, for example, announced price increases of up to 90% on some products, placing them firmly out of the reach of many. If you were ever sitting on the fence about scooping something up, now would be the time, these reports indicate. One example cited by PetaPixel to illustrate how much of a price increase we are looking at for some items is the MagSafe Lux Grip from Leica for iPhone, currently priced at $USD 329. After the tariffs, this price is expected to be $USD 625. That’s a lot for a grip already. The price hike makes it even more questionable from the standpoint of value for your money. Certainly there are other capable grips out there but they might be more expensive, too, because of the tariffs. Welcome to the new age of discerning consumers in the United States. Any thoughts you might have on Leica’s pricing going forward in the United States are welcome in the comments. We have some other news for you to read at this link.
