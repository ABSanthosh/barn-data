  "description": "I had hoped to have these last week, but there was a lot to go through (though about 1/2 of what other folks got on the trip, as I caught a nasty bug about 1/2 way through the trip and wound up in bed in my cabin for days coughing and sneezing with zero energy, but I survived, bounced back, and here are some of my favroties from the trip: https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/tJndh0XPaRQcH If youâ€™ve got a sec, I hope you can check them out. Thanks for letting me share my photos and story of the trip with you. Have a good one. -Scott The post My Favorite Shots From Antarctica appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
