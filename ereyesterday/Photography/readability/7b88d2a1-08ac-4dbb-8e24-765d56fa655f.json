And bonus points for having both weather sealing and optical image stabilisation. https://www.cameralabs.com/canon-rf-16-28mm-f2-8-is-stm-review/DigitalCameraWorld (DCW) for short, has also weighed in on the Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM and a little oddly compared it against the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L IS USM, not a lens that I would have chosen as my basis of comparison. But it’s also a good point that Canon has progressed from being rather sad and quite, well, comically bad at making ultra wides to basically being able to make almost any ultra wide that can be imagined, and some, like this lens – ones that people didn’t even really imagine. DCW does show some close-up crops, so you can determine for yourself the corner performance, etc.The Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM is small, light, weather-sealed, feature-packed and half the price of its 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM sibling – so what’s not to like! If you’re thinking of buying a wide-angle zoom for your R-series camera, you could do far worse than the RF 16-28mm. It boasts incredible stabilization, quiet autofocus that’s fast and smooth, and my early tests with a beta sample show comparable image quality to the older Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM III. https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/lenses/canon-rf-16-28mm-f-2-8-is-stm-reviewAs well as written reviews, there are quite a bit of video resources now out and my top picks in that category are below.
