We Miss These Magazines Photography magazine can be either digital or print copies and although we are in an age that is completely moving towards digital, there is something special about holding a physical magazine, flipping through the pages to see the images printed on paper, and reading through the information. I personally think although the digital age has helped cut down on the use of paper, which hugely contributes to saving the environment, once in a while, it is good to get printed magazines and flip through the pages. It is definitely different from what you read digitally! Photography Magazine subscriptions could be for personal use if you are a photographer or can be a rewarding gift to photographers. Be it a birthday or the holiday season, these subscriptions can be educative gifts that can help a photographer grow. Another benefit of printed photography magazines is, when you travel, you can grab a copy of your favorite magazine and get through the journey. It could help inspire you with some ideas for your next photo shoot or if you are traveling to a destination as a travel photographer, getting one or two outdoor magazines relevant to your destination will give you an idea of locations and inspiration for travel photography. Moreover, printed copies are easy on your eyes! There are a bunch of photography magazines focusing on various genres or levels of photographers – some are educative, some are technical, some inspirational, some for professionals, and some for beginners or hobbyists. Whatever genre of photography you enjoy or whatever level of photography you are in, there is something to suit everyone’s needs. In this article, we have put together a bunch of photography magazines that we think are the best out there. We took into account certain factors that we thought a good photography magazine should include and filtered out the best magazines based on some of the criteria below. Note: There are loads of magazines out there with new ones coming into the market every time you go out to get one at the newsstand, but there are some magazines that stand out from the rest always. But again, it is a very personal thing when it comes to photography and what you like may be different from what someone else likes. Update on January 20, 2022: This article was mainly focused on showcasing print-only magazines. Since publishing this article in 2018, a lot of the magazines have either gone digital or have closed printing/publications during the pandemic. We have included updates with links to digital subscriptions, back issues, and archives wherever available. 1. What We Look For In A Great Photography Magazine A great photography magazine needs to have certain qualities in order for it to be beneficial for the reader. Different photographers look for different content in a magazine and a magazine as a whole should be able to incorporate this content in there so that it can be read by a wide genre of photographers. Here are some factors that we think top photography magazines should include: The contents of the photography magazine need to be spot on (magazines aimed at beginners need to focus on helping beginners, and magazines for pros need to be geared towards pros) and the magazine needs to cover topics that they say are included in the photography magazine cover in detail Knowledge from the magazine should help the reader develop photography and gear skills It needs to provide tips with illustrations to make information understandable and interesting Contents of the magazine need to be laid out in a way that the information makes things easier for photographers so they do more photography and not contemplate about it Assignment ideas should be included in photography magazines to help photographers practice what they learn Project ideas to help photographers get through times when they feel less motivated. Advice from Pros to help with inspiration and needs to be delivered in such a way that it motivates photographers and gives them a feeling of “nothing is impossible” with practice and patience The magazine contents need to be laid out in an easy-to-understand format, flow, and language Promotions or reviews made on equipment should not lead beginners towards gear lust but rather help them focus more on improving photography with the gear in hand Seasonal articles, projects to try along with tips should be included, for example, what and how to photograph during each season (spring, autumn, winter, summer) Photos need to include settings, tips, and any techniques used, including lighting setups and any story behind the situation, as this helps with knowledge for the reader rather than just looking at photos for the namesake. It would be great if a short note on the location, weather, and available light was discussed as well. Should include post-processing advice and tips along with recommended applications and reasons why they are recommended. Not just focus on paid applications or just applications from one developer like Adobe, but also include other developers and free applications that would help any reader and beginners Needs to feature/showcase readers’ work, so readers get to know what other photographers achieve with their gear Critique sections so that readers can learn from critiques of other photographers’ images in a photography magazine Review gadgets and accessories for photographers so they can make decisions on buying the gear they need Ads relevant to the audience – for example, if the magazine focuses on landscape photography, ads related to gears and other equipment required for landscape photographers Include little surprise gifts like cards that readers can download to their smart devices or prints that can be used in the fields. It should include the latest news and events Behind the scenes of professional photographers on location and studios. Interviews in a photography magazine, especially how a photographer turned pro from a beginner or amateur Taking into account most of the above factors, we have come up with a bunch of what we think are the best photography magazines overall and by region and important genres. We have done all the research and included as much information about the magazines so you do not have to spend time looking around for them. Note: The price, subscription fees, and any offers stated here are based on what we found at the time of writing or updating the article, and please note that these may change from time to time and may also be available for better offers elsewhere. 2.
