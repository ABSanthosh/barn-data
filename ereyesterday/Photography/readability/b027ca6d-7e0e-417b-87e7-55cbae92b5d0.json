  "text": "A bloodied yet determined honey badger returns to finish off a Cape porcupine, which earlier had tried to defend itself in Botswana. | Ian Wood / Wildlife Photographer of the Year Animal lovers are being asked to vote for their favorite picture for this year’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice Award. The amazing set of 25 photos includes a determined honey badger with a face full of spikey quills from a porcupine, a beluga whale exfoliating its skin, and a scientist dressed as a whooping crane in Louisiana. Wildlife Photographer of the Year is developed and produced by the Natural History Museum, London. To vote for your favorite photo, head to the museum’s website where you can cast your vote. A selection of the images are below. A ghostly barn owl exits the hayloft window of a derelict barn to hunt in fields outside Vancouver, Canada. | Jess Findlay / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A polar bear cub attempts an underwater surprise attack on a northern fulmar. | Erlend Haarberg / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A European roller defends its territory from a bemused-looking little owl in Kiskunság National Park, Hungary. | Bence Máté / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A rarely seen four-toed sengi forages for food among the leaf litter in Mozambique. | Piotr Naskrecki / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A disguised biologist approaches an endangered whooping crane in Louisiana, USA. Michael has been chronicling the lives of endangered whooping cranes since early 2019. The biologist acted with cat-like quickness to check the bird’s health and change a transmitter that was no longer working. The transmitter helps biologists track these non-migratory birds and learn more about them. This experimental population was reintroduced in Bayou Country in 2011. In the 1940s there were roughly 20 whooping cranes in the region. Since then, numbers have climbed to over 800. | Michael Forsberg / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A chimpanzee pauses and looks down as its family moves across the forest floor of Loango National Park, Gabon. | Nora Milligan / Wildlife Photographer of the Year Four grey wolves cross a minimalist landscape of naked aspens and snow in Yellowstone National Park, USA. | Devon Pradhuman / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A giant ground gecko stands fast against a pale chanting goshawk in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa. | Willie Burger van Schalkwyk / Wildlife Photographer of the Year Members of an Indian wolf pack pause briefly as they play in fields in Bhigwan, India. | Arvind Ramamurthy / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A dramatic blue-grey sky highlights the soft greys of a Weddell seal as it rests on an ice floe. | Sue Flood / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A beluga whale rubs its underside on a shallow river bottom to exfoliate its skin. | Mark Williams / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A young cheetah cub hisses while waiting to be sold in Ethiopia. Captured from her home plains in the Somali Region, she was transported for several days on the back of a camel to the northern coast of Somaliland. Illegal wildlife trafficking is a problem in the Somali Region. Farmers catch and sell cheetah cubs to traffickers, claiming that the cheetahs attack their livestock. Sometimes the farmers and traffickers cannot sell the cubs immediately. The bigger the cheetahs get, the harder it is to find buyers. Some end up being killed and their parts sold, their bones shipped to Yemen and then to other Asian markets. They are then sold as tiger bones and used to make Chinese bone wine. After hissing at the camera, the cub started chirping, calling out for its mother. | Jose Fragozo / Wildlife Photographer of the Year An ambling Eurasian badger appears to glance up at badger graffiti on a quiet road in St Leonards-on-Sea, England, UK. | Ian Wood / Wildlife Photographer of the Year A puma stands on a windswept outcrop in the rugged mountain terrain of Torres del Paine National Park, Chile. | Aaron Baggenstos / Wildlife Photographer of the Year Vote for your favorite photo here.

Captured from her home plains in the Somali Region, she was transported for several days on the back of a camel to the northern coast of Somaliland. Illegal wildlife trafficking is a problem in the Somali Region. Farmers catch and sell cheetah cubs to traffickers, claiming that the cheetahs attack their livestock. Sometimes the farmers and traffickers cannot sell the cubs immediately. The bigger the cheetahs get, the harder it is to find buyers. Some end up being killed and their parts sold, their bones shipped to Yemen and then to other Asian markets. They are then sold as tiger bones and used to make Chinese bone wine.
