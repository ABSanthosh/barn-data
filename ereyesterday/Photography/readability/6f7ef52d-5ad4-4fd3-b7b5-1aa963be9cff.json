This card is also well-suited for video capture, including 4K, 3D, and Full HD video, and can achieve maximum read speeds of up to 250 MB/s and maximum write speeds of up to 120 MB/s. Thanks to its V60 speed class rating, minimum write speeds are guaranteed not to drop below 60 MB/s.UHS-II cards achieve their speed through an extra row of pins and while this card has been designed for cameras that are UHS-II / V60 compatible, it may be used in devices that do not support UHS-II / V60. However, bear in mind that this card will then default to your device’s speed class and bus rating, such as UHS-II and V30, which supports minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s, or UHS-I and U3, which also supports minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s. If your device does not support U3, this card is compatible with the U1 and Class 10 standards, each of which guarantee minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s.To help protect against accidental file deletion, there is a built-in write protect switch. To further safeguard against possible data loss, users can download free Image Rescue software that is designed to recover most photo and video files.General FeaturesHigh-speed performance-leverages UHS-II technology (U3) for a data read speed up to 1667x (250 MB/s)Captures high-quality images and extended lengths of enhanced 1080p Full HD, 3D, and 4K video with a DSLR camera, HD camcorder, or 3D cameraA large capacity of up to 256GB lets you shoot longer without changing cardsHigh-speed file transfer from card to computer to dramatically accelerate workflowBackwards compatible with UHS-I and Class 10 devicesWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
