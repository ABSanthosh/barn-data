  "description": "Erik Kuna and I am back from an amazing week in Tokyo with 13 wonderful photographers. Man, we had an incredible experience – tons of photo opportunities, great food, great people (love the Japanese people), and a really great culture, lots of laughs and fun, and we even took a photo or two, all in an absolutely incredible place. If you’ve got a minute, here’s a link to some of my favorite images from the week, the story of it all, and some behind-the-scenes photos. Here’s the link. Next, here’s an absolutely fantastic new video from Terry White on 5 ways to speed up Lightroom Classic, and this is so helpful – SO helpful. If you’ve got a sec, check it out (it could save your hours. Heck, days!). Kick butt video, right? Thanks, Terry. 🙂 The Big Photography Show Coming To New York This Summer – It’s B\u0026H Photo’s BILD Expo And I’m thrilled to be one of their speakers again this year.
