How did a decade happen???? Anyway, one of the more recent bits of kit that I use from them is the Travel Tripod. It‚Äôs been allll over the place with me since launch, from the most southern tip of New Zealand to the north coast of Scotland and loads of places in between and has never let me down. In this relationship, unlike others in my life, I‚Äôm far more likely to be the one to cause issues, that‚Äôs for sure. Back to my original point. Today Peak Design are launching the Pro Tripod line with enhanced features such as increased strength and stability to carry heavier cameras and lenses, improved ball head functionality and accessories for full fluid pan/tilt video capture. It looks like they‚Äôve also refined the design and further enhanced build quality too. Nice stuff all round! So, if the original wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpro‚Äù enough for you maybe the new one will be. You can find our more here where they‚Äôve spent countless hours crafting a useful info and sales page. If you grab one, have fun! And if you don‚Äôt well, um, enjoy knowing that you made a terrible life decision. üòâ",
