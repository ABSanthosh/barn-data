There are many incidents of thieves snatching cameras from photographers all around the world and a very few are usually able to get their equipment back. Photo by Filtergrade In Barcelona, Spain, a Chinese photographer, Jia Daming, was able to choke down the thief who snatched his camera and this news has gone viral for his heroic act. Footage of the incident can be found here on X. The photographer was not harmed and was able to get his equipment back. The photographer who travels the world to shoot for fashion, celebrity brands and wedding photography, was filming a newlywed couple in a famous landmark in Barcelona, Spain, when a group of three men tried to steal the camera. The photographer got hold of one of the thieves while the other two fled the scene. Witnesses in that area, besides capturing this incident, quickly called the local police to report the incident. The thief was choked by the photographer in an act of self-defence and to restrain him till the police arrived. The police handcuffed the thief and according to other reports, the police are investigating this matter. The footage from the scene have been shared on social media and has attracted millions of views. Onlookers and social media users applauded the photographer for his brave act. While it can be very dangerous to restrain a thief, it looks like the photographer used martial arts to neck choke hold the thief and this can sometimes even cause death because of the restricted air and blood flow to the brain.
