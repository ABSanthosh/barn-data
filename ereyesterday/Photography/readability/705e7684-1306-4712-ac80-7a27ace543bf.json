Photo by charlesdeluvio An almost iconic identifier of a smartphone, the camera bump is a somewhat unseemly hill on an otherwise flat plain of tooled metal, regardless of the handset maker. In fact, most people, designers included, think that everything would look a whole lot better without it. But how do you do that without sacrificing performance? After all, smartphone cameras are already doing some pretty impressive things in a form factor so alien and different from their forebears that that fact alone is impressive. Well, it looks like Google might have found a way because the company’s next-generation smartphones seem to have eschewed the camera bump for a cleaner look. The Verge reports that the company will officially unveil the new phones March 19 for a March 26 street launch. They will also be relatively affordable given the competition with the entry-level model coming in at $USD 499. In terms of the camera’s capabilities, the website states:  “The back cameras will include a 48-megapixel main shooter (down from 64 megapixels in the 8A), and a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and the phone will have a 13-megapixel selfie camera on the front, according to Android Headlines. The Pixel 9A will also apparently sport a 5,100mAh battery, up from the previous model’s 4,492 mAh.” Since this is all rumors and speculation at this point, we have to take all of this with a grain of salt. The cool thing is that, if this works out, we might see a trend among others to eliminate the camera bump without compromising performance. The new Pixel 9A is expected to compete with the as-yet-unannounced iPhone SE.  Any thoughts that you might have on smartphone design are welcome in the comments.
