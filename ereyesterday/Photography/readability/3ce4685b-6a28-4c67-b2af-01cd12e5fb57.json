Most of the incidents happen during wildlife safaris where a photographer may have accidentally dropped their gear or the gear fell off their bags, etc. Image via Dansen Raddy One of the most recent incidents is one where a lion walked away with a photographer's very expensive lens and looks like this incident happened in Kenyaâ€™s Maasai Mara National Park. The incident was captured by another photographer, who posted the footage on his Instagram. The footage was shared on many social media channels, reposted by other accounts and has gone viral. While a lot of viewers found the footage funny and entertaining, it has raised concerns and a bit of anger among other wildlife photographers. As photographers, we always need to be ethical and mindful of the wildlife and their surroundings. Incidents like these only show that photographers are more concerned about getting the shot than being more responsible. A lot of comments on the video shared here talk about how these incidents should not be entertained. Looks like there are also instances where photographers intentionally drop their gear to gain popularity on social media which is really sad, and more so when one claims to be a serious photographer. While some viewers commented that the scene seem like a planned one, there are comments from witnesses who mention that it was an accident. Other concerns raised were how close the photographers and their vehicles were to the animals, which is not acceptable at all in photography and raises questions about giving animals their space and not disturbing them or their environment when capturing their photographs. What are your thoughts on incidents like these and the rise in the number of such incidents? Let us know in the comments section below.
