Join today! It costs just $3 per month or $30 per year. There is a lot to discuss about the RX1R III from the massive hiatus Sony took from the line (nearly a decade) to the high asking price ($5,100), but that’s not all the team discusses this week. PetaPixel News Editor Jeremy Gray joins to go through it all as well as lead a discussion on gap primes: what happened to them? While photographers are hit with a deluge of 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm primes at varying apertures and prices, lenses like the 28mm, 30mm, 40mm, 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 135mm are left to essentially wither. That ain’t right! The four discuss where manufacturers are lacking the most, what lenses they would like to see next, and why giving slower and more compact lenses in these ranges makes for better photography.
