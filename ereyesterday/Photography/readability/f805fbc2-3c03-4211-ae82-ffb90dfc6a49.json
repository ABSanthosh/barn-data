  "text": "A coronal mass ejection (CME) is headed straight for Earth per NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Astrophotographers should charge their camera batteries, check weather conditions for tomorrow, and prepare for what could be the biggest auroral event of the year. While there is no way to guarantee that auroral displays will light up the sky — space weather is enigmatic — the experts agree that the odds are looking very good. The CME is slated to strike Earth on June 1st, and auroras may be visible across Europe and many U.S. states. While Spaceweather.com does not expect the storm to be as powerful as the one that lit up the skies just over a year ago, it “could be one of the bigger events of Solar Cycle 25 is a severe storm materializes.” NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center expects the CME to arrive on June 1st, with passage continuing into June 2nd. The current expectation is that the CME will strike Earth’s atmosphere sometime between midday (EDT) and early evening. However, timing is tricky to predict due to the current solar wind conditions. Nonetheless, the CME speed and direction provide “fair confidence in an Earth arrival.” While that language is not dripping with confidence, the geomagnetic storm watch is a G4-class, which is extremely high. There is currently a 55% chance of severe geomagnetic storms at mid-latitudes over the next 48 hours and a whopping 95% chance of the same thing at high latitudes. ‘Big old sunspot 4100 finally exploded–and it was a doozy. On May 31st at 00:05 UTC, Earth-orbiting satellites detected an M8.2-class solar flare. The explosion lasted more than three hours,’ Spaceweather.com explains. | Image credit: NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory Again, and it is vital to stress this, space weather predictions are challenging. Everything has to come together for good aurora photography, including the timing of impact, cloud conditions, and good old-fashioned luck. The most essential ingredient — a strong CME headed in the right direction — is in play, at least. Further, the Moon is a reasonably dim waxing crescent right now, which helps. There are no guarantees when it comes to auroras, but things are looking as promising as they have all year. PetaPixel has many aurora photography guides to help beginners and veterans alike have the best chance at success, including the following: A Mini Guide on When, Where and How to Photograph the Aurora by Albert Dros How and When to Photograph Auroras by Albert Dros How to Find and Photograph the Northern Lights by Jason Parnell-Brookes The Ultimate Guide to Forecasting, Shooting, and Post-Processing the Northern Lights by Daniel Laan A Complete Guide to Capturing Gorgeous Photos of the Night Sky by Michael Bonocore with tips from Peter Baumgarten Image credits: Aurora photos by Jeremy Gray PetaPixel articles may include affiliate links; if you buy something through such a link, PetaPixel may earn a commission.",
