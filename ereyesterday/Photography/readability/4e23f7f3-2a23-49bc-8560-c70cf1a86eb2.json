An unfortunate Redditor recently revealed on the site that a client they had done a shoot for eight months previously came back asking for the download link. Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, this was about a week after they had already deleted the client's photographs. And this was one of those situations in which, as you guessed, there was no contract. Now, we are not in any way naive enough to believe that a lot of photographers aren’t working on good faith in this industry – but what happens when situations like this arise? For one, it potentially leaves you open to legal repercussions—a knife that cuts both ways. Of course, as anyone will tell you, the first thing in a legal situation that lawyers will ask for is the contract. And if there is no contract, you are about to enter a quagmire. But this particular situation also raises the question: how long is reasonable to keep a client's old work? For that, you might need to use common sense—or, preferably, as you guessed it, have a contract in place. So how long do you keep clients’ work? Is eight months a reasonable amount of time? And do you have a standard contract that you use that covers this scenario? Let us know in the comments.",
