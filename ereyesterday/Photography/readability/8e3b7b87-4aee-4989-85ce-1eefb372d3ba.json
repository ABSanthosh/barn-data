  "description": "On this weekâ€™s episode of The Grid, Scott, Erik, and special guest Terry White took on one of the most entertaining topics yetâ€”whatâ€™s totally overrated in the world of photography. From gear that gets too much hype to hardware that doesnâ€™t live up to the buzz (looking at you, MacBook Pro), nothing was off-limits. They had a blast chatting with the live audience about everything from light meters and UV filters to prime lenses, editing habits, and even overrated travel spots for photographers. Ohâ€”and somehow, it turned into a full-blown chicken sandwich debate. Because, of course, it did. ðŸ˜‰ If you missed it live, this oneâ€™s definitely worth catching the replay. Itâ€™s packed with laughs, hot takes, and a few solid nuggets of photo wisdom. The post This Week on The Grid: Whatâ€™s Really Overrated in Photography? appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
