Early indications point to “yes” and, for our purposes, the camera system on the new iPhone 16e seems to be unique enough to warrant discussion. That’s because, unlike those we have discussed in more recent articles, this one has a single camera oculus, shedding the ubiquitous camera bump for something simpler. It’s also not quite as good as the more expensive ones from a technology standpoint but it’s nonetheless a competent camera and an innovative bit of kit in its own right. Starting at $USD 599, the 16e has the affordability thing on lock and sports a sleek form factor that is sure to please people who prefer smaller smartphones over the larger versions that tend to dominate.  It’s got all of Apple’s in-house wonders as well as the necessary AI integration and, of course, Siri. Now for the camera: Billed as a two-for-one, the 48 MP sensor apparently is 4x the resolution of older iPhones (so those who are holding out for something like the iPhone 16e have a reason to move on) and a 2x telephoto zoom. In terms of video capabilities, users get 4K video in Dolby quality, Apple reports. That’s pretty impressive and the form factor is sure to get noticed, particularly since camera bumps are becoming a controversial design feature that no one has quite figured out how to get around.   Do you prefer more expensive or cheaper smartphones? What are your thoughts on the rise of camera technology in smartphones? Let us know in the comments.  We have some other photography news for you to check out at this link right here.
