Photo by Jakob Owens And, naturally, it involves everyone’s favorite buzzword these days: AI.  Described by PetaPixel in much the same way that Google provides previews for search engine results, Alphabet’s YouTube is looking into having AI specifically take clips from videos that match your search results in a similar preview format.  In other words, it will help you cut to the chase and find exactly what you’re looking for, where, and when in a YouTube video. No more searching, waiting, and going through multiple advertisements to get what you need. It sounds like a pretty neat feature and, initially, it’s going to be limited to a few niche subjects such as travel and shopping, the website quotes YouTube brass.  That makes sense because those are both very lucrative areas for companies and content creators and it is also one where very specific, timely information makes the most sense.  If it works out here, we could see it expanding to other search results. One thing that comes to mind, however, is that often you will find yourself watching ads and various other monetization clips when digging through YouTube videos to find what you need. While that is a pain, it helps the creators of the content make money and, ostensibly, create more useful content. How will that system fare once everything is being quick clipped by AI remains to be seen but, if anything, hopefully it eliminates the overly long content that does nothing but generate clicks.  Any thoughts you might have on this somewhat novel idea are welcome in the comments.  We have some other news for you to read at this link.
