So the team at Clickster Camera sent us across this little gem to have a play with! It’s a super-simple digital camera, but, it has NO screen! It comes with a memory card and you can shoot a couple of thousand frames before you need to empty the card. It’s kinda like a modern day point and shoot film camera, but you don’t need to send it off to be developed. The fun, for me at least, is that you take it out for a day, you make all of your photographs, and then, when the time is right, you plug it into your computer and ‘see what you got!’ that anticipation of not knowing, you don’t get to review in camera, you don’t get to check it out via your phone – you have to wait! It’s as simple as this, here’s pretty much everything in the instruction manual for the Clickster Camera – It has an off/on button, a shutter release button, a USB-C plug for charging and getting your photos off. Right next to the USB-C port you will find an ‘M’ button as well as a + and – They’re for setting the date on your camera. There’s a button on the back where the little digital display is, that is the mode button – you have three options, Mono, Retro and Classic, and if you hold that button in it turns the beepy sound off / on. On the front of the camera (the photo up the top) you can also see the LED flash on/off button. All you have on the display is what mode you’re in, your battery life (around 500 frames, that’s a lot!) as well as how many frames you’ve taken and the sound on or off icon – again, simples! It’s a dead simple camera, very easy to use in good light, less than ideal results in the dark unless you’re on a tripod, but then (for subjects in close) you use the flash and you’re cooking with gas, well, LED, but you get me… Pretty much child-proof and only $120 – well worth a shot! Enough of my rambling! Check out this little video from our friend Andy on his time with the Clickster Camera! (Sub to his Youtube while you’re at it) Do we think the Clickster is better than the Fujifilm? Well that all depends, doesn’t it? You could grab one and try it out for yourself! We found them online in Australia for $119 at Teds, Camera House etc, a quick Google should have you up and running. Read more from our Cameras \u0026 Equipment category I need help with...",
