This mega zoom camera comes with a 125x optical zoom feature, with an equivalent focal length range of 24 to 3000mm. Image by Nikon The advantage of these COOLPIX cameras are that they are quite compact, lightweight and are beginner friendly for people who are on a budget. One does not need to invest in a camera body and then a bunch of lenses. The image quality may not be at par with the interchangeable lens cameras, especially in the telephoto ranges, but owning a 3000mm lens may be near to impossible and not practical. With the 125x optical zoom and more digital zoom, image stabilisation is of paramount importance. This camera comes with great image stabilisation – dual detect Optical VR for both stills and videos. This means you can shoot sharp images and smooth videos. The camera also comes with modes for specific genre like fireworks, bird and moon photography. When in specific modes, the camera is set to capture those subjects without the user having to worry about the right settings. This camera also has a minimum focusing distance of 1 cm in macro mode, making it a great equipment for macro photography. Here are some of important technical features of the Nikon COOLPIX P1100: Effective pixels – 16 megapixels 1/2.3 inches CMOS Sensor 125x optical zoom with an equivalent focal length of 24 to 3000mm and up to 4x digital zoom. Lens aperture values between f/2.8 to f/8 17 lens elements in 12 groups Vari-angle LCD screen Maximum ISO of 6400 Maximum shutter speed 1/4000s Self timer Customisable control ring. Weight about 1.41kg More information about the Nikon COOLPIX P1100 can be found here!",
