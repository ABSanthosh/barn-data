  "description": "This is a great tip (and one I did not know) from Adobe’s own Rikk Flohr who posted this as a comment here on my post about how to find Lightroom’s hidden “Reset Preferences” button. Here’s Rikk’s comment; If, for some reason, you are unable to launch Lightroom Classic to access the Preferences dialog, there is a KBSC [keyboard shortcut] reset on launch you can use. This procedure works for both Lightroom Classic and Lightroom Desktop.Note: If you are using Lightroom Desktop, it can change your local storage location. Please review this setting after resetting preferences. Reset Procedure:1. Close Lightroom.2. Hold down [Alt/Opt]+[Shift] while restarting Lightroom.3. Overwrite the Preferences when prompted by the dialog.4. Close Lightroom.5. Restart Lightroom. I had no idea. Thanks, Rikk! 🙂 Next week, it’s the Wildlife Photography Conference (and you’re invited) It’s here next week – Dec. 10-11, 2024 (Tuesday and Wednesday), but we kick the conference off a day early on Monday with a special pre-conference session from the brilliant teacher and photographer Rick Sammon called “WILDLIFE PSYCHOLOGY, PHOTOGRAPHY \u0026 PHILOSOPHY” and you don’t want to miss it. The conference is two full days, two training tracks, it’s all online, and everyone’s invited to spend a few days with us learning, laughing, and making new connections. Plus, you get access to the entire event to stream live on-demand for an entire year! We’ve put together an absolutely top-notch team of instructors — some of the most passionate, gifted communicators, who are there for one reason — to help you take your wildlife photography up a big notch. Here’s a peek at who’s teaching: This event is packed with expert-led inspiration and insights for every wildlife photography niche. Sign up today to secure your spot and save $150 (here’s the link for tickets and more details). Have a great weekend, everybody! #GoBucs! -Scott The post What To Do If Lightroom Won’t Launch appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
