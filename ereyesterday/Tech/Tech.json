    "description": "The full trailer dropped today for Apple's F1 movie. The film is getting an international theatrical release starting June 25, and will be in theaters and IMAX domestically beginning June 27. F1 has received extensive involvement from the Formula 1 world, so it'll be fascinating to see how well it walks the line between being a good movie and feeling like a dramatic promo for the organization. The movie is a star-studded affair, with Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia in the cast. Joseph Kosinski, who helmed Top Gun: Maverick, is the director, Ehren Kruger wrote the screenplay and the legendary Hans Zimmer did the score. Every shot in the trailer promises that this is a luxe production, fitting for the huge piles of money that go into developing F1 cars and teams.  F1 has the glossy sheen of a Hollywood sports drama to it. Even though it's a work of fiction, several personalities and teams from the actual Formula 1 teams will appear in the final cut. There's been a surge in filmmaking about this type of car racing, with Netflix also hosting its own documentary series about Formula 1.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/see-brad-pitt-behind-the-wheel-in-the-trailer-for-f1-224420723.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Meta is adding a new incentive to get people to create and share photos and videos on Facebook. The company announced today that creators in Facebook's Content Monetization program can now earn money off people viewing their Facebook Stories. Since you can already easily share photos and videos you post to your Stories, this should be a low-effort way to earn a bit more money off the content you share on Facebook. The ability to earn money on Stories is available globally, according to Meta, though it is based on performance, and Stories need to be public to be monetized. Creators who aren't already in the Content Monetization program can apply to be considered right now on Meta's website.  The new payment option is just Meta's latest attempt to get creators posting content to Facebook instead of Instagram or competing apps. In January, the company debuted a \"breakthrough bonus program\" that offered an extra $5,000 to creators with an existing presence on another social media platform for posting a certain amount of photos and videos to Instagram and Facebook.  The timing of the program made it clear that Meta was interested in luring in creators who would soon lose access to TikTok. The app's temporary rescue by the Trump administration has made the need to leave slightly less urgent, but Meta obviously still wants to benefit from the chaos as much as it can.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-creators-can-now-monetize-their-stories-221139957.html?src=rss",

    "description": "On March 9, older Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices stopped working due to an expired device authentication certificate authority that made them untrusted by Google's apps. While unofficial apps like VLC continue to function, Google's fix will require either updating client apps to bypass the issue or replacing the expired certificates, a process that could take weeks; however, Google has since announced it is beginning a gradual rollout of a fix. The Register reports: Tom Hebb, a former Meta software engineer and Chromecast hacker, has published a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests a fix could take more than a month to prepare. He's also provided workarounds here for folks to try in the meantime. We spoke to Hebb, and he says the problem is this expired device authentication certificate authority. [...] The fix is not simple. It's either going to involve a bit of a hack with updated client apps to accept or workaround the situation, or somehow someone will need to replace all the key pairs shipped with the devices with ones that use a new valid certificate authority. And getting the new keys onto devices will be a pain as, for instance, some have been factory reset and can't be initialized by a Google application because the bundled cert is untrusted, meaning the client software needs to be updated anyway. Given that the product family has been discontinued, teams will need to be pulled together to address this blunder. And it does appear to be a blunder rather than planned or remotely triggered obsolescence; earlier Chromecasts have a longer certificate validity, of 20 years rather than 10. \"Google will either need to put in over a month of effort to build and test a new Chromecast update to renew the expired certificates, or they will have to coordinate internally between what's left of the Chromecast team, the Android team, the Chrome team, the Google Home team, and iOS app developers to push out new releases, which almost always take several days to build and test,\" Hebb explained. \"I expect them to do the latter. A server-side fix is not possible.\" So either a week or so to rush out app-side updates to tackle the problem, or much longer to fix the problem with replaced certs. Polish security researcher Maciej Mensfeld also believes the outage is most likely due to an expired device authentication certificate authority. He's proposed a workaround that has helped some users, at least. Hebb, meanwhile, warns more certificate authority expiry pain is looming, with the Chromecast Ultra and Google Home running out in March next year, and the Google Home Mini in January 2027.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Meta plans to test out X's algorithm for Community Notes to crowdsource fact-checks that will appear across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. In a blog, Meta said the testing in the U.S. would begin March 18, with about 200,000 potential contributors already signed up. Anyone over 18 with a Meta account more than six months old can also join a waitlist of users who will \"gradually\" and \"randomly\" be admitted to write and rate cross-platform notes during initial beta testing. Meta claimed that borrowing X's approach would result in \"less biased\" fact-checking than relying on experts alone. But the social media company will delay publicly posting any notes until it's confident that the system is working. For users of Meta platforms, notes could help flag misleading content overlooked by prior fact-checking efforts. However, Meta confirmed that users will not be allowed to add notes correcting misleading advertisements, which means notes won't help reduce scam ads that The Guardian reported last August have been spreading on Facebook for years. Meta confirmed that the company plans to tweak X's algorithm over time to develop its own version of community notes, which \"may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
