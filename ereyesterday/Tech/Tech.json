    "description": "Google's Pixel 6a has been a winner in many respects, but a new issue with the smartphone's battery may pose a safety concern. After Android Authority reported on a pair of instances where a Pixel 6a battery overheated to the point where the device caught fire, the publication spotted some details in the latest Android 16 beta indicating that as a precaution, the Pixel 6a battery capacity and charging speed will be reduced. In addition, Android Authority received this statement from Google: A subset of Pixel 6a phones will require a mandatory software update to reduce the risk of potential battery overheating. The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles. We’ll contact impacted customers next month, with all the information they need to address the issue. The Pixel 6a is due to receive software support until July 2027, but it's just the latest entry in this device line to have battery problems this year. In January, Google rolled out an update that reduced battery life of the Pixel 4a to increase stability for the 2020 phone model. Then in April, the company launched a program of repairs and payments after some instances of batteries \"swelling\" in the Pixel 7a.

    "description": "Remedy's multiplayer spin on Control is coming to the PlayStation Game Catalog. Sony's June PS Plus additions start with the day-one arrival of FBC: Firebreak. Other entries this month include the latest Battlefield entry and sticky-ball Katamari fun. FBC: Firebreak lets you and up to two others team up to kick some Hiss ass. Play as a government employee who volunteered to take out extra-dimensional monsters. But the wicked delights really kick in when you enhance your plain ol' guns with supernatural gear. In our preview, Engadget's Jessica Conditt saw a promising and \"incredibly fun\" shooter that only needed a bit of fine-tuning before launch. \"Firebreak is poised to be a thoughtful and focused entry in the co-op shooter genre, and it's already an inviting extension of Remedy's darkest and silliest sensibilities,\" she wrote. FBC: Firebreak will be available in the Game Catalog on its launch day, June 17. You'll need a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership to claim it. EA Also coming on that date is Battlefield 2042. This could be a good time to catch up on the franchise before its next installment. (It's expected by April 2026.) Also arriving this month is We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. Who doesn't love rolling a satisfyingly growing blob of random shit? Both of those titles require a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership. Ditto for other June entries like Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 and theHunter: Call of the Wild. Meanwhile, the 2000 classic Deus Ex: The Conspiracy will only be available for Premium subscribers. You can check out the PlayStation blog for the complete list.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fbc-firebreak-headlines-junes-ps-plus-additions-211440207.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A dating site launched last week by Belgian artist Dries Depoorter matches potential partners based on their internet browsing histories rather than curated profiles or photos. Browser Dating requires users to download a Chrome or Firefox extension that exports and uploads their recent search data, creating matches based on shared online behaviors and interests rather than traditional dating app metrics. Less than 1,000 users have signed up since the platform's launch, paying a one-time fee of $10.3 for unlimited matches or using a free tier limited to five connections. Depoorter, known for digital art projects exploring surveillance and technology, says the concept emerged from a 2016 workshop where participants shared a year of search history data. The platform processes browsing data locally using Google's Firebase tools. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Amazon Web Services has signed a long-term deal with Talen Energy to receive up to 1,920 megawatts of carbon-free electricity from the Susquehanna nuclear plant through 2042 to support AWS's AI and cloud operations. The partnership also includes plans to explore new Small Modular Reactors and expand nuclear capacity amid rising U.S. energy demand. Utility Drive reports: Under the PPA, Talen's existing 300-MW co-location arrangement with AWS will shift to a \"front of the meter\" framework that doesn't require Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval, according to Houston-based Talen. The company expects the transition will occur next spring after transmission upgrades are finished. FERC in November rejected an amended interconnection service agreement that would have facilitated expanded power sales to a co-located AWS data center at the Susquehanna plant. The agency is considering potential rules for co-located loads in PJM. Talen expects to earn about $18 billion in revenue over the life of the contract at its full quantity, according to an investor presentation. The contract, which runs through 2042, calls for delivering 840 MW to 1,200 MW in 2029 and 1,680 MW to 1,920 MW in 2032. Talen will act as the retail power supplier to AWS, and PPL Electric Utilities will be responsible for transmission and delivery, the company said. Amazon on Monday said it plans to spend about $20 billion building data centers in Pennsylvania. \"We are making the largest private sector investment in state history -- $20 billion-- to bring 1,250 high-skilled jobs and economic benefits to the state, while also collaborating with Talen Energy to help power our infrastructure with carbon-free energy,\" Kevin Miller, AWS vice president of global data centers, said.

Finnish startup Polar Night Energy recently turned on the so-called sand battery in the municipality of Pornainen, an hour north of Helsinki.  The machine, which uses dirt to store excess renewable energy as heat, will warm the homes and businesses in the town of 5,000 people. It is expected to replace natural gas and oil in Pornainen’s district heating network entirely, slashing emissions by an estimated 70%.   “This project is a powerful example…This story continues at The Next Web",
