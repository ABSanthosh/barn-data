    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/msis-new-claw-gaming-handhelds-have-lunar-lake-processors-and-nondescript-ai-powers-230028563.html?src=rss",
    "description": "MSI has two new versions of the MSI Claw after the original landed with a thud earlier this year. The company’s $900 MSI Claw 8 AI+ and $800 Claw 7 AI+ have Lunar Lake Intel processing, better battery life and quality-of-life improvements like redesigned sticks, bumpers and triggers. The previous model launched “a touch late and a bit too pricey,” according to Engadget’s Sam Rutherford in our review. He said its performance was underwhelming compared to cheaper rivals, its software was too clunky, and it was plagued by an overabundance of optimization updates (presumably because MSI scrambled to fix its long list of problems). We haven’t handled the new models, but their switch to Intel’s latest Core Ultra 7 processor should lead to better performance and lower power consumption — two of the biggest marks against the A1M. The Claw 8 AI+ has an 8-inch (1,920 x 1,200) display, and the Claw 7 AI+ has a 7-inch (1,920 x 1,080) one. Both devices support a 120Hz refresh rate. However, they’re LCD panels; you still won’t find an OLED option here, like in Valve and Lenovo’s alternatives. It... floats, too? MSI The Claw 8 has an 80Wh battery, while the 7-inch model has a 54.5Wh battery. It uses MSI’s Cooler Boost HyperFlow tech, which includes dual fans and heat pipes. The company claims it outperforms “competitors” (without stating which) when running at a power-efficient 17W. Each handheld has a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, so you could plug the handheld into a monitor and use it as a makeshift Windows PC. They even have CoPilot+ support built-in. MSI redesigned the new generation’s joysticks, bumpers, D-pad and triggers for this generation. Although the last model had Hall effect sticks, the new ones also have it in their triggers. Ergonomics were a rare highlight in the previous model, and MSI touts the new handhelds as being “tailored to fit the natural contours of the hand.” As for the AI in the handheld’s branding, MSI presumably refers to the XeSS upscaling tech in the Intel chip. However, the previous model also used XeSS, so maybe the company just wanted to scream to customers and investors that it uses AI. The new handhelds arrive on December 25. GameRant notes that their pre-order pages are listed without available stock (yet). Regardless, once you can buy them, the Claw 7 AI+ costs $800, and the Claw 8 AI+ will set you back $900.

    "description": "Meta has confirmed its plans to use nuclear power to fuel US data centers. The company announced that it’s accepting proposals from nuclear energy developers to work on the project, with the goal of adding between one and four gigawatts of nuclear energy capacity “starting in the early 2030s.” The company’s request for proposals states that Meta is seeking partners that have experience with “either Small Modular Reactors (SMR) or larger nuclear reactors.” Axios reports that the company is “geographically agnostic” about the location of potential nuclear sites. The company previously had plans to build a nuclear-powered data center, The Financial Times reported earlier this year, but the plans were scuttled after the discovery of a rare species of bees near the site. “As new innovations bring impactful technological advancements across sectors and support economic growth, we believe that nuclear energy can help provide firm, baseload power to support the growth needs of the electric grids that power both our data centers (the physical infrastructure on which Meta’s platforms operate) as well as the communities around them,” the company wrote in a statement. Meta isn’t the only major tech company looking to nuclear power to help power its AI ambitions. Google recently announced a deal to build multiple reactors in the US, with the goal of adding 500 megawatts of nuclear power from SMRs. Microsoft also said this year it wants to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania to fuel its AI development.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-wants-to-use-nuclear-power-for-its-data-centers-225051671.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Intel's board of directors ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger after losing confidence in his ambitious turnaround strategy. The move comes as Intel posted significant losses, including $16.6 billion in Q3 2024, its worst quarterly result ever. Under Gelsinger's leadership, Intel struggled to compete in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia, while facing manufacturing challenges and declining data center revenue. Analysts suggest the board may be considering splitting off Intel's foundry business, though such a move could face scrutiny from the U.S. Commerce Department due to $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. The Verge adds: But Moorhead and Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin both believe Gelsinger's departure was so sudden, it can't simply have been the straw that broke the camel's back. \"There must have been a decision the board made that he was not going to stick around for,\" Moorhead tells me. His hunch: Intel's board may want to split off its foundry business entirely, above and beyond the spinoff that Gelsinger already announced, turning Intel into a company that simply designs chips like its direct rivals.

    "description": "Amsterdam-headquartered Nebius, which builds full-stack AI infrastructure for tech firms, has secured $700mn in a private equity deal led by Nvidia, Accel, and asset manager Orbis.  The funding comes in the form of a private placement — when a company sells stocks directly to a private investor instead of on the public market.

The remainder comes from an insurance payout, the startup said.  The funding will propel the launch of two new satellites in its HotSat constellation, which are scheduled to liftoff next year. The probes — HotSat-2 and HotSat-3 — will replace HotSat-1, SatVu’s first satellite, launched in 2023.  When HotSat-1 launched it was fitted with the…This story continues at The Next Web",
