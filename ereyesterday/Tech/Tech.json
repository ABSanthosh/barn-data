    "description": "Bungie finally took the wraps off its upcoming team-based extraction shooter, Marathon, sharing a look at gameplay and a cinematic short during its showcase this weekend. We also now know the release date: September 23. Marathon will be available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, and support full cross play and cross save. Marathon, a reboot of Bungie’s 30-year-old FPS series, was first announced back in 2023, and we’ve heard little more about it until now. Now, Bungie says: In Marathon, players inhabit a Runner, a cybernetic mercenary scouring the remains of a lost colony of Tau Ceti IV for fortune and power. Players team up in crews of three as they battle rival Runner teams and hostile security forces for weapons and upgrades. Survive and everything they’ve scavenged is theirs to keep for future runs on Tau Ceti IV — or if they’re brave enough, a journey to the derelict Marathon ship that hangs above. If you missed the live Gameplay Reveal Showcase on Saturday, you can catch up on all the highlights now on Bungie’s website and the official Discord. The team says there will be a “fairly small” Closed Alpha Test from April 23 to May 4, ahead of bigger tests leading up to the release in September.

    "description": "Apple is said to be readying some big improvements for iPadOS that could bring it more in line with macOS. According to Mark Gurman in the Power On newsletter, Apple’s iPadOS 19 will “focus on productivity, multitasking and app window management — with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac.” It won’t quite be macOS for iPad, but Gurman notes that “the changes will likely go far enough” to please those users who are looking to get more out of the tablet’s software.  It's expected to arrive later this year. Chances are we'll hear all about it at WWDC 2025, which Apple has set for the second week of June. This year is rumored to be bringing some major changes to iOS and macOS as well, as Gurman previously reported. It all reportedly comes as part of Apple’s push to make its software look more consistent across its devices.

    "description": "Stanford law school graduate Peter Thiel later co-founded Facebook, PayPal, and Palantir. But in 2010 Thiel also created the Thiel Fellowship, which annually gives 20 to 30 people under the age of 23 $100,000 \"to encourage students to not stick around college.\" (College students must drop out in order to accept the fellowship.) And now Palantir \"is taking a similar approach as it maneuvers to attract new talent,\" reports financial news site The Street: The company has launched what it refers to as the \"Meritocracy Fellowship,\" a four-month internship program for recent high school graduates who have not enrolled in college. The position pays roughly $5,400 per month, more than plenty of post-college internship programs. Palantir's job posting suggests that the company is especially interested in candidates with experience in programming and statistical analysis. Palantir's job listing specifically says they launched their four-month fellowship \"in response to the shortcomings of university admissions,\" promising it would be based \"solely on merit and academic excellence\" (requiring an SAT score over 1459 or an ACT score above 32.) \"Opaque admissions standards at many American universities have displaced meritocracy and excellence...\" As a result, qualified students are being denied an education based on subjective and shallow criteria. Absent meritocracy, campuses have become breeding grounds for extremism and chaos... Skip the debt. Skip the indoctrination. Get the Palantir Degree... Upon successful completion of the Meritocracy Fellowship, fellows that have excelled during their time at Palantir will be given the opportunity to interview for full-time employment at Palantir.
