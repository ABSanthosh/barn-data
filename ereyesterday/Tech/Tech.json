    "description": "We’re coming up on the 10-year anniversary of Undertale’s release, and to mark the occasion, a 25-piece orchestra will perform the game’s soundtrack for a one-night-only concert at London's Eventim Apollo this summer. The event, dubbed The Determination Symphony, will be held on June 22, and tickets are on sale now. The Determination Symphony is described as “a musical journey from your initial fall at Mount Ebott, leading you through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Forest, Temmie Village and so much more.” Attendees (who I’m deeply envious of) will be able to watch all of that on screen while the orchestra makes its way through arrangements of the soundtrack. It’s hard to believe that Toby Fox’s Undertale is already 10 years old, but its enduring popularity just speaks to the impact it’s had on so many who have played it. We may not all get to experience the orchestral rendition, but at least we'll always have the original soundtrack.

    "description": "The Nintendo Direct livestream on Thursday brought some unexpected news for Tamagotchi fans: the Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop game series of the early 2000s is being resurrected with a new entry, Tamagotchi Plaza. But it seems the announcement trailer left out the best part. As spotted by Tama-Palace, Bandai Namco says on the game’s official website that Tamagotchi Plaza will be compatible with the Tamagotchi Uni. Players will be able to link their Uni devices to the game to access special perks — kind of like how the beloved, defunct TamaTown worked. Tamagotchi Plaza comes out on June 27. In Tamagotchi Plaza, players will act as shopkeepers and help get the town ready for the big Tamagotchi festival. Some shops will include the option for local two-player. As for connecting your Uni, Bandai says: Tamagotchi Plaza features a linkage function with the Tamagotchi Uni. For the first time, players can connect with the latest toy model, the Tamagotchi Uni. By linking the Tamagotchi Uni, they will gain access to exclusive items, special events, and unique conversations not available in the base game, while supplies last. Considering the Tamagotchi Uni is nearing two years old now, anything that will inject some newness into the experience is welcome. For anyone who grew bored of the Uni and has been neglecting it, Tamagotchi Plaza seems like a pretty compelling reason to dust it off and get playing again. Of course, you don't need a Uni device to play; it has enough appeal on its own as a super cozy game that'll tug at franchise fans' nostalgia. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-new-tamagotchi-game-for-nintendo-switch-will-connect-with-tamagotchi-uni-160639100.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Though it's stock price is still up 200% from its IPO in March of 2024 — last week Reddit's stock had dropped nearly 50% since February 7th. And then this week, it dropped another 10%, reports Bloomberg, citing both the phenomenon of \"volatile technology stocks under pressure\" — but also specifically \"the gloomy sentiment around Reddit...\" The social media platform has struggled to recover since an earnings report in February showed that it is failing to keep up with larger digital advertising peers such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which have higher user figures. Reddit's outlook seemed precarious because its U.S. traffic took a hit from a change in Google's search algorithm. In recent weeks, the short interest in Reddit — a proxy for the volume of bets against the company — has ticked up, and forecasts for the company's share price have fallen. One analyst opened coverage of Reddit this month with a recommendation that investors sell the shares, in part due to the company's heavy reliance on Google. Reddit shares fell more than 5% in intraday trading Friday. \"It's been super overvalued,\" Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options said of Reddit. \"Their growth rate is very strong, but they still are not making any money.\" Reddit had a GAAP earnings per share loss of $3.33 in 2024, but reported two consecutive quarters of positive GAAP EPS in the second half of the year... At its February peak, Reddit's stock had risen over 500% from the $34 initial public offering price last March. Some of the enthusiasm was due to a series of deals in which Reddit was paid to allow its content to be used for training artificial intelligence models. More recently, though, there have been questions about the long-term growth prospects for the artificial intelligence industry. \"On Wall Street, the average price target from analysts has fallen to about $195 from $207 a month ago,\" the article points out. \"That still offers a roughly $85 upside from where shares closed following Thursday's 8% slump...\" Meanwhile Reuters reported that more than 33,000 U.S. Reddit users experienced disruptions on Thursday according to Downdetector.com. \"A Reddit spokesperson said the outage was due to a bug in a recent update, which has now been fixed.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Automotive historian Dan Albert loves the \"adorable tiny truck\" he's driving. It's one of the small Japan-made \"kei\" pickups and minivans that \"make up about a third of car sales in Japan.\" Americans can legally import older models for less than $10,000, and getting 40 miles per gallon they're \"Cheap to buy and run... rugged, practical, no-frills machines — exactly what the American-built pickup truck used to be.\" But unfortunately, kei buyers face \"bureaucratic roadblocks that states like Massachusetts have erected to keep kei cars and trucks out of the hands of U.S. drivers.\" Several state departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) have balked at registering the imported machines, saying that they're too unsafe for American streets. Owners have responded with a righteous mix of good humor, lobbying and lawsuits... Kei trucks do not meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or FMVSS — the highly specific rules US-market new cars must meet. But since 1988, the Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act has exempted vehicles that are at least 25 years old from these crash safety standards, allowing drivers to bring over vintage European and Asian market models... Getting insurance coverage was the next barrier, as the company that had long been underwriting the Albert family's fleet also rejected me, forcing me to seek out a specialty \"collector car\" insurer. (I did eventually get regular coverage....) Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Virginia, and Michigan also tightened their rules on registering small Japanese imports in recent years. The culprit, according to the auto enthusiast press, was the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the trade organization that serves as the lobbying and policy arm of DMVs across North America. Much of AAMVA's work involves integrating the databases of the 69 US and Canadian motor vehicle jurisdictions who are its members, so that a car stolen in one state can't be titled in another... The kei truck's regulatory troubles can be traced to a 2011 AAMVA report, \"Best Practices Regarding Registration and Titling of Mini-Trucks,\" which called for outright bans and encouraged DMVs to lobby state legislatures to outlaw keis entirely. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety concurred, telling AAMVA that its recommendation did not go far enough: The IIHS said that keis should join the class of conveyances that the U.S. government calls Low Speed Vehicles, which are mechanically limited to 25 miles per hour or less and should be used only for short local trips on low-speed-limit roads because they can't protect occupants in the event of a collision with a regular vehicle... [But] By 2008, Japan's kei trucks did feature crumple zones and driver airbags in compliance with that country's safety standards... Despite its name, the Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act that lets older cars into the US from overseas isn't really about safety: Car industry lobbyists secured passage of the law to protect dealer profits. Newer keis — which are banned — are safer and cleaner than the 25-year-old ones that can be imported now. (Battery-powered keis debuted in 2009.) But even mine has an airbag, front crumple zone, seatbelt pretensioners, and anti-lock brakes. The article notes that kie fans have \"a distinctly libertarian streak... Some owners I've talked to report forging titles, setting up shell companies in Montana and finding other means of skirting DMV rules.\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 for sharing the article.
