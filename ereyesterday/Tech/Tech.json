    "description": "The following article discusses the fifth season of Star Trek: Lower Decks and older Treks. There’s no such thing as “dead” in Star Trek, the sprawling, perpetual opus that has thrived in spite of itself for almost sixty years. What started as a cornball space-ships and punch-fights show for atomic-age kids and their parents has become (gestures around) all this. So I’m not writing too much of an obituary for Star Trek: Lower Decks despite its fifth season being its last. Given Paramount’s fluid leadership right now, I can easily imagine that decision being reversed in the future. So this isn’t so much of a goodbye as a farewell for now. Lower Decks’ fifth season picks up not long after the fourth left off, with Tendi still repaying her debt to the Orions. I don’t think it’s a spoiler to suggest the status-quo reasserts itself soon after given, you know, all the other times this has happened. The crew of the Cerritos is then thrust into the usual sort of high-minded, lowbrow yet full of heart hijinks that we’ve come to expect. Naturally, I’m sworn to secrecy, but the fifth episode — where its title alone is a big spoiler — is a highlight. I’ve seen the first five episodes of the season and as with any sitcom, there are a few misses in between the hits. One episode in particular is trying to reach for an old-school Frasier plotline, but it falls flat given the thinness of the characters in question. Thankfully, Lower Decks is able to carry a weak show on the back of its central cast’s charm. Sadly, as it tries to give everyone a grace note, some characters you’d expect would get more focus are instead shunted to the periphery. You can feel Lower Decks straining against its own premise, too. A show about people on the lowest rung of the ladder can’t get too high. As a corrective, both Mariner and Boimler use this year as an opportunity to mature and grow. I won’t spoil the most glorious running gag of the season, but their growth comes in very different ways. If there’s a downside, it’s that the show still relies too much on energy-sapping action sequences to resolve its episodes. But that’s a minor gripe for a show that grew from the would-be class clown of the Trek world to the most joyful interpretation of its ethos. I’ve always loved how, when the chips are down, Lower Decks delights in the bits plenty of newer Treks would rather ignore. The show is, and has been, a delight to watch and something for the rest of the franchise to aspire toward. Paramount+ I’ve been looking for a way to describe Lower Decks’ target audience for years, but only now has it hit me. It’s a show written by, and for, the people who grew up watching Star Trek in the VHS era. Creator Mike McMahan is just four years older than me, barely a teenager when The Next Generation went off-air. So while he’d have encountered Deep Space Nine and Voyager as first-run, everything else would have been discovered through re-runs and tapes. You can almost track that timeline of discovery as Lower Decks broadened its range of hat-tips each year it ran. Of course we got a parody of the first two Trek films in the first season — both were ever-present on Saturday afternoon TV when I was a kid — but it’s not until the third that we get a nod to First Contact. As Enterprise ran out of gas, you can feel McMahan and co’s delving into the behind-the-scenes lore and convention gossip about those later series. If you’ve seen the series five trailer, you’ll spot the gag about Harry Kim’s promotion, something the character never got on Voyager. If you’re fluent with Trek’s behind-the-scenes drama you’ll know the handful of reasons why, and why it’s funny to nod toward that now. But that’s not the only subtle gag that points a sharpened elbow into the ribs of major figures from the series creative team. I’m sure if you don’t spot them all, Reddit will have assembled a master list half an hour after each episode lands on Paramount+. Paramount+ I won’t indulge in theorizing as to why a popular and successful show like Lower Decks is ending (it’s money, it’s always money). But, as we’ve seen countless times before, it’s not as if it’s hard to revive a successful animated show when wiser heads prevail. Hell, even McMahan told TrekMovie he’s prepared for that, and even has some spin-off ideas in the works. But for now, let’s raise a toast to Lower Decks, the animated sitcom that became the cornerstone of modern Star Trek. The first two episodes of Star Trek: Lower Decks season five will arrive on Paramount+, Thursday, October 24, with an additional episode landing each week for the successive eight weeks. The series and season finale will air on December 19.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/star-trek-lower-decks-bows-out-on-business-as-usual-200017641.html?src=rss",

    "description": "DJI has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Defense over its addition to the Pentagon list that designates it as a \"Chinese military company.\" In its filing, shared by The Verge, the company said it's challenging the designation because it's \"neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military.\" It described itself as the \"largest privately owned seller of consumer and commercial drones,\" mostly used by first responders, fire and police departments, businesses and hobbyists.  The company claimed that because the Pentagon has officially proclaimed it as a national security threat, it has suffered \"ongoing financial and reputational harm.\" It also said that it has lost business from both US and internal customers, which terminated contracts and refused to enter new ones, and it has been banned from signing contracts with multiple federal government agencies.  DJI explained that it tried to engage with the Department of Defense for over 16 months and submitted a \"comprehensive delisting petition\" on July 27, 2023 to get the agency to remove its designation. However, the agency allegedly refused to engage in a meaningful way and to explain its reasoning behind adding the company to the list. On January 31, 2024, the DoD redesignated the company without notice, DJI wrote in its complaint. DJI alleged that the DoD only shared its full rationale for its designation after it informed the agency that it was going to \"seek judicial relief.\" The company claimed that the DoD's reasoning wasn't adequate to support its designation, that the agency confused people with common Chinese names and that it relied on \"stale alleged facts and attenuated connections.\" DJI is now asking the court to declare the DoD's actions as unconstitutional, describing the Pentagon's designation and failure to remove it from the \"Chinese military company\" list a violation of the law and of its due-process rights.  DJI has long been at the crosshairs of various US government agencies. The Department of Commerce added it to its entity list in 2020, which prevented US companies from supplying it with parts without a license. A year later, it was added to the Treasury department's \"Chinese military-industrial complex companies\" list for its alleged involvement in the surveillance of Uyghur Muslim people in China. And just a few days ago, DJI confirmed that its latest consumer drones are being held at the border by US customs, which cited the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The drone-maker denied that it has manufacturing facilities in Xinjiang, the region associated with forced Uyghur labor. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/dji-challenges-its-chinese-military-company-pentagon-designation-in-court-120036412.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/10/19/2253239/after-second-power-outage-10-million-cubans-endure-saturday-afternoon-blackout?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "The Miami Herald reports: Cuba's electrical grid shut down again early Saturday, leaving the island without electricity after authorities tried but failed to restore power following an earlier nationwide blackout on Friday. The island's Electric Union reported a second \"total outage\" at 6:15 a.m., just hours after officials reported they had restored power in a few \"microsystems\" all over the island... The country has been going through its worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the government lacks money to buy oil in the international market to meet domestic demand. Cubans irked by the daily blackouts defied the country's Draconian laws punishing criticism of the government and left several comments in official news outlets calling for government officials to resign. The second outage will likely exacerbate public frustration as food begins to spoil because of the lack of refrigeration. Two hours ago, Reuters reported that Cuba's government \"said on Saturday it had made some progress in gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals and parts of the capital Havana...\" \"Most of Cuba's 10 million people, however, remained without electricity on Saturday afternoon.\" Traffic lights were dark at intersections throughout Havana, and most commerce was halted... Cuban officials have said even if the immediate grid collapse is resolved, the electricity crisis will continue. Cuba produces little of its own crude oil, and fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba. Mexico experienced a historic drop in production, according to the New York Times, while Venezuela is selling its oil to foreign companies to ease its own economic crisis: The experts had warned for years: Cuba's power grid was on the verge of collapse, relying on plants nearly a half-century old and importing fuel that the cash strapped Communist government could barely afford... Cuban economists and foreign analysts blamed the crisis on several factors: the government's failure to tackle the island's aging infrastructure; the decline in fuel supplies from Venezuela, Mexico and Russia; and a lack of capital investment in badly needed renewable systems, such as wind and solar. Jorge Piñon, a Cuban-born energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin, highlighted that Cuba's electricity grid relies on eight very large power plants that are close to 50 years old. \"They have not received any operational maintenance much less capital maintenance in the last 12 to 15 years,\" he said, adding that they have a lifetime of only 25-30 years. \"So, number one, it's a structural problem, they are breaking down all the time and that has a domino effect,\" he said. Compounding the problems, Cuba burns crude oil as a fuel for its plants. Experts said Cuba's own crude oil production is very heavy in sulfur and metals that can impair the thermoelectric combustion process. \"So they have to be constantly repairing them, and they're repairing them with Band-Aids,\" said Mr. Piñon... \"If they can't turn these plants back on there is a concern that this could turn into another mass exodus,\" said Ricardo Herrero, the director of the Cuba Study Group in Washington. \"They are really short on options,\" he added.

    "description": "An anonymous readed shared this report from CNN: [U.S. army boats] are poorly maintained and largely unprepared to meet the military's growing mission in the Pacific, a new government oversight report said this week. The Government Accountability Office released a report on Wednesday that concluded there are \"wide-ranging\" issues facing Army watercraft, which limit the Army's ability \"to meet mission requirements in the Indo-Pacific theater where the need for Army watercraft is most pronounced.\" Despite Army policy requiring the vessels to be at least at a 90% mission capable rate — meaning the vessels are ready to perform their mission — the boats currently have a less than 40% capable rate this year. Overall, the fleet of watercraft has dropped by nearly half since 2018, going from 134 vessels to 70 as of May this year, in part due to divestment of vessels in 2018 and 2019... \"Army boats have not been ready, capable, or in a mindset they'll have to do something dangerous or in the real world ... for decades now,\" a retired warrant officer and former chief engineer on Army watercraft told CNN at the time... [Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith] said that the Army is \"actively\" working to address gaps in the watercraft's capability as a whole, and prioritizing improving the current fleet while also \"investing in a modernized fleet to meet the needs of the 2040 force.\" Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, told CNN that the Army is also looking at possibly replacing the existing fleet of Army watercraft with autonomous vessels in the future. \"What we see is the oil industry and other shipping industries are doing this already, we see that happening all around the world,\" Butler said. \"There's no reason the Army shouldn't be thinking that way ... leaders from down at ship level all the way to the Pentagon are looking at this and determining the best way to deploy our forces... \"Maybe the future fleet is all autonomous, we just don't know,\" he said. \"This is all stuff we're looking at in terms of trying to modernize the way we move people, weapons, and equipment.\" CNN notes that the report \"also said the Army is considering leasing civilian watercraft to bolster its existing fleet and moving all of its watercraft to the Pacific.\" The report also included a response from Army Secretary Wormuth, who said the Army is \"actively pursuing a holistic approach to mitigate the gaps in Army watercraft capability and capacity.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
