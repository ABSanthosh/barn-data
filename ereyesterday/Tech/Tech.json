    "description": "The Caesars Superdome will host Super Bowl LXI on Sunday, February 9. Here's how to tune in to the big game! (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) Chris Graythen via Getty Images The weekend has started, and before it's over, we'll have a new NFL champion — but will it be the Kansas City Chiefs with an unprecedented third win in a row, or the Philadelphia Eagles? If that roster sounds familiar, it's because it's a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, where the Chiefs edged out the Eagles 38-35. The NFC champion Eagles are hungry for revenge, but the defending champion Chiefs are looking to make history.  The kickoff for Super Bowl LIX will be this Sunday, February 9 at 6:30PM ET at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA — the eighth time the venue has hosted the big game. The 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show will feature Kendrick Lamar, riding high on the five new Grammys he snagged just last Sunday, as well as SZA. Will Taylor Swift be there to cheer on beau Travis Kelce? The odds are currently yes. But she'll likely be splitting camera time with President Trump, who is also slated to attend the game in person.   The championship game will be broadcast nationally on Fox this year and will be available on platforms like DirecTV Stream and Fubo. Looking for a free way to tune in? The Super Bowl will also be livestreamed on Tubi — in 4K, no less! Here’s everything you need to know about how to watch the Super Bowl. When is Super Bowl LIX? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9. What time does the Super Bowl start? Super Bowl LIX kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT. How to watch the Super Bowl live Super Bowl LIX will air nationally on Fox and stream live on Tubi. How to stream the Super Bowl for free this year Tubi will be livestreaming Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl this year — the first time the free platform has done so. It will also be available in the Fox Sports app on mobile platforms. Beyond that, you can also sign up for free trials of DirecTV Stream, Fubo, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each of which carry Fox in most locations. Two important caveats: Verify that your locality includes a Fox stream by inputting your ZIP code on their respective sites. And if you don't want to pay, make sure you cancel before the trial subscription ends — they can be as short as three days, so plan ahead. How to watch the 2025 Super Bowl without cable The Tubi option above is the easiest go-to starting point for free Super Bowl streaming — but no one knows how the service will hold up under what's certain to be its most intensive influx of concurrent users. There are plenty of worthwhile backups, each of which offer more comprehensive options for cordcutters beyond the game itself — say, watching SportsCenter on ESPN before or after the game. And most of our picks for best live TV streaming services offer free trials, so you can check them out risk-free. If you time it right, your free trial can include the Super Bowl broadcast, too.  Where is the 2025 Super Bowl? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The venue has been host to seven previous Super Bowl games. Who is performing in the Super Bowl 59 halftime show? Kendrick Lamar is headlining Super Bowl LIX, with a guest appearance by SZA. Who is playing in the Super Bowl 2025? AFC champions the Kansas City Chiefs will play NFC champs the Philadelphia Eagles. More ways to watch Super Bowl LIX  Thanks to the wide array of streaming options detailed above, you'll be able to watch the Super Bowl on nearly any current device with a screen. There are plenty of Super Bowl TV deals ahead of the game if you need to upgrade that aging 40-inch screen with the dead pixels in the corner. Live close to a broadcast tower of a Fox station? Attach a good old-fashioned over-the-air antenna (like the Channel Master linked above), and you can get the game for free.  Have a fast Internet connection but don't have access to the latest and greatest streaming apps on your TV? For as little as $25 or less, a new Roku or Fire TV device will ensure that you have all of these apps (including Tubi). See our list of best streaming devices for the full range of options.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/house-democrats-press-mark-zuckerberg-on-metas-policy-changes-235229672.html?src=rss",
    "description": "A group of House Democrats are pushing Mark Zuckerberg on Meta’s recent policy changes, saying they are “deeply concerned” about the company’s move to loosen its content moderation rules, end corporate diversity programs and ditch third-party fact checking. In a letter addressed to the Meta CEO, four members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded details about the sweeping changes Zuckerberg announced last month. “These policy changes, the timing of which gives the inescapable appearance of currying favor with the Trump Administration, are abhorrent, inconsistent, and dangerous,” the lawmakers wrote. Meta so far hasn’t provided many specifics about how it will implement its new policies, which were announced shortly before President Donald Trump took office. The letter asks Zuckerberg to describe how Trump’s “threats of retribution against you” may have influenced the decision to end fact-checking on the platform. It also asks if the Facebook founder has “had discussions with anyone representing the Trump Administration regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Meta.” The letter further notes that Zuckerberg’s recent statements seem to directly contradict previous remarks he made when the Oversight Board was first created. “The Oversight Board, once touted as a beacon of accountability, is rendered toothless when Meta itself refuses to adhere to the principles of ‘trust and safety,’” it says. Lawmakers also questioned Zuckerberg about his public statements that corporations need more \"masculine energy” calling it “particularly strange in light of the fact that Meta’s long time Chief Legal Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer are both women and the three most important committees of your Board of Directors are chaired by women.” Zuckerberg was given a February 21, 2025, deadline to respond. “We don’t have anything further to say beyond all we’ve already communicated over the last weeks,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget when asked about the letter.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/house-democrats-press-mark-zuckerberg-on-metas-policy-changes-235229672.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI says it's investigating after a hacker claimed to have stolen login credentials for 20 million OpenAI accounts and advertised the data for sale on a dark web forum. Though security researchers doubt on the legitimacy of the breach, the AI company stated that it takes the claims seriously, advising users to enable two-factor authentication and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Decrypt reports: Daily Dot reporter Mikael Thalan wrote on X that he found invalid email addresses in the supposed sample data: \"No evidence (suggests) this alleged OpenAI breach is legitimate. At least two addresses were invalid. The user's only other post on the forum is for a stealer log. Thread has since been deleted as well.\" \"We take these claims seriously,\" the spokesperson said, adding: \"We have not seen any evidence that this is connected to a compromise of OpenAI systems to date.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: Hospital Sisters Health System notified over 882,000 patients that an August 2023 cyberattack led to a data breach that exposed their personal and health information. Established in 1875, HSHS works with over 2,200 physicians and has around 12,000 employees. It also operates a network of physician practices and 15 local hospitals across Illinois and Wisconsin, including two children's hospitals. The non-profit healthcare system said in data breach notifications sent to those impacted that the incident was discovered on August 27, 2023, after detecting that the attacker had gained access to HSHS' network. After the security breach, its systems were also impacted by a widespread outage that took down \"virtually all operating systems\" and phone systems across Illinois and Wisconsin hospitals. HSHS also hired external security experts to investigate the attack, assess its impact, and help its IT team restore affected systems. [...] While the incident and the resulting outage have all the signs of a ransomware attack, no ransomware operation has claimed the breach. Following the forensic investigation, HSHS found that the attackers had accessed files on compromised systems between August 16 and August 27, 2023. The information accessed by the threat actors while inside HSHS' systems varies for each impacted individual, and it includes a combination of name, address, date of birth, medical record number, limited treatment information, health insurance information, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number. While HSHS added that there is no evidence that the victims' information has been used in fraud or identity theft attempts, it warned affected individuals to monitor their account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity. The health system also offers those affected by the breach one year of free Equifax credit monitoring. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
