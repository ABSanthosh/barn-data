    "description": "Now you’ve got one less thing you have to fish for in your pocket or purse at the airport. Starting today, Google Wallet can carry a digital copy of your US passport and use them at Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) checkpoints. If you want to add your passport to Google’s virtual wallet, first you’ll need to download the Google Wallet app and log into your account or create one. Check the prompt “create an ID pass with your US passport” and follow the instructions. The app will ask you to take a video selfie to verify your identity and scan the security chip in your passport. It should only take a few minutes for Google to confirm your identity. Your digital passport won’t work at every airport. Currently, there are 27 states (and Puerto Rico) with at least one airport that accepts digital forms of identification. The TSA website can show you which states and airports accept digital IDs. Google has been testing the use and storage of digital passports in Google Wallet for some time. Several states have started accepting digital IDs just in the last few months. New Mexico is the newest state to accept digital IDs including driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/google-wallet-can-now-hold-your-us-passport-215133683.html?src=rss",

    "description": "SpaceX completed its first Starlink direct-to-cell satellite constellation this week. On Wednesday, the company launched 20 satellites aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, 13 of which can communicate directly with cell phones without extra equipment. The completed constellation follows the FCC’s approval of a deal between SpaceX and T-Mobile last week. The companies announced the partnership in 2022, touting plans for a future where phones can be connected to the world even in the middle of the ocean. SpaceX says the satellite constellation acts “like a cellphone tower in space, allowing network integration similar to a standard roaming partner.” On Thursday, SpaceX posted on X that the direct-to-cell satellites will “immediately connect over laser backhaul to the Starlink constellation, eliminate dead zones and provide peace of mind when customers need it most.” The company sent and received its first text messages through T-Mobile’s network early this year. The low-earth-orbit constellation has 6,799 operational satellites, and Space.com reports that about 330 can communicate directly with cell phones. On Thursday, Elon Musk said unmodified cell phones would enjoy a bandwidth of around 10Mbps per beam. He said future constellations will be capable of much greater throughput. The companies will presumably go into more detail for consumers once Starlink Direct to Cell is available. It’s currently targeted for next year. However, the constellation isn’t locked into T-Mobile alone. Android Central reports that SpaceX senior director Ben Longmier said shortly after the deployment that the satellites are “open for business for any teleco in the world.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-completes-starlinks-first-direct-to-cell-constellation-212549713.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu,\" reports the Associated Press, \"to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.\" Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states — California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Officials said the move is aimed at \"containing and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states. \"This will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus' spread nationwide,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink... At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.

    "description": "Nuclear rods are traditionally clad in metal. But a U.S. energy company wants to develop a better, safer alternative that instead uses silicon carbide composites. Working with America's Energy Department, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems just completed a 120-day irradiation testing period simulating the intense radiation and extreme temperatures (3,452F) of a pressurized water reactor in a real-world nuclear power plant. And the tests \"showed no significant mass change, indicating promising performance,\" the company said in a statement. \"This indicates that the SiGA cladding is exceptionally resistant to the damaging effects of radiation.\" Long-time Slashdot reader fahrbot-bot shared this report from the Interesting Engineering blog: \"This success is a key milestone on SiGA cladding's development path to enhance the safety of the existing U.S. fleet of light water reactors,\" added Scott Forney, president of GA-EMS. \"It could also do the same for the future generation of advanced nuclear power systems.\" This advanced material offers significant advantages over traditional metal cladding. It can withstand temperatures up to 1900 degreesC (3452 degreesF), far exceeding the limits of current materials. This enhanced heat resistance is crucial for improving safety margins in nuclear reactors. Moreover, the company claims that in case of any accident, SiGA cladding is designed to maintain its integrity at temperatures where traditional cladding might fail. This could prevent the release of radioactive materials and significantly improve overall reactor safety. Furthermore, SiGA cladding offers performance benefits. It enables higher power operation and longer fuel lifetimes. This translates to increased efficiency and reduced costs for nuclear power plants... The design, safety, and installation of new nuclear reactors have been a prime subject for research. Recently, France-based Newcleo applied to the United Kingdom's Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to enter its lead-cooled small modular reactor for generating fission energy in the generic design assessment phase. Newcleo's SMR can operate at atmospheric pressure, and the company also states that no significant energy release occurs in cases of vessel failure. This also eliminates the need for high-pressure-resistant containment. The article notes that General Atomics's collaboration with the U.S. Energy Department is \"part of the Accident Tolerant Fuel Program, a national effort to improve the safety and performance of nuclear reactors.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
