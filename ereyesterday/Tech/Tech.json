    "description": "Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has only been in his post for a day and already making it clear that the agency will be ignoring the role vehicle pollution plays in worsening climate change. Duffy sent a memo to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calling for a review of fuel economy standards to align with President Donald Trump's goals of promoting the use of oil, natural gas and biofuels. The memo claims that \"artificially high\" fuel economy standards have made new cars prohibitively expensive for US buyers and could negatively impact the US auto industry. It's the latest swing of the pendulum as the country's leadership changes hands once again. Trump's first presidency saw a rollback of fuel efficiency standards that had been enacted by Barack Obama, followed by the EPA introducing its strictest standards to date when Joe Biden assumed office. President Donald Trump's transition team had already signaled in December that he would walk back moves by previous administration to strengthen fuel efficiency standards and promote electric vehicle adoption. Today's development isn't a surprise, but it's still bad news considering multiple international reports have demonstrated that the planet's rising temperature will cause extreme and catastrophic weather events.

    "description": "Meta has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit stemming from the social network‚Äôs decision to suspend Trump's Facebook account following the riots at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.¬† According to The Wall Street Journal, there had been ‚Äúlittle activity‚Äù surrounding the lawsuit until Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg flew to Mar-a-Lago following the election. ‚ÄúToward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of the lawsuit,‚Äù The Journal reports. ‚ÄúThe president signaled that the litigation had to be resolved before Zuckerberg could be ‚Äòbrought into the tent.‚Äô‚Äù Much of the settlement will reportedly go toward funding Trump's presidential library. Settling the lawsuit is the latest step Zuckerberg and Meta have taken to appease Trump, who at one point during the campaign threatened to imprison the Facebook founder for ‚Äúplotting‚Äù against him. Following the election, Zuckerberg ended Meta‚Äôs longtime fact-checking program and rolled back content moderation standards that prohibited dehumanizing language and slurs targeting immigrants and LGBTQ people. He also ended corporate diversity programs and added Trump backer and UFC CEO Dana White to Meta‚Äôs board. Zuckerberg had a prominent seat at Trump‚Äôs inauguration, alongside other tech CEOs. News of Meta‚Äôs settlement broke just as the company released its latest earnings results. During a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that 2025 was ‚Äúgoing to be a big year for redefining our relationship with governments.‚Äù Though he didn‚Äôt mention Trump by name, he said that ‚Äúwe now have a US Administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad.‚Äù Zuckerberg, who earlier this week said the company would spend as much as $65 billion on AI investments this year, predicted that Meta AI would reach 1 billion users in 2025. He also commented on the rise of DeepSeek, an open-source AI assistant from China, saying that it‚Äôs ‚Äústrengthened our conviction‚Äù about open source AI. ‚ÄúOne of the things that we're talking about, is there's going to be an open source standard globally,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I think for own national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard.‚ÄùThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-pay-25-million-to-settle-a-lawsuit-with-donald-trump-over-his-2021-facebook-suspension-234046291.html?src=rss",

    "description": "jjslash shares a report from TechSpot: Atari teamed up with luxury watch brand Nubeo to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Asteroids with a collection of five limited-edition timepieces. Each watch, originally priced at $1,650 but discounted to $499, was limited to 125 pieces -- and they sold out almost immediately. The watches feature a unique Japanese automatic movement, where three rotating discs replace traditional hands. The smallest disc, featuring the classic Asteroids spaceship, acts as the second hand, while the minute and hour hands are represented by asteroid-filled outer discs. While they're not smartwatches, the timepieces feature Swiss Super-LumiNova glow-in-the-dark ink sitting underneath a sapphire lens within a stainless-steel case. They're water resistant up to 21 ATM (atmospheres) and have a screw-down crown, so you can show them off while at the beach or diving. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sony's game publishing arm has done a 180-degree turn on a controversial policy of requiring PC players to sign in with PlayStation accounts for some games, according to a blog post by the company. A PlayStation account will \"become optional\" for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. Sony hasn't lost hope that players will still go ahead and use a PlayStation account, though, as it's tying several benefits to signing in. Logging in with PlayStation will be required to access trophies, the PlayStation equivalent of achievements. (Steam achievements appear to be supported regardless.) It will also allow friend management, provided you have social contacts on the PlayStation Network. Additionally, Sony is providing some small in-game rewards to each title that are available if you log in with its account system. You'll get early unlocks of the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit in Spider-Man 2, for example -- or the Nora Valiant outfit in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Some of these rewards are available via other means within the games, such as the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos in Ragnarok. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
