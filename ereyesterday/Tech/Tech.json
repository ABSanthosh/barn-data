    "description": "The Caesars Superdome will host Super Bowl LXI on Sunday, February 9. Here's how to tune in to the big game! (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) Chris Graythen via Getty Images Super Bowl LIX is less than a week away, and the hype is building for the NFL's final game of the season. The NFC champions the Philadelphia Eagles will face AFC champs — and two-time defending Super Bowl winners — the Kansas City Chiefs. If that roster sounds familiar, it's because it's a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, where the Chiefs edged out the Eagles 38-35. Will the Eagles get their revenge this year, or will the Chiefs go where no NFL team has gone before: an unprecedented three straight Super Bowl wins?  We'll find out on Sunday, Feb. 9 at 6:30PM ET, when the Super Bowl LIX kickoff happens. The game will be played at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA — the eighth time the venue has hosted the big game. The 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show will feature Kendrick Lamar, who recently confirmed that SZA will be joining him. The championship game will be broadcast nationally on Fox this year and will be available on platforms like DirecTV Stream and Fubo. Looking for a free way to tune in? The Super Bowl will also be livestreamed on Tubi — in 4K, no less! Here’s everything you need to know about how to watch the Super Bowl. When is Super Bowl LIX? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9. What time does the Super Bowl start? Super Bowl LIX kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT. How to watch the Super Bowl live Super Bowl LIX will air nationally on Fox and stream live on Tubi. How to stream the Super Bowl for free this year Tubi will be livestreaming Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl this year — the first time the free platform has done so. It will also be available in the Fox Sports app on mobile platforms. Beyond that, you can also sign up for free trials of DirecTV Stream, Fubo, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each of which carry Fox in most locations. Two important caveats: Verify that your locality includes a Fox stream by inputting your ZIP code on their respective sites. And if you don't want to pay, make sure you cancel before the trial subscription ends — they can be as short as three days, so plan ahead. How to watch the 2025 Super Bowl without cable The Tubi option above is the easiest go-to starting point for free Super Bowl streaming — but no one knows how the service will hold up under what's certain to be its most intensive influx of concurrent users. There are plenty of worthwhile backups, each of which offer more comprehensive options for cordcutters beyond the game itself — say, watching SportsCenter on ESPN before or after the game. And most of our picks for best live TV streaming services offer free trials, so you can check them out risk-free. If you time it right, your free trial can include the Super Bowl broadcast, too.  Where is the 2025 Super Bowl? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The venue has been host to seven previous Super Bowl games. Who is performing in the Super Bowl 59 halftime show? Kendrick Lamar is headlining Super Bowl LIX, with a guest appearance by SZA. Who is playing in the Super Bowl 2025? AFC champions the Kansas City Chiefs will play NFC champs the Philadelphia Eagles. More ways to watch Super Bowl LIX  Thanks to the wide array of streaming options detailed above, you'll be able to watch the Super Bowl on nearly any current device with a screen. There are plenty of Super Bowl TV deals ahead of the game if you need to upgrade that aging 40-inch screen with the dead pixels in the corner. Live close to a broadcast tower of a Fox station? Attach a good old-fashioned over-the-air antenna (like the Channel Master linked above), and you can get the game for free.  Have a fast Internet connection but don't have access to the latest and greatest streaming apps on your TV? For as little as $40 or less, a new Roku or Fire TV device will ensure that you have all of these apps (including Tubi). See our list of best streaming devices for the full range of options.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/super-bowl-2025-watch-the-chiefs-vs-eagles-on-sunday-february-9-214817982.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI announced on X that it’s hosting a livestream from Tokyo tonight, offering no more context beyond, “Deep Research.” (Didn't Google already take that name for Gemini?) The stream is scheduled for 7PM ET (4PM PT/ 9AM JST). You can watch it on YouTube below. Just a few days ago, OpenAI released its new reasoning model, o3-mini. The company says it produces “more accurate and clearer answers, with stronger reasoning abilities” than its predecessor, and “works with search to find up-to-date answers with links to relevant web sources.” CEO Sam Altman and other members of the OpenAI team held an AMA on Reddit on Friday to talk about it. And a week before that, OpenAI introduced its new Operator tool, a “Computer-Using Agent” that it said “can go to the web to perform tasks for you.”  Deep ResearchLive from Tokyo4pm PT / 9am JSTStay tuned for link to livestream.— OpenAI (@OpenAI) February 2, 2025 At the same time, we've seen the sudden rise of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI assistant app that was released at the end of January and spiked in popularity on app stores last week. Following all the initial hype, a report from the Wall Street Journal said OpenAI is investigating whether its models were used to train DeepSeek.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-announces-surprise-deep-research-stream-tonight-220708906.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Just three hours ago, OpenAI made a surprise announcement to their 3.9 million followers on X.com. \"Live from Tokyo,\" they'd be livestreaming... something. Their description of the event was just two words. \"Deep Research\" UPDATE: The stream has begun, and it's about OpenAI's next \"agent-ic offering\". (\"OpenAI cares about agents because we believe they're going to transform knowlege work...\") \"We're introducing a capability called Deep Research... a model that does multi-step research. It discovers content, it synthesizes content, and it reasons about this content.\" It even asks \"clarifying\" questions to your prompt to make sure its multi-step research stays on track. Deep Research will be launching in ChatGPT Pro later today, rolling out into other OpenAI products... And OpenAI's site now has an \"Introducing Deep Research\" page. Its official description? \"An agent that uses reasoning to synthesize large amounts of online information and complete multi-step research tasks for you. Available to Pro users today, Plus and Team next.\" Before the livestream began, X.com users shared their reactions to the coming announcement: \"It's like DeepSeek, but cleaner\" \"Deep do do if things don't work out\" \"Live from Tokyo? Hope this research includes the secret to waking up early!\" \"Stop trying, we don't trust u\" But one X.com user had presciently pointed out OpenAI has used the phrase \"deep research\" before. In July of 2024, Reuters reported on internal documentation (confirmed with \"a person familiar with the matter\") code-named \"Strawberry\" which suggested OpenAI was working on \"human-like reasoning skills.\" How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said. The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company's AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms \"deep research,\" according to the source. This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers. Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: \"We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time.\" The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry. The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough... OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models' reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialized way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets. Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence... OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this year that in AI \"the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Similar to online AI detector tools, the add-on can analyse text (of 32 words or more) to identify patterns, traits, and tells common in AI generated or manipulated text. It uses Mozilla's proprietary ApolloDFT engine and a set of open-source detection models. But unlike some tools, Mozilla's Fakespot Deepfake Detector browser extension is free to use, does not require a signup, nor an app download. \"After installing the extension, it is simple to highlight any text online and request an instant analysis. Our Detector will tell you right away if the words are likely to be written by a human or if they show AI patterns,\" Mozilla says. Fakespot, acquired by Mozilla in 2023, is best known for its fake product review detection tool which grades user-submitted reviews left on online shopping sites. Mozilla is now expanding the use of Fakespot's AI tech to cover other kinds of online content. At present, Mozilla's Fakespot Deepfake Detector only works with highlighted text on websites but the company says it image and video analysis is planned for the future. The Fakespot web site will also analyze the reviews on any product-listing pages if you paste in its URL. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "A German startup plans to jumpstart European EVs with an AI-powered brain. Sphere Energy built the system to simulate battery behaviour. The company then predicts a power source’s lifetime in numerous scenarios, from driving styles to temperatures on the road.  According to Sphere, the insights shrink the battery testing cycle by at least a year. Developing a car, meanwhile, could be completed “at least” twice as quickly. Sphere envisions endless benefits: manufacturers will save millions, car prices will plummet, and innovations will increase at exponential rates. The startup’s co-founder, Lukas Lutz, said the plans are unprecedented. “Nobody right now —…This story continues at The Next Web",

Many assume it’s the tech-savvy — those who understand how AI works — who are most eager to adopt it. Surprisingly, our new research (published in the Journal of Marketing) finds the opposite. People with less knowledge about AI are actually more open to using the technology. We call this difference in adoption propensity the “lower literacy-higher receptivity” link. This link shows up across different groups, settings, and even countries. For instance, our analysis of data from market research company Ipsos…This story continues at The Next Web",
