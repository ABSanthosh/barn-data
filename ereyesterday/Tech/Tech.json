    "description": "Civilization VII is getting a VR port soon, but it’ll be exclusive to Meta’s most recent headsets. Meta, 2K and Firaxis Games announced this weekend that the franchise’s latest entry will be available on Meta Quest 3 and 3S in Spring 2025. Players will have the option to “freely switch” between virtual and mixed reality as they wish. Per the release: In virtual reality, players are transported to an ornate museum as they look out onto a vista personalized to their leader; in mixed reality, the Command Table adapts to its placement in a player's physical space. Detailed dioramas can be viewed in The Archives, a room in your museum dedicated to your gameplay achievements displayed in both virtual and mixed reality. There’s no exact release date or price just yet, but you can wishlist it on the Meta Horizon Store. Civilization VII became available for Advanced Access buyers on PC and consoles a few days ago, and reviews have so far been pretty rough. It opens up for everyone else on February 11.

    "description": "The Caesars Superdome will host Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, February 9. Here's how to tune in to the big game! (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) Chris Graythen via Getty Images The big day has arrived, and Super Bowl LIX is imminent. The Kansas City Chiefs are shooting for an unprecedented (for the NFL) third championship win in a row, while the Philadelphia Eagles are looking to play the spoiler — and avenge their narrow 38-35 loss to the Chiefs in the 2023 Super Bowl. The kickoff for the big game will be today — Sunday, February 9 — at 6:30PM ET at Caesars Superdome. It's the eighth time the storied New Orleans venue has hosted. The Kendrick Lamar, riding high on the five new Grammys he snagged just last Sunday, headlines the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show, where he'll be joined by SZA. Taylor Swift is expected to be at the game to cheer on beau Travis Kelce, but the cameras pointed at the luxury boxes will be splitting time between her and President Trump, who is also slated to attend the game in person.   The championship game will be broadcast nationally on Fox this year and will be available on platforms like DirecTV Stream and Fubo. Looking for a free way to tune in? The Super Bowl will also be livestreamed on Tubi — in 4K, no less!  Here’s everything you need to know about how to watch the Super Bowl. When is Super Bowl LIX? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held today — Sunday, Feb. 9. What time does the Super Bowl start? Super Bowl LIX kicks off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT, but the pregame show is already well underway.  How to watch the Super Bowl live Super Bowl LIX is airing nationally on Fox and streaming live on Tubi. How to stream the Super Bowl for free this year Tubi is livestreaming Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl this year — the first time the free platform has done so. It will also be available in the Fox Sports app on mobile platforms. Beyond that, you can also sign up for free trials of DirecTV Stream, Fubo, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each of which carry Fox in most locations. Two important caveats: Verify that your locality includes a Fox stream by inputting your ZIP code on their respective sites. And make sure to set a reminder to cancel before the trial subscription before you get billed if you don't want to keep these paid services. How to watch the 2025 Super Bowl without cable The Tubi option above is the easiest go-to starting point for free Super Bowl streaming — but no one knows how the service will hold up under what's certain to be its most intensive influx of concurrent users. There are plenty of worthwhile backups, each of which offer more comprehensive options for cordcutters beyond the game itself — say, watching SportsCenter on ESPN before or after the game. And most of our picks for best live TV streaming services offer free trials, so you can check them out risk-free. If you time it right, your free trial can include the Super Bowl broadcast, too.  Where is the 2025 Super Bowl? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The venue has been host to seven previous Super Bowl games. Who is performing in the Super Bowl 59 halftime show? Kendrick Lamar is headlining Super Bowl LIX, with a guest appearance by SZA. Who is playing in the Super Bowl 2025? AFC champions the Kansas City Chiefs will play NFC champs the Philadelphia Eagles. More ways to watch Super Bowl LIX  Thanks to the wide array of streaming options detailed above, you'll be able to watch the Super Bowl on nearly any current device with a screen. There are plenty of Super Bowl TV deals ahead of the game if you need to upgrade that aging 40-inch screen with the dead pixels in the corner. Live close to a broadcast tower of a Fox station? Attach a good old-fashioned over-the-air antenna (like the Channel Master linked above), and you can get the game for free.  Have a fast Internet connection but don't have access to the latest and greatest streaming apps on your TV? For as little as $25 or less, a new Roku or Fire TV device will ensure that you have all of these apps (including Tubi). See our list of best streaming devices for the full range of options.

    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from Fortune: More than 14 million job seekers' applications went completely ignored in a single quarter last year, according to one hiring platform. Now, sites like Greenhouse and LinkedIn are experimenting with new ways to hold companies accountable for making the hiring process so miserable for applicants. Three of the biggest job search sites — LinkedIn, Indeed and Greenhouse — have put tools in place to highlight which companies frequently respond to applicants in a timely manner... According to Greenhouse, half of applicants say they've been ghosted after an interview. Meanwhile, new artificial intelligence tools have made it easier for candidates to play a numbers game, generating tailored resumes for hundreds of roles. But that's led to an increasingly overwhelming flood of applications for companies, making it nearly impossible to process the deluge and respond to every hopeful in a timely manner — let alone find their perfect match... [LinkedIn is] refining its \"job match\" feature that uses AI to see how well qualified a candidate is for a given listing. The feature is designed to help cut down on the flood of applications companies are receiving by nudging users to focus their efforts on jobs where they actually have a good shot at hearing back. That, in theory, should make the hiring process more efficient for both parties... Indeed chose to focus on encouraging employer responsiveness after the issue showed up as the biggest pain point for job seekers in a recent survey. While the platform has issued \"responsive employer\" badges since 2018 to recognize companies that consistently reply to more than half of all messages, it started releasing even more detail in 2023, including labels that share the employer's median response time with candidates... Greenhouse, meanwhile, is testing a set of four badges that would verify an employer meets the platform's respectful, communicative, prepared and fair hiring process standards for a given job posting... For \"communicative,\" they're expected to clear out active candidates on closed jobs and send out rejection emails. LinkedIn is also adding \"responsiveness insights,\" according to the article, which \"show applicants which listings are being actively reviewed by employers. \"It's testing the insights on a small number of job postings before rolling them out sitewide in the coming months.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Fortune remembers that in 2011 Steve Jobs had told author Walter Isaacson that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates would \"be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.\" But The Indendepent notes that in his new memoir Gates does write about two acid trip experiences. (Gates mis-timed his first experiment with LSD, ending up still tripping during a previously-scheduled appointment for dental surgery...) \"Later in the book, Gates recounts another experience with LSD with future Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and some friends... Gates says in the book that it was the fear of damaging his memory that finally persuaded him never to take the drug again.\" He added: \"I smoked pot in high school, but not because it did anything interesting. I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn't succeed, so I gave it up.\" Gates went on to say that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who didn't know about his past drug use, teased him on the subject. \"Steve Jobs once said that he wished I'd take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,\" recalled Gates. \"My response to that was to say, 'Look, I got the wrong batch.' I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him! Because his talents and mine, other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits, they didn't overlap much. He wouldn't know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that... I envy those skills. I'm not in his league.\" Gates added that he was a fan of Michael Pollan's book about psychedelic drugs, How To Change Your Mind, and is intrigued by the idea that they may have therapeutic uses. \"The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating,\" said Gates. \"Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.\" Touring the country, 69-year-old Gates shared more glimpses of his life story: The Harvard Gazette notes that the university didn't offer computer science degrees when Gates attended in 1973. But since Gates already had years of code-writing experience, he \"initially rebuffed any suggestion of taking computer-related coursework... 'It's too easy,' he remembered telling friends.\" \"The naiveté I had that free computing would just be this unadulterated good thing wasn't totally correct even before AI,\" Gates told an audience at the Harvard Book Store. \"And now with AI, I can see that we could shape this in the wrong way.\" Gates \"expressed regret about how he treated another boyhood friend, Paul Allen, the other cofounder of Microsoft, who died in 2018,\" reports the Boston Globe. \"Gates at first took 60 percent ownership of the new software company and then pressured his friend for another 4 percent. 'I feel bad about it in retrospect,' he said. 'That was always a little complicated, and I wish I hadn't pushed....'\" Business Insider adds that according to his memoir, Gates \"eventually gave his additional 4% stake to [Steve] Ballmer to convince him to quit business school for Microsoft. 'He joined in 1980 and became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,' Gates wrote.\" Benzinga writes that Gates has now \"donated $100 billion to charitable causes... Had Gates retained the $100 billion he has donated, his total wealth would be around $264 billion, placing him second on the global wealth rankings behind Elon Musk and ahead of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.\" Gates told the Associated Press \"I am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\" saying Intel is now \"kind of behind\" on both chip design and fabrication. \"They missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don't even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy... I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\" Gates also told the Associated Press that fighting a three-year antitrust case had \"distracted\" Microsoft. \"The area that Google did well in that would not have happened had I not been distracted is Android, where it was a natural thing for me. I was trying, although what I didn't do well enough is provide the operating system for the phone. That was ours for the taking.\" The Dallas News reports that in an on-stage interview in Texas, Mark Cuban closed by asking Gates one question. \"Is the American Dream alive?\" Gates answered: \"It was for me.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
