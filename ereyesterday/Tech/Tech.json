    "description": "The iFixit teardown of the PS5 Pro is here, and while there isn‚Äôt all that much different going on from what we‚Äôve seen with the PS5 and PS5 Slim in terms of repairability, Sony has made one notable change: in the Pro, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get to the CMOS battery. Whereas accessing this battery to replace it in the two previous PS5 models required a fair amount of work due to its placement beneath the main board, iFixit found that it‚Äôs right under the faceplates in the PS5 Pro and nestled behind a hatch that has just one screw. That‚Äôs a nice improvement over the other PS5s, where ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got to take apart almost the whole thing to change [the CMOS battery] out,‚Äù iFixit notes. Other than that, things look pretty familiar. That‚Äôs not to say the PS5 Pro itself doesn‚Äôt have excitement to offer ‚Äî as our reviewers found, the PS5 Pro is an absolute beast of a console when it comes to performance. Less exciting though is its $700 price tag.

    "description": "It‚Äôs been a few years since Apple first introduced the AirTag, and while the tracker has undoubtedly become a useful everyday tool for a lot of buyers, there have also been concerns ‚Äî and a class-action lawsuit ‚Äî over misuses of the device as reports of AirTag stalking have come to light. With all of this in mind, Apple is reportedly building some privacy improvements into its next AirTag. Namely, it‚Äôll be more tamper-proof, Mark Gurman reports in this week‚Äôs Power On newsletter. The second-generation AirTag, which Gurman reports is expected to be released mid-next year, will be made so it‚Äôs more difficult to remove the speaker, he writes. Apple has implemented features to curb unwanted tracking, including sound alerts that will let a person know there‚Äôs an unknown AirTag in their vicinity, but it‚Äôs still relatively easy to remove the speaker, which would make it less noticeable. On top of the privacy tweaks, the new AirTag will also bring upgrades to range and the onboard wireless chip, according to Gurman. But looks-wise, it shouldn‚Äôt be much different from the AirTag we‚Äôre used to.

    "description": "This week Alphabet CEO Sundar Picahi assured investors that their long-term AI focus and investment (and a \"commitment to innovation\") \"are paying off,\" reports the Associated Press. Alphabet's stock has already soared 20% this year, and it's \"still thriving\" as the company \"navigates through a pivotal shift to AI and battles regulators...\" Alphabet earned $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share during the most recent quarter, a 34% increase from a year ago. Revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $88.27 billion... The profits would have been even higher if Google wasn't pouring so much money into building up its AI arsenal in a technological arms race that includes other industry heavyweights Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and rising star OpenAI. The AI investments are the primary reason Google's capital expenditures in the past quarter soared 62% from the same time last year to $13.1 billion. The AI spending will likely stay at roughly the same level during the current October-December period, and the rise even higher next year, according to Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet's chief financial officer. But Ashkenazi also emphasized the Mountain View, California, company will act on cost-cutting opportunities in other areas to help boost profits. Alphabet already has trimmed its payroll from more than 190,000 worldwide employees early last year to about 181,000 workers now. In an example of how AI can perform tasks that once required human brainpower, Pichai said the technology is now writing more than 25% of the company's new computer coding. After the results, investors sent Alphabet's stock price up 5% in extended trading, the article points out. \"Both Alphabet's profit and revenue increased at a brisker pace than industry analysts anticipated, thanks primarily to a moneymaking machine powered by Google's ubiquitous search engine... [Google's digital search-engine ads earned $49.39 billion, 12% more than the same quarter of 2023.] And Google's cloud division is growing at an even more robust rate, thanks to demand for AI services. The cloud division generated $11.35 billion in revenue during the past quarter, a 35% increase from last year.\" And meanwhile over at Microsoft, quarterly sales surged 16% to $65.6 billion, reports the Associated Press. But again, \"the company sought to assure investors its huge spending on artificial intelligence is paying off.\" The company has spent billions of dollars to expand its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology... As a result, AI-related products are now on track to contribute about $10 billion to the company's annual revenue, the \"fastest business in our history to reach this milestone,\" CEO Satya Nadella said on a call with analysts Wednesday. [Though Microsoft \"hasn't yet formally reported revenue specifically from AI products,\" the article notes later, with Microsoft instead saying it's infused AI and Copilot into all its business segments.] Just in the last quarter, Microsoft spent $20 billion \"mostly for its cloud computing and AI needs,\" the article points out. But there's still making plenty of money... The software maker also reported an 11% increase in quarterly profit to $24.7 billion, or $3.30 per share, which beat Wall Street expectations for the July-September period... Leading in sales for the quarter was Microsoft's productivity business segment, which includes its Office suite of email and other workplace products, growing 12% to $28.3 billion. Microsoft's cloud-focused business segment grew 20% from the same time last year to $24.1 billion for the three months ending Sept. 30. Its personal computing business, led by its Windows division, grew 17% to $13.2 billion. A big part of that growth came from Microsoft's Xbox video game business, which was boosted by its purchase of game publishing giant Activision Blizzard a year ago.

    "link": "https://it.slashdot.org/story/24/11/17/2249228/what-happened-when-a-washington-county-tried-a-32-hour-workweek?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "On a small network of islands north of Seattle, Washington, San Juan County just completed its first full year of 32-hour workweeks, reports CNN. And Tuesday the county released a report touting \"a host of positive outcomes ‚Äî from recruiting to retention to employee happiness ‚Äî and a cost savings of more than $975,000 compared to what the county would have paid if it met the union's pay increase demands.\" The county said the 32-hour workweek has attracted a host of new talent: Applications have spiked 85.5% and open positions are being filled 23.75% faster, while more employees are staying in their jobs ‚Äî separation (employees quitting or retiring) dropped by 48%. And 84% of employees said their work-life balance was better. \"This is meeting many of the goals that we set out to do when we implemented it,\" County Manager Jessica Hudson said. said, noting the county is looking for opportunities to expand the initiative... Departments across San Juan County have implemented the 32-hour workweek differently, some staggering staffing to maintain their previous availability to the public while others have shortened schedules to be open just four days a week... \"I tell people, you're not going to see things change from your perspective,\" said Joe Ingman, a park manager in the county. \"Offices are going to stay open, bathrooms are going to get cleaned, grass is going to get mowed.\" His department adjusted schedules to stay staffed seven days a week, and while communication across shifts was an initial hurdle, issues were quickly ironed out. \"It was probably the smoothest summer I've had, and I've been working in parks for over a decade,\" he said, crediting the new schedule as a boon for recruiting. While job postings used to languish unfilled for months, last summer the applicant pool was not only bigger but more qualified, and the two staffers he hired both cited coming to the county because of the 32-hour workweek. \"It's no more cost to the public to work 32 hours ‚Äî but we have better applicants,\" he said. Ingman also said the four-day workweek has done wonders for his job satisfaction; he'd watched colleagues burn out for years, but now sees a path for his own future in the department... County employees have used their extra time off to spend less money on childcare, volunteer in their kids' schools, and contribute to the community... While San Juan County's motivation in adopting a shortened workweek was financial, the benefits its employees cite speak to a larger trend, as workplaces around the country increasingly explore flexible schedules to combat burnout and attract and retain talent. A survey of CEOs this spring found nearly one third of large US companies were looking into solutions like four-day or four-and-a-half-day workweeks... Even without a reduction in total hours, a Gallup poll last year found a third day off would be widely embraced: 77% of US workers said a 4-day, 40-hour workweek would have a positive impact on their wellbeing. One worker shared their thoughts with CNN. \"Life shouldn't be about just working yourself into the ground...\" And they added that \"So far, I feel happy; I feel seen as an employee and as a human, and I feel like it could be a beautiful step forward for other people if we just trust it and try it.\" They even had some advice for other employers. \"Change happens by somebody actually doing the change. The only way we're going to find out if it works is by doing.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
