    "description": "Current Backyard made its CES debut last year with an electric smart grill and griddle, but for 2025, the company is going in a slightly different direction. Looking to cater to the pizza oven craze, the company revealed the Model P Smart Pizza Oven in Las Vegas. As you might expect, the unit is all-electric, but it's certified for use indoors and outside. The \"smart\" portion of the recipe here is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity that provides access to tools in the company's app. The company says the Model P can hit a maximum temperature of 850 degrees Fahrenheit, the level at which a Neapolitan-style pie can cook in two minutes. For comparison, that's the same max heat output as the pricier Ooni Volt 12. Current Backyard explains that the internal design of its electric oven uses an algorithm alongside graphite and calrod elements to ensure uniform heating. The company says this construction also eliminates the need to rotate pizzas during cooking. A cordierite cooking stone assists with the even doneness, especially for crisping up the crust.  The Model P has five cook modes for different styles of pizza and other uses: Neapolitan, New York, thin crust, frozen pizza and a broil function with high and low settings. Inside the company's app, a Pizza Build Calculator offers customized cook time and temperature based on a selected style and ingredients. This tool takes into account the amounts of sauce, cheese and toppings along with the thickness of the dough.  Current Backyard didn't include an exact arrival date in the Model P announcement, but it did say that the pizza oven will cost $599 when it's available for purchase sometime in Q2.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/current-backyard-debuts-the-model-p-smart-pizza-oven-at-ces-2025-010054271.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Concept devices are always tricky. For every one that gets turned into a real product a year later there are a thousand disappointments. Maybe the concept can’t be mass-produced affordably enough to make it viable to the business. Maybe the technology isn’t reliable enough to really make good on the promises its creators made during the glossy launch. And sometimes, it was never anything more than a bit of Kabuki to juice the stock price or lure in some new investors. With that wariness in one hand, we can now examine Withings’ new concept device, Omina, which it says is its vision for the future of health monitoring. It’s a floor mat and smart mirror designed to usurp your bathroom scale and take up way more room in your home. The idea is it’ll offer a “holistic” view of your physical health, demystifying your biological markers as it goes. Withings Climb aboard and you’ll be shown a 3D body model that will visualize the results of whatever metrics it can access. Omina will be able to check your weight, heart health and metabolic health, which will be integrated with any data from your other Withings devices. That includes stats on your activity, sleep health and blood pressure, depending on what you own. Omina “comes” with its own AI voice assistant, offering real-time feedback to help you hit your fitness goals. It’ll also answer questions, offer motivational quotes and guide you through any roadblocks you may find. Plus, it’ll connect with any telemedicine provider that integrates with the system, letting you share your vitals with your physician. Naturally, as a concept device, you won’t be able to buy one now, or potentially ever, but it is described as being “in development.” Withings has, however, pledged that the AI assistant and telemedicine features will arrive on its Health Mate app at some point this year. In the meantime you should probably think about buying a house with a bathroom big enough to accommodate one of these things.

    "description": "\"It's fair to say that by 1995, OS/2 was dead software walking,\" remembers a new article from the Register (which begins with a 1995 Usenet post from Gordon Letwin, Microsoft's lead architect on the OS/2 project). But the real question is why this Microsoft-IBM collaboration on a DOS-replacing operating system ultimately lost out to Windows...? If OS/2 1.0 had been an 80386 OS, and had been able to multitask DOS apps, we think it would have been a big hit.... OS/2's initial 1980s versions were 16-bit products, at IBM's insistence. That is when the war was lost. That is when OS/2 flopped. Because its initial versions were even more crippled than the Deskpro 386... Because OS/2 1.x flopped, Microsoft launched a product that fixed the key weakness of OS/2 1.x. That product was Windows 3, which worked perfectly acceptably on 286 machines, but if you ran the same installed copy on a 32-bit 386 PC, it worked better. Windows 3.0 could use the more sophisticated hardware of a 386 to give better multitasking of the market-dominating DOS apps... IBM's poor planning shaped the PC industry of the 1990s more than Microsoft's successes. Windows 3.0 wasn't great, but it was good enough. It reversed people's perception of Windows after the failures of Windows 1 and Windows 2. Windows 3 achieved what OS/2 had intended to do. It transformed IBM PC compatibles from single-tasking text-only computers into graphical computers, with poor but just about usable multitasking... Soon after Windows 3.0 turned out to be a hit, OS/2 NT was rebranded as Windows NT. Even the most ardent Linux enthusiast must c\\oncede that Windows NT did quite well over three decades. Back in 1995, the Register's author says they'd moved from OS/2 to Windows 95 \"while it was still in beta. \"The UI was far superior, more hardware worked, and Doom ran much better.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"In many instances, there's a catch: flexible work but at lower pay...\" writes Fortune. \"Remote workers are accepting lower salaries in order to achieve remote status. Some are taking as much as 5% to 15% less pay to do so, while other employers are reversing the strategy to entice workers to come to the office at higher salaries...\" Today, nearly half of managers anticipate challenges in meeting candidates' compensation expectations. And when the gap between salary expectation and an offer is too great, many employers are negotiating remote and hybrid work to get candidates to sign on the dotted line, according to Robert Half's recently published 2025 U.S. Hiring Outlook. Some candidates accept 5% to 15% less pay in exchange for getting to work from home, Theresa L. Fesinstine, founder of human resources advisory peoplepower.ai, told Fortune. \"There's this unspoken exchange rate between flexibility and comp, and for some candidates, it's worth a significant trade-off,\" said Fesinstine, who has more than two decades of leadership experience in HR. This is especially true \"for those who value work-life balance or are saving on commute costs.\" There are inherent risks in offering job candidates lower salaries, even if it means getting the chance to work from home. Amy Spurling, founder and CEO of employee benefits reimbursement platform Compt, told Fortune she expects to see a second Great Resignation this year after hiring freezes, benefits cuts, and forced RTO policies in 2023 and 2024. \"If you're trying to lowball remote workers, you're about to face a harsh reality,\" Spurling said. \"2025 is going to be a 'find out' year for companies that thought they could use remote work or other 'perks' to replace competitive compensation and genuine employee support.\" To wit, a 2024 report by PwC forecasts another resignation period with a 28% increase in the number of people who plan to change jobs, compared to 19% during the Great Resignation of 2022... What's more, Fesinstine argues, remote work \"isn't a perk anymore, but rather a standard operating model.\" So attempting to describe remote work as a benefit doesn't sit well with job candidates... On the other hand, Michael Steinitz, senior executive director of professional talent solutions at Robert Half, told Fortune their research shows 76% of job candidates are willing to work fully in-office — in exchange for a higher salary. \"Among those employees, the average raise they would request is about 23%, he said.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Our growing reliance on technology at home and in the workplace has raised the profile of e-waste. This consists of discarded electrical devices including laptops, smartphones, televisions, computer servers, washing machines, medical equipment, games consoles and much more. The amount of e-waste produced this decade could reach as much as 5 million metric tonnes, according to recent research published in Nature. This is around 1,000 times more e-waste than was produced in 2023. According to the study, the boom in artificial intelligence will significantly contribute to this e-waste problem, because AI requires lots of computing power and storage.

    "description": "Businesses are already being radically transformed by artificial intelligence (AI). Tools now exist that offer instantaneous, high-quality results in improving certain operations without the burden of high costs or delays. In fact, generative AI could completely upend the traditional ways that we measure success in business. Generative AI refers to programs that produce high-quality text, images, ideas and even complex software code in response to prompts (questions or instructions) from a user. Applications powered by data-driven algorithms enable users to quickly create high-quality content, redefining traditional measures of success.
