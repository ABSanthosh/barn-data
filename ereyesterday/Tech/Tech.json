    "description": "Documents and workstations at the US Treasury Department were accessed during a cyberattack, The New York Times reports. The attack was linked to a \"China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat actor\" and has been characterized as \"a major cybersecurity incident.\" According to a letter the Treasury Department shared with lawmakers (via TechCrunch), US officials were made aware of the issue on December 8, when BeyondTrust, a third-party software company, shared that a security key used to provide technical support was used to access workstations and unclassified documents.  The Treasury Department said that it has worked with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI to understand the full scope of the breach, but hasn't shared how long files and workstations were accessible or what was actually accessed. Engadget has contacted the US Treasury Department and will update this article once we know more. The cyberattack follows a similarly concerning, but separate breach of US telecom carriers that came to light in October 2024. That cyberattack was perpetrated by a Chinese hacking group referred to as \"Salt Typhoon.\" Attackers gained access to unencrypted SMS messages and call logs of politicians, government officials and others for months before the breach was discovered.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/the-us-treasury-department-says-it-was-hacked-in-a-china-linked-cyberattack-230114104.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Owning a Playdate comes with the perk of already having access to 24 games at no additional cost from the bundled-in Season One — and some pretty good ones to boot. But there are a ton of great games outside the Season One offerings too, for when you’ve finished the whole batch or, for newer players, while you’re waiting for new games between the weekly drops. Here, I’ll highlight some of the best games I’ve played so far from the Playdate Catalog. It’ll mainly be split two ways: games that use the crank and games that don’t. There are also a couple of titles that aren’t quite games, but are worth checking out all the same. Games that use the crank Games that don’t use the crank Comics, visual novels and more Check out our entire Best Games series including the best Nintendo Switch games, the best PS5 games, the best Xbox games, the best PC games and the best free games you can play today.

    "description": "Researchers at Cornell University have developed a set of low-cost VR goggles for lab mice. Called MouseGoggles, the VR headsets will allows scientists to provide immersive virtual environments for the mice while capturing fluorescent images of the rodents' brain activity. Phys.Org reports: The goggles -- which dwarf the tiny mice in size -- were built using low-cost, off-the-shelf components like smartwatch displays and tiny lenses, researchers said. [...] About a decade ago, researchers began rigging up clunky projector screens for mice as a means of creating virtual reality environments, but these devices frequently created so much light and noise that they spoiled experiments, researchers said. \"The more immersive we can make that behavioral task, the more naturalistic of a brain function we're going to be studying,\" senior researcher Chris Schaffer, a professor of biomedical engineering at Cornell, said in a news release. The new VR setup, called MouseGoggles, requires a mouse to stand on a ball-shaped treadmill with its head fixed in place. The headset is attached to its head and held in place with a rod while the mouse skitters about on the treadmill. To see if the headset worked, researchers projected the image of an expanding dark blotch that appeared to be approaching the mice. \"When we tried this kind of a test in the typical VR setup with big screens, the mice did not react at all,\" Isaacson said. \"But almost every single mouse, the first time they see it with the goggles, they jump. They have a huge startle reaction. They really did seem to think they were getting attacked by a looming predator.\" The researchers also examined two key brain regions to make sure the VR images were working properly. Results from the primary visual cortex confirmed that the goggles form sharp, high-contrast images that mice can see, and readings from the hippocampus confirmed that mice are successfully mapping the virtual environment provided them. These VR goggles could be used to help study brain activity that occurs as mammals -- be they mice or men -- move around their environment, potentially giving researchers new insights into disorders like Alzheimer's disease, the study's authors said. The research has been published in the journal Nature Methods. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to delay the upcoming TikTok ban while he works on a \"political resolution.\" In a legal brief (PDF) on Friday, his lawyer said Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" The BBC reports: Trump had met with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last week. In his court filing on Friday, Trump said the case represents \"an unprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national security concerns on the other.\" While the filing said that Trump \"takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute\", it added that pushing back the 19 January deadline would grant Trump \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution\" to the matter without having to resort to the court. [...] Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president. \"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he claimed at a press conference earlier in December, although a majority of young voters backed his opponent, Kamala Harris. \"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that,\" he added. Earlier this month, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to block the ban, saying that the law violates both its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users.

This consists of discarded electrical devices including laptops, smartphones, televisions, computer servers, washing machines, medical equipment, games consoles and much more. The amount of e-waste produced this decade could reach as much as 5 million metric tonnes, according to recent research published in Nature. This is around 1,000 times more e-waste than was produced in 2023. According to the study, the boom in artificial intelligence will significantly contribute to this e-waste problem, because AI requires lots of computing power and storage.

    "description": "Businesses are already being radically transformed by artificial intelligence (AI). Tools now exist that offer instantaneous, high-quality results in improving certain operations without the burden of high costs or delays. In fact, generative AI could completely upend the traditional ways that we measure success in business.
