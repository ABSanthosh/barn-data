    "description": "NASA's Parker Solar Probe made history with the closest-ever approach to the sun last December, and we're finally getting a look at some of the images it captured. The space agency released a timelapse of observations made using Parker's Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) while it passed through the sun's corona (the outer atmosphere) on December 25, 2024, revealing up close how solar wind acts soon after it's released. The probe captured these images at just 3.8 million miles from the solar surface. To put that into perspective, a NASA video explains, \"If Earth and the sun were one foot apart, Parker Solar Probe was about half an inch from the sun.\" The probe got an unprecedented view of solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during the approach, which could be invaluable for our understanding of space weather. \"We are witnessing where space weather threats to Earth begin, with our eyes, not just with models,\" said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. After completing its December flyby, the Parker Solar Probe matched its record distance from the surface in subsequent approaches in March and June. It'll make its next pass on September 15.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/great-grok-is-in-cars-now-too-202153874.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Just a day after the xAI team issued a comprehensive apology and explanation about why its chatbot was spreading antisemitic rhetoric, Tesla updated its software for its cars to include the supposedly fixed Grok. According to Tesla, all new vehicles delivered on or after July 12 will have Grok available in-car. There's no additional subscription cost, but Tesla is limiting Grok's availability to models in the US for now. For older models to run Grok, it requires a Tesla with an AMD processor, the latest software update of 2025.26, and either a stable Wi-Fi connection or Tesla's $9.99 Premium Connectivity subscription. It's worth noting that Grok will simply be an AI chatbot you can ask questions to, but won't be able to interface with the car itself. In other words, Grok can't help you set up directions to your destination, lower the music's volume or control the car's temperature. Instead, it can offer excruciatingly cringe-inducing responses under its \"Unhinged\" personality, as seen in an X post from Tesla. While Tesla has incorporated the chatbot into its newly delivered cars, the company still faces safety concerns with its Full Self-Driving system, which uses mostly cameras and AI. Tesla added that Grok may become available to more of its vehicles with over-the-air software updates in the future, but noted that \"Grok availability is subject to change or end at any time.\" Like when Grok went \"MechaHitler\" only a few days ago and had to be disabled.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/great-grok-is-in-cars-now-too-202153874.html?src=rss",

    "description": "At an Amazon warehouse that employs 3,700 people, hundreds of workers recently lost their job, reports the New York Times. \"They are among thousands of foreign workers across the country who have been swept up in a quiet purge, pushed out of jobs in places where their labor was in high demand and at times won high praise.\" While raids to nab workers in the country without legal permission in fields and Home Depot parking lots have grabbed attention, the job dismissals at the Amazon warehouse are part of the Trump administration's effort to thin the ranks of immigrants who had legal authorization to work... Such dismissals are happening at many of Amazon's more than 1,000 facilities around the country, including in Massachusetts and the warehouse in Staten Island that fills orders for millions of New Yorkers. At one fulfillment center in Florida, hundreds were let go, a person familiar with the site said... \"We're supporting employees impacted by the government's recent changes in immigration policy,\" Richard Rocha, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement. The company has pointed workers to various resources, including outside free or low-cost legal services... The dismissals came with remarkable speed. On May 30, the Supreme Court granted temporary approval for the Trump administration to revoke a program known as \"humanitarian parole,\" which had allowed more than 500,000 migrants feeling political turmoil in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to quickly get work permits if they had a fiscal sponsor... On June 12, the Department of Homeland Security said it had begun notifying enrollees that the program was ending, saying the immigrants had been poorly vetted and undercut American workers... On June 22, Amazon told managers around the country in an email, which was obtained by The New York Times, that it had \"received the first list from D.H.S. identifying impacted Amazon employees\" from the parole program, as well as \"some employees outside of this specific program whose work authorization is similarly affected.\" Amazon let the managers know that the next day, the affected workers would receive push notifications in the employee app about the change. Unless the workers could provide alternate work authorization documents in the next five days, they would be suspended without pay and ultimately dismissed. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Brian Witten, VP/CSO of automotive technology supplier Aptiv, warns that \"While seven to 10 years may sound like a long way off, preparation for quantum threats must begin now, not once they have already materialized.\" Organizations need time to implement post-quantum cryptography (PQC) transition plans methodically — and that applies both to anyone with an IT infrastructure and to anyone building software-defined systems. \"Current encryption, such as RSA and ECC [elliptic curve cryptography], will become obsolete once quantum computing matures,\" said Cigent cofounder John Benkert. \"Management often assumes cybersecurity threats are only present-day problems. But this is a future-proofing issue — especially relevant for industries dealing with sensitive, long-lifespan data, like healthcare, finance or government.\" Remediation requires long-term planning. Organizations that wait until quantum computers have broken encryption to address the threat will find that it is too late. Start by building an inventory of what needs to change, Witten recommends. (Fortunately, \"It's a matter of using newer and different chips and algorithms, not necessarily more expensive components,\" he writes, also suggesting requests for proposals \"should ask vendors to include a PQC update plan.\") Firmware will also need quantum-resistant digital signatures. (\"Broken authentication lets bad things happen. Someone could remotely take over a vehicle, for instance, or send malicious code for autonomous execution later, even after the vehicle has gone offline.\") And remember that post-quantum key sizes are larger, requiring more storage space. \"In some cases, digitally signed messages with security information could triple in size, which could impact storage and bandwidth.\" Thanks to Esther Schindler (Slashdot reader #16,185) for sharing the article.
