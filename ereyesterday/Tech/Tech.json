    "description": "Old-school Doom fans have something new to chew on until The Dark Ages arrives. Doom + Doom II, the latest in a long line of rereleases of the two id Software classics, was updated on Tuesday with multiplayer mod support. And balance was restored in Hades. At launch in August, the bundle ‚Äî available for PC, PS5/PS4, Xbox Series X/S and Switch ‚Äî supported mods and multiplayer, but not the two together. The game‚Äôs second update, which Bethesda pushed on Tuesday, only adds multiplayer mod support if everyone in your match does a little planning. First, hosts need to activate each mod before entering the multiplayer menu. In addition, all players in the match have to subscribe to the same mod before joining. Only mods authored with Vanilla DOOM, DeHackEd, MBF21 or BOOM are compatible. Doom: The Dark Ages is set to launch on May 15. It takes place in the medieval wastelands of Hell and adds new goodies like mech battles and a ridable cyber dragon. If that isn‚Äôt an elevator pitch for a Doom game, I don‚Äôt know what is.

    "description": "Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Block has created its own open-source AI agent. Called ‚Äúcodename goose,‚Äù the tool allows users to complete tasks using popular large language models. ‚ÄúYou can think of Goose as an assistant that is ready to take your instructions, and do the work for you,‚Äù Block explains in a blog post. According to the company, the agent can autonomously complete engineering tasks like looking for bugs or making code changes. Users can configure goose to run on their preferred LLM. Iit supports Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI and others, though the company says it ‚Äúworks best‚Äù with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's o1 model. It‚Äôs also compatible with extensions, which allows it to plug into popular developer tools, like GitHub and Google Drive, Block is, of course, known for its financial apps, Square and Cash App, as well as the music streaming service Tidal, which it acquired in 2021. Those may not be industries you immediately associate with AI development, but Block founder Jack Dorsey is a longtime advocate for open-source software. The company also notes that goose could eventually extend to ‚Äúnon-engineering use cases‚Äù as well. Block engineer Brad Axen told ZDNET that the company envisions more ‚Äúcreative‚Äô uses for goose, like music generation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/jack-dorseys-block-has-an-ai-agent-too-212706083.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Google has appealed a record $4.5 billion EU antitrust fine to the European Court of Justice, arguing that the European Commission's decision punished its innovation and imposed unfair penalties for agreements requiring pre-installation of its apps on Android devices. Reuters reports: Google's appeal to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union comes two years after a lower tribunal sided with the European Commission which said the company used its Android mobile operating system to quash rivals. The lower court trimmed the fine to 4.1 billion euros. \"Google does not contest or shy away from its responsibility under the law, but the Commission also has a responsibility when it runs investigations, when it seeks to reshape markets and second-guess pro-competitive business models, and when it imposes multi-billion-euro fines,\" Google lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid told the court. \"In this case, the Commission failed to discharge its burden and its responsibility and, relying on multiple errors of law, punished Google for its superior merits, attractiveness and innovation,\" he said. The final ruling is expected in the coming months and cannot be appealed. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "During the first press briefing of Donald Trump's second administration, White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that the National Security Council was \"looking into\" the potential security implications of China's DeepSeek AI startup. Axios reports: DeepSeek's low-cost but highly advanced models have shaken the consensus that the U.S. had a strong lead in the AI race with China. Responding to a question from Axios' Mike Allen, Leavitt said President Trump saw this as a \"wake-up call\" for the U.S. AI industry, but remained confident \"we'll restore American dominance.\" Leavitt said she had personally discussed the matter with the NSC earlier on Tuesday. In the combative tone that characterized much of her first briefing, Leavitt claimed the Biden administration \"sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,\" while Trump had moved quickly to appoint an AI czar and loosen regulations on the AI industry. Leavitt also commented on the mysterious drones spotted flying around New Jersey at the end of last year, saying they were \"authorized to be flown by the FAA.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
