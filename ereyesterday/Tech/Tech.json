    "description": "Apple's AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation (ANC) just became an even more enticing proposition for those who have been on the fence about picking up a pair. They have dropped to $149, which is $30 off the regular price. That's only about $10 more than the record low and the lowest price we've seen for the AirPods 4 with ANC so far this year. If ANC isn't such a big deal for you (perhaps, like me, you tend to only wear one earbud at a time), you can snap up a set of AirPods 4 without ANC instead. Those will currently run you $119, a discount of $10. We gave the AirPods 4 with ANC a score of 86 in our review. Apple improved the audio quality compared with the previous version, and the earbuds have a better fit than the AirPods 3. We felt that the ANC was pretty effective too. However, the lack of onboard volume controls remains a disappointment. The AirPods 4 use the same H2 chip as the AirPods Pro 2, meaning they share some features with the higher-end model. They support Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Personalized Volume and Adaptive EQ. The ANC-enabled model also has Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. In addition, the charging case that comes with the ANC version has Qi-compatible wireless charging, as well as a built-in speaker for Find My. However, the AirPods Pro 2's advanced hearing health features aren't present here. Check out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-4-with-anc-drop-to-149-for-memorial-day-161120128.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Memorial Day sales are in full swing, and if you've been eager to make your home a bit smarter, this deal on the 2024 Ring Video Doorbell is worth considering. It's down to $55 right now, or $45 off the regular price and a record-low. This is a battery-powered version of the doorbell, so you won't have to spend a second figuring out how to hook it up to existing wiring. It'll be easy to recharge the Video Doorbell too. When you need to top up the battery, all you'll need to do is detach the device and plug in a USB-C cable for a while. This version of the Ring Video Doorbell provides a head-to-toe view of the person who's on your doorstep, as it offers 66 percent more vertical coverage than the previous model. The live view feature delivers a real-time feed from the camera to your phone, tablet or other compatible device. There's a two-way talk function as well, so you can chat with the person at your door no matter where you are. You can receive real-time alerts on your phone whenever the Ring Video Doorbell picks up movement through its motion-detection function. However, you'll need to pony up for a Ring Home plan (starting at $5 per month) to get more detailed alerts, such as whether the motion alert was due to a person ringing your doorbell, a package delivery and so on. The subscription includes features like access to 180 days of event video history. If you opt for the $20 per month premium tier, you'll get 24/7 recording for every compatible doorbell and camera in your home. A few other Ring devices are on sale for Memorial Day as well. The pan-and-tilt Ring Indoor cam is 25 percent off and down to $60, and you can snag a five-piece Ring Alarm Kit for only $150, or 25 percent less than usual.¬† Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-2024-ring-video-doorbell-is-cheaper-than-ever-in-this-memorial-day-sale-162236141.html?src=rss",

    "description": "As policy makers in the UK weigh how to regulate the AI industry, Nick Clegg, former UK deputy prime minister and former Meta executive, claimed a push for artist consent would \"basically kill\" the AI industry. From a report: Speaking at an event promoting his new book, Clegg said the creative community should have the right to opt out of having their work used to train AI models. But he claimed it wasn't feasible to ask for consent before ingesting their work first. \"I think the creative community wants to go a step further,\" Clegg said according to The Times. \"Quite a lot of voices say, 'You can only train on my content, [if you] first ask.' And I have to say that strikes me as somewhat implausible because these systems train on vast amounts of data.\" \"I just don't know how you go around, asking everyone first. I just don't see how that would work,\" Clegg said. \"And by the way if you did it in Britain and no one else did it, you would basically kill the AI industry in this country overnight.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
