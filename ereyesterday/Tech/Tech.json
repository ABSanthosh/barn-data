    "description": "Tesla has scrapped its plans to sell a range extender for the Cybertruck, the automaker has notified customers who have previously paid a $2,000 reservation fee for the $16,000 add-on. Based on copies of the email people have been posting on social networks and forums, Tesla will be refunding their deposits in full. It didn't say why it's no longer planning to sell the accessory, but the emails come a month after the company quietly pulled the option to add it to the vehicle from its website configurator. The range extender is a battery pack that was supposed to be installed on the bed of the Cybertruck. It was Tesla's answer to releasing vehicles that had shorter ranges than it originally promised. When the company first unveiled the model, it said different versions would have different ranges, including one that has a 500-mile range. Instead, the long-range Cybertruck, which has the longest range, can only last for 350 miles on a single charge. As Electrek noted late last year, the battery pack was supposed to start shipping in early 2025, but Tesla pushed back its release to mid-2025 and also reduced its promised range from 470 miles to 445 miles. Elon Musk previously said that he expects Tesla to sell between 250,000 to 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. However, a recent recall showed that the automaker sold fewer than 50,000 units over a 15-month period. It's unclear whether the company decided to pull the plug on the range extender because it's not worth manufacturing a new product for a model that's performing far below expectations, or if it has another reason altogether. Either way, the Cybertruck's battery add-on has been cancelled and won't be seeing the light of day.

    "description": "Samsung will host a virtual Unpacked event on May 12 at 8PM ET. It streams live at the Samsung Newsroom and on the company‚Äôs official YouTube page. The company promises a look at \"the next evolution of Galaxy\" devices and that it‚Äôll unveil \"more about the latest addition to the Galaxy S series.\" This means we‚Äôll get more juicy tidbits about that slim Galaxy S25 Edge smartphone that was first teased at an Unpacked event in January. What to expect: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge The company has confirmed via a blog post that the event will shine a light on the Galaxy S25 Edge, which was a long-rumored device before the official tease a few months ago. Samsung did give us a bit of information regarding specs. It offers a slimmer form factor than the standard S25 and includes an impressive 200MP wide camera lens. The company also boasts that the phone will integrate with Galaxy AI to help the camera transform \"into a smart lens that helps recognize what matters to create new memories.\" We don‚Äôt know if that translates to brand-new camera software or if the company‚Äôs referring to the pre-existing suite of AI tools available with its newer handsets. Galaxy S25 Edge„ÄÅÁêÜÊÉ≥ÁöÑ„Åô„Åé„Çãwww„ÇÅ„Å°„ÇÉ„Åè„Å°„ÇÉ„Åª„Åó„ÅÑ.... https://t.co/L1JBl8DCRD pic.twitter.com/zofJ3BLyGX‚Äî „Å°„Åà„Åª„Çìüì±„É¢„Éê„Ç§„É´„Éâ„ÉÉ„Éà„Ç≥„É† (@chehonz201) January 22, 2025 We're still in the dark regarding traditional specs. Samsung‚Äôs blog post is heavy on hyperbole, calling the S25 Edge \"a powerful AI companion and an engineering marvel\" that merges \"flagship-level performance with superior portability.\" The company goes on to say the new handset \"not only sets a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone, but it also unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.\" We‚Äôll find out just how true these words are on May 12. Will this Unpacked event start and stop with the S25 Edge? That‚Äôs likely, but it‚Äôs always possible that Samsung will throw a curveball our way. Maybe the standard S25 Edge will get companion smartphones that are more powerful, like the S25+ or S25 Ultra. It‚Äôs also highly possible the company will reveal a new AI tool or two.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-is-hosting-a-virtual-unpacked-event-on-may-12-at-8pm-et-230026574.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Google has partnered with Elementl Power to develop at least 600 MW of nuclear capacity at each of three planned sites. It's unknown where the three proposed sites will be located or how much Google is investing. World Nuclear News reports: The two companies will work \"with utility and regulated power partners to identify and advance new projects\" and Elementl \"will continue the evaluation of potential technology, engineering, procurement and construction, and other project partners, while prioritising specific sites for accelerated development.\" Elementl Power, founded in 2022, describes itself as a technology-agnostic advanced nuclear project developer which aims to provide \"turn-key development, financing and ownership solutions for customers that want access to clean baseload power but may not want to own or operate nuclear power assets.\" It says its mission is to \"to deploy over 10 gigawatts of next-generation nuclear power in the US by 2035.\" It is not Google's first nuclear power deal -- in October 2024 the company signed an agreement with Kairos Power to purchase power from its fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature small modular reactors, with a fleet of up to 500 MW of capacity by 2035. The aim of the power purchase agreement was to facilitate Kairos Power to develop, construct, and operate plants and sell energy, ancillary services, and environmental attributes to Google. At the time of that announcement Google said that it would help it achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030.

    "description": "Netflix has officially launched a new AI-powered search feature that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to deliver a conversational content discovery experience, allowing users to describe what they're looking for in natural language. The streaming giant is also getting into short videos with a new vertical feed set to rival Instagram Reels and TikTok. TechCrunch reports: Users can enter their preferences using natural phrases like \"I want something funny and upbeat\" or even more detailed requests, such as \"I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny.\" The feature is set to roll out this week to iOS users as an opt-in beta. Some subscribers in Australia and New Zealand have already had access to it, as reported by Bloomberg last month. [...] Additionally, at the tech and product event, the company mentioned plans to use generative AI to update title cards in subscribers' preferred languages. Other features revealed on Wednesday include a short-form video feed for mobile users and a redesign of its TV homepage. Netflix's new mobile-only vertical feed allows users to easily scroll through clips of its original titles. Within this feed, users can tap on buttons to watch the entire show or movie immediately, save it to their \"My List,\" or share it with friends. Of note is that the clips are curated from the \"Today's Top Picks for You\" section rather than being chosen from Netflix's entire library. This approach makes it specifically tailored to each user, ultimately encouraging viewers to watch the full shows. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
