    "description": "Apple is reportedly still working on glucose management — this time through software. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says the company tested an app this year for pre-diabetic people, helping them manage their diet and lifestyle. Apple is said not to have plans to launch the app to consumers, but it could play a part in future health products. The company reportedly tested the app internally, with employees confirmed through a blood test to be at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The subjects “actively monitored their blood sugar via various devices available on the market,” logging corresponding glucose changes. The app would then note correlations between dietary changes and blood sugar levels (for example, “don’t eat the pasta”). Gurman says Apple paused the test to focus on other health features. Bloomberg notes that the Apple Health app currently lacks meal tracking, something rival services offer. The publication also says Apple could eventually offer deeper third-party glucose tracking integration into its products. The study reportedly wasn’t directly related to Apple’s 15-year quest to offer non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, something that’s seemingly regurgitated in Apple Watch rumors every cycle. The company’s current hardware prototype is reportedly an iPhone-sized wearable device that uses lasers to shoot light into the skin. Gurman claims Apple’s first consumer-facing version — whether in the Apple Watch or some other form — will likely only notify users if they may be pre-diabetic. Providing specific glucose levels would have to come in later iterations.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-reportedly-tested-a-blood-glucose-monitoring-app-204241266.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Heads up if you’ve had a Cash App account over the last six years or so: you may now be able to claim thousands of dollars as a result of a class-action settlement. The company proposed the $15 million settlement earlier this year following two security incidents. If you're eligible to make a claim, you only have a few weeks to do so. The first related breach took place in December 2021 when, according to Cash App, a former employee downloaded reports containing information on more than 8 million users. This included their full names, brokerage account numbers and, in some cases, the holdings and value of investment portfolios. Cash App disclosed the incident in April 2022. The consolidated class-action complaint alleged that Cash App and parent company Block failed to enact sufficient security measures to prevent another data breach. This involved Cash App’s person-to-person payment services. According to the plaintiffs, “an unauthorized user accessed certain Cash App accounts in 2023 using recycled phone numbers.\" The complaint contended that Cash App and Block mishandled complaints related to both breaches and fraudulent transactions. Cash App and Block have denied any wrongdoing, The New York Times reports. They say the settlement is not an admission of liability. You may be eligible to make a claim if you had a Cash App account between August 23, 2018 and August 20 of this year. The settlement will cover up to $2,500 of out-of-pocket costs stemming from the breaches, as well as up to three hours worth of lost time at $25 per hour. Those who have sustained a monetary loss and haven’t yet been reimbursed can file a claim for that too. If you plan to file a claim through the settlement website, you’ll need to do so by 2AM ET on November 19. A final court hearing in the case is set for December 16.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/cash-app-users-can-claim-thousands-of-dollars-in-a-data-breach-settlement-194520756.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple was handed a victory today by a jury in Delware, which ruled that two of Masimo's smartwatches and chargers \"willfully violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs,\" according to Reuters. The reward? $250 in damages. 9to5Mac reports: Apple previously accused Masimo of using litigation to boost the launch of its own smartwatch product. In October 2022, Apple filed two patent infringement lawsuits against Masimo. The first lawsuit accused Masimo of copying the Apple Watch design. The second said that Masimo's technical features infringed on Apple patents covering technology used in the Apple Watch. Reuters reports: \"Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that health monitoring tech company Masimo's smartwatches infringe two of its design patents. The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that Masimo's W1 and Freedom watches and chargers willfully violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs, awarding the tech giant $250 in damages. Apple's attorneys told the court the 'ultimate purpose' of its lawsuit was to win an injunction against sales of Masimo's smartwatches after an infringement ruling.\" The jury, however, also determined that Masimo's smartwatches \"did not infringe on Apple patents covering smartwatch inventions that the tech giant had accused Masimo of copying.\" The two companies continue to battle it out over patent infringements regarding the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor.

    "description": "Former Nvidia engineer Luke Durant, working with the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), recently discovered the largest known prime number: (2^136,279,841)-1 or M136279841 (where the number following the letter M represents the exponent). The achievement was detailed on Mersenne.org. Tom's Hardware reports: This is the largest prime number we've seen so far, with the last one, M82589933, being discovered six years prior. What makes this discovery particularly fascinating is that this is the first GIMPS discovery that used the power of data center GPUs. Mihai Preda was the first one to harness GPU muscle in 2017, says the GIMPS website, when he \"wrote the GpuOwl program to test Mersenne numbers for primarilty, making his software available to all GIMPS users.\" When Luke joined GIMPS in 2023, they built the infrastructure needed to deploy Preda's software across several GPU servers available in the cloud. While it took a year of testing, Luke's efforts finally bore fruit when an A100 GPU in Dublin, Ireland gave the M136279841 result last October 11. This was then corroborated by an Nvidia H100 located in San Antonio, Texas, which confirmed its primality with the Lucas-Lehmer test. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); Overall, Compose AI's NLG software can be a useful tool for automating the process of creating written or spoken content from structured data. However, the quality of the generated content may vary depending on the data source, and it is essential to review the generated content before using it in a production environment. It is important to use the tool as an aid, not a replacement for the understanding of the data. Conclusion AI tools are becoming increasingly important in today's business and technology landscape.
