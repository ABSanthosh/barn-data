    "description": "Apple announced a lot of new features in today's WWDC stream, but news from one follow-up meeting heralds the end of an era. MacOS 26, also known as macOS Tahoe, will be the last version of the operating system to work on Macs powered by Intel Processors. Tahoe-supporting Intel Macs will get full access to all the new features, and they'll still get security updates for the next three years. By 2028, though they'll be out of the Apple ecosystem. The first Apple Silicon processor launched in 2020. Since then, Apple has run all its hardware on its own Apple Silicon microchips, which are significantly more powerful than the Intel chips it had been using for most of the millennium. Apple Silicon's ARM-based architecture can perform more operations and use less battery power than the x86-based Intel processors. Many Intel-powered Macs have already aged out of updates, but today's update puts an expiration date on the last survivors. The announcement, which came during a Platform State of the Union (SOTU) following the main WWDC event, was aimed primarily at app developers. Apple is encouraging developers to plan for the post-Intel era and ensure the migration is as smooth as possible for themselves and their users. Both macOS 26 and the planned next version, macOS 27, will include the Rosetta translation process, which helps apps built for x86 run on ARM. After 27, Rosetta will remain in place to support legacy video games. Intel-powered Macs that will support Tahoe include the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 2020 27-inch iMac and the 2019 Mac Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-is-the-end-of-the-line-for-intel-macs-113036626.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Hideo Kojima doesn't really go for half measures. Following a 10-minute trailer that unveiled some early details, the game creator participated in a beefy 80-minute panel discussion with Geoff Keighley about Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on the final day of Summer Games Fest 2025. The wide-ranging conversation included some clips from the sequel to the acclaimed Death Stranding, including its first five minutes, which sparked lots of cheers as people recognized performers' names in the opening credits. Kojima also showed the English language version of a scene that was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show, highlighting the performances of Elle Fanning as Tomorrow and Shioli Kutsuna as Rainy. Fans also got a chance to see Tomorrow in action as she literally gets down and dirty in the tar to take out some robotic combatants. There was also a live gameplay demo, first showing Sam in combat with a blood boomerang and a tar cannon, then a more challenging fight against Neil that showed off some stealth attacks as well as some more weaponry. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available on PlayStation 5 starting June 26.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-22-minutes-of-death-stranding-2-gameplay-from-summer-games-fest-224814307.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has called for changes to the roster of officials appointed to oversee the forthcoming election at the African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC), the latest twist in a conflict that stretches back years and has left the African regional internet registry in limbo. From a report: AFRINIC is one of the world's five regional internet registries, the governance bodies that delegate and manage IP addresses and autonomous systems numbers in co-ordination with ICANN. The African organization has essentially been dead in the water, operating without a board or CEO since 2022. The problems started in 2020 when AFRINIC alleged that one of its members -- a company called Cloud Innovation -- had breached its agreement with the registry in ways that could lead AFRINIC to reclaim the company's IP address holdings. Cloud Innovation countered that AFRINIC acted improperly and launched multiple lawsuits in Mauritius, the Indian Ocean nation the registry calls home. Other parties also sued AFRINIC for similar reasons. The lawsuits left AFRINIC's bank accounts frozen and meant it was unable to convene a board or run elections. In February 2025, the Supreme Court of Mauritius appointed a receiver to secure AFRINIC's assets and reconstitute its board. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
