    "description": "Amazon Prime Day has returned for the summer, making it a good time to check to see if any big-ticket gadgets on your wishlist are on sale. A lot of our favorite tech is on sale at the moment, and that includes a number of Prime Day vacuum deals. One of the best is on the Dyson V15 Detect Plus, which has dropped to $570 for Prime members. We loved the Dyson V15 Detect and it earned a slot in our best cordless vacuums guide. The Plus model on sale during Prime Day is the same vacuum with more accessories. The suction power on the V15 Detect Plus is really impressive, especially for a cordless vacuum. For anyone with pets, good suction should be a strong consideration when selecting a vacuum, and we were thoroughly impressed with the pet hair this model picked up in our tests from both hardwood and carpet. The Fluffy Optic hard surface cleaning head comes with a laser that illuminates the ground in front of you as you vacuum. It does a frighteningly good job of highlighting just how much dust, hair and other debris have collected on your hardwood or tile floors that you might not have seen. For a shocking look at just how much stuff is on your floors, try vacuuming with the lights off. The V15 Detect Plus gets its namesake from a handy LCD display screen on the main body of the vacuum that tells you exactly how many particles across different size ranges the vacuum has detected since you started cleaning. In practice, this doesn't add anything to the functionality of the device, but it sheds a light on just how much stuff you've picked up.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-this-dyson-cordless-vacuum-while-its-180-off-for-prime-day-121534903.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The bumper 2025 edition of Amazon's Prime Day is fast approaching and the deals are starting to emerge. While we've seen this offer pop up several times in the past, it's one that's always worth highlighting. New Audible subscribers can get three months of access to the Premium Plus plan for $3. That's a total of $42 off. This is one of the best streaming deals around right now. It will be available until July 31, which is a few weeks after the Prime Day event ends (it could probably be called Prime Week this year since it's running for four days). If you don't cancel your Audible membership before the promotional period ends, it will automatically renew for $15 per month. Through the Audible Premium Plus plan, you'll receive one credit each month. You can use this to claim any audiobook you like on the platform, whether it's a bestseller, new release or something else you've been meaning to get to. You'll retain access to audiobooks you claim with credits even after your subscription expires. So, you're effectively getting three audiobooks for your permanent collection for three bucks. Audible members will be able to take advantage of exclusive discounts and sales too. They also get access to thousands of audiobooks, Audible Originals and podcasts as long as their subscription remains active.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/three-months-of-audible-is-only-3-in-this-prime-day-deal-143734246.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Interesting Engineering reports: Astral Systems, a UK-based private commercial fusion company, has claimed to have become the first firm to successfully breed tritium, a vital fusion fuel, using its own operational fusion reactor. This achievement, made with the University of Bristol, addresses a significant hurdle in the development of fusion energy.... Scientists from Astral Systems and the University of Bristol produced and detected tritium in real-time from an experimental lithium breeder blanket within Astral's multi-state fusion reactors. \"There's a global race to find new ways to develop more tritium than what exists in today's world — a huge barrier is bringing fusion energy to reality,\" said Talmon Firestone, CEO and co-founder of Astral Systems. \"This collaboration with the University of Bristol marks a leap forward in the search for viable, greater-than-replacement tritium breeding technologies. Using our multi-state fusion technology, we are the first private fusion company to use our reactors as a neutron source to produce fusion fuel.\" Astral Systems' approach uses its Multi-State Fusion (MSF) technology. The company states this will commercialize fusion power with better performance, efficiency, and lower costs than traditional reactors. Their reactor design, the result of 25 years of engineering and over 15 years of runtime, incorporates recent understandings of stellar physics. A core innovation is lattice confinement fusion (LCF), a concept first discovered by NASA in 2020. This allows Astral's reactor to achieve solid-state fuel densities 400 million times higher than those in plasma. The company's reactors are designed to induce two distinct fusion reactions simultaneously from a single power input, with fusion occurring in both plasma and a solid-state lattice. The article includes this quote from professor Tom Scott, who led the University of Bristol's team, supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering and UK Atomic Energy Authority. \"This landmark moment clearly demonstrates a potential path to scalable tritium production in the future and the capability of Multi-State Fusion to produce isotopes in general.\" And there's also this prediction from the company's web site: \"As we progress the fusion rate of our technology, aiming to exceed 10 trillion DT fusions per second per system, we unlock a wide range of applications and capabilities, such as large-scale medical isotope production, fusion neutron materials damage testing, transmutation of existing nuclear waste stores, space applications, hybrid fusion-fission power systems, and beyond.\" \"Scientists everywhere are racing to develop this practically limitless form of energy,\" write a climate news site called The Cooldown. (Since in theory nuclear fusion \"has an energy output four times higher than that of fission, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\") Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader fahrbot-bot for sharing the news.

    "description": "\"Microsoft has released the source code for the GitHub Copilot Chat extension for VS Code under the MIT license,\" reports BleepingComputer. This provides the community access to the full implementation of the chat-based coding assistant, including the implementation of \"agent mode,\" what contextual data is sent to large language models (LLMs), and the design of system prompts. The GitHub repository hosting the code also details telemetry collection mechanisms, addressing long-standing questions about data transparency in AI-assisted coding tools... As the VS Code team explained previously, shifts in AI tooling landscape like the rapid growth of the open-source AI ecosystem and a more level playing field for all have reduced the need for secrecy around prompt engineering and UI design. At the same time, increased targeting of development tools by malicious actors has increased the need for crowdsourcing contributions to rapidly pinpoint problems and develop effective fixes. Essentially, openness is now considered superior from a security perspective. \"If you've been hesitant to adopt AI tools because you don't trust the black box behind them, this move opensources-github-copilot-chat-vscode/offers something rare these days: transparency,\" writes Slashdot reader BrianFagioli\" Now that the extension is open source, developers can audit how agent mode actually works. You can also dig into how it manages your data, customize its behavior, or build entirely new tools on top of it. This could be especially useful in enterprise environments where compliance and control are non negotiable. It is worth pointing out that the backend models powering Copilot remain closed source. So no, you won't be able to self host the whole experience or train your own Copilot. But everything running locally in VS Code is now fair game. Microsoft says it is planning to eventually merge inline code completions into the same open source package too, which would make Copilot Chat the new hub for both chat and suggestions.
