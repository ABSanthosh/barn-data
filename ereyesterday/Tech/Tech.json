    "description": "According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman (paywalled), Apple has big plans to turn Siri into a true ChatGPT competitor. \"A next-generation, chatbot version of Siri has reportedly made significant progress during testing over the past six months; some executives allegedly now see it as 'on par' with recent versions of ChatGPT,\" reports MacRumors. \"Apple is also apparently discussing giving Siri the ability to access the internet to gather and synthesize data from multiple sources, just like ChatGPT.\" From the report: The report added that Apple now has artificial intelligence offices in Zurich, where employees are working on an all-new software architecture for Siri. This \"monolithic model\" is entirely built on an LLM engine that will eventually replace Siri's current \"hybrid\" architecture that has been incoherently layered up with different functionality over many years. The new model will make Siri more conversational and better at synthesizing information. Google's Gemini is expected to be added to iOS 19 as an alternative to ChatGPT in Siri, but Apple is also apparently in talks with Perplexity to add their AI service as another option in the future, for both Siri and Safari search.

    "description": "Sony has begun mass suspensions of PlayStation accounts linked to Russian users, including those registered in other countries like Turkiye and Kazakhstan, in an effort to crack down on circumvention of regional restrictions like PS Plus access. This move follows Sony's 2022 exit from the Russian market due to the war in Ukraine. Ukrainska Pravda reports: Russians are trying to bypass the blocks and are contacting PlayStation support, but these attempts are to no avail. Users with purchased accounts encounter the most problems -- Sony checks IP addresses for verification. There are already many similar reports. In some cases, accounts with thousands of roubles worth of games purchased have been blocked. Russian media outlets like RT are reporting the news. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Spotify is continuing to add more ways for listeners to directly make purchases within its iOS app. Following on the streaming service's changes to make purchasing subscriptions easier earlier this month, there's now an an option for users to buy audiobooks in Spotify. \"Spotify submitted a new app update that Apple has approved: Spotify users in the United States can now see pricing, buy individual audiobooks and purchase additional 'Top Up' hours for audiobook listening beyond the 15 hours included in Premium each month,\" the company said in its updated blog post. The wave of changes stem from the ongoing court case between Apple and Epic Games surrounding fees for purchases made outside the App Store. While things appear to be swinging in favor of app and service providers, Apple is likely to continue challenging the rulings even as it makes changes to allow for external payment options.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotify-ios-users-can-now-buy-audiobooks-directly-from-the-app-230304105.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/elgatos-stream-deck-breaks-free-from-the-companys-hardware-230052921.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The Elgato Stream Deck is expanding into a hardware-agnostic platform. On Monday, the company unveiled a software version of the programmable shortcut device. Also on tap are a module for integration in third-party products and DIY projects, an Ethernet dock and an updated Stream Deck MK.2 with scissor-switch keys. Stream Deck MK.2 Scissor Keys There's a new version of the popular Stream Deck MK.2. The only difference is that this version ditches membrane keys in favor of scissor-switch ones. Scissor keys (found on many laptops, like modern MacBooks) have a shorter travel distance and sharper actuation than the mushy-feeling ones on the (still available) legacy MK.2. The Stream Deck MK.2 Scissor Keys costs $150. Shipments begin around the beginning of June. Virtual Stream Deck Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) is a software-only counterpart of the classic devices. Like the hardware versions, the VSD includes a familiar grid of programmable shortcut buttons. Anything you'd configure for a device like the Stream Deck MK.2 or XL, you can also do for the VSD. Place the interface anywhere on your desktop, pin it for quick access or trigger it with a mouse click or hotkey. Elgato Presumably to avoid cannibalizing its hardware business, Elgato is limiting the VSD to owners of its devices. Initially, it will only be available to people who have Stream Deck hardware or select Corsair peripherals (the Xeneon Edge and Scimitar Elite WE SE Mouse). The company says the VSD will soon be rolled out to owners of additional devices. The VSD has one frustrating requirement. It only works when one of those compatible accessories is connected to your computer. Unfortunately, that means you can‚Äôt use it as a virtual Stream Deck replacement, mirroring your shortcuts while you and your laptop are on the go. That seems like a missed opportunity. Instead, it‚Äôs more like a complement to Stream Deck hardware while it‚Äôs connected ‚Äî a way to get more shortcuts than the accessory supports. It‚Äôs also a method for Corsair accessory owners to get Stream Deck functionality without buying one. Regardless, Virtual Stream Deck launches with the Stream Deck 7.0 beta software. Stream Deck Modules Elgato Stream Deck Modules can be built into hardware not made by Elgato. So, hobbyists, startups and manufacturers can incorporate the OLED shortcut buttons into their DIY projects or products. The only difference is their more flexible nature. Otherwise, they function the same as legacy Stream Deck products. Stream Deck Modules have an aluminum chassis that's \"ready to drop straight into a custom mount, machine or product.\" They're available in six-, 15- and 32-key variants. The modules begin shipping today. You'll pay $50 for the six-key version, $130 for the 15-key one and $200 for the 32-key variant. (If you're providing them for an organization, Elgato offers volume discounts.) Elgato Network Dock Elgato The Elgato Network Dock gives Stream Deck devices their own Ethernet connections. This untethers the shortcuts from the desktop, allowing for \"custom installations, remote stations and more.\" The Network Dock supports both Power over Ethernet (PoE) and non-PoE networks. You can set up its IP configuration on-device. The dock costs $80 and ships in August.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/elgatos-stream-deck-breaks-free-from-the-companys-hardware-230052921.html?src=rss",
