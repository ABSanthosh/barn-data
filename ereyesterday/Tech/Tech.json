    "description": "The Federal Trade Commission has put Uber in its sights once again. Bloomberg reported that the regulator is investigating complaints about the Uber One subscription program. Customers alleged that the company signed users up for the service without their consent and made it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. According to documents seen by Bloomberg, the Commission opened this inquiry earlier this year. \"We will continue to answer any questions the FTC may have about our cancellation policies,” Uber representative Noah Edwardsen told the publication. \"The Uber One cancellation process follows both the letter and the spirit of the law: Uber One members can easily cancel their membership in the app — in fact, the majority of those cancellations take 20 seconds or less.\" Earlier in 2024, the FTC ratified a \"click to cancel\" rule that requires companies make it as easy to end a subscription as it is to start one. The regulator sued Amazon and Adobe for similar claims around their subscription products within the past year. This also isn't the first time the FTC has examined the rideshare company. Uber agreed to a settlement with the agency in 2017 around questions of exaggerating driver income to encourage recruitment. In 2018, the company also reached an accord around a data breach and misconduct in trying to cover up the scope of the problem.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/the-ftc-is-investigating-uber-for-its-subscription-policies-232453366.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It may not be Black Friday yet, but the holiday shopping blitz is already well underway with some significant discounts on games and gaming devices. Steam is in the middle of its Autumn Sale that runs until December 4 and includes a discount on the LCD Steam Deck. No, it’s not the OLED Steam Deck, but Steam is offering the 512GB Steam Deck with a 25 percent discount that brings the price down to $336.75. Steam’s sale also offered the smaller 64GB LCD model with a 15 percent discount for less than $300 but they’ve already run out of stock. This may be the best time to pick up a Steam Deck since last summer. In June, Steam knocked down the price of the 64GB variant to just under $300 and the 512GB version for under $400. The 64 and 512GB models are discontinued and won’t be available once Steam runs out of stock. The 256GB LCD model is sticking around for a little while longer for those gamers who can’t afford the fancier versions. If you’re going to buy a Steam Deck, you’ll need some games to play on it. Steam Autumn Sale also includes some sweet deals on games like Baldur’s Gate 3 for $47.99 and Total War: Warhammer III for $23.99 and early access to Supergiant’s Hades II for $26.99. Steam also has some cool discounts on older games that you’ve been meaning to play like Double Fine’s Psychonauts 2 and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey for $6 each, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for $4 and Cities Skylines for $3.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steams-autumn-sale-sees-deep-discounts-on-lcd-steam-decks-and-select-games-202918983.html?src=rss",

    "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer inaugurated London's first Google-funded AI Campus in Camden, aiming to equip young people with AI and machine learning skills. Reuters reports: The center, based in Camden, an area which Starmer represents in parliament and which is also home to Google's future offices in Kings Cross, has already started a two-year pilot project for local students. An first cohort of 32 people aged 16-18 will have access to resources in AI and machine learning and receive mentoring and expertise from Google's AI company DeepMind, the tech giant said. The students will tackle real-world projects connecting AI to fields such as health, social sciences and the arts at the campus, which has been established in partnership with the local authority, Google said. Google's UK and Ireland managing director Debbie Weinstein announced 865,000 pounds ($1.10 million) of funding for an AI literacy program across the UK. The money will be used by charities Raspberry Pi Foundation and Parent Zone to help train teachers with an aim of reaching over 250,000 students by the end of 2026, she said.

    "description": "A U.S. federal appeals court ruled that sanctions against Tornado Cash, a crypto transaction anonymization service, must be abandoned, stating that its immutable smart contracts do not constitute \"property\" under U.S. law and that the Treasury overstepped its authority. The ruling is available here (PDF). CoinDesk reports: The decision answers a controversial privacy debate on whether the government -- via a sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department -- has a right to target the technology because it's associated with criminals. The ruling reversed a district court's August ruling that had sided with the government's pursuit of what it had characterized as a \"notorious\" crypto-mixing service. OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash last year, contending that it was a vital tool used by bad actors including North Korea's Lazarus Group to launder crypto tokens pilfered from platforms and games such as Axie Infinity. Coinbase (COIN) and others had sued the government, claiming it had overreached. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of crypto exchange Coinbase, cheered the ruling in a Tuesday post on X, calling it a \"historic win for crypto.\" \"These smart contracts must now be removed from the sanctions list and U.S. persons will once again be allowed to use this privacy-protecting protocol,\" Grewal wrote. \"Put another way, the government's overreach will not stand.\" \"We readily recognize the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC's sanctioning authority,\" the judges said, referencing the ineffectiveness of a law that was established well before the world moved online. \"But we must uphold the statutory bargain struck (or mis-struck) by Congress, not tinker with it.\" Tornado Cash's TORN token has since rallied 500%, passing the $20 mark.
