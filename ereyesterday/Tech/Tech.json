    "description": "Amazon Prime Day is almost over, so now’s the time for members to stock up on discounted home essentials, clothing, shoes, and of course, tech. It’s safe to say that Amazon’s website has been overwhelming for the entirety of the event, so we wouldn’t blame you if you got distracted immediately upon opening it. If you’ve got gadgets on your wishlist, Engadget has you covered. We’re surfacing the best Prime Day deals on gadgets and gear we can find for the whole of the shopping event. As in years past, Prime Day has brought solid discounts on some of our favorite tech including earbuds, tablets, robot vacuums and home devices. These are the best Prime Day deals you can get before the sale ends tonight. Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Samsung 55-inch The Frame QLED 4K smart TV for $798 (47 percent off): This is the set that spurred all of the art TV copycats, and it's been a favorite of our staff for a long time. Samsung's set looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall when you're not watching TV, and you can cycle through thousands of images to show on the TV so you'll always have something new to display. Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 ($180 off): You can't get much better than a Dyson if you're on the market for a cordless stick vacuum, and the V15 Detect delivers. It's our current top pick for the best cordless vacuum overall thanks to its excellent suction power, lightweight design, good battery life and the included Fluffy Optic cleaning head that uses a laser to show you where all the debris is while you're using it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 (38 percent off): While the XM6 headphones are the latest and greatest, they only make small changes to the already stellar XM5. These were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for a long time before the XM6 launched earlier this year, and we still like them for their excellent sound quality, strong ANC, multi-device connectivity and good battery life. Note that the black model is the only one down to $248 at the moment; all other colors are on sale for $298. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $149 (40 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 remain Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid now. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This was my favorite thing I bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning my shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off): Jisulife makes handheld fans we've recommended in past gift guides and this is one of its newer models. It can be held, folded so it sits flat on a table or worn around your neck for a cool breeze wherever you're going. It has an easy-to-read display in its center that will show you the fan speed level or current battery life, and its 5,000 mAh battery can last up to 19.5 hours on a single charge when you're running the fan on its lowest setting. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $500: We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the fact that Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available to order \"by invitation\" now. The Mario Kart World bundle is available for the standard $500 price, so it's not a Prime Day deal per se, but considering Amazon was (supposedly) shut out of the initial Switch 2 order process earlier this year, it's notable to see the console listed on the site at all. Prime Day deals under $50 Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 (49 percent off): Our favorite budget streaming stick, the Fire TV Stick HD is an easy, dirt-cheap way to upgrade an aging TV set. It supports HD video and its revamped remote can control the power and volume of your TV, so you don't have to keep track of two controllers. Anker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. Blink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): This stick handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K video and HDR10+ and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick and Engadget’s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. Of course, Amazon’s user interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than others. And it highly prioritizes Prime Video content. Lexar Professional Silver Plus for $38 ($35 off): Our tests showed this to be the fastest microSD card on the market, beating out the whole Samsung line. Not only is it fast enough to download and upload 4K files without trying your patience, it's also waterproof, cheap and squeezes in both USB-A and USB-C ports. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Amazon revived the Spot smart alarm clock last year, which features a half-circle shaped display that shows the time, weather and other information like song titles when you're using the speaker to play music. It has a compact design that will make it easy to fit on a desk or a nightstand, and as with any Alexa smart speaker, you can use it to control IoT devices like smart lights, locks and more. Meater SE smart meat thermometer for $45 (43 percent off): This lets you wirelessly monitor the temperature of your food while it's cooking, which could make it an essential tool for aspiring grillmasters. It has a Bluetooth range of 165 feet, a dishwasher-safe design and its companion mobile app lets you keep an eye on foods even if you're a few rooms away. Prime Day Apple deals Apple Watch Series 10 for $280 ($120 off): We consider Apple’s flagship wearable to be the best smartwatch you can buy, period. It's a mostly iterative update, with faster charging, a slightly slimmer design and a marginally larger display than the prior Series 9. That said, it's still a comprehensive fitness tracker, and no other smartwatch can integrate as neatly with iPhones and other Apple devices. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $479 ($120 off): In our opinion, the iPad Air is the best iPad for most people as it strikes an ideal balance between performance, price and features. The M3 chip is almost overkill for a tablet, but it means performance should never be an issue. And upcoming productivity gains from iPadOS 26 should make the tablet even more powerful. Apple iPad (A16) for $280 (20 percent off): The latest base model iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage as standard. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need an iPad for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it's a good starter tablet. Prime Day audio deals Sonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 (26 percent off): The second-gen Beam soundbar has support for Dolby Atmos and it has a relatively streamlined design that should be easy to fit into most home entertainment setups. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $160 (30 percent off): The best earbuds for Pixel phone users are down to $160, which makes them a great purchase right now. Live translate and hands-free access to Gemini might be the highlight, but these earbuds have great sound and capable ANC too. Beats Pill for $99 (34 percent off): The Beats Pill is one of the few portable bluetooth speakers we liked enough to give it a full review. Those of you who love the classic Beats bluetooth speakers will be happy to know they're back in fine form. Nobody can beat the Pill for bass, and its sound is crisp and lossless at almost any frequency and volume. For some reason, only the Kim Kardashian branded version is on sale, but it's the exact same speaker. Sony WH-CH720N headphones for $78 (48 percent off): The cheapest Sony headphones we'd recommend that are no slouch. They're lightweight and comfy with respectable sound for the price. You also get Adaptive Sound Control, 360 Reality Audio and multipoint Bluetooth on this budget model. Prime Day laptop deals Microsoft Surface Laptop (13.8-inch, Snapdragon X Plus) for $880 (27 percent off): In addition to running on a Snapdragon X Plus processor, this 2024 Surface Laptop has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It's a Copilot+ PC that also has a 13.8-inch touchscreen, and it should last up to 20 hours on a single charge. Google Pixelbook Go (13-inch, Intel Core M3) for $319 (51 percent off): The Pixelbook Go is a bit old at this point, but if you're a Chrome OS lover and want a Google-made laptop, this is a solid option. It includes an Intel Core M3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 12-hour battery life. Prime Day tech deals Samsung The Frame Pro (65-inch) for $1,898 (14 percent off): New for 2025, Samsung's Frame Pro sets offer brighter and higher-quality Mini LED panels for a superior TV watching experience. The 65-inch Frame Pro is a great option for most living rooms since it's large enough to deliver an immersive viewing experience, and it also comes with Samsung's wireless One Connect box for less cable clutter. While there's still no OLED Frame TV yet, this Mini LED set is the closest you'll get today. (If you're looking for something larger, the 75-inch Frame Pro is down to $2,699, and the 85-inch is $4,061.) Hisense S7N Canvas TV (65-inch) for $898 (31 percent off): Hisense's spin on Samsung's Frame sets, the CanvasTV, comes in much cheaper and with a boatload of features. The S7N sports an anti-glare display and art mode, as you'd expect, but there's also 144Hz support for a bit of gaming. It also comes with a slim wall mount so you can hang it on your wall like a genuine work of art. (The 55-inch model is also a great deal at $689, and the 77-inch is down to $1,399.) Kindle Scribe for $260 ($140 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. iRobot Roomba 104 Combo robot vacuum and mop for $250 (44 percent off): This combo machine will vacuum and mop on its own, plus it comes with an auto-empty base as well. That means it will automatically empty the dry debris it collects into the base after every cleaning job. Levoit Core 400S air purifier for $183 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best air purifier, Levoit's Core 400S reliably improved air quality in our testing, plus it has easy to use onboard controls and replaceable filters that are not too expensive. We also found it to not be offensively loud, even on its highest setting. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10 quart) for $160 ($90 off): This model is one of our favorite air fryers thanks to its dual-zone cooking system, which allows you to prepare two separate foods at different temperatures and settings. There's even a Match Cook feature that ensures both foods will be done at the same time, regardless of their cooking settings. Samsung 990 Pro for $150 (29 percent off): The whole Samsung Pro line of SSDs is excellent for gamers, with PS5s in particular seeming to run much faster with one installed. The 990 Pro can reach read speeds of up to 1,400 KB/s — and yes, that's kilobytes, not megabytes. Crucial X9 Pro 2TB for $120 ($60 off): The Crucial X9 Pro with 2TB storage space is marked down 33 percent for Prime Day. It's our top pick for the best portable SSD right now thanks to its excellent speeds, compact yet rugged design and five-year warranty. Kindle for $85 ($25 off): Our favorite budget option in our guide to the best ereaders, the latest base Kindle has 16GB of storage — more than enough to hold hundreds of books at a time. It has a compact and durable design that’s easy to take anywhere, and the latest model is faster than before with speedy page turns and a more seamless navigation between books, your library and other parts of the UI. Ring Doorbell Battery + Indoor Cam 2 for $70 (50 percent off): If you're looking to build out a security system in your home, this bundle is a good place to start, giving you a video doorbell and an indoor security camera. You'll be able to see both live feeds in the Ring app, and they can send you motion alerts and let you speak to people on the other end of the camera when you're not at home. What is Prime Day? Prime Day is Amazon's members-only shopping event, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of most of the savings. Amazon still offers a 30-day free trial to new Prime subscribers, so you can start your free trial closer to July and participate in the event. When is Prime Day 2025? Amazon Prime Day 2025 will be back this year on July 8 through July 11. When does Prime Day 2025 end? Amazon Prime Day ends on July 11 at the end of the day. How often is Prime Day? Amazon Prime Day typically comes around annually in July. In the last few years, Amazon has also had its \"Big Deal Days\" in October, which is effectively a second Prime Day and the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season. How does Prime Day work? Prime subscribers can go to Amazon's site on Prime Day to see all of the exclusive deals they have access to. Prime subscribers do not have to do anything additional to get Prime Day sales: the discounts you see on product pages will show up in your cart automatically. If you're not a Prime subscriber and you go to Amazon to shop on Prime Day, you'll likely see tons of items on sale but only \"with Prime;\" those discounts will not be available to those who are not active Prime subscribers. Is Prime Day only for Prime members? Technically yes, but even if you do not pay for a Prime membership, you should still check out Amazon on Prime Day. While most Prime Day deals will be exclusively available to subscribers, there are always a handful of sales available to all shoppers. Amazon distinguishes between them very clearly: you'll see \"Prime exclusive\" on product pages near the deal pricing on the discounts that are only available to paying members. Separately, it’s very likely that other retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy will have their own competing Prime Day sales during that time frame, too. So if you're not keen on shopping at Amazon at all, it's worth checking out other retailers during the week of Prime Day to see if they are matching Prime Day deal prices.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-for-the-last-day-our-top-picks-on-headphones-tvs-robot-vacuums-and-more-120028336.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If it's not worth doing at the last minute, is it really worth doing? If you've put off buying something from Amazon's Prime Day sale but still want to save some dollars on a bit of new tech, now is the time. These are the best tech deals we could find under $50, but the discounts will only be live for a few more hours. Prime Day ends at midnight Pacific time. Sure, a few deals will stick around — they usually do, anyway —but most will go the way of Cinderella's pumpkin. Right now, Anker cables and chargers, the Echo Spot smart speaker, microSD cards, Roku streaming sticks, Chipolo trackers and more are all on sale. And these are the products and brands Engadget recommends based on our own testing and reviews.  Engadget's top picks Anker Nano USB-C charger block for $12 ($8 off): Remember when tiny bricks like this all maxed out at a dinky five-watts? This tiny but mighty cube is the best cheap fast charger in our guide to fast chargers and it outputs a generous 30 watts, plus the prongs fold down to make it even more teensy. Blink Mini 2 security camera (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off with Prime): Our pick for the best budget security camera is now even more budget friendly. We appreciated this diminutive camera’s ease of setup and excellent integration with Alexa devices, like Echo speakers and displays. It requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch. If you just need one camera, you can pick one up for $20. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off with Prime): The Spot speaker was resurrected last year with a slightly different design than it first had. Now the display is a half-circle on the round face of the clock and it can show you the weather, time and song title. The speaker itself brings you all Alexa can do, like setting timers, adding stuff to your grocery lists and answering questions about the weather. The best Prime Day tech deals under $25 Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off with Prime): This plug and an Alexa Echo device makes a perfect smart home starter kit (and a number of Echos are on sale for Prime Day, too). Snap this into your outlet and Alexa should automatically detect it (if not, a few taps in the Alexa app should get things connected). Then you can use it to control any lamp, fan or other simple device you plug into it — just by asking the assistant. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $10 ($6 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Anker iPhone Nano Power Bank with Built-in USB-C Connector for $20 ($10 off with Prime): One of these little guys could represent the difference between a dead phone and a not-dead phone. It’s the size of an oldey-timey lipstick case and delivers a partial charge to any USB-C phone. We tested it out and awarded it a spot in our guide to power banks. The current discount only applies to the black colorway, and this is a few dollars higher than the all-time low of $16 it hit for Black Friday. JLab Go Sport+ workout earbuds for $19 ($11 off): Anyone looking for a cheap set of beater earbuds for the gym should check this out. It’s a recommendation in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds and offers a solid eight-to-nine hours of battery life, passable (if somewhat compressed) sound and a water-resistant, around-the-ear design. Amazon Echo Buds for $20 (60 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This matches a previous low price — but is a bit more than a temporary Lightning deal for $15 that hit early on Tuesday. TP-Link Kasa Smart Bulbs for (four pack) for $22 (31 percent off with Prime): After testing a bunch of bulbs we deemed these the best value. Installation is easy, even for those new to smart devices, thanks to Kasa’s clean and simple app. Just note that voice control is only available with Alexa or the Google Assistant; Siri is unfortunately incompatible with these. Anker USB-C Cable 240W Bio-Braided for $13 ($6 off with Prime): We recommend this in our guide to iPhone accessories. It’s a reliable cable that’s durable and capable of fast charging (provided you have the right wall adapters). This matches its price in past sales. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $17 ($8 off with Prime): We tested this one for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but it’ll work with Alexa and the Google Assistant too. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off with Prime): If you only want one Blink security camera, snag this deal. But if you can spring for a two-pack at $35, it's actually a better deal. Either way, it's our pick for the best budget security camera. Just note it requires a subscription for person detection and cloud storage, and the image quality wasn’t the best of the bunch.  Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off with Prime): We name this the best budget streaming stick on our list of the best streaming devices. It's easy to set up and so you can access all of the major streaming platforms. Just note that it only streams content at 1080p, not 4K and the UI is more ad-heavy than competing streamers. Apple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Just note that you'll get a cheaper per-tag price if you buy a four-pack.  Samsung Fit Plus 56GB flash drive for $23 ($12 off): We named this the best thumbstick drive in our guide to the best SSDs. It has a sleek design, five-year warranty and has a USB 3.1 connection. There’s even a small attachment point for a keychain so you can take your extra storage drive with you when you go. J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $16 ($10 off with Prime and on-page coupon): The lowest price we’ve seen for one of our favorite ergonomic mice is $17 and now it’s even cheaper. This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop for $22 ($18 off with Prime): The smallest (and cheapest) Echo speaker is ideal for small apartments or rooms. The half-sphere design comes in purple and teal in addition to the standard black and white colorways. It's gone as low as $18 in past Prime Day sales.  Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth speaker for $19 ($16 off with Prime): One of the newest additions to our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers is this ‘lil guy from Soundcore (Anker). We found it had decent sound quality and was loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room. It's gone as low at $20 in the past. Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): The top pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers was finally knocked off its throne — by another tracker from the same brand. This is our current recommendation for most people. It taps into either Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find My Device network (but just one at a time) and has a loud ring, quick Bluetooth connection and comes in fun colors. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): Roku just released two new streaming sticks this year. This standard model and the Plus model that supports 4K resolution. We recommend the latter in our guide to streaming sticks as the best way to catch free and live content, but if you don't have a 4K TV (or don't care about the resolution) you can grab this stick for 33 percent off. The Plus model is also on sale.  The best Prime Day tech deals under $35 TP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $30 ($14 off with Prime): This is our favorite smart plug overall because it works with all four major smart home assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby). In our tests, it connected easily and reliably controlled our lamps and other simple appliances. Star Wars Outlaws (Amazon Exclusive, PS5) for $29 ($31 off): At full price, this game was easy to skip. But now that it's available for just half price, it's a lot more compelling for Star Wars fans. The limited edition includes pre-order rewards like the Kessel Run bonus pack and the Rogue Infiltrator bundle. -\u003e For more Prime Day gaming deals, check out our guide. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $30 ($10 off): Roku replaced the Streaming Stick 4K with this model (which also supports 4K) earlier this year. We think it’s the best streaming stick for people who want to access free and live content on their TV. Roku’s interface is easy to use, colorful and lets you watch thousands of hours of free stuff, through Roku’s own content and more. You also get decently organized access to your paid content. Anker USB C Charger (Nano 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): This is a similar model to the travel pick in our fast charger guide. It has three ports, two USB-C that deliver up to 65 watts each and a USB-A that can output 22 watts. That should refill your laptop, tablet and maybe some earbuds while not taking up too much space. Amazon Echo Dot Kids with Alexa for $32 ($28 off with Prime): The kids version of Amazon's smart speaker is the same hardware but with a kid-themed cover (owl or dragon) and it comes with a free year-long subscription to Amazon Kids+ with audiobooks, games and educational Alexa skills. The standard Echo Dot is on sale too, but we're disappointed in the sale price.   Blink Video Doorbell for $30 ($30 off with Prime): If you already use Alexa in your home and want a compatible video doorbell, you may want to check out this deal. Note that you’ll need a Blink subscription and a Blink Sync Module to store clips and to access other features. You can wire it to your existing doorbell wires or use it wirelessly with two AA batteries that can last up to two years. Moft Magnetic Phone Tripod for $32 ($8 off with Prime): I was impressed with how sturdily this small tripod held my phone. It folds down super thin but pops up to hold the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. The only downside is you’ll need to pop it off to wirelessly recharge (obviously) but removal and reattachment is quick. EarFun Free 2S wireless earbuds for $28 (30 percent off with Prime): These are fairly comfortable, have a good waterproof rating and deliver a decent amount of bass. They’re not going to deliver the fullest or most nuanced sound as more expensive buds, but for far less than $50, they’re a fine knockaround pair. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): The Soundcore 2 is an older bluetooth speaker, but it holds up — fully waterproof, with 24 hours of battery life and bass you can hear on the other side of a pool. It's on sale for less than $30.  -\u003e If you'want more speaker deals, check out our Prime Day speaker guide.  The best Prime Day tech deals under $50 UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $32 ($22 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. The hub has gone as low as $30 in prior sales. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($6 off with Prime): If you get a MacBook Air for Prime Day, you might find yourself needing more ports than the ultraportable offers. This is our favorite hub in our guide to MacBook accessories.   Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $36 ($34 off with Prime): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 gaming headset for $37 ($14 off): In our guide to gaming headsets, we ultimately recommend getting an external mic along with a good pair of wired headphones for chatting. But if you really want a two-in-one, the Cloud Stinger 2 is our pick for a budget gaming headset. Lexar Professional Silver Plus (512GB) for $38 ($35 off): We found this microSD card to be the best value of all the cards we tested. It consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than other models. If you need storage for your gaming handhels, camera, drone or other devices, may as well stock up now.  Leebin Electric Spin Scrubber for $38 (46 percent off with Prime): This was Deputy Editor Valentina Palladino's favorite thing she bought last year because it makes the must-detested chore of cleaning her shower less of a pain. It's an electric spin scrubber that comes with multiple cleaning heads so you can use it on your countertops, sinks, tubs and showers and more. It also has an adjustable arm so you can reach tough spots in hard-to-reach places, and it convenient recharges via USB-C. Amazfit Band 7 fitness tracker for $38 ($12 off with Prime): The runner up in our guide to the best, cheap fitness trackers has a comfortable design we found easy to sleep with and a great, mutli-week battery life. The screen isn’t as bright and it wasn’t quite as speedy as our top pick, but it does let you easily set custom goals. Hamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker for $40 ($10 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is on sale for Prime members. The brown rice came out particularly good in our tests and the cooker is easy to clean with a dishwasher-safe cooker pot and steamer basket. Just note that it’s pretty small and doesn’t have the granular controls of pricer models. -\u003e See more kitchen tech Prime day deals in our guide. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam for $40 ($40 off with Prime): This indoor security camera can spin 360 degrees and has a tilt range of 169 degrees so you can keep tabs on pets and other happenings at home. It'll let you drop in for a live view from your phone, and supports two-way talk for telling your pup to get off the couch. Moft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work somewhere away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories. Anker’s PowerConf C200 2K Webcam for $48 ($12 off with Prime): This deal matches the low from last Black Friday. It's the budget pick in our guide to the best webcams. If you want to bump up the look of your video calls, we think this will do the trick. Expired deals Blink Outdoor 4 for $45 ($55 off): We named this outdoor camera the best for Alexa homes in our security cameras guide. It can go just about anywhere you want as the wireless design runs on AA batteries and can last for two years before needing to be replaced. The motion alerts are accurate, but keep in mind you’ll need a subscription to enable person detection and cloud storage. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth tracker for $15 ($15 off): If you have a Samsung phone, the company’s own Bluetooth tracker may make the most sense for you. We say as much in our guide to these finding fobs. The design is attractive and the finding network admirable, drawing on the signals of nearby Galaxy devices to pinpoint your lost keys. JBL Go 3 for $28 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 4 gets a shout out in our guide to Bluetooth speakers, this is its predecessor. It's got a carabiner-friendly design, five hours of battery life, and IP67-rated waterproofing and dustproofing. It's not exactly powerful, but it's way better than a phone speaker for driving, trekking or camping. Amazon Echo Buds for $15 (70 percent off with Prime): In our guide to the best budget earbuds, we called Amazon’s latest earbuds the best option for an open-ear design. That means they don’t go all the way in your ear canal, which is far more comfortable for some people. They’re sturdy, comfortable and the sound is decent once you’ve fiddled with the EQ settings to bring down the treble. This is a lightning deal and the lowest price we've seen yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-that-you-can-get-before-the-event-is-over-160028359.html?src=rss",

    "description": "iFixit has harsh words for Nintendo's $85 Switch 2 Pro controller, calling it a \"piss-poor excuse for a controller\" due to its difficult repairability, use of outdated drift-prone joysticks, and poor internal accessibility. The Verge reports: Opening the controller requires you to first forcefully remove a faceplate held in place by adhesive tape before a single screw is visible. But you'll need to extract several other parts and components, including the controller's mainboard, before its battery is even accessible. As previously revealed, the Pro 2 is still using older potentiometer-based joysticks that are prone to developing drift over time. They do feature a modular design that will potentially make them easier to swap with third-party Hall effect or TMR replacements, but reassembling the controller after that DIY upgrade will require you to replace all the adhesive tape you destroyed during disassembly. You can watch the full teardown on YouTube. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: JPMorgan Chase has told financial-technology companies that it will start charging fees amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to their customers' bank account information -- a move that threatens to upend the industry's business models. The largest US bank has sent pricing sheets to data aggregators -- which connect banks and fintechs -- outlining the new charges, according to people familiar with the matter. The fees vary depending on how companies use the information, with higher levies tied to payments-focused companies, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. A representative for JPMorgan said the bank has invested significant resources to create a secure system that protects consumer data. \"We've had productive conversations and are working with the entire ecosystem to ensure we're all making the necessary investments in the infrastructure that keeps our customers safe,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. The fees -- expected to take effect later this year depending on the fate of a Biden-era regulation -- aren't final and could be negotiated. [The open-banking measure, finalized in October, enables consumers to demand, download and transfer their highly-coveted data to another lender or financial services provider for free.] The charges would drastically reshape the business for fintech firms, which fundamentally rely on their access to customers' bank accounts. Payment platforms like PayPal's Venmo, cryptocurrency wallets such as Coinbase and retail-trading brokerages like Robinhood all use this data so customers can send, receive and trade money. Typically, the firms have been able to get it for free. Many fintechs access data using aggregators such as Plaid and MX, which provide the plumbing between fintechs and banks. The new fees -- which vary from firm to firm -- could be passed from the aggregators to the fintechs and, ultimately, consumers. The aggregator firms have been in discussions with JPMorgan about the charges, and those talks are constructive and ongoing, another person familiar with the matter said.
