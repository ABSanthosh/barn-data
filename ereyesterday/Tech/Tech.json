    "description": "Microsoft announced that it is making some features available for free in its Copilot AI assistant. Everyone now has unlimited access to Voice and Think Deeper, which is powered by OpenAI‚Äôs o1 model. Copilot got the Voice feature, which allows users to have conversations with the AI assistant, in October 2024. Think Deeper is intended to parse complicated queries, such as assessing the pros and cons of major home purchases, taking cost and long-term value into account. \"We are working hard to scale unlimited access to advanced features to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible,\" the blog post noted. Microsoft noted that users could experience delays or interruptions during times of high usage for these newly free Copilot applications. Members of the Copilot Pro subscription will still have preferred access to the company's latest AI models at those peak usage times, as well as to new features that are still in the experimental stage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-copilot-offers-voice-and-o1-powered-think-deeper-for-free-232723768.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A bizarre bug is causing iPhones to automatically change the word ‚Äúracist‚Äù to ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù when using the built-in dictation feature in iOS. The issue, which seems to have been discovered by TikTok users, crops up when using the voice-to-text feature in Apple apps like Messages. When speaking the word ‚Äúracist,‚Äù iOS briefly transcribes the text as ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù before changing it back to the intended word. It‚Äôs not clear what could cause this behavior. Engadget was able to replicate the issue, as you can see in the GIF below. Apple told The New York Times¬†it was due to ‚Äúphonetic overlap between the two words,‚Äù despite the fact that the two words do not sound similar. That also doesn't explain why \"racist,\" with a lowercase \"r\" would transcribe as \"Trump\" ‚Äî seemingly a reference to our current president ‚Äî and not \"trump,\" the noun. An AI expert who once worked on Siri told the paper it could be a ‚Äúserious prank‚Äù on the part of an Apple employee.¬† Apple didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. Whether it‚Äôs a bug or prank, it surfaced at a particularly embarrassing time for the iPhone maker, which announced on Monday that it planned to invest $500 billion in manufacturing facilities for AI servers. The investment, most of which was already planned, came after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/iphones-are-briefly-changing-racist-to-trump-due-to-an-ios-dictation-issue-230712021.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A massive blackout has hit Chile, leaving millions without power and disrupting transportation, businesses, and essential services across 14 of the country's 16 regions. The Associated Press reports: The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile's grid operator, said a disruption had occurred in a high-voltage transmission line that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to the capital of Santiago in the country's central valley. It did not say what actually caused the disruption that pushed much of the country's power grid into shutdown, from the northernmost Chilean port of Arica to the southern Los Lagos agricultural region. Interior Minister Carolina Toha said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching on backup generators to keep essential equipment operating. In a press conference, Toha urged the public to stay calm and said officials were racing to put the grid back in operation and restore electric service across the country of some 19 million people. \"It's affecting the entire electrical system of the country,\" she said of the breakdown in the 500-kV backbone transmission line. Toha said if all areas didn't return to normal by sunset the government would take emergency measures to avert a crisis. [...] Videos on social media from all over Chile, a long ribbon of a country stretching 4,300 kilometers (over 2,600 miles) along the southern Pacific coast, showed chaos at intersections with no functioning traffic lights, people having to use their mobile phones as torches in the underground metro and police dispatched to help evacuate office buildings.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: As part of a settlement announced by the state of New York's Attorney General, Letitia James, DoorDash has agreed to pay $16.75 million to more than 60,000 Dashers who were supposed to receive that money in the form of tips but instead, the company used it to cover base pay and pocketed the rest. New York's lawsuit alleged that between May 2017 and September 2019, tens of thousands of Dashers were misled by DoorDash's pay model. At the time, the company offered a guaranteed wage to drivers -- the minimum amount that they could expect to make from a job. But instead of paying that guarantee and letting drivers keep their tips, DoorDash counted the tip toward their base pay and kept what was left. [...] Per the AG's lawsuit, DoorDash showed a message to customers that said \"Dashers will always receive 100 percent of the tip\" -- a statement that is technically true but does not clarify that \"tip\" is actually the delivery drivers' wage. New York argued that disclosures explaining how tips worked were buried in online documents and \"customers had no way of knowing that DoorDash was using tips to reduce its own costs.\" DoorDash did eventually change its payment model to ensure \"earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order,\" but New York's case represents drivers finally getting those tips they earned during the period when the company was less transparent about who was actually pocketing that extra cash. Dashers eligible for the settlement will be contacted by the settlement administrator so they can get their piece of the pie that was rightfully theirs in the first place.
