    "description": "The Super Bowl tends to be a cultural moment, even for people who don't know an extra point from a safety. This year, if you want to see the whole program, including the halftime show by Kendrick Lamar, there will be a free streaming option. The broadcast will be available in 4K on Tubi, the free ad-supported streaming TV platform owned by Fox. This year marks the first time Tubi will have the NFL's final matchup as part of its programming. Fox Sports announced its plans to mark the occasion of Super Bowl LIX with a \"takeover\" of Tubi, including not just the livestream of the game, but also a special red carpet pre-show. Tubi will also have a Countdown to the Super Bowl on the NFL channel starting January 28 that will highlight big moments from the championship's history. Super Bowl LIX will be available to watch on FOX, FOX Deportes, Tubi and Telemundo, as well as on NFL digital properties, without requiring any paid-TV authentication. The game takes place on February 9.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/tubi-will-livestream-the-2025-super-bowl-for-free-in-4k-232831563.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Sonos is continuing to clean house as the company recovers from the hits it took following a disastrous mobile app redesign last year. Just a day after CEO Patrick Spence departed the company, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin is also leaving. He will act as an advisor to interim CEO Tom Conrad during the leadership transition before fully exiting Sonos. According to The Verge, Conrad informed Sonos employees about the latest leadership change in a company-wide email today. The CPO role is being made redundant, with Sonos' product team reporting directly to Conrad for the time being. A day after Bouvat-Merlin was let go, The Verge reported that chief commercial officer Deirdre Findlay was also leaving the company. However, an internal email from Conrad clarified that Findlay has no timeline yet for her departure and her reasons for leaving Sonos are not related to the recent leadership changes.Â  Sonos has been in a tailspin since releasing a mobile app update in May that contained many bugs and was missing key features. The company's financial results took a dive, and it laid off about 100 employees in August. Sonos has made several efforts to keep customers aware of its plans to recover from the app launch, and the decision to replace top leadership seems like the latest move to win back public trust in the business. Update, January 15 2025, 4:50PM ET: This story was updated to include details of Sonos' chief commercial officer also leaving the company.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-chief-product-officer-is-also-leaving-the-company-223256031.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Roseltorg, Russia's main electronic trading platform for government and corporate procurement, confirmed it was targeted by a cyberattack claimed by the pro-Ukraine hacker group Yellow Drift. The group allegedly deleted 550 terabytes of data, causing significant operational delays and client concerns. The Record reports: The company initially confirmed last Thursday that its services had been temporarily suspended, without providing further details. In a recent Telegram statement, Roseltorg disclosed that it had been targeted by \"an external attempt to destroy data and the entire infrastructure of electronic trading.\" Roseltorg stated that all data and infrastructure affected by the recent attack had been fully restored, and trading systems are expected to resume operations shortly. However, as of the time of writing, the company's website remains offline. Last week, the previously unknown pro-Ukraine hacker group Yellow Drift claimed responsibility for the attack on Roseltorg, stating they had deleted 550 terabytes of data, including emails and backups. As proof, the hackers published screenshots from the platform's allegedly compromised infrastructure on their Telegram channel. \"If you support tyranny and sponsor wars, be prepared to return to the Stone Age,\" the hackers said. The cyberattack on Roseltorg is already impacting clients who rely on the platform's operations, including government agencies, state-owned companies and suppliers. Following the company's announcement, many clients expressed concerns in the comments section, complaining about potential financial losses and delays in the procurement process. Roseltorg said in a statement that once access to the trading systems is reinstated, all deadlines for procedures, including contract signings, will be automatically extended without requiring any requests from users.

    "description": "Diamond Comic Distributors, the world's biggest English language comic book distributor, is filing for bankruptcy and scaling its business back in order to survive. The Verge reports: In a letter sent to comics retailers and publishers today, Diamond president Chuck Parker announced that the company has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and plans to sell off its Alliance Game Distributors arm to Universal in order to \"protect the most vital aspects of our business.\" Founded in 1982 by Stephen A. Geppi (who still serves as CEO), Diamond became a heavyweight in the comics business by securing a number of exclusive distribution agreements with various publishing houses like DC, Marvel, and Image. For decades, Diamond -- which also publishes its Previews magazine showcasing upcoming titles -- was instrumental in bringing comics to market and played a huge role in determining a book's success because of how Previews influenced retailer orders. \"This decision was not made lightly, and I understand that this news may be as difficult to hear as it is for me to share,\" Parker said. \"The Diamond leadership team and I have worked tirelessly to avoid this outcome but the financial challenges we face have left us with no other viable option.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
