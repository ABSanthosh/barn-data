    "description": "This year's Summer Game Fest will feature a new showcase for games that highlight environmental causes and make direct contributions to real-world sustainability efforts. The Green Games Showcase, led by the not-for-profit PlanetPlay, will be held on Saturday, June 7 at 4:00PM ET (1:00PM PT) and streamed live on YouTube. PlanetPlay says the event will be \"a celebration of game studios that have raised over $100,000 for certified environmental projects around the world.\" Those projects so far include Abundant Village, a regenerative garden project in South Africa; the carbon forestry project WithOneSeed in Timor-Leste; The Hongera Clean Cookstove project in Kenya; and The Teeny Tiny Truth, which aims to reduce microplastics in New Zealand's fresh water systems. The Green Games Showcase is one of several streams that are set to take place between Summer Game Fest Live on Friday and the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday. Be sure to also check out Day of the Devs, Devolver Direct, Wholesome Direct, the Women-Led Games Showcase, the Latin American Game Showcase and the Southeast Asian Games Showcase. It'll all wrap up with a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach premiere event, where you can get an early look at the game ahead of its release on June 26.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-green-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-000057640.html?src=rss",

    "description": "There will be no shortage of gaming news to come out of Summer Game Fest 2025, but don't forget about the first-ever Frosty Games Fest that will highlight more than 50 video games made in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. The showcase will kick off its YouTube and Twitch livestreams on Saturday June 7 at 7PM ET. Organized by industry professionals from the region, Amy Potter, Kieron Verbrugge, Lucy Mutimer and Pritika Sachdev will take us through some upcoming and recently released games from Oceania. If you prefer, you can also tune into the event with various co-streamers, which can be found at Frosty Games Fest's Bluesky account. To close out Saturday's festivities, Frosty Games Fest will shine a light on titles like Sub-Verge, a psychological narrative puzzle game that takes place underwater from Interactive Tragedy, Limited, and Winnie’s Hole, a turn-based roguelite based on the Winnie the Pooh franchise from Twice Different. The Melbourne-based 10PM Club will also debut its teaser trailer for REAPRIEVE, where you follow a grim reaper at an office desk who's tasked with deleting a soul's memories. Be sure to follow our live reporting of Summer Game Fest 2025, where we'll be on site to cover the latest gaming announcements.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-frosty-games-fest-at-summer-game-fest-2025-220039256.html?src=rss",

    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from Space.com: Three world travelers, two Space Camp alums and an aerospace executive whose last name aptly matched their shared adventure traveled into space and back Saturday, becoming the latest six people to fly with Blue Origin, the spaceflight company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Mark Rocket joined Jaime Alemán, Jesse Williams, Paul Jeris, Gretchen Green and Amy Medina Jorge on board the RSS First Step — Blue Origin's first of two human-rated New Shepard capsules — for a trip above the Kármán Line, the 62-mile-high (100-kilometer) internationally recognized boundary between Earth and space... Mark Rocket became the first New Zealander to reach space on the mission. His connection to aerospace goes beyond his apt name and today's flight; he's currently the CEO of Kea Aerospace and previously helped lead Rocket Lab, a competing space launch company to Blue Origin that sends most of its rockets up from New Zealand. Alemán, Williams and Jeris each traveled the world extensively before briefly leaving the planet today. An attorney from Panama, Alemán is now the first person to have visited all 193 countries recognized by the United Nations, traveled to the North and South Poles, and now, have been into space. For Williams, an entrepreneur from Canada, Saturday's flight continued his record of achieving high altitudes; he has summitted Mt. Everest and five of the other six other highest mountains across the globe. \"For about three minutes, the six NS-32 crewmates experienced weightlessness,\" the article points out, \"and had an astronaut's-eye view of the planet...\" On social media Blue Origin notes it's their 12th human spaceflight, \"and the 32nd flight of the New Shepard program.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "title": "Amid Turmoil, Stack Overflow Asks About AI, Salary, Remote Work in 15th Annual Developer Survey",
    "link": "https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/05/31/0545201/amid-turmoil-stack-overflow-asks-about-ai-salary-remote-work-in-15th-annual-developer-survey?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "Stack Overflow remains in the midst of big changes to counter an AI-fueled drop in engagement. So \"We're wondering what kind of online communities Stack Overflow users continue to support in the age of AI,\" writes their senior analyst, \"and whether AI is becoming a closer companion than ever before.\" For their 15th year of their annual reader survey, this means \"we're not just collecting data; we're reflecting on the last year of questions, answers, hallucinations, job changes, tech stacks, memory allocations, models, systems and agents — together...\" Is it an AI agent revolution yet? Are you building or utilizing AI agents? We want to know how these intelligent assistants are changing your daily workflow and if developers are really using them as much as these keynote speeches assume. We're asking if you are using these tools and where humans are still needed for common developer tasks. Career shifts: We're keen to understand if you've considered a career change or transitioned roles and if AI is impacting your approach to learning or using existing tools. Did we make up the difference in salaries globally for tech workers...? They're also re-visiting \"a key finding from recent surveys highlighted a significant statistic: 80% of developers reported being unhappy or complacent in their jobs.\" This raised questions about changing office (and return-to-office) culture and the pressures of the industry, along with whether there were any insights into what could help developers feel more satisfied at work. Prior research confirmed that flexibility at work used to contribute more than salary to job satisfaction, but 2024's results show us that remote work is not more impactful than salary when it comes to overall satisfaction... [For some positions job satisfaction stayed consistent regardless of salary, though it increased with salary for other positions. And embedded developers said their happiness increased when they worked with top-quality hardware, while desktop developers cited \"contributing to open source\" and engineering managers were happier when \"driving strategy\".] In 2024, our data showed that many developers experienced a pay cut in various roles and programming specialties. In an industry often seen as highly lucrative, this was a notable shift of around 7% lower salaries across the top ten reporting countries for the same roles. This year, we're interested in whether this trend has continued, reversed, or stabilized. Salary dynamics is an indicator for job satisfaction in recent surveys of Stack Overflow users and understanding trends for these roles can perhaps improve the process for finding the most useful factors contributing to role satisfaction outside of salary. And of course they're asking about AI — while noting last year's survey uncovered this paradox. \"While AI usage is growing (70% in 2023 vs. 76% in 2024 planning to or currently using AI tools), developer sentiment isn't necessarily following suit, as 77% in of all respondents in 2023 are favorable or very favorable of AI tools for development compared to 72% of all respondents in 2024.\" Concerns about accuracy and misinformation were prevalent among some key groups. More developers learning to code are using or are interested in using AI tools than professional developers (84% vs. 77%)... Developers with 10 — 19 years experience were most likely (84%) to name \"increase in productivity\" as a benefit of AI tools, higher than developers with less experience (\u003c80%)... Is it an AI agent revolution yet? Are you building or utilizing AI agents? We want to know how these intelligent assistants are changing your daily workflow and if developers are really using them as much as these keynote speeches assume. We're asking if you are using these tools and where humans are still needed for common developer tasks. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
