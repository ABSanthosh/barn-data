    "description": "Canada has ordered TikTok to shut down its operations in the country, citing unspecified “national security risks” posed by the company and its parent ByteDance. With the move, TikTok will be forced to “wind up” all business in the country, though the Canadian government stopped short of banning the app. “The government is taking action to address the specific national security risks related to ByteDance Ltd.’s operations in Canada through the establishment of TikTok Technology Canada, Inc,” Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement. “The decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada’s security and intelligence community and other government partners.” Canada’s crackdown on TikTok follows a “multi-step national security review process” by its intelligence agencies, the government said in a statement. As the CBC points out, the country previously banned the app from official government devices. It also comes several months after the United States passed a law that could ban the app stateside. US lawmakers have also cited national security concerns and the app’s ties to China. TikTok has mounted an extensive legal challenge to the law. In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the company would challenge Canada’s order as well. \"Shutting down TikTok’s Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone's best interest, and today's shutdown order will do just that,” the spokesperson said. “We will challenge this order in court. The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/canada-orders-tiktok-to-shut-down-its-business-operations-in-the-country-due-to-national-security-risks-002615440.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Virtua Fighter may soon be punching its way back into the public eye. Justin Scarpone, Sega's global head of transmedia, casually dropped the news about a new game in the franchise during an interview with VGC. \"We have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket, which we announced last year at The Game Awards,\" he said. \"Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and we have another Virtua Fighter being developed. And so all that’s very exciting.\" Exciting indeed. Most of those titles were indeed showcased during The Game Awards as part of a new era for Sega, but Scarpone's mention of Virtua Fighter is a new revelation. The last numbered entry in the series was Virtua Fighter 5 all the way back in 2006. That's not to say the fighting game franchise has been static since then; there have been riffs and redos such as Virtual Fighter 5: Final Showdown in 2015 and 2021's Virtua Fighter Ultimate Showdown. But it has been nearly 20 years since fans have gotten an all new game. Beyond this offhand confirmation that Sega is working on a follow-up, we know nothing about what the future might hold for a possible Virtua Fighter 6. It seems likely that Akira Yuki and other familiar faces will return, but anything's possible for the characters and mechanics.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sega-apparently-has-a-new-virtua-fighter-game-in-the-works-235417627.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Intel faces a class-action lawsuit alleging its 13th and 14th generation desktop processors from 2022 and 2023 are defective, causing system instability and frequent crashes. The suit claims that Intel knew of the issue but continued marketing the processors anyway. The Register reports: The plaintiff, Mark Vanvalkenburgh of Orchard Park, New York, purchased an Intel Core i7-13700K from Best Buy in January 2023, according to the complaint [PDF]. \"After purchasing the product, Plaintiff learned that the processor was defective, unstable, and crashing at high rates,\" the complaint claims. \"The processor caused issues in his computer, including random screen blackouts and random computer restarts. These issues were not resolved even after he attempted to install a patch issued by Intel for its 13th Generation processors.\" The potential class-action lawsuit cites various media reports and social media posts dating back to December 2022 that describe problems with Intel's 13th and 14th generation processors, known as Raptor Lake. These reports document unexplained failures and system instability, as well as a higher-than-expected rate of product returns. \"By late 2022 or early 2023, Intel knew of the defect,\" the complaint says. \"Intel's Products undergo pre-release and post-release testing. Through these tests, Intel became aware of the defect in the processors.\" And because Intel continued making marketing claims touting the speed and performance of its products, with no mention of any defect, the complaint alleges that Intel committed fraud by omission, breached implied warranty, and violated New York General Business Law.

    "description": "The federal government of Canada has ordered TikTok to shut down its operations in the country, citing national security concerns. However, Canadians will still be able to access the app and use it to create content. \"The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" said Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. \"We came to the conclusion that these activities that were conducted in Canada by TikTok and their offices would be injurious to national security. I'm not at liberty to go into much detail, but I know Canadians would understand when you're saying the government of Canada is taking measures to protect national security, that's serious.\" CBC News reports: Champagne urged Canadians to use TikTok \"with eyes wide open.\" Critics have claimed that TikTok users' data could be obtained by the Chinese government. \"Obviously, parents and anyone who wants to use social platform should be mindful of the risk,\" he said. The decision was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada's national security. Former CSIS director David Vigneault told CBC News it's \"very clear\" from the app's design that data gleaned from its users \"is available to the government of China\" and its large-scale data harvesting goals. \"Most people can say, 'Why is it a big deal for a teenager now to have their data [on TikTok]?' Well in five years, in 10 years, that teenager will be a young adult, will be engaged in different activities around the world,\" he said at the time. \"As an individual, I would say that I would absolutely not recommend someone have TikTok.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
