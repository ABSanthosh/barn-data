    "description": "OpenAI has achieved \"gold medal-level performance\" at the International Math Olympiad, notching another important milestone for AI's fast-paced growth. Alexander Wei, a research scientist at OpenAI working on LLMs and reasoning, posted on X that an experimental research model delivered on this \"longstanding grand challenge in AI.\" According to Wei, an unreleased model from OpenAI was able to solve five out of six problems at one of the world's longest-standing and prestigious math competitions, earning 35 out of 42 points total. The International Math Olympiad (IMO) sees countries send up to six students to solve extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems. These exercises are seemingly simple but usually require some creativity to score the highest marks on each problem. For this year's competition, only 67 of the 630 total contestants received gold medals, or roughly 10 percent. AI is often tasked with tackling complex datasets and repetitive actions, but it usually falls short when it comes to solving problems that require more creativity or complex decision-making. However, with the latest IMO competition, OpenAI says its model was able to handle complicated math problems with human-like reasoning. \"By doing so, we've obtained a model that can craft intricate, watertight arguments at the level of human mathematicians,\" Wei wrote on X. Wei and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, both added that the company doesn't expect to release anything with this level of math capability for several months. That means the upcoming GPT-5 will likely be an improvement from its predecessor, but it won't feature that same impressive capability to compete in the IMO.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-experimental-model-achieved-gold-at-the-international-math-olympiad-182719801.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It's \"a milestone for scalable quantum technologies,\" according to the announcement from Boston University. Scientists from Boston University, UC Berkeley, and Northwestern University \"reported the world's first electronic-photonic-quantum system on a chip, according to a study published in Nature Electronics.\" Quantum computing is on \"a decades-long path from concept to reality,\" says Milos PopoviÄ, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at BU and a senior author on the study. \"This is a small step on that path — but an important one, because it shows we can build repeatable, controllable quantum systems in commercial semiconductor foundries.\" The system combines quantum light sources and stabilizing electronics using a standard 45-nanometer semiconductor manufacturing process to produce reliable streams of correlated photon pairs (particles of light) — a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. The advance paves the way for mass-producible \"quantum light factory\" chips and large-scale quantum systems built from many such chips working together... Just as electronic chips are powered by electric currents, and optical communication links by laser light, future quantum technologies will require a steady stream of quantum light resource units to perform their functions. To provide this, the researchers' work created an array of \"quantum light factories\" on a silicon chip, each less than a millimeter by a millimeter in dimension... \"What excites me most is that we embedded the control directly on-chip — stabilizing a quantum process in real time,\" says Anirudh Ramesh, a PhD student at Northwestern who led the quantum measurements. \"That's a critical step toward scalable quantum systems.\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader fahrbot-bot for sharing the news.

    "link": "https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/07/19/0252236/23andmes-data-sold-to-nonprofit-run-by-its-co-founder---and-i-still-dont-trust-it?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "\"Nearly 2 million people protected their privacy by deleting their DNA from 23andMe after it declared bankruptcy in March,\" writes a Washington Post technology columnist. \"Now it's back with the same person in charge — and I still don't trust it.\" As of this week, genetic data from the more than 10 million remaining 23andMe customers has been formally sold to an organization called TTAM Research Institute for $305 million. That nonprofit is run by the person who co-founded and ran 23andMe, Anne Wojcicki. In a recent email to customers, the new 23andMe said it \"will be operating with the same employees and privacy protocols that have protected your data.\" Never mind that Wojcicki and her privacy protocols are what put your DNA at risk in the first place... The company is legally obligated to maintain and honor 23andMe's existing privacy policies, user consents and data protection measures. And as part of a settlement with states, TTAM also agreed to provide annual privacy reports to state regulators and set up a privacy board. But it hasn't agreed to take the fundamental step of asking for permission to acquire existing customers' genetic information. And it's leaving the door open to selling people's genes to the highest bidder again in the future... Existing 23andMe customers have the right to delete their data or opt out of TTAM's research. But the new company is not asking for opt-in permission before it takes ownership of customers' DNA... Why does that matter? Because people who handed over the DNA 15 years ago, often to learn about their genetic ancestry, never imagined it might be used in this way now. Asking for new permission might significantly shrink the size (and value) of 23andMe's DNA database — but it would be the right thing to do given the rocky history. Neil M. Richards [the Washington University professor who served as privacy ombudsman for the bankruptcy court], pointed out that about a third of 23andMe customers haven't logged in for at least three years, so they may have no idea what is going on. Some 23andMe users never even clicked \"agree\" on a legal agreement that allowed their data to be sold like this; the word \"bankruptcy\" wasn't added to the company's privacy policy until 2022. And then there is an unknown number of deceased users who most certainly can't consent, but whose DNA still has an impact on their living genetic relatives... [S]everal states have argued that their existing genetic privacy laws don't allow 23andMe to receive the information without getting permission from every single person. Virginia has an ongoing lawsuit over the issue, and the California attorney general's office told me it \"will continue to fight to protect and vindicate the rights\" of consumers.... Two more points of concern: \"There is nothing in 23andMe's bankruptcy agreement or privacy statement to prevent TTAM from selling or transferring DNA to some other organization in the future.\" The article also notes a 2023 data breach affecting 6.9 million users, arguing \"They haven't shown they can keep your data safe... 23andMe's financial struggles could make it hard to run a robust cybersecurity program.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in fusion energy this year, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s booming defence tech arena.  Europe’s defence tech startups secured $971mn in funding in the first half of this year, as VCs look to capitalise on the continent’s push to rearm amid heightened geopolitical tensions.  Funding in H1 2025 has already shot past the whole of 2024 — the previous record year — which saw defence startups raise $605mn, according to Dealroom data.

    "description": "The UK has just launched its most advanced supercomputer — the 11th most powerful in the world.  Isambard-AI, hosted at the University of Bristol, officially went live this week. The machine was built by Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (HPE) using its Cray EX architecture and fitted with over 5400 NVIDIA Grace Hopper superchips.  Its raw computing power is measured at 216.5 petaflops, with a peak theoretical performance of 278.6 petaflops. For the uninitiated, one petaflop is equal to 1 quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) calculations per second. The system is more than 10x faster than the UK’s next-fastest supercomputer — the Njoerd supercluster in London.…This story continues at The Next Web",
