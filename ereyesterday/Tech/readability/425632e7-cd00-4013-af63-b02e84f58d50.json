Discovery just released a new trailer for the second (and maybe last) season of The Last of Us, offering an action-packed view of the fraught world Pedro Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and his daughter Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are facing.Things look bleak for both of them, and the show’s fungal-based zombies don’t seem to have become any less dangerous. The trailer’s centerpiece is a snowy human settlement that, at one point, is assaulted by a zombie horde. There are lots of explosions and at one point, a monstrous zombie being blasted by a flamethrower. There are also brief clips of characters fleeing in the woods and an ominous close-up of a sickle just before a shot of someone being hanged.Interspersed with shots of them are flashbacks of Joel and Ellie, the latter of whom is intense in shots of her sprinting and firing a handgun or running over the top of an underground train. There are brief clips of other characters, including a man and his daughter who seem to be fleeing something — or someone — in the woods. The trailer closes on Ellie saying to what looks like a guilt-stricken Joel, “You swore.”The Last of Us season two also stars Jeffrey Wright as Isaac Dixon, Isabela Merced as Dina, and Kaitlyn Dever as Abby. It debuts April 13th on Max.",
