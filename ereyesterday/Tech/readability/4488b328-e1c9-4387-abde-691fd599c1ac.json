Credit: Marciobnws / Shutterstock.com Buying an air fryer can be a worthy kitchen investment, but with so many to choose from, which one will work best for you? I might be able to help. I’ve crisped, roasted, and fried my way through a bunch of air fryers, and I've found a few that I like most. Here are my top three air fryer picks of 2024. Best overall : The Cuisinart Air Fryer Toaster Oven While I’ve been a basket-style air fryer user for years, the Cuisinart Air Fryer Toaster Oven completely changed my mind. The convection heating is as effective as the best of them, it’s easy to use, and blessedly quiet (which is more than I can say for any other air fryer, ever). Unlike others, this toaster oven-style air fryer steers clear of the digital control panel and opts for more classic twisting dials. I like the analog feel and easy operation it offers with a simple turn of the knob. The oven-style door is also a boon for anyone that enjoys baking in an air fryer, or cooking two trays of nibbles at once. It’s a rather large air fryer, so this may not be a great fit for smaller kitchens. However, if you do have the space available, this is the best air fryer for both small and large households. Read here for the full review.Best basket-style: The Instant Vortex 6-quart As I mentioned, tossing foods into an air fryer basket has been my preferred method for some time. The Instant Vortex 6-quart has been my favorite one with its simple design, easy operation, and overall efficient cooking. This is a no-frills air fryer that anyone can enjoy, even if they’ve never tried an air fryer before.One of my favorite attributes of this one is its size and weight. The Instant Vortex manages to provide a large basket without making the entire unit too big. The balanced weight of the engine makes the unit easily portable, which is nice if you don’t plan on giving it a permanent home on the countertop. Read here for the full review.Best for multiple recipes: The Ninja DoubleStack The biggest drawback to many air fryers (even oven-style ones with two trays) is that you can only cook one type of food because there is only one cooking zone. You can’t put a cookie that bakes at 350°F in the same basket as a croissant that needs convection at 400°F. But with the Ninja DoubleStack, you can. This air fryer has two baskets, each with its own fan and heating element. The control panel on the side allows you to operate each cooking zone independently. So if you’re hosting Thanksgiving, saddle up. You can roast sweet potatoes in one basket and zap green beans in the other. This air fryer is designed to take up more vertical space rather than a wide footprint, so it works well for cooking lots of different items in a small kitchen. Read here for the full review.For a versatile cooking appliance that’ll no doubt make your time in the kitchen a bit easier, any of these three air fryers is well worth the price.  Allie Chanthorn Reinmann Food Editor Allie has been Lifehacker’s Food Writer since 2021.
