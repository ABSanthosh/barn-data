The resulting SAF is ‚Äúdrop-in ready,‚Äù requiring no changes to aircraft or airport infrastructure. Turbe will be able to process both bio-methanol ‚Äî sourced from biological waste ‚Äî and e-methanol, which is made using renewable electricity and captured CO2. This flexibility allows Metafuels to respond to shifts in feedstock availability and regulatory demand, the company said. Kapoor said he expects both the Netherlands and Denmark plants to start producing fuel for use in commercial aircraft from 2028. However, before that happens, the company will need to obtain accreditation for its aerobrew process, which it expects to get by the end of this year. ¬† Metafuels says the new site will produce 12,000 litres of SAF per day during its first phase, with ambitions to scale that tenfold in the second phase. For reference, a Boeing 737 Max has a fuel tank capacity of around 26,000 litres, which equates to a range of around 6,570 km. Metafuels and the broader aviation industry still has a long way to go to meet global and regional targets for SAF adoption.¬† SAF made up only 0.53% of global aircraft fuel use in 2024. The EU wants to ramp that up to 70% by 2050, which will require a drastic increase in the production of the greener fuel.¬†¬† Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.",
