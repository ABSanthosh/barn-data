He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Following a court order that blocks Apple from taking a commission on purchases made outside the App Store, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says on X that the company plans to bring Fortnite back to iOS in the US “next week.”The app hasn’t been available on iOS in the US since August 2020, when Apple kicked it off the App Store for implementing Epic’s own in-app payment system in violation of Apple’s rules. Since then, Apple and Epic have been embroiled in an ongoing legal battle, including a ruling more in Apple’s favor in 2021 and today’s ruling that is a major victory for Epic.Fortnite has returned to iOS in the EU, but only via Epic’s own mobile app store, which isn’t available in the US.Sweeney also offered a “peace proposal” from Epic to Apple in his post on X. “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.",
