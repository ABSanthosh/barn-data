  "text": "DC Studios’ new cinematic universe makes its movie debut with next year’s Superman, but it’s coming to TV much sooner with Creature Commandos. WB and creator James Gunn have been gradually peeling back the curtain on the animated series, and you know they couldn’t not have a trailer to show at New York Comic-Con. If you liked Gunn’s take on the Suicide Squad from a few years back, you’ll probably dig Creature Commandos. After the events of that film and Peacemaker’s first season Amanda Waller’s (Viola Davis) iback up to her old tricks of assembling a black ops team to carry out dicey missions for the US government. But instead of relying on B and C-list villains to get the job done, she’s thinking darker: the monsters, science experiments, and other non-humans imprisoned in Belle Reve Penitentary. To wit, the titular squad  includes two Frankensteins—the Bride (Indira Varma) and her equally undead lover Eric (David Harbour)—military android GI Robot (Sean Gunn, who also voices returning Squad antihero Weasel), walking radioactive Doctor Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk), amphibious scientist Dr. Nina Mazursky (Zoë Chao), and leader Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo). Like the Suicide Squad, the Commandos have bombs in their heads to get them to comply with being sent to tangle with Circe (Anya Chalotra), deal with their own hangups, and save the world the only way they can: in the most cartoonishly violent fashion. Also starring Steve Agee and Maria Balakova, Creature Commandos hits Max with weekly episodes beginning on December 5, with the finale expected to air on January 16. Want more io9 news?
