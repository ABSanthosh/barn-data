Melt some snow off your windows with this heart-warming NordVPN deal. NordVPN Basic is now 74% off for the 2-year plan with 3 extra months. The price is a measly $2.99/mo, which is the cheapest you’ll ever pay for this revolutionary VPN. However, NordVPN’s Holiday appreciation hardly stops there. The provider offers a few more discounted plans, all brimming with exciting features, thousands of servers, and support for all your devices. Interested in securing your online presence and venturing into the new year happier than ever? Here’s how you can get your NordVPN deal immediately. Get NordVPN At 74% Off While It Lasts NordVPN Holiday Saving Frenzy: All Deals Explained Our team of experts agrees that NordVPN is the most reliable VPN you can get. However, you don’t have to pay a fortune. If you’re looking to save tremendously on it, NordVPN offers three ultra-popular plans, all 74% off: Basic at $2.99/mo with 3 extra months – $80.73 upfront Plus at $3.89/mo with 3 extra months – $105.03 upfront Prime at $7.89/mo with 3 extra months – $213.03 upfront All three are awesome in their own right and can be obtained below. The Basic plan offers VPN features like a Double VPN, a kill switch, IP leak protection, 7,000+ servers, and more. However, paying a little more for Plus gets you Threat Protection Pro! This means you can instantly block ads with this VPN and kill trackers and malware. The Prime Plan greases the gears even more by including NordLocker + NordPass + NordProtect. This bundle is essentially a password manager with encrypted cloud storage and data protection. NordProtect also wipes clean data broker databases, preventing further harm to your privacy. You Can Also Save Big on Annual Plans Apart from 2-year plans, NordVPN includes their 1-year variants: Basic at $4.59/mo with 3 extra months – $68.85 upfront, 60% off Plus at $5.49/mo with 3 extra months – $82.35 upfront, 63% off Prime at $9.49/mo with 3 extra months – $142.35 upfront, 69% off If short-term plans suit you better, don’t hesitate to grab these. Regardless of your choice, NordVPN packs a 30-day money-back guarantee, so the entire package is risk-free. If you end up not liking it, get a refund. If not, enjoy the time of your life! NordVPN Features Breakdown The features you’ll get are plan-dependant but the basics are the same: 7,000+ servers in over 113 countries Certified no-logging policy Automatic kill switch Double VPN servers Unblocking Netflix and BBC iPlayer Limitless torrenting Apps for all devices 10 simultaneous connections 24/7 round-the-clock support, and more. NordVPN’s qualities are far too numerous to be discussed in depth. We have a dedicated NordVPN review if you’re interested in that. At the price of roughly three quids, you can’t go wrong with the world’s #1 VPN. Remember – it can only get more expensive after that, once this juicy discount expires. View at NordVPN",
