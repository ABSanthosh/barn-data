Credit: Kinga Krzeminska / Moment via Getty Images We’ve all been there: You find the perfect product, the chair or skin cream that will solve all your problems through the liberal application of capitalism—but it doesn’t fit into your budget. You have three choices: You can spend the next few months (years?) saving diligently toward the glorious day when you can afford to pull the trigger; you can put that purchase on a credit card and deal with the interest charges—or you can find a dupe.Dupes—short for “duplicates”—are having their moment. While knockoffs are nothing new, as anyone who has ever bought a “designer” handbag on the streets of New York City can attest, dupes are a little different. Knockoffs are trying to fool people that they’re the name-brand product, but dupes are their own thing—they’re not pretending to be the expensive item, they just replicate its look and function at a lower price point.Finding dupes can be as easy as a Google image search or a quick trip to Target or Lidl—but it can sometimes be a challenge. Thankfully, there are a variety of apps you can use that make locating dupes a lot easier, and companies that make their own dupes for specific items.How to scour the web for dupesIf you’re looking for duplicate furniture and housewares, you could spend hours digging through subreddits and Facebook pages, but luckily there tools and sites that make it a lot easier. Some of the most useful include:TikTok. The social media behemoth is kind of dupe central these days. You can type the name of what you’re looking for with hashtags like #dupe or #dupefinder to see what’s out there. What’s good about using TikTok is that most of the results will show people actually using and discussing the dupes, which can help you figure out if they’re truly worth buying. Dupe.com has been getting a lot of press of late thanks to the love it gets from social media. Its interface is pretty simple: You paste in the URL of an item (furniture, housewares, or clothing) or drag an image into the search bar, and Dupe searches the internet for lookalikes. For example, if you want an Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman from Herman Miller—which sells for anywhere from $6,000 to $8,000 new—Dupe.com quickly leads you to Walmart, where you can buy this leather lounge chair with a very similar look and vibe. (There’s also an app.)Spoken.io works very similarly: Paste in a URL or drag/upload a photo, and it will scan the web and point you to a list of discounted dupes. For example, it turned up this $1,899 Eames-like chair—not quite as cheap as the Walmart version, but still a significant savings over the original.Dupeshop focuses on skincare and makeup products, and it doesn’t just point you at purchase links—it pulls together detailed comparisons, reviews, videos, and other information so you can feel confident that the dupe product will perform as expected.SkinSkool distinguishes itself by offering a list of potential dupes organized by a similarity score and labeled with a dollar sign icon indicating how expensive the dupe is. This makes it easy to cross-reference your budget with the available options. The site explicitly states that it bases its choices solely on the publicly available ingredient lists of the products, so it doesn’t offer any kind of hands-on review.A few companies that make their own dupesSome companies have made a name for themselves because they make and sell their own high-quality dupes, so you don’t have to search the entire internet trying to find them. A few examples include:Brandefy was founded to exploit the fact that name-brand beauty and skincare products at every price point are largely manufactured in the same facilities using the same ingredients. It creates “inspired by” products that are often indistinguishable from the pricier versions. Brandefy is more oriented toward its app than the website, however, so it’s a good choice if you want to check something on your phone while you’re out shopping.The Essence Vault and Dossier both offer up perfume dupes. Perfumes are expensive to develop, to manufacture, and to package—but you can’t actually copyright a fragrance, so dupe perfumes tend to be uncannily like the expensive brand they’re copying. That being said, you may notice a quality difference between the good stuff and the dupes. But if your budget is dupe-sized, both The Essence Vault and Dossier offer scents explicitly inspired by designer fragrances (Dossier also sells their own original scents).Element Brooklyn offers soaps, lotions, and other products that dupe brands like Aesop or Le Labo with an environmentally friendly twist: Its products are refillable, so you aren’t dumping plastic bottles into landfills all the time.Quince takes the same approach as Brandefy, but for clothing, claiming to use the same factories and manufacturers as the high-end luxury brands it's replicating.Italic is a Los Angeles-based company that sells clothing, jewelry, and accessories that closely resemble luxury brands. Its prices aren’t as low as literal dupes, but you can still find fashion that looks just like the top-tier brands at a much lower cost.Some caveats to keep in mindKeep in mind that it can be difficult to judge whether a dupe is going to be worth buying even at a drastically lower price point. It can be very difficult to tell from a photo whether a piece of furniture or clothing is going to be anywhere near the quality of the real thing, for example. That’s where apps like TikTok that offer endorsements from folks who have actually used the dupes can be super valuable.Another option for doing your dupe due diligence on beauty and skincare products is SkinSort, which has a useful comparison tool. You can compare a dupe to the brand it’s replicating and SkinSort will show you a list of ingredients in each (along with explanations for what each does) and reviews from people who have actually used the dupe.Finally, if you want to save some money without risking a downgraded experience, you can also look for name-brand items at secondhand places like Poshmark, which sells clothes, skincare, perfume, and beauty products. A lot of sellers on these platforms have access to name-brand stuff (some work for retailers where they get deep discounts, giving them room for resell profits, for example—look for folks who have a lot of a specific product on hand and you’re probably looking at a hustling sales associate) and you can find some real bargains that way. This gives you the main benefit of a dupe (lower prices) without compromising in any way.

This gives you the main benefit of a dupe (lower prices) without compromising in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n                        \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/authors/01HF2FBCXPYGW932B49BS1SERF/image.fill.size_150x150.v1699836614.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Jeff Somers\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n                                            \u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eJeff Somers\u003c/p\u003e\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                            \u003cp\u003eJeff Somers is a freelancer who has been writing about writing, books, personal finance, and home maintenance since 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lifehacker.com/author/thejeffsomers\"\u003eRead Jeff\u0026#39;s full bio\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n                                                                            \u003cli\u003e\n                                \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffreysomers\" title=\"Find on Twitter (Opens in a new tab)\" aria-label=\"Visit Jeff\u0026#39;s Twitter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\n                                    \u003csvg\u003e\n                                        \u003cuse href=\"/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-social-twitter\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\n                                    \u003c/svg\u003e\n                                \u003c/a\u003e\n                            \u003c/li\u003e\n                                                                                            \u003c/ul\u003e\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                            \n                        \u003cdiv data-ga-module=\"latest-stories\" data-ga-element=\"latest-stories-stripe\" data-ga-action=\"latest-stories-stripe\"\u003e\n                \n                \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-ga-click=\"\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-position=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"10 Ways You’re Damaging Your House Without Realizing It\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/ways-youre-ruining-your-house-without-realizing-it\"\u003e\n                    \u003cimg src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JMWJRF6HQQRTBS3STV95WQ14/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1740427549.png\" alt=\"A pink bath bomb fizzing in water\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003chr/\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv data-ga-module=\"latest-stories\" data-ga-element=\"latest-stories-stripe\" data-ga-action=\"latest-stories-stripe\"\u003e\n                \n                \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-ga-click=\"\" data-ga-item=\"image\" data-ga-position=\"2\" data-ga-label=\"Nine Tricks That Make Painting Any Room a Lot Easier\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com/home/best-way-to-paint-any-room\"\u003e\n                    \u003cimg src=\"https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JMMT5DECDCF9T81AB5EM6VQ1/hero-image.fill.size_75x75.v1740161951.png\" alt=\"paint materials set up in an empty room \" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003chr/\u003e\n                                        \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \n    \n    \n\n    \n                    \u003c/section\u003e\n\n                            \n                    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-ga-module=\"footer-nav\" data-ga-action=\"footer-nav-link\"\u003e\n\n        \n        \u003cdiv role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Our Mission \u0026amp; Social Network\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-ga-click=\"\" data-ga-element=\"nav-logo\" data-ga-action=\"nav-logo\" data-ga-item=\"logo\" href=\"https://lifehacker.com\"\u003e\n                    \u003cimg src=\"https://lifehacker.com/images/lifehacker-logo.svg\" alt=\"Lifehacker Logo\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"256\" height=\"71\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.
