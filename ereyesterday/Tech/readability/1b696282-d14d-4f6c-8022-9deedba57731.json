General summary Google is adding more advanced AI features to Search using the latest Gemini models. Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers get early access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and Deep Search in AI Mode for complex queries and in-depth research. Also, Search can now use AI to call local businesses for pricing and availability, saving you time. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. At I/O, we shared how our latest Gemini models are enabling dramatically more powerful capabilities and features in Search. Now, we’re beginning to roll out access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model and Deep Search in AI Mode, available for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers – and introducing a new agentic feature to help you get even more done. Making the most powerful Gemini models available in AI Mode in SearchStarting today, we’re bringing Gemini 2.5 Pro to AI Mode, giving you access to our most intelligent AI model, right in Search. Gemini 2.5 Pro excels at advanced reasoning, math and coding questions, helping you with your complex queries with links to learn more. Subscribers can select the 2.5 Pro model from a drop-down menu in the AI Mode tab. The default model in AI Mode will continue to be helpful for fast, all-around assistance on most questions. For questions where you want an even more thorough response, we’re bringing deep research capabilities into AI Mode through Deep Search with the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Deep Search is our most advanced research tool in Google Search, helping you save hours by issuing hundreds of searches, reasoning across disparate pieces of information and crafting a comprehensive, fully-cited report in minutes. Deep Search is especially useful for in-depth research related to your job, hobbies, or studies. It's also a valuable tool when making big life decisions, like purchasing a new house or needing assistance with financial analysis. For Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S., Deep Search and Gemini 2.5 Pro are starting to roll out this week for those opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs, where we test our most cutting edge capabilities. Using AI to get things done fasterTo help you get even more done, we’re now bringing a new, agentic capability directly into Search: AI-powered calling to local businesses. From pet grooming to dry cleaning needs, Search can now call businesses to get pricing and availability information on your behalf — without you needing to pick up the phone.To get started, search for something like “pet groomers near me” and you’ll see a new option in the results to “Have AI check pricing.” From there, you can submit your request and Search will do the rest, consolidating information about appointments and services from different businesses to present you with a range of options – saving you time and creating new opportunities for businesses to easily book customers. This capability is now starting to roll out to all Search users in the U.S., with higher limits for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. With this new experience, businesses are always in control via their Business Profile settings. Read more here.As we continue to build a more intelligent Search with our most advanced models, we’ll bring some of our most cutting edge AI features to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers first, providing early access to the forefront of our research and capabilities. And we look forward to continuing to bring advanced capabilities in Search to all our users globally. Related stories",
