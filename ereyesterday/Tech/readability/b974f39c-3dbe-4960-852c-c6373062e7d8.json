The constant details of sexual and physical violence is not easy to digest. Credit: Antonio Hugo via Getty Images In recent days, it has become nearly impossible to move through the world without being confronted by the latest high-profile case of interpersonal violence — the ongoing trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, following the harrowing testimony of singer Cassie Ventura, Diddy's ex-partner. Ventura's detailed allegations of prolonged abuse, coercion, and exploitation have dominated headlines and social media feeds, making the coverage inescapable. For many, this constant exposure brings up waves of complex feelings, including pain, anger, confusion, or even numbness. And for those of us with a personal history of trauma, these waves may at times feel like a tsunami.This collective reaction is not only understandable, it’s deeply human.As a trauma therapist and mental health professional who has worked alongside hundreds of survivors of interpersonal violence with a focus on human trafficking and sexual violence, I want to offer a framework for understanding what many of us are experiencing, and gentle tools for protecting our mental health as we navigate this moment. Our reactions are personal and validThere is no single way to respond to trauma exposure. Our reactions are shaped by our own lived experiences, including any past histories of violence. They are intersectional based on our identities, the communities we belong to, and the broader histories of injustice we carry. They are also adaptive as our minds are constantly working to make meaning, to find understanding, and ultimately, to protect us.Sometimes, this means we feel an intense pull to learn more. We read every article, scroll through every comment thread, or watch every video in the hope that information might help us feel a little safer, more in control, or closer to justice. This search for meaning is not a flaw; it is a natural function of a brain seeking safety and clarity in a world that can often feel unsafe and chaotic.When meaning-making becomes overexposureThere can be a point where our quest for meaning tips into overexposure, sending us into a state of disregulation. Even when we’re not seeking it out, constant exposure to the Diddy trial coverage can have an impact on our mental health. As we find ourselves reading one more post, watching one more reel, and clicking one more headline, the exposure adds up and our nervous system, especially those who have experienced past trauma, becomes activated.  Mashable Trend Report: Coming Soon! We begin to move outside our \"window of tolerance,” a concept in trauma healing that describes the range of emotional states where we feel grounded and able to respond effectively to stress. When we're pushed beyond that range, we may shift into hyper-arousal, where we feel speedy, agitated, angry, panicked, or unable to stop scrolling. Or we might move into hypo-arousal, where we feel numb, detached, exhausted, or checked out.In hyper-arousal, we might feel compelled to argue with strangers in the comments section or rapidly consume articles. In hypo-arousal, we might shut down, avoid contact with others, or feel disconnected from our bodies and emotions. Both are nervous system responses to overwhelming situations, and both are signs that we need care, not judgment.Recognizing disregulationHere are a few signs that our media consumption may be impacting our mental health:Losing track of time while reading about the caseFeeling emotionally exhausted or detached after reading updatesTrouble sleeping or concentrating after trial exposure Thoughts of our own past experiences of violence arising Spiraling into despair, hopelessness, rage, or any intense emotional stateFeeling disconnected from your bodyIf you recognize yourself in any of these, you are not alone. This response is an adaptive human reaction to graphic trauma exposure. Tools for regulation and grounding Caring for ourselves in the face of the Diddy trial coverage means tending to our nervous systems. Here are a few ways to support our well-being:Create social media boundaries. Consider limiting screen time, setting app timers, or pausing before engaging with sensitive content. Check in with your body. Are you breathing shallowly? Clenching your jaw? Holding tension? Gentle movement, deep breathing, or stretching can help regulate our nervous system and bring us back into the present moment. Name your feelings. Say them out loud or write them down. Naming emotions helps us metabolize them. If you’re having trouble identifying them, try looking at the emotions wheel. Protect your peace in comment sections. Online space, especially comment threads, can reflect common misconceptions about violence that place undue scrutiny on survivors rather than those who caused harm. It’s okay to disengage from these conversations. Preserving your mental health does not mean you care any less; it means you are choosing where to place your energy.  Reach out. Talk to someone you trust. Community care is essential to healing.Practice grounding. Sensory-based techniques like holding a cold object, naming five things you see, and engaging your full five senses can bring you back into your body.Seek support. Whether through therapy, community support, or a trusted friend, reaching out to others to process what is happening can be an important lifeline. At the Sanar Institute, we specialize in providing this type of trauma-specific care to ensure that individuals and communities that have experienced interpersonal violence have access to life-changing support.A call for collective compassionAs we navigate through this trial, this is an invitation to us all: we do not need to consume every update to care deeply about what happened. We are allowed to set boundaries. We are allowed to care for our bodies, our spirits, and to prioritize our psychological safety.Each of us processes trauma exposure differently. Let’s offer compassion for our own responses and grace for the ways others may be showing up. The goal isn’t to disconnect from the world but to stay rooted in it, with care.Kate Keisel, LCSW is the Co-Founder \u0026 Co-CEO of the Sanar Institute, which creates holistic access to trauma-conscious and person-centered care to support individuals and communities healing from the traumatic events of interpersonal violence.
