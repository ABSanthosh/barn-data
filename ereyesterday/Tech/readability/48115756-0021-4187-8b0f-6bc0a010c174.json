Read Full Bio  on April 5, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Disney has dropped the first official trailer for Tron: Ares and it's a different world than Tron fans are used to. Of course, that world is the real world, as the trailer shows how rogue programs and their light cycles have broken out of the game world and entered into a high-speed chase with real police, easily slicing through a cop car with a light wall. Another scene depicts an ominous red-lit structure emerging from the sky, showing the virtual world merging with the real world. Although it's been 15 years since the Tron: Legacy reboot, Tron: Ares picks up where it left off as a standalone sequel. But the film that started it all was the groundbreaking 1982 Tron. The franchise's third installment expands on the original concept by introducing Ares (Jared Leto) as an AI program on a mission. Is this mission good or bad? We don't know, but the red circuit color historically represents the system enforcers, although Leto's Ares also seems to be going rogue. The film also stars Evan Peters as Julian Dillinger (yes, that Dillinger), Greta Lee as Eve Kim, Jodie Turner-Smith, Cameron Monaghan, Sarah Desjardins, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Gillian Anderson, and, of course, Jeff Bridges returning as Kevin Flynn. We don't see Bridges' Flynn, but at the end of the trailer, we hear him say, \"Ready? Cause there’s no going back.\" Daft Punk isn't scoring the film (boo), but Nine Inch Nails, led by Trent Reznor, is (yay). Based on the trailer, it couldn't be a more worthy replacement. Tron: Ares hits theaters on October 10. Cecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.
