  "text": "It’s not been all that long since we were defying gravity with the release of Wicked: Part One last year, but now, we’re finally getting a glimpse of what’s next as Jon M. Chu returns us to Oz for one last time—and prepares us for a reunion that portends that we, Elphaba, and Glinda alike will all be changed by… for good. Today, to mark Wicked‘s return to theaters for a one-day-only event, Universal has revealed the first trailer for Wicked: For Good, which will bring the second act of the iconic musical to the big screen. Picking up where things left off at the end of Part One, with Elphaba branded a wicked enemy of the Ozian state by Madame Morrible and the Wizard as she flees from the Emerald City, leaving Glinda behind, For Good will cover Elphaba’s exploration of the magical grimmerie and her life on the run, as Glinda finds herself conflicted as she’s taken in to become a new witch in her friend’s stead. As the events of The Wizard of Oz begin to play out, and Elphaba’s portended defeat as the Wicked Witch of the West at Dorothy and her friends’ hands, there’s going to be plenty of drama, twists, and, of course, lots of singing as we set the stage for Wicked‘s curtain close. Wicked: For Good will see the return of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, alongside Jonathan Bailey, Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater, and more, and is currently set to hit theaters November 21.
