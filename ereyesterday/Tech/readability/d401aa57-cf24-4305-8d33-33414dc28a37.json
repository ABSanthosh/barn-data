Many can already pursue multi-step goals, make decisions, and interact with external systems — all with minimal human input. Teams of AI agents are beginning to collaborate, each handling a specialised role. As their autonomy increases, they’re poised to reshape countless business processes. Tech giants are heralding them as the future of the web. At Microsoft’s Build conference this week, the company declared that we have entered “the era of AI agents.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the event, proclaiming his lab’s new Codex tool as “a real agentic coding experience.” He called it “one of the biggest changes to programming that I’ve ever seen.” Beyond the hype, practical applications are rapidly emerging. AI agents are already assisting with various tasks, from code generation and cyber threat detection to customer service enquiries and shopping marketing campaigns.  Before long, they could become comprehensive executive assistants — managing your emails, calendar, and projects. But to harness the opportunities, people need to prepare now. Cihangir Kocak is helping them do just that. A principal business and AI strategist at HP, Kocak guides organisations through digital transformation. He believes AI agents will unleash a new wave of opportunities. “We are going to a future where everyone will have an AI agent as an assistant,” he says. At TNW Conference this summer, Kocak will host two sessions on AI agents. On June 19, he’ll deliver a keynote on their rise. The next day, he’ll join Joost Bos, Senior AI Engineer at Deloitte, for a masterclass titled “Agentic AI: Architecting the Future of Business.” Ahead of the event, he shared a few of his tips. 1. Understand what AI agents can do AI agents evolve large language models (LLMs) from passive responders into active problem-solvers. With tools, memory, and defined goals, they can complete complex tasks on their own. “Large language models act as the brains and AI agents as the hands, which means they can also act,” Kocak says. “They can do things for you autonomously.” Agents can also collaborate. One might source products, another handle logistics, a third build your website, and a fourth write the marketing copy. In future, businesses may need their own agents to interact with others. Your AI assistant could collaborate with them to book the best service for your needs. Free courses from the likes of Hugging Face, Salesforce, and Microsoft are good starting points to explore the possibilities. After getting an understanding of the basics, you can put them into practice.  2. Start experimenting Kocak expects AI agents to rapidly reshape workplaces. “I believe that within five years, everything will be changed because of AI agents,” he says. “It might be even much less than five years — maybe two to three years.” Many companies are already shifting numerous tasks from humans to AI. In the near future, the people that they do recruit may require experience of working with AI agents. “Soon, a lot of these companies will ask for people who can work with AI agents,” says Kocak. His advice? “Get your hands dirty. Play with it, experiment with it — but do it consciously.” One tool he recommends is LM Studio, a desktop app for running LLMs locally. But his key recommendation is simply getting started. “Just do something to get a feel of it. Once you have that, it’s time for the next step.” 3. Find use cases After testing some tools, Kocak suggests identifying where they can add value. He advises looking for tasks where AI can free up your time — and start small. “What costs you the most time? What don’t you like to do? When you figure out those things, you can look at how AI agents can help you.” Kocak uses local LLMs for privacy-sensitive tasks, and ChatGPT for public ones — like drafting LinkedIn posts in his own voice. “It saves at least half of my time,” he says. 4. Focus on the data The real magic of AI agents emerges when they’re personalised with your choice of data. Generic tools like ChatGPT can handle broad tasks. But if you want something tailored, agents trained on your choice of data can offer sharper performance. That internal knowledge can turn a generic agent into a bespoke powerhouse. “What makes an AI solution special is when you feed it with your own data,” says Kocak. “Then you will have a solution that can operate differently than anything else.” 5. Maintain human oversight Although AI agents can act autonomously, human oversight remains vital. Agents are powerful, but not flawless. Giving them too much freedom is risky. “It’s wise to have a human in the room,” he says. “The future will be AI agents plus humans — that will be the most beneficial combination.” 6. Stay secure As AI tools become more accessible, security concerns are mounting. Among the threats are data leaks, adversarial attacks, and agents going off the rails. There’s also the risk of losing a competitive edge.  “External parties can take your data and send it to their servers,” says Kocak. “They can then use all sensitive data in your conversations to optimise their models.” Many risks can be reduced by deploying open-source, local models — especially for sensitive data and use cases. “If you really want a competitive advantage, you need to run and own your AI. That sets you apart,” says Kocak. He adds that people shouldn’t be fearful, but conscious. Closed-source, cloud-based tools such as ChatGPT remain useful — but sensitive data and tasks may require more secure alternatives. “Just be aware of what information you enter. And remember there is another, better option, of running your large language model locally.” 7. Embrace the future As the industrial revolution and factory automation did before them, AI agents will transform jobs. Some roles will disappear — but new ones will emerge. A welder could become an operator of robotic welders. A data entry clerk might oversee AI agents. Kocak is optimistic about the possibilities. “Our core capabilities as humans — like being creative, finding solutions out of the box, and empathy — will come to the forefront.” These tips are just a glimpse of what Kocak will provide at TNW Conference.
