  "text": "Netgear is strongly recommending that you update your router. The company resolved two critical security issues affecting several Wi-Fi 6 access points and Nighthawk Pro Gaming routers. It issued security updates for both vulnerabilities earlier this week. Several Nighthawk Wi-Fi routers were impacted by an unauthenticated remote code execution security vulnerability. In this kind of security issue, an attacker could execute malicious code on your router without permission. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a formula that calculates how serious security issues are in computing systems. Netgear scored the unauthenticated RCE issue at 9.8 out of 10, or “critical.” These are the three routers that Netgear identified as having the vulnerability:Nighthawk Pro Gaming WiFi 6 Router model XR1000Nighthawk WiFi 6 Pro Gaming Router model XR1000v2 Nighthawk Pro Gaming Router model XR500The other devices that were affected are wireless access points, which are typically used in office or large buildings where a single router is insufficient. This one was an authentication bypass security vulnerability, which would allow hackers to bypass the authentication process entirely for affected devices. These are the wireless access points that have the vulnerability:WiFi 6 AX3200 Dual Band Wireless Access Point model WAX206WiFi 6 AX4200 Dual-band Multi-Gig PoE Access Point model WAX220WiFi 6 AX1800 Dual-band PoE Wireless Access Point model WAX214 v2How to secure your deviceIf you use one of the devices listed above, you should download the latest firmware as soon as possible. You can find detailed instructions on Netgear’s support pages for the impacted routers and wireless access points. Here are the step-by-step instructions from Netgear:Go to the main Netgear Support page. Type your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu. The model number is the string of numbers and letters at the end of your router’s name, i.e. “XR1000.” Click Downloads in the top section. Under Current Versions, select the most recent download with the title beginning with Firmware Version.Click Download.Follow the instructions in your product’s user manual, firmware release notes or product support page to install the new firmware.These steps might lead you on a circuitous route directing you back to your user manual to figure out how to update your firmware. To find your user manual, go to https://www.netgear.com/support/, enter your model number in the search box and click the Documentation button on the product page.
