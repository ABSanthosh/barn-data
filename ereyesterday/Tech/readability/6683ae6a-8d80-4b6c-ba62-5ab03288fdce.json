Hopefully, you're done paying off your credit card bill from October Prime Day, but regardless, Amazon is ready for another round—a Spring sale is around the corner. Here is everything you need to know about Amazon's Big Spring Sale if you're looking for some deals.What is Amazon's Big Spring Sale?Amazon's Big Spring Sale is the spring version of Prime Day, although it lasts longer and features less impressive deals. It's a seven-day sale with deals focusing on seasonal items from winter- and spring-like apparel, travel, sports, furniture, gardening, lawn, grilling, storage, and bedding supplies. And, of course, tech. This is only the second time Amazon has run this spring sale, with the first one running in 2024 from Wednesday, March 20 through Monday, March 25.When is Amazon's Big Spring Sale?Amazon announced that their Big Spring Sale will run for a ful week from March 25 through March 31, 2025.Do you need to be a Prime Member to shop for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?You do not need to be a Prime Member to shop Amazon's Big Spring Sale, however, Prime Members will get more and better deals, according to Amazon. Prime membership starts at $14.99 per month. You can calculate whether a yearly Prime membership is worth it for you, but remember you can always cancel your Prime membership once the sale is over. Keep in mind that Amazon offers free 30-day trials, so you can shop the whole week of the event and cancel before making a subscription payment. You can read about how to sign up for a Prime account here.What can you expect for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?Because the Big Spring Sale happens in the spring, you're going to see end-of-season deals from Amazon outlet stores on winter items, but also on upcoming spring products. The deals seem to tap at 40% off. Here is an idea of what you can expect:Up to 40% off select outdoor furniture and gardening suppliesUp to 35% off select lawn and grilling equipmentUp to 35% off select home storage and beddingUp to 40% off select apparel and beautyUp to 40% off select sports and travel essentialsThere will be \"daily themes\" for each day of the sale, and whatever the theme is for that day is where you can expect to find the best deals. We'll also be publishing the best deals we find, so make sure to keep tabs on our deals page throughout the week.Early Amazon's Big Spring Sale deals are already liveAs is usually the case, Amazon kicks off their sales with some early deals that lead up to the main event. Keep in mind these aren't technically Big Spring Sale deals, though. You'll know they are by the \"Prime Spring Deal\" badge on the product page once the sale officially starts.Some tips for Amazon's Big Spring SaleIf this will be your first time shopping an Amazon sale, there are some basic things you need to know; you can share your Prime membership with family members even if they don't live with you; you can set price alerts for products you want and your Alexa devices can notify you when they go on sale; and there are tools you can use to see if the deal you're looking at is good or not. But if you only take one bit of advice for shopping on Amazon's Big Spring Sale, let it be this one: Don't buy anything you weren't going to buy anyway. A good way to make sure you do this is by making a list of the products you do want ahead of time, and focus on those. Daniel Oropeza Staff Writer Daniel is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker.
