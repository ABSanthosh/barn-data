  "text": "Rumors have been circulating about who’ll be the next director to put James Bond through his superspy paces. Now we know who’s been hired: Denis Villeneuve, the four-time Oscar nominee behind Dune, Dune: Part Two, Blade Runner 2049, Arrival, Sicario, and more. Variety reports Villeneuve will also executive produce with his partner and frequent collaborator Tanya Lapointe. The trade has a very excited statement from Villeneuve to go with the news: “Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr. No with Sean Connery. I’m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he’s sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor. Amy [Pascal], David [Heyman], and I are absolutely thrilled to bring him back to the screen. Thank you to Amazon MGM Studios for their trust.” Pascal and Heyman’s involvement as producers on the long-awaited Amazon MGM project was confirmed in March after the creative exit of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. With Villeneuve aboard, you know what comes next, right? Casting the new 007! (Also of interest, what does this mean for Dune Messiah, which just announced some intriguing casting earlier this week? Will Villeneuve make that first and move on to Bond after?) Let your speculation build in the comments. Want more io9 news?
