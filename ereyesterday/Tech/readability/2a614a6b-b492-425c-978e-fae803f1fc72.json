  "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader sandbagger brings news that in June \"a rare screening of the original 1977 Star Wars movie — complete with Han shooting first — will be shown at a theater in London...\" Petapixel reports: Subsequent alterations made to the film are well-documented: Han Solo being shot at by the bounty hunter Greedo first, rather than the original in which anti-hero Han killed Greedo without being shot at. Then there is the addition of a CGI Jabba the Hutt who was only mentioned by name in the 1977 release. Fans have also complained about the color grading painted on re-releases. But for those attending the British Film Institute (BFI)'s Film on Film festival in London, they are in for a treat. Star Wars will play not once but twice on the opening night on June 12... BFI says the print is \"unfaded\" and \"ready to transport us to a long time ago, and a galaxy far, far away, back to the moment in 1977 when George Lucas's vision cast a spell on cinema audiences.\" Lucas has little sympathy for those who want to see his first version of the film, telling the Associated Press in 2004, \"I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.\" The film festival promises \"a glorious dye-transfer\" of Star Wars — and will also show \"a pristine 35mm print of the original US pilot episode of Twin Peaks, screening for the first time ever in the UK\" — followed by a Q\u0026A with the 1990 show's original star Kyle MacLachlan. On display to coincide with the opening night screening there is also a rare opportunity to view material from the original continuity script for Star Wars, which includes rare on-set Polaroids, annotations and deleted scenes. The script is from the collection of Ann Skinner, script editor on the original film, and is now cared for by the BFI National Archive. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
