  "text": "Samsung may have announced three Galaxy phones today, including the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, but that didn’t stop the company from teasing a fourth. Alongside detailed specs of the new lineup arriving on Feb. 7, Samsung also hinted at a more mysterious future phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge.This announcement came towards the tail end of Samsung’s Unpacked event, and didn’t give viewers much more to work off of than a name and some renders. From the looks of it, though, the Edge seems to be a thinner version of the Galaxy S25, with a dual lens camera bump swapped in to help accommodate the smaller body. Credit: Samsung That would coincide with rumors that Apple is also working on an iPhone Air, which have been shared by reputable sources including supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg tech reporter Mark Gurman.Assuming these rumors are true, the iPhone Air and the Galaxy Edge both releasing back-to-back would seem to point towards an upcoming shift towards thinner phones, which could potentially convince users to upgrade their handsets in the face of flagging interest in foldable phones and increasingly iterative updates on the standard format.According to Android Authority, which spoke with a Samsung South Africa representative, the Edge will definitely come to South Korea and the US when it launches at some point in the future, but it may take some time to reach the rest of the world. Credit: Samsung As for what kind of specs to expect, Samsung president of mobile devices TM Roh told Bloomberg that, “The Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design.” Given what looks to be a much-reduced camera capacity, I’m a little skeptical of that, but maybe the Edge really will beat out the base S25.With that kind of power in such a small form factor, though, I would definitely expect a heftier price tag (the base S25 starts at $800), although that’s still under wraps for now. Its release date is also still up in the air, at least officially, but Gurman posted on X to expect the phone “in the first half of this year.”",
