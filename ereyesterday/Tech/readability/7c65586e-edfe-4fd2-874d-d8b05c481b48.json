  "description": "Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films, citing national security concerns and accusing other countries of luring U.S. film production abroad with incentives. PBS reports: \"The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,\" he wrote [on his Truth Social platform], complaining that other countries \"are offering all sorts of incentives to draw\" filmmakers and studios away from the U.S. \"This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\" It wasn't immediately clear how any such tariff on international productions could be implemented. It's common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming \"Mission: Impossible -- The Final Reckoning,\" for instance, are shot around the world. Incentive programs for years have influenced where movies are shot, increasingly driving film production out of California and to other states and countries with favorable tax incentives, like Canada and the United Kingdom. Yet Trump's tariffs are designed to lead consumers toward American products. And in movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelming dominate the domestic marketplace. \"Other nations have been stealing the movie-making capabilities from the United States,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday night after returning from a weekend in Florida. \"If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
