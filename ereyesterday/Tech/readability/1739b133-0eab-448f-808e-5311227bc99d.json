  "text": "James Gunn's Man of Steel soars into theaters this summer. There might finally be an answer about whether or not Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) knows if Clark Kent (David Corenswet) is really the caped superhero in red trunks, and it’s slipped into a quick teaser DC Studios just unleashed for Superman. While previous iterations of Superman’s love interest may have fallen for the glasses trick, the idea that being bespectacled could hide the Man of Steel’s true identity has always been a ridiculous notion. Director James Gunn has seemingly side-stepped that in his upcoming DC Studios film Superman. In the clip below Lane cuts to the chase saying, “Eventually people are going to find out that you’re Superman.” We love to see the Daily Planet’s star reporter’s investigatory prowess getting down to business when it comes to Metropolis’ caped hero being her boyfriend. The real power’s in the glasses. 👓 💪 #Superman – only in theaters July 11. Get tickets now: https://t.co/mznvQOysqv pic.twitter.com/fEl0B6DOOq — Superman (@Superman) June 13, 2025 In earlier trailers you kind of get the impression that she knows but this one confirms it. Now, what’s yet to be seen is just when it’s figured out—or if she’s the only one not falling for the flimsy disguise. Kent responds to her question, “Yeah, but the glasses,” with a certain confidence that’s more “Kal-El, god among us” than “farm boy turned big city journalist.” Clearly, Lex Luthor is on his trail too as he attempts to dehumanize the hero as an alien threat, specifically targeting his identity as a man—glasses or not. It remains to be seen if Clark Kent being outed as Superman is going to just be treated as a commonplace thing for this universe, a place where he’s far from the only superhero. Superman hits theaters July 11. Want more io9 news?
