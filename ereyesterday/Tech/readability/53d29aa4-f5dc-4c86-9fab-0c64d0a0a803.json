Get an early look at BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X, its three-tiered display and AI-powered voice assistant at CES 2025. Now we just got a concrete look at the technology that's gonna be inside of every BMW in the future. Meet the new panoramic IDrive with Operating System X demonstrated on this comically large dashboard. Now panoramic IDrive is based on 3 different technologies that BMW is bringing here. Let's cut to the really good part first. The panoramic display that's over the top of the dashboard. This is a pillar to pillar display that stretches all the way across the dashboard and is visible. To all people in the car right in front of the driver, you've got things like your speed, range, things that the driver would need in a digital instrument cluster. There's also space for you to throw up 6 widgets that everybody in the car can see. Here at the presentation they demonstrated things like now playing or air quality monitoring or the weather, but you could put all sorts of things up there, and those things are gonna be tied to your BMW profile. So when you get in the car, you'll see what you like to see, but when other people who share the car with you get in, they'll see something completely different. There's all. A 3D head up display that gets projected onto the windshield. So when you're driving, you get live turn by turn navigation up there with things like lane guides or live turn previews. And when you put your car into autonomous driving mode or use any of these sort of driver assistance features, that'll also be overlaid into that same 3D head up display area. And of course the third part is the main display. It's kind of got a parallelogram shape, not the regular rectangle that you'll see, but here you'll get things like your regular 3D maps for navigation. As well as predictive widgets that you could sort of swipe through to get quick access to all the sorts of things that you may need to do while you're driving. And because this is CES, you know there's AI built into the dashboard here in the form of BMW's intelligent assistant, a little emoji dude who lives in that panoramic display that answers to the hey BMW command. You can talk to that guy and just ask it to give you directions to where you're going, and it'll also tie into other parts of the vehicle system. So when it's time to go into sport mode, you can just say, hey BMW. Activate sport mode and the whole car gets a whole lot hotter. Now, the most interesting thing about this is that it's not a concept. BMW says that the dashboard that you see right here, albeit a much more manageable human size, will be the exact technology you'll see in every BMW car going forward after their new Neue class of EVs launches in the very near future. If you want to hear more about this technology, be sure to head over to CNET.com, where we've got a deeper dive into it, and that's where you'll also find the rest of our coverage of CES 2025. Drive safe and I'll see you there.",
