  "text": "The 'Saturday Night Live' cast were Trumpers all along. Now that the votes are in, the Saturday Night Live cast can confess that they've been with Donald Trump \"all along.\" In full deadpan, cast members Bowen Yang, Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson, Heidi Gardner, Marcello Hernandez, Sarah Sherman, and Colin Jost shared their support for President-elect Trump. \"We see ourselves in you,\" said Nwodim, \"we look at you and think, 'that's me.'\" In an bid to get on the future leader of free world's good side, the SNL cast is willing to rat out anyone who voted for Kamala Harris. That included Jost who gleefully called out his Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che for being a part of the \"lame-stream media.\"And if that wasn't enough to appeal to Trump, the cast introduced James Austin Johnson's flattering new portrayal of Trump in his yoked Cobra Kai-esque glory. The cast even gave us a glimpse of \"the other man we love and trust,\" Elon Musk (played by Dana Carvey) doing his double fist pump jumping thing. Maybe that means we'll see more Musk impressions in the future. Cecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.
