Funding has been halted for the State Department's Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP), a fairly new bureau that utilizes diplomacy to create technological partnerships and tackle emerging cyber threats.

Fick was the first cyber ambassador in the U.S.Congress created the CDP in 2022 for the U.S. to build diplomatic relations around the world with a focus on cyber threats and working together on new technologies. Its more than $90 million in funds comes from the bureau's baseline budget, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, and its Digital Connectivity and Related Technologies Fund.The CDP's last post on its X account was a retweet of the State Department's official account welcoming Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio to the position. The CDP account has not published a post of its own since January 17, before Trump's inauguration.",
