  "text": "Unlike Jurassic World, Fantastic Four, M3GAN, and others, Toothless and his crew are breaking the Super Bowl mold. During the big game, a new TV spot for the live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon played but, unlike those films, the trailer wasn’t already out nor was it released in conjunction. Instead, we’ll have to wait until Tuesday to see the full thing. Nevertheless, we’re starting to get very curious about this film as we see more and more. How to Train Your Dragon is a remake of the 2010 animated film of the same name, which went on to spawn two sequels and multiple TV franchises. Writer-director Dean DeBlois, who co-wrote and directed the original before fully taking over for two and three, returns and now classic characters like Hiccup, Toothless, Astrid, Stoick, and others exist in reality. We see them all in this brand-new TV spot which also gives us our first glimpse of Toothless and Hiccup flying.. Like many of you, we’re huge fans of the original How to Train Your Dragon series and some of our biggest questions about this remake center on the question of “Why?” Why is this film even happening? Is it merely a cash grab? Does it have to do with the new How to Train Your Dragon land opening at Universe Studios Orlando’s Epic Universe? Will the movie justify its existence in any way? And, will it be able to give us the same feelings we had watching the original without tainting it? The footage above looks like maybe it’ll all work out. And, surely, we’ll be able to discern a bit more when the trailer drops. Starring Mason Thames, Gerard Butler, Nico Parker, Nick Frost, Julian Dennison, Gabriel Howell, Bronwyn James, Harry Trevaldwyn, Ruth Codd, Peter Serafinowicz, and Murray McArthur, How to Train Your Dragon opens June 13.
