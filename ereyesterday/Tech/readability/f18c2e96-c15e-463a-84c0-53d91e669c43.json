Erik Anderson, CEO of SportIQ, said the process will integrate his company‚Äôs system at basketball‚Äôs highest level. ‚ÄúThis partnership opens doors to opportunities that are rare for startups,‚Äù Anderson told TNW. ‚ÄúIt positions us to enhance officiating, provide deeper analytics for teams, and elevate the fan experience ‚Äî all while staying true to our vision of making basketball smarter and more connected.‚Äù Building smarter basketballs Basketball is at the root of SportIQ. The startup‚Äôs founder, Harri Hohteri, is a former professional player and computer scientist. The sport is also ripe for data-driven disruption. ‚ÄúBasketball has a gap in analytics solutions, particularly at the consumer level, compared to other sports,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúThis provides a clear opportunity to bring innovative and accessible tools to players, coaches, and fans alike, revolutionising the way the game is understood and played.‚Äù Credit: SportIQAnderson (left) and Hohteri believe basketball is underserved by analytics. Credit: SportIQ SportIQ is also a rare example of a European consumer tech firm breaking into the US. According to the startup, thousands of Americans buy its smart basketballs a year. Launchpad provides a chance to increase those numbers. SportIQ is the only European company in the program this year. Joining the Finish startup are OneCourt, which translates gameplay into haptics and generative audio for vision-impaired fans; VReps, an education platform that improves basketball IQ; Somnee, which has developed a clinical-grade sleep diagnostic and therapeutic headband; and Trashie, a clothes recycling and rewards platform. The squad earned their spots after pitching innovations that address Launchpad‚Äôs key objectives. For the sport itself, the program is prioritising the future of officiating, youth basketball, and player health. For the business of basketball, meanwhile, the focus shifts to the future of media, fan connection, and impact. SportIQ will also benefit from targeting these objectives. By joining Launchpad, the company hopes to expand its product lines, usage cases, revenue streams, and technological capabilities. But the NBA is just a starting point for SportIQ. The company is already planning to expand into new markets, and its sensor system can adapt to numerous sports. As Anderson puts it: ‚ÄúEvery ball can be smart.‚Äù",
