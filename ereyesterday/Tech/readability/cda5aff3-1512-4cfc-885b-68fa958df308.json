If you want to get in more exercise this year, you can't really go wrong with a stationary bike. For one thing, stationary bikes are great tools for aerobic exercise, and they make a great addition to your home exercise equipment if you have a gym. Whether you're looking for a smart exercise bike or on-demand classes, there are plenty of exercise bike options out there. With indoor cycling, you can work toward achieving your fitness goals even during winter weather.The best thing about a stationary bike though? They are pretty quiet and can be used in apartments, regardless of what level you're on. We’ve tried out a bunch of bikes from popular brands like Peloton and Bowflex, so check out our top favorites below!Editor's note Jan. 6: We will be updating this page later this year. New machines are currently in the testing stages and will be updated accordingly.What is the best exercise bike overall?I have more than five years of experience testing indoor exercise bikes, and not just because I moved to a place where it gets too cold to enjoy my road bike all year long. Exercise bikes have many benefits, no matter what your skill level is as a cyclist. Right now the best overall fitness bike is the BowFlex Velocore series. It's easily one of the most versatile exercise bikes that doesn't take up a massive amount of space, the included display offers a massive amount of training and entertainment options, and it comes in a budget-friendly version with a smaller display.Editor's note, June 10: BowFlex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and the brand is now owned by Johnson Health Tech, which also owns Horizon Fitness and Matrix. You can still buy BowFlex products through its website and via retailers such as Amazon and Dick's Sporting Goods.Best exercise bikes of 2025 BowFlex has worked hard to make its Velocore series something anyone can enjoy. The upright exercise bike is surprisingly modular, and its magnetic resistance system allows you to get a whole-body workout without making excessive noise. The big front wheels make it easy to move around offering a smooth ride, and while you can use the big speakers on the front of the display, it also works great with headphones over Bluetooth. The truly unique part of this design is the ability to lean into your rides, thanks to a locked hinge offering a core workout while you ride. What makes this exercise bike stand out is its extremely flexible software. If you want a growing set of classes to give you a clear set of instructions for working out, BowFlex has quite a bit to offer through its subscription service. If that's not your thing, there are loads of other options, including watching Netflix, Hulu or even Max while you ride. Very few other bikes do this unless you bring your own screen, and BowFlex does it with ease. CNET Score Breakdown Software Ease of Use 8 Functionality 10 Warranty 6 Features 10 If you've been looking to buy an exercise bike, you've heard of Peloton. It has a reputation for higher-than-average build quality, a large, crisp display and slick branding. Peloton bikes are frequently compared to Apple products when it comes to look and feel, and it's not hard to see why. The frame can be easily adjusted to suit a variety of body types, with a frame that's easier for many kinds of cyclists to use.The Peloton experience is most known for its classes. It offers a wide variety of highly interactive experiences that allow you to see your performance in real-time compared to others who have taken that same class, and each is recorded in actual Peloton studios with expert instructors. You can even take part in live classes, where you could get a shout-out from an instructor as though you were right there in the room.Update: Myx II Plus is now called BODi Bike. Myx bikes have always been aimed at hardcore fitness fans, but when it merged with the folks at BeachBody an already great experience expanded to way more people as it released the BODi Bike. This is a great bike for a variety of different body types and offers the ability to adjust your screen in just about every direction. Unlike many of its competitors, BODi Bike makes it very easy to share the bike with up to five other people without needing multiple subscriptions.Where most exercise bikes offer the ability to do a variety of workouts while on the bike, BODi Bike offers a ton of things to do off the bike as well. The included software offers everything from yoga to kettlebell classes with everything in between, in addition to an array of spin class-style workouts and even live classes you can join throughout the week. It's one of the few exercise bikes in this price range to truly deliver a full-body workout solution.Don't let the Peloton folks hear this, but not everyone wants or needs a big screen on your bike with a class instructor shouting at you. For some folks, an inexpensive tablet sitting on a simpler bike playing this week's episode of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds to help get you through an hour of exercise is enough. If that sounds good to you, the BowFlex C6 may be exactly what you're looking for. The frame adjusts for all sorts of body types and riding positions, so anyone from novice to century riders can climb on and get a decent workout with minimal effort.With its simple display to show you your distance traveled and heart rate if you connect the included armband monitor, you can get plenty of information from your workout on this comparatively simple yet effective exercise bike. A Bluetooth connection to the bike will allow you to use just about any cycling app, but performance-focused cyclists will find the speed and cadence data it pushes to apps like Zwift isn't as accurate as other bikes.The Wahoo Kickr is the closest thing you'll get to an outdoor road bike, right down to the customizable gearing and simulated shifting. The aggressive seating position is designed to mimic a racing road bike and the resistance you feel when riding matches the software you're using. That means when your virtual ride in Zwift or other apps starts to go uphill, the bike adjusts your resistance automatically to give you the most realistic feeling possible as you ride. This is the only exercise bike capable of making you feel like you're riding where the virtual ride shows you on the screen, and it's incredible.If you're a serious cyclist looking to improve your performance when it gets cold and dark outside, and you're unwilling to sacrifice that real bike feeling to get it, the Wahoo Kickr bike is your best option. Like everything designed for hyper-accuracy in the cycling world, you'll pay for the experience. If you go this route and add in the real-feel wind fans and a big enough screen, you might forget for a moment that you're riding indoors.Instead of buying a separate exercise bike to ride when you can't ride outside, you can instead use a Direct Drive Trainer. If you're going to go this route, you want to make sure it's smart enough to intelligently adjust alongside your favorite workout apps.Swap out your rear wheel for the Saris H3 and you now have a balanced surface with built-in cadence, speed and power sensors to give you the data you need to measure performance. These sensors communicate with everything from Zwift, BKool and TrainerRoad to the included one-month access to Rouvy to offer an interactive experience like mountain bike rides. Magnetic resistance changes based on what you see in your app of choice, and since you're using your real bike, your power and shifting will reflect that same real-world feel.Indoor trainers can also be used, but if you're looking for a combination of smart feedback, performance monitoring and price, this is the way to go. undefined Exercise bike SuperlativeDimensionsWeightSpecial featuresMembershipPriceBowFlex Velocore Best exercise bike overall‎48\"D x 60\"W x 53\"H325 lbsLeaning Mode, adjustable resistance, HD touchscreen$11.99/mo or $99/yr (first two months free)$1,800Peloton Bike Best exercise bike for classes59 L x 22\"W x 59\"H135 lbsHD touchscreen, adjustable resistance, in-workout metrics$44/mo$1,445BODi Bike Best exercise bike with full-body workout54\"L x 21\"W x 47\"H 150 lbsTouchscreen tablet, in-workout data, heart rate monitor, foam roller$179 for 12 months$399BowFlex C6 Best budget exercise bike54.6\"L x 30.7\"W x 51.8\"H113.6 lbsBluetooth-enabled heart rate armband, SPD clips for cycling shoes, pair of 3-lb dumbbells, backlit LCD display, 100 magnetic resistance levels, media rack for a phone or tablet$11.99/mo or $99/yr (first two months free)$799Wahoo Kickr Bike Best exercise bike for hardcore cyclists48\"L x 30W x 47\"H 93 lbsCustomizable gearing, replicated groupset-specific shifting, and real-time gradient adjustmentCan connect to Zwift and TrainerRoad apps$4,000Saris H3 Indoor Trainer Best add-on for your outdoor bike‎22\"L x 22\"W x 12\"H47 lbsUltra-quiet performance, connects to certain indoor cycling apps, compatible with a wide range of bikesMay come with vouchers to training programs such as ROUVY, Zwift, bKool, Kinomap$619 Show more Included in this article are loads of different options to suit the needs of just about every kind of cyclist. It doesn't matter if you're in a small apartment, a hardcore cyclist who already has a great outdoor bike, or someone who needs that class environment to feel motivated. I've done a ton of testing to help you pick the right option for you, but getting there means understanding what you need.Build quality and sizeNot all exercise bikes are built the same, and I'm not just talking about the metals and plastics used in their construction. If a frame is too narrow and the weight is not evenly distributed, it may be prone to tipping. If an exercise bike uses friction to add resistance rather than a magnetic drive, it can in many places either be louder or wear out faster. No matter what the bike is made of, being able to move an exercise bike around easily is a big deal if you're limited on space in your home.Workout qualityCycling is way more than just moving your legs. Many exercise bikes include the ability to clip your shoes to the pedals, which allows you to train a totally different set of leg muscles. In addition, exercise bikes are frequently paired with weights or core leans to offer a full-body workout. Depending on what kind of workout you want to do, the accessories surrounding your exercise bike can make a huge difference.Software and featuresNot every bike comes with a screen, but every good bike should come with the ability to work with the many phone and tablet apps available for cyclists. Whether you're bringing your own screen and racing friends in Zwift or you're binging The Witcher to keep yourself on the bike longer on a large, mounted display, the quality of the experience makes a huge difference in your workout. Show more Like so many other things at CNET, we test exercise bikes as thoroughly as possible through rigorous examination and comparison. Each exercise bike in our list has been through at least 100 miles of riding, using as many of the built-in features as possible. Every exercise bike is judged against the following metrics:Exercise bike volumeEvery workout makes some noise, but a quieter bike typically means greater build quality. At the same time, if an exercise bike has a built-in display with speakers it's important to know it's possible to clearly hear the class instructor or your favorite TV show over the sound of you working out.Riding position flexibilityIt's important to be able to set your exercise bike to the riding position that works best for you and be able to ride in that position for extended periods. All of the bikes in this list are tested in cruiser, neutral and competition riding positions to ensure comfort for as many body types as possible.Software compatibilityEven if your bike doesn't have a display, it likely has a way to connect to your phone or tablet to access performance apps. That testing doesn't end at the ability to connect to a phone; the accuracy of the information sent from the bike to your phone makes a big difference, especially if you're counting calories or you want to use a competitive racing app to ride with friends. Making sure the power you push into your exercise bike is accurately reflected in the information sent to apps makes a big difference. Show more Adjust the seat height and angle: Before using your exercise bike, ensure your seat is level enough to support your full body weight. You should also adjust the seat height so that you can pedal comfortably while wearing your biking shoes. A great way to start is by ensuring your seat is level with your hip height and then making small adjustments. Adjust the handlebars: You should be able to reach the handlebars for all positions and bend your elbows while cycling. Strap or clip in your feet: First, ensure you have the proper footwear for your specific exercise bike. Then, use the straps and/or clips on the bike's pedals to secure your feet. Focus on your posture: When riding on an exercise bike, you want to keep your spine straight, head up, and feet flat on the pedals. Do not lean on the handlebars.Warm up your body: Before diving into a cycling workout, stretch and warm up your body to prevent injury and enhance performance. To warm up before a more intense cycling workout, do a light cycle on your exercise bike until you feel ready to increase the intensity. Know your exercise bike's features: Know which way to turn the knob on your exercise bike to add or take away resistance. If there is a touchscreen, knowing how to access the classes and other features on your device is helpful. Most importantly, for safety reasons, it's important to know how to abruptly stop the bike in case of an emergency. Show more Low-intensity ride: If you've never used an exercise bike before, take time to get used to it. Start by riding for a short period, getting used to the resistance levels, and making sure the seat height is set up for your body. Low-intensity rides can also provide cardiovascular benefits.High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): If you're familiar with exercise bikes, then you're familiar with HIIT rides. They require short bursts of energy followed by a rest period. You can also adjust the resistance to make the ride harder or easier. This is a great way to get a quick workout in 30 minutes or less. Hills and Sprinting: To improve your stamina and endurance, practice cycling uphill with heavy resistance or sprinting with little to no resistance. Show more Is an exercise bike good for losing weight? Absolutely. Exercise bikes are a great way for almost every body type to lose weight, due in large part to the constant movement and low impact on joints. Even when an exercise bike is set to comparatively low levels of resistance, constantly moving your legs keeps your heart rate elevated. Moderate levels of riding for 30 minutes can burn more than 250 calories, and that increases dramatically as you become more comfortable with increasing resistance and riding for longer periods. Show more Is an exercise bike better than a treadmill? While it's possible to get a great workout from a treadmill, using an exercise bike dramatically reduces strain on knees and ankles which allows you to work out for longer without soreness. It is true that treadmill workouts on average burn more calories than the same amount of effort on an exercise bike, but it's possible to work out for longer on a bike, which can yield better long-term results. Show more How much weight can an exercise bike hold? Not all exercise bikes are created equally, but most can support riders up to 350 pounds. There are a couple of exercise bikes designed to support riders up to 400 pounds, but very few support more than that. On the other end of the spectrum, most exercise bikes aimed at performance-focused cyclists typically only support up to 250-pound riders. Be sure to confirm that the bike you are looking at can support your body type before buying. Show more",

Even when an exercise bike is set to comparatively low levels of resistance, constantly moving your legs keeps your heart rate elevated.

Be sure to confirm that the bike you are looking at can support your body type before buying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
