Credit: Arturo Holmes/WireImage via Getty Images Rounding out months of daring red carpet looks evoking Bob Dylan's eclectic wardrobe, Best Actor nominee Timothée Chalamet took to the 2025 Oscars red carpet in a more demure, pastel ensemble. The night's theme is \"butter.\" The A Complete Unknown star could snag a historic win this evening, becoming the youngest Best Actor winner since Adrien Brody won for The Pianist in 2003 — Brody is also up for his role in The Brutalist. Audiences clocked the actor's Easter-yellow outfit mere seconds after the star flashed across screens, posts flooding users' social media feeds as the popular and newly mustachioed actor stepped out in the custom leather Givenchy look. Reactions were mixed, but BTS fans joked he could be channeling the global superstars' 2022 radio hit, \"Butter,\" and you know what? Sure, why not? It wouldn't be the strangest thing the actor pulled out for his Dylan-inspired campaign.
