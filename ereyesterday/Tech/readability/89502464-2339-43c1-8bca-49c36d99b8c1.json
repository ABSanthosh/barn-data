Temperatures were frosty and the fog was thick when I lined up to start, but I warmed up fast. That said, there's a chance of snow in the forecast for later this week. Dressing for a run this time of year isn't easy. Wear too much and you could end up a sweaty mess if the sun comes out, but opting to drop a layer on what looks like a beautiful day could leave you cold and miserable if the wind starts kicking up.  And getting those quality workouts in as comfortably as possible is becoming increasingly important for runners training for big spring races. With the NYC Half now behind me, my entire focus is now on the TCS London Marathon coming up at the end of April.But even if you're just looking to shake off the winter blahs and get in shape, or maybe training for your first 5K, the right gear this time of year is essential. Layering up is key, as is protection from spring downpours, but you also need to start thinking more about hydration and nutrition as you start to sweat out your long runs.That may seem daunting, but I've gotten a jump on spring product testing and I've got some great ideas for you. Here's a look at some of my favorite running gear for spring.  It's a fact: Runners love socks. FeeturesRunners love socksRunners don't cut corners when it comes to socks. They can make the difference between finishing a race happy and limping to the end with bloody feet.Whether it be for the biggest races of the year, or just a jog around the block, many of the runners on my team almost always reach for Feetures, as do I. Priced at about $18 a pair, Feetures' colorful and long-lasting socks are my go-to for training and racing. Specifically, the \"Elite\" versions of the socks offer targeted compression that helps protect and support your feet as you run, without feeling too heavy.But if it's still cold where you live, or if you're like me and prone to stepping in spring mud puddles, you might want to stick with wool socks for just a little bit longer. My pairs of Smartwool Cold-Weather Run crew and Compression Over the Calf socks got me through the winter, but they're great all year round.When it comes to keeping your feet warm and dry without adding a lot of bulk, you just can't beat wool. On the flip side, they're great for beating the heat, too. I wore a lighter version of Smartwool socks for a 9-mile run up the Las Vegas Strip last August and they kept my feet dry.Starting at $18, they're worth the money. Like the other Smartwool products I've used, they've managed to survive several wash cycles without shrinking the way wool socks can be prone to do. These are just a few pairs of the running shoes I've tried recently. Bree Fowler/CNETFor great shoes, leave it to the professionals I have tried on countless running shoes from some of the top brands and I still don't know what will be on my feet as I race the streets of London on April 27. I'm in the market for something new that's springy and responsive, but still gives me the support I need for a long race. Like Goldilocks, I'm looking for a pair that's just right.Lately, for long training runs, I've been turning to the squishy comfort of the Brooks Glycerin 22. Honestly, these are also some of my favorite shoes for bumping around the streets of NYC. They aren't meant to be fast, but if you're hurting from training, or just someone who spends a lot of time on their feet, I highly recommend them. Brooks also just came out with a laceless version of the Glycerin that I've just started testing out, so more on those later. The truth is, the best shoe for you is going to depend on you, your feet and your needs. A size 9 in one brand may fit completely differently than in another. Shoes that your best friend, or even a world-class marathoner, thinks are amazing may feel torturous for you to walk in. Well-fitting shoes can make the difference between having happy feet at the end of a race or one of those dreaded black toenails.If you're shopping for yourself, head to your local running store and get some expert advice. The fitting technology used by many stores has come a long way. In 2023, I got an up-close look at the system used by Fleet Feet, a national chain of running stores. It uses artificial intelligence to compare a 3D scan of your feet to those of millions of other customers, along with the store's inventory. Combine that tech with suggestions from a store employee and you're bound to walk away with a pair of shoes you love. Kanes are fun and comfortable. KaneIf you're looking for gifts for your favorite runner, I've got a better idea than running shoes.The NYC Half was a tough race for me. By the end of it my feet were swollen and I couldn't get my sneakers off fast enough after I crossed the finish line. Once I did, I slipped on a pair of Kane recovery shoes. Yes, they look a lot like Crocs, and at $80 a pair they're a lot more expensive, but I think they're well worth the money, and they've earned a permanent spot in my post-race bag.After the marathon, they gave my screaming feet the room they needed to breathe, while the little nodes of the relatively firm footbed massaged them as I made my way home from Central Park. The shoes slipped on and off easily, and thankfully they didn't rub raw marks on my feet through the journey home.The shoes are available in a variety of fun colors and patterns, including licensed versions for alumni and fans of two dozen colleges and universities. Each pair also comes with a handy carabiner that you can use to clip them to the outside of a bag.Interestingly, Kanes have also become the footwear of choice for a lot of the kids on my 10-year-old son's travel hockey team. As a former ice hockey player myself, I know well how much your feet can swell inside tightly laced skates during a game. Comfortable, but supportive, footwear that comes on and off easily in the best thing to wear to and from the rink. The kids love the fun designs and colors, too. Light brightJust when it was starting to get light out in the morning, we had to \"spring forward\" and now it's dark again when I leave for early runs. Meanwhile, the sun still sets before my team finishes its evening runs. Lights and reflective gear remain a must, both to make sure cars see you and that you see all those cracks in the sidewalk and all those unfortunately placed piles of dog poop.I've got a few sets of lights, but my favorite remains the Tracer2 light-up vest from Noxgear. Its rechargeable LED lights flash in a rainbow of fun colors. They can be seen a quarter mile away and last up to 20 hours on a single charge.At $51, it's not cheap, and I'd recommend adding on the optional Tracer Lamp ($32) that clips on the front. It's super bright and can be aimed down to help you spot cracks in the sidewalk and avoid blinding fellow runners who might try to look directly at you.The vest, which includes reflective straps, fits me perfectly and doesn't slide around like a less expensive version I used previously that was made by another company. My teammates would be upset if I didn't mention Noxgear's 39G wearable Bluetooth speaker ($56). It kicks out a surprising amount of sound for its size. Instead of using headphones or earbuds that could block the sound of an approaching car or another threat, you can use the speaker to listen to your tunes while staying aware of what's going on around you.Fashionable and functionalI grew up in Michigan, so it takes a lot for me to get cold. I ran last year's New York City Marathon in my team singlet and a trusty pair of compression shorts from Flipbelt, even though it was 38 degrees outside when I started the race. And I wore the same outfit for the recent NYC Half.But for regular training runs this time of year, I usually grab a pair of full-length or cropped running tights. My best budget buy in that area remains the Flipbelt Air MId-Weight Leggings.  Flipbelt made its name by producing stretchy running belts designed to hold everything you might need for a long run. Its shorts and leggings build in that same storage. They offer enough space to hold your phone, keys, water flask and all the fuel and snacks you need to get through a long race, with room to spare and without making you feel weighed down. But if you're willing to spend and are looking for performance, you might want to consider 2XU's Light Speed React High-Rise Compression Tights ($160). These superthin, though admittedly plasticy feeling, tights are a battle to get on, but they make you feel like Catwoman once you succeed. There are different compression sections, designed to improve your performance as well as help your muscles recover faster. Though they don't offer Flipbelt's level of storage, there are pockets for your phone and other small items.I think the most important clothing item this time of year is a solid jacket that gives you the freedom of movement you need to run and that has a hood you can zip and unzip as needed. Bonus points if it'll protect you when it suddenly starts raining buckets.I'm just starting to test out these kinds of layers. Two of my favorite jackets are actually holdovers from winter. North Face's Summit Series FutureFleece Full-Zip Hoodie ($170) is a thin, hoodielike layer with a little bit of fleece on the inside. It kept me warm in below-freezing temperatures when paired with one of the company's thermal base layers, but now I'm wearing it with a regular long-sleeve running top.And I love Oiselle's Essential Full Bird Zip ($98), which is made from a supercozy material and comes in a beautiful eggplant color. I also layered this over thermals during the winter. Now it's what I grab when I need an extra layer after running.      The Adidas Dunamis have wraparound lenses and are lightweight. AdidasShades for every budgetNow that the winter weather is starting to retreat, it's time to plan for sunnier runs. I've recently become a fan of the reflective, wraparound style of shades, despite the fact that they kind of make me look like a Stormtrooper.If you're on a budget, Tifosi Optics makes a variety of running sunglasses that range between $25 and $80. I particularly like the Vogel SL model ($40), which features wraparound reflective lenses and comes in a variety of colors. They're light-weight, yet durable and manage to stay put on my nose when I run.A slightly more expensive, but more compact, offering is Knockaround's Kinetics ($70). These are one of my new favorite pairs for running and what I chose to wear during the NYC Half (though they didn't get much use due to the fog and clouds). Their rubber nose pads are very comfortable but keep them firmly in place, and I like how the superclear lenses aren't huge but do cover my entire field of vision, almost like swim goggles, thanks to their close-to-face design.   And if you're looking to go upscale and look very cool doing it, the Adidas Dunamis ($210) are a similar style but feature crystal-clear, reflective, wraparound lenses that are light as a feather and will make you feel like a professional athlete. What I like most about them is how well they're vented. Even on super-cold days when I pulled a neck gaiter up over my nose, they didn't fog up like other pairs I have did. Other great gearMore sun and warmth means you need more hydration. For long runs, a hydration vest with a refillable bladder is the way to go. In addition to holding more than a liter of water, these vests offer tons of storage and can generally take the place of a running belt.For this marathon training cycle, I've been using the Nathan Pinnacle Pro 12 Liter Women's Hydration Race Vest ($200). It's an investment, but it's worth it. Hydration packs that I've used in the past have leaked, were made out of material that made me sweat, or worse, chafed and rubbed raw marks on me when I ran. Admittedly, it's still not that hot outside, but I've yet to experience those problems with this vest.The women's version comes in different sizes. Consult the company's chart, and when in doubt, go for a bigger size. Assuming you get the right one, they're easy to put on and adjust to fit you just right -- they should hug your body when you run. They don't bounce around or chafe, even when the included 1.6-liter bladder is completely full. The vest is made of a soft material that keeps you cool and wicks away sweat. Best of all, you can throw it in the wash when you get home.   For shorter runs, I go with Nathan's Pinnacle Soft Flask Insulated Handheld 18 oz. It's a soft flask that's held in a fabric case. There's an adjustable strap that goes around your hand, so you don't really have to cling to it while you run. It's easy to squeeze and drink from. It doesn't leak, and you can throw it in the dishwasher.Gels, chews and other kinds of running fuel are also worthwhile. I'm a fan of Skratch Labs energy chews. They taste less like chemicals and more like gummy bears. Some of my favorite products come from UnTapped, a maple syrup company based in — you guessed it — Vermont. Its coffee-spiked maple syrup athletic fuel gives me the zip I need without including chemicals I can't pronounce.When I reach for a traditional gel, it's generally a Maurten. While other brands offer a Baskin-Robbins-like variety of flavors, Maurten comes in just one, which doesn't really taste like anything but isn't super sweet. It takes some getting used to, but I've found it to be easy on the tummy.",

They don\u0026#39;t bounce around or chafe, even when the included 1.6-liter bladder is completely full. The vest is made of a soft material that keeps you cool and wicks away sweat.
