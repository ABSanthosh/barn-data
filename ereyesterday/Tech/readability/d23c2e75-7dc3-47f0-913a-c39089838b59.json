She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.OpenAI just made its Super Bowl debut with a 60-second spot that positions AI alongside humanity’s greatest innovations.The commercial traces humanity’s technological evolution through a distinctive pointillism-inspired animation style, transforming abstract dots into iconic images of progress – from early tools like fire and the wheel to modern breakthroughs like DNA sequencing and space exploration. It culminates with modern AI applications, showing ChatGPT handling everyday tasks like drafting business plans and language tutoring. The ad cost roughly $14 million for the first-half placement.The commercial, developed under new CMO Kate Rouch, deliberately avoids mentioning AGI or superintelligence, which are at the core of OpenAI’s mission. Instead, it focuses on practical applications. “We want the message to feel relevant to the audience that is watching the Super Bowl, which includes tens of millions of people who have no familiarity with AI,” Rouch tells The Verge, noting there should be about 130 million people watching.While OpenAI’s text-to-video AI Sora was used during conception to rapidly prototype ideas and explore different camera treatments, the final animation was created entirely by human artists. “This is a celebration of human creativity and an extension of human creativity,” Rouch says, addressing the decision not to use AI-generated content in the final product.The campaign arrives at what OpenAI sees as a pivotal moment. “We’re at the dawn of the intelligence age and you can participate today,” Rouch says, a reference to CEO Sam Altman’s recent blog. “This is potentially the most powerful tool that we’ve ever created, and it’s in your pocket right now.”The stakes couldn’t be higher for OpenAI’s Super Bowl moment. With competitors gaining ground and the company seeking a $300B valuation, this prime-time pitch for America’s attention is meant to help get the startup to its projected revenue of $11.6 billion this year. The pressure’s especially high after Google’s recent AI ad disaster – its Olympics spot was pulled after backlash over writing a heartfelt letter using AI.When asked about what they learned from Google’s ad fumble, Rouch said that “the whole space is learning” but emphasized that “authenticity really matters.” Google has its own Gemini ad during the Super Bowl making a pitch similar to OpenAI’s, while Meta is running one demonstrating AI-powered features in its Ray-Ban smart glasses.OpenAI’s ad debuts amid growing public discourse about AI’s societal impact. When asked about potential criticism of comparing AI to foundational human innovations like fire and the wheel, Rouch was direct: “We fundamentally believe in the transformative power of this technology. It’s core to everything that we do.”",
