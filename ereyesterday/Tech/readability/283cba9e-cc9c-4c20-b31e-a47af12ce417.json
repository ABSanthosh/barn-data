However, rendering typically requires a lot of time, effort, expertise — and money. Tools like Visoid look to disrupt the status quo. “What started as a simple tool for architects to generate beautiful visualisations has led us on a journey to simplify and democratise the visualisation process itself,” said co-founder Joachim Holwech. Here’s how the software works:  You take a screenshot of your 3D design and import it into Visoid’s web-based app. Then write out a general overview of your creative vision using a text prompt — “Scandinavian house in the woods with big windows,” for example. You can also set more detailed requirements like the desired lighting or background elements. Once you’re ready, click “Render.” Then the AI, trained on images of real buildings and homes, will generate your visualisation. If you’re happy with the result, you then download it in up to 4K resolution.  All of this speeds up the 3D rendering time by up to 90%, Visoid claims. The startup also promises to slash costs. A typical architectural 3D render costs anywhere from €90 to €9,000 — per image. In contrast, Visoid’s Premium software package is available for just €55 a month.  The founders of US-based construction outfit PANL, one of Visoid’s clients, described the impact as “game-changing.” “It allows us to create lots of beautiful content for a fraction of the price,” they said. AI accelerates into architecture PANL is far from alone in applying artificial intelligence to architecture. Over 40% of architects are now using AI tools, according to a report last month by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).  Some of these AI tools include OpenAI’s ChatGPT for writing briefs, and text-to-image generators like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or Dall-E for creating early concept designs. However, Visoid is confident that its tool offers something unique.  “Unlike other AI tools that generate images from prompts and light references, Visoid uses architects’ actual 3D models to create precise, true-to-design renderings,” CEO and co-founder Mark Szoke told TNW.  “While other AI tools operate with more freedom based on less information and are more relevant in generating concept ideas and variations, Visoid ensures precise control and photo-realistic visualisation — key reasons behind our rapid usage growth in just a year.” https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/03/Visoid_beforeafter_2.mp4 Since launching in 2023, Visoid has attracted customers in over 80 countries and generated more than 2.7 million images, with over 500,000 uploaded to its platform, the company said.  The startup’s progress caught the attention of VC firm Antler, which participated in the new seed funding round.  “The fact that they have reached a high ARR [annual recurring revenue] and attracted users from around the world while having spent very little money on marketing shows they have built something that creates real value for their customers,” said Anna Munthe-Kaas, associate partner at Antler. Antler contributed to Visoid’s new funding alongside lead investor StartupLab, a Norwegian startup incubator and investor and construction giant OBOS.  Visoid will use the fresh capital to expand its team and reach new clients. Among the recent additions to the customer base is the Nordic Office of Architecture. One of Scandinavia’s leading architecture practices, the company has led mega projects including the new Oslo Airport and Norway’s Government Quarter.",
