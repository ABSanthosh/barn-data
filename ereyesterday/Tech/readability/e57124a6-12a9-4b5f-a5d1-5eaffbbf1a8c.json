Right now, you can get it on sale for just $53 (down from $59) but with an additional 10% coupon, you can lower the price even further to an unbelievable $48.50. This is the cheapest price ever for this model, and if you compare any offer or comparison website, you simply won’t find a better deal anywhere. See at Amazon Massive 25,000mAh Capacity INIU is already a well-known brand in smartphone charging with over 40 million users across the globe relying on it for quality. But this power bank is different: With a colossal 25,000mAh capacity, it’s not just intended for phones and tablets but laptops too. With its huge 100W output, you can charge power-hungry devices like MacBooks, high-end Windows laptops and even gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck at full velocity when you’re away. What’s great with the INIU 100W power bank is that the dual USB-C output also allows you to charge two USB-C devices simultaneously, be that your phone and laptop, or your tablet and wireless earbuds. The USB-C port’s not just for output, either—it’s also for fast recharging of the power bank itself with a 65W input filling you up in a flash. This power bank is crafted for travelers: It has a 25,000mAh battery that’s large enough to charge multiple devices all day but remains compact and airplane-approved so you can take it with you in your carry-on on long flights or layovers. If you work remotely or just like to have a backup on a road trip, this charger ensures you will never be low on battery. This INIU charger is the one-and-done charging powerhouse for anyone who expects rock-solid, high-speed power anywhere. At its record-low cost of $48.50 after coupon on Amazon, there’s just no better deal available today. See at Amazon",
