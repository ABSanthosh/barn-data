Now, British carmaker McMurtry has turned that wild idea into a reality for the first time. In a stunt that would make Batman jealous, McMurtry drove its insanely fast electric Spéirling flipped over. More impressively, it did that for over a minute while keeping the vehicle completely stationary — save for a quick acceleration to prove the car wasn’t tied down.  While it might look like the car has defied gravity, in reality, it’s basic physics coupled with some clever engineering.  To drive upside down using conventional aerodynamics, an F1-style car would need to hit at least 100–150 mph to generate enough downforce to exceed its own weight and “stick” to the ceiling.   But the Spéirling is a fan car. Twin electric turbines positioned behind the cockpit of the vehicle pull air from under the chassis and expel it through a rear-mounted exhaust system, creating a low-pressure zone underneath that presses the car onto the road. This system means the Spéirling can generate 2,000kg of downforce on demand. That’s great for grip in high-speed turns, but it also means the 1,000kg car can hang upside down, even when standing still.  That’s how McMurtry’s co-founder Thomas Yates was able to drive the Spéirling onto a rotating rig, flip it 180 degrees upside down, and have it stay there. No wires. No magnets. Just an insane amount of downforce.  The route to public roads for McMurtry McMurtry steered the Spéirling up a ramp and drove it upside down. Credit: McMurtry While this was just a stunt — for now — one can’t help but wonder what the future might hold. Stuck in tunnel traffic? Just drive up the wall, flip upside down, and cruise on the ceiling. Goodbye, gridlock.  The Spéirling Pure, the company’s first commercially available vehicle, is set to go on sale next year for £895,000. So, technically, you could try upside-down driving yourself.  “That said, customers are strongly advised not to try [driving upside down] at home,” a McMurtry spokesperson told TNW. If you’re mad enough to give it a go, McMurtry recommends contacting the company directly to discuss “pre-flight checks, preparation and safety equipment, and controlled demonstration environments.” For now, though, McMurtry is preoccupied with smashing records the right side up. On the same day as the Batmobile-like stunt, the Spéirling beat the all-time Top Gear track record by 3.1 seconds, dethroning a Renault F1 car at the top of the leaderboard. The McMurtry Spéirling’s fan-based tech gives it incredible grip in corners. It’s no slouch, either. Dual electric motors — one for each rear wheel — deliver over 1,000 horsepower combined. Paired with a featherweight chassis, this allows the car to clock 0–60mph in 1.5 seconds.",
