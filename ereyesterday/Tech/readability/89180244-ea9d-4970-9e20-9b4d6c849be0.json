There’s the Solterra, now in its third model year, and the upcoming Trailseeker, which promises to be the Outback to the Solterra’s Impreza when it comes out in 2026.Now we can add a new member to the lineup. The 2026 Subaru Uncharted is an electric crossover SUV that like the Solterra and Trailseeker is built on Toyota’s E-TNGA platform. When it comes out next year, the Uncharted will have more than 300 miles of estimated range, 338 horsepower, and a sporty style befitting one of America’s favorite outdoor automotive brands.With Uncharted, Subaru finally seems like it’s ready to pick up the pace on electrification. Subaru and EVs always seem like a good fit — its customers are a little bit crunchy and enjoy darting up rugged trails in AWD vehicles — so it’s a little confusing that the brand has taken so long to come around to the technology. But with a heavy lift by Toyota, Subaru is making good on lost time.That said, Subaru is sticking to a pretty familiar template with the Uncharted. The compact crossover will have dual motors for AWD, 338 horsepower, and a 0–60mph acceleration time under 5 seconds on the Sport and GT trims. All that on top of Subaru’s finely tuned suspension for more refined handling.How does the Uncharted stack up against Subaru’s flagship EV? It’s shorter than the Solterra by nearly 7 inches but offers more cargo capacity, with over 25 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row (the Solterra only has 23.8 cubic feet of cargo, or 63.5 cubic feet with the second row folded flat).The 74.7kWh battery will provide an estimated 290 miles of range on Sport and GT trims with AWD, and over 300 miles on the front-wheel drive version, which comes with 228 horsepower and a lower price point. The Uncharted will come with a standard NACS charging port for access to Tesla Supercharger stations. Subaru claims 10–80 percent charging in under 30 minutes, thanks to battery preconditioning features. Though charging at Tesla’s V3 Superchargers and higher will probably be a little bit slower than expected, as the Uncharted only supports charging speeds of up to 150kW.Inside, the 14-inch infotainment screen supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connections. The center console features twin wireless charging pads that come standard on all trims. And even though climate functions appear on the center touchscreen, there are a fair share of physical buttons, especially around the center-mounted gear shifter.In appearance, the Uncharted looks similar to the recently revealed Toyota C-HR. Given their shared tech and architecture, it’s likely that the Uncharted is basically a cousin to the C-HR. (A Subaru spokesperson didn’t respond to questions about the shared platform.)Subaru still distinguishes itself, thanks to its iconic badging and reputation among a certain segment of nature-seeking urban and suburban dwellers. The Solterra has been a surprise hit for the Japanese automaker, selling 3,131 units in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 1,147 in Q1 last year. That’s a 173 percent increase year over year.Subaru is certainly counting on 2026 being a breakout year for its nascent EV business. But with federal incentives evaporating and tariffs conspiring to jack up prices, the company will have to push extra hard if it hopes to keep up the momentum.",
