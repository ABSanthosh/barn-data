The latest setback: Current Tesla drivers are ending their relationship with the brand in record numbers.In March 2025, the number of used Tesla vehicles for sale on the popular automotive marketplace Autotrader reached a record level, according to new data from its parent company Cox Automotive. This development was first reported by Sherwood.In the last week of March, more than 13,000 Tesla electric vehicles were listed for sale on the online used car marketplace, setting a new record high for Tesla EVs. That's a 67 percent increase year-over-year in listings for used Teslas.Further emphasizing Tesla's problems, this isn't an industry-wide trend; rather, it's a problem with Teslas specifically. Cox's data shows that the number of used Teslas listed for sale rose more than any other auto company's vehicles. Mashable Light Speed And as supply increases, the price of used Teslas will likely continue to fall. As Mashable previously reported, the value of used Teslas has been steadily decreasing by thousands of dollars. In addition, Forbes reported last month that the value of a used Tesla Model Y has dropped by $6,000 on average in the past year.It gets worse: Sales of brand new Teslas are also plummeting around the globe. In Germany, for example, Tesla sales have fallen by 76 percent. Tesla owners looking to trade-in their vehicles have also ballooned, with the company now reportedly turning away Cybertruck owners who want to trade their vehicle.Tesla CEO Elon Musk plays a controversial role in the Trump administration, and it's increasingly clear that Tesla customers are rejecting Musk through Tesla.Over the past year, Tesla protests have appeared all over the world as people voice their dissatisfaction with Musk's close relationship with President Donald Trump and his role with DOGE. Through DOGE, Musk has spearheaded massive cuts in federal funding to important medical research and global welfare programs. Combined with growing competition in the EV market from other carmakers, Tesla has found waning interest in the brand — even among their own customers.Keep checking Mashable for our latest tariff news and explainers, from delayed Nintendo Switch 2 preorders to reports of iPhone 16 panic buying.",
