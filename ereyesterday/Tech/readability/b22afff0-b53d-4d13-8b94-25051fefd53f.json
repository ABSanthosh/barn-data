  "text": "While it seems like everyone is streaming these days, nothing is actually better than owning the movies you love. And for that, you'll want physical media. But DVDs are outdated and low quality. These days, most people should have a nice 4K HD television in their home, which means the best picture quality you can get for television series and movies. Luckily for you, Amazon has its big Spring Sale event going on right now, and there are a ton of 4K Blu-rays available for $13 or less on Amazon until March 31.No matter what you're a fan of, with dozens of titles on sale right now, you're bound to find something you'll love. And with these super low prices, it's a great time to stock up on your favorites if you don't already have them, pick up some new recommendations from friends and family, or just take a chance on something new that you might have heard great things about. Since these 4K Blu-rays are physical discs that you'll buy, you also won't have to worry about no longer being able to access them at some point in the future, unless your Blu-ray player (like a PlayStation 5) breaks down. And again, with 4K Blu-ray quality, you're getting the absolute best picture possible, even possibly beating the quality you'd get from streaming.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.I personally love some animated films, especially Disney, like The Lion King, which you can grab for just $13 instead of $35. I also grew up with The Little Mermaid, which is now also down to $12 from $39. Though Lightyear didn't seem like a big hit, I personally enjoyed it for what it's worth, and it's down to just $11 from $35. Though it's not Disney, I am also a huge fan of the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, and you can get all three movies in a single disc for just $12, down from $30 — incredible steal! Top deals available today, according to CNET's shopping experts Curated discounts worth shopping while they last Not a fan of animated films? That's fine too. There are plenty of non-animated stuff on sale as well, like the classic American Psycho, now down to $14 from $22, which is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. Everything Everywhere All At Once is also a fantastic film that came out in recent years that is a masterpiece in its own right, and you can add it to your collection for just $14, down from $19. Dogfight fans will love having Top Gun: Maverick on their shelves, and now it's just $15, down from $26. M3GAN is also a surprise hit from Blumhouse, and it's just $18, down from $30. And while this is just a regular Blu-ray and not 4K, the entire Back to the Future trilogy can be obtained for just $16, originally $24.Why this deal mattersThough streaming has exploded in popularity, it seems we now have too many streaming services and it's harder to find the content you want to watch on the services you subscribe to. Not everyone wants to subscribe to every single streaming service (it's just cable all over again), and it's a pain when the content you want is no longer available on a particular service. That's why buying physical media is getting popular again, and Amazon's Spring Sale lets you stock up on 4K Blu-rays for cheap.",
