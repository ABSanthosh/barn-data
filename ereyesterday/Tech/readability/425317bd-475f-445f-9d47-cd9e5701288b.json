  "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering SpaceX to conduct a mishap investigation into what caused the company's Starship rocket to explode mid-flight on January 16. Until the FAA approves SpaceX's investigation reported, the company won't be allowed to proceed with future Starship missions. SpaceX's launch seemed to be going as planned prior to the explosion. Starship successfully made it off the launch pad and SpaceX was even able to catch the ship's boosters. But then, only eight and a half minutes after taking off, the Starship spacecraft exploded, according to SpaceX's post-launch blog post. In response to the sudden explosion, the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and slowed or diverted nearby flights to prevent further accidents, severely delaying flights from multiple airlines, according to CNBC. Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed! ✨ pic.twitter.com/nn3PiP8XwG— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2025 The FAA's statement says that no one was injured by the falling debris but that its working \"to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\" The mishap investigation SpaceX performs will have to determine not only what caused the explosion, but also what corrective actions the company needs to take to prevent it from happening again. \"Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship,\" SpaceX says. This isn't the first time Starship has met an explosive end. Multiple Starship launches have ended with either SpaceX's boosters, the Starship spacecraft or both exploding. The company does appear to be getting better at catching and reusing its Super Heavy boosters, however. The successful catch that preceded the January 16 explosion is only the second time SpaceX has pulled it off. Its first successful Super Heavy catch was in October 2024.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-faa-is-grounding-spacexs-starship-after-its-latest-explosion-223535001.html?src=rss",
