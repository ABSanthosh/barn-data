  "text": "Overview Table of Contents Just like the continuous stream of new Kindles and Fire TV devices, Amazon has an ever-growing list of Echo devices — Echo Dot, Echo Show, Echo Auto, and now the Echo Spot alarm clock. Many of these devices also have multiple generations, and it's a lot to keep straight. So, we're here to help pull you out of that Echo chamber and find the best Echo devices for your smart home.Keep in mind, you don't need to buy these devices at full price. They're guaranteed to go on sale during events like Prime Day and Black Friday. During Black Friday sales, we saw discounts of up to 58% on devices like the Echo Pop, Dot, and Spot. So if you are going to buy an Amazon smart home device, it's worth holding out until the next big event.What can an Echo smart speaker do? Tring out the new Echo Spot smart alarm clock. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable All Echo devices are designed to utilize Amazon Alexa's AI superpowers — it's just a matter of which form you want your Echo to take. The Echo and Echo Dot are smart speakers, which you can use for music, phone calls, calendar reminders, or news alerts. Amazon Echo Show devices, on the other hand, can do all of the aforementioned audio stuff, but they also boast colorful displays for making video calls, streaming entertainment, or managing your day. Think of Echo Shows as tiny and more affordable tablets, essentially. Most Echo devices are designed to act as smart hubs within your home, but some Echo devices can also be taken on the road. Echo Auto brings hands-free Alexa functionality to the car, while Echo Buds and Echo Frames can travel with you anywhere.Read on for the 10 best Amazon Echo devices of 2024 so that you can make an informed, stress-free Echo purchase. Read our full review of the Echo (4th Gen) here.If you're just looking to get your foot in the door of the whole Alexa-driven smart home game, the Amazon Echo is a great place to start. It's about as basic as a latest-model Echo device gets these days, adhering to the main tenets of what an Echo was meant to be from the start: A sleek little speaker that responds to your voice commands.That's not to say, however, that this isn't still one of the best Amazon Echo devices out there. Now in its 4th generation, its spherical form looks good in any setting (and in your choice of a few different colors too), and it delivers premium Dolby sound whether you're streaming music or just getting the latest weather update. Plus, you can easily connect your other smart home devices to this one central hub so that you can control all your little tech minions with your voice alone. It even has a built-in temperature sensor that can work in conjunction with your smart thermostat, and motion detection that can be used to automatically turn lights on when you walk into a room. Another cool feature is the ability to \"Drop-In\" on the Echo devices of your loved ones. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Echo Dot (5th Gen) here. Looking suspiciously similar to the baseline Echo, the Echo Dot is just about the same as its spherical older brother, except in a smaller form. While the Echo stands just over 5 inches tall, the Echo Dot is a more squat 3.5 inches, making it better suited for a bedside table, shelf, home office setup.Now in its 5th generation, the Echo Dot boasts more vibrant sound with clearer vocals and deeper bass, though it does not have Dolby audio like the latest-model Echo. It also only has one front-firing speaker as compared to the Echo's two plus a woofer. However, the Echo Dot does have the same built-in mic and in-app privacy controls as the Echo, as well as a temperature sensor and motion detector to help automate other smart home devices. Amazon takes smart home functioning quite seriously with its Dot: If you enable sound detection routines, for instance, you can program a particular sound (dog barking, oven dinging, door opening) to trigger a certain Alexa Routine. The Good The Bad Details Who it's for:Whether you want an Echo smart speaker in every room or just need a smarter alarm clock, the 2024 Echo Spot is made for your bedside. It has programmable routines to queue your morning wake-up and evening wind-down. Plus, it responds quickly and clearly to Alexa commands, so you can play music from the speaker without opening your phone or ask for a weather report as you're getting dressed.Why we like it:The 2024 Echo Spot improves about the previous models' shortcomings, creating an easy-to-use smart alarm clock that's both useful and good-looking. It's bigger than both the Echo Pop and Echo Dot; at 4.5-inches by 4.1-inches by 4.4-inches, it takes up just the right amount of nightstand space without overcrowding.Slanted at a slight angle, the upper half of the clock face features a small touchscreen. While we think it's a little too small, it still has vibrant colors. The bottom half is a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, the same that comes in the Echo Dot. The speaker produces clear audio that doesn't sound tinny, however, it's meant for small spaces — don't plan on using it for your next party. Alexa also answers quickly to questions and commands, making it easy to turn on a podcast to kick off your morning.The alarm function works like any daily alarm clock. Snoozing is easy: Tap the top of the device with more than one finger to get another few minutes of rest. Meanwhile, turning off the alarm is slightly more annoying, requiring you to interact with the touchscreen. While it works fine, it would feel more natural to have a \"Stop\" button on top.The touch screen is rather minuscule and limited to the small rectangular space on the half-moon top of the clock face. Another big drawback of the Echo Spot comes when you're playing music or listening to a podcast. When audio is playing, the time disappears — a hinderance if you need to know what time it is.Otherwise, the Echo Spot is a worth entry into the Echo line of devices, offering a well-designed smart alarm clock. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) here.The Echo Show 10 sits at the crossroads of great audio and visual content delivery, but it is considerably larger than other Echo devices. With a 10-inch display, the Echo Show 10 is much more than just a larger screen to enjoy Alexa's AI and video calls with loved ones. In fact, its whole form is different. Whereas the Echo Show 8 is a bit boxy, the Echo Show 10 boasts a slimmer screen perched atop a speaker, a cue that the Echo Show 10 is the superior choice when it comes to audio. It almost looks like an Amazon Fire tablet slapped on top of an Echo Dot, but we promise it's more sophisticated than that.One of the Echo Show 10's coolest features is that its HD screen moves with you. Whether you're on a video call or following a recipe while moving around the kitchen, the screen will turn to face you. You can also utilize this functionality to look around the entire room while you're away from home. Not only are the views multidirectional, but the Echo Show 10 also delivers premium, directional audio that can really fill a room. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Echo Pop (1st Gen) here.If you want to keep up-do-date on the latest versions of Amazon Echo devices, the 1st Gen Echo Pop is a solid choice to go with (given the fact that it was rolled out in May 2023). It's a fresh product, there's no arguing with that; however, we don't think the Echo Pop differs much from the 2022 5th Gen Echo Dot, which retails for only $10 more. One time we would recommend it over the Echo Dot? When it reaches record-low pricing of under $15.Mashable writer SaVanna Shoemaker reviewed the lil' Pop in July 2023 and praised it for its ability to (inexpensively) fill up a living space with great-quality music. Besides being a handy and cheap smart speaker, the Echo Pop also boasts \"nearly all of the same functionality\" as other Echo devices on the market — including that signature smart home compatibility and Alexa voice control. Note that, unlike the 5th Gen Echo Dot, the newbie Pop doesn't have temperature sensors. Shoemaker was quick to mention (and bust) the myth that the Echo Pop is equivalent to a Bluetooth speaker. You cannot, in fact, use it to stream audio directly from your phone. The Alexa app must serve as a handy intermediary in order to do so. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) here.Breaking beyond just audio, we're now jumping into the Echo devices with visual displays, also known as the Echo Show lineup. First on our list is the Echo 8 with its 8-inch HD touchscreen and 13-megapixel camera. It can act as a sous chef in the kitchen, serving up recipes while keeping your hands free, and it can just as easily make video calls to keep up with friends and family or stay productive while WFH (though our reviewer SaVanna Shoemaker noted some issues with Zoom functionality). You can also \"Drop-In\" on any other Alexa devices in your household, including video chat with other Echo Shows.That's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Echo Show 8's visual feats, though, and the gorgeous display really opens up the door to an incredible amount of enhanced Alexa functionality. The Echo Show 8 can even function as a security camera, and you can check in on what it sees via the Alexa app on your phone while you're away. That said, you can close the camera shutter and shut off the mic for more privacy.If you're looking for the same capabilities in a smaller size for the bedroom or office, however, the Echo Show 5 is an equally nice choice. Note that the smaller-screened Show 5 won't do as good of a job with streaming, pulling up ingredient lists on recipes, or other tasks that require a large display. Check out our full in-depth comparison of the two for more details. There's now a new-gen model of the Echo Show 8 — the 3rd Gen Echo Show 8 — that might be an even better fit, if you're dedicated to buying only the latest smart home tech. Mashable hasn't gotten hands-on with this new release, but you'll find upgraded audio features, a speedy processor, and mics with noise-reduction technology. The Good The Bad Details The Echo Dot gets an adorable facelift in this kids' version of the device. You can choose from cute and colorful designs — like an owl or dragon — for the outside, but the inside is exactly the same as the latest-model Echo Dot, minus the LED clock display. The Echo Dot Kids is not just a pretty paint job, though; it also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, a digital subscription designed for kids aged 3-12 to access kid-friendly audiobooks, educational Alexa skills, interactive games, homework help, bedtime stories, and more — all without ads. (Though to be fair, you could always subscribe to Amazon Kids+ separately and use it via any other Echo device too.) In addition to a built-in mic off button for privacy, the Echo Dot Kids is also packed with parental controls: Like only giving kid-friendly responses to any questions asked, filtering out explicit songs when playing music, and only allowing calls to parent-approved contacts. It also allows Alexa's voice to be changed to that of an owl- or dragon-inspired character, making the whole experience more fun for little ones. And, it comes with a 2-year worry-free guarantee that allows for replacement if it breaks (which is a huge step up from the Echo Dot's 90-day limited warranty).If you, however, want to treat the kiddos to the latest-and-greatest in the world of Amazon tech, your best bet would be the Amazon Echo Pop Kids (released on Oct. 25). The Pop Kids costs $49.99, has all the same parental controls features we mentioned above, and grants you six free months of Amazon Kids+. Its Avengers or Disney Princess design options are giving #genderstereotypes, but they're still a great way to add some brightness to your kid's room and life. The Good The Bad Details At their core, the Echo and Echo Dot are essentially just speakers — incredibly intelligent speakers, but speakers nonetheless. And while they're great for casual music listening and hearing Alexa serve up her endless knowledge, they won't impress any true audiophiles. That's where the Echo Studio comes in with its wow-worthy Dolby Atmos sound and five strategically positioned speakers inside. Standing 8 inches tall with a nearly 7-inch diameter, it's markedly larger than the baseline Echo — but it's still a relatively unobtrusive speaker that can fill a large room with exquisite audio. You can even pair two Echo Studios together (plus an Echo Sub subwoofer add-on, for good measure) and configure them for the left and right to create a truly immersive, three-dimensional audio experience. Even better, connect it all to your Fire TV for a truly cinematic home theater setup.Aside from its epic sound quality, the Echo Studio functions almost identically to the standard Echo when it comes to smart home capabilities and Alexa's functionality. However, it doesn't have motion detection or a temperature sensor, so you won't be able to automate any connected devices in those ways. But it does have a built-in \"mic off\" button and in-app privacy controls. For instance, on the Alexa app, \"you can review your daily voice history and delete anything you don't vibe with, manage the access to data certain skills have, and more,\" according to former Mashable fellow, Stacia Datskovska. The Good The Bad Details PSA: Amazon has an Echo device just for your car, in case you weren't aware. While other Echo devices are designed mostly around the idea of being a hub for smart home devices, the Echo Auto brings that very intelligence to your vehicle. As of now, you likely don't have a ton of smart tech to control while in your car, but the Echo Auto allows you to access Alexa's hundreds of thousands of skills hands-free while you drive. You can control your music, podcasts, or audiobooks, or make phone calls and send texts. You can also remotely control your devices at home from the road, such as turning on your lights and bumping up your thermostat for a warm welcome when you walk in the door. You can even contact roadside assistance, all with simple voice commands. The Echo Auto comes with an adhesive mount, fast car charger, and AUX cable, and it's built with privacy controls, such as a \"mic off\" button. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Echo Buds (2nd Gen) here.If you love Alexa and simply want to take her epic skills with you wherever you go, Amazon has created wireless earbuds to help you do just that. They're designed to be compact and comfortable, though they are a bit larger than some competitors' earbuds. Their fit is customizable, however, and they're IPX4 sweat-resistant so you can use them during intense workouts without worry. They also have active noise cancellation to limit background sounds, and a \"passthrough\" mode that allows you to safely hear what's going on around you.Like other Echo devices, you can use voice commands to make calls, set reminders, and utilize tons of other Alexa skills as well. You can also tap to pause, skip, and rewind your music, and you'll enjoy up to five hours of music playback per charge (or 15 hours with the charging case). Also, you can mute the earbuds' mic from within the Alexa app, but as our reviewer Alex Perry notes, she will keep reminding you to unmute them, which can get annoying. The Good The Bad Details While we haven't had the opportunity to conduct hands-on testing with every single one of these Echo devices (peep our recent comparison of the 4th gen Echo and the 5th gen Echo Dot, BTW), we did put forth hours of careful research into Amazon's current lineup of Echo devices and analyzed our own writers' in-depth reviews and personal experiences. We included many of the newest Echo devices in our guide, comparing their features to determine the best Echo devices for a variety of different use cases. To make our selection, we took some key factors into consideration:Type: We included as many different types of Echo devices as we could, including the audio-only original and Dot lineups as well as the more visual Echo Show options. We then compared and contrasted specs and selected those devices that rose to the top.Price: Echo devices can vary greatly in price, so we made it a point to include budget-friendly options as well as more extravagant, \"splurge-worthy\" choices.Smart features: Amazon's smart home ecosystem goes beyond Echo devices, and also includes Ring and Blink products. We chose Echo products with modern smart features such as the ability to control and sync with other smart home gadgets. Frequently Asked Questions Before we try to make sense of all your different options, let's just define what an Amazon Echo device is, was, and has become. When this line of devices first launched, the Echo was a tall cylinder that was essentially a speaker that responded to your voice commands, thanks to the artificial intelligence of Alexa. This is still the core of today's Amazon Echo devices, with some still offering just audio and others offering both auditory and visual content. Today's Echo devices also now come in many different shapes and sizes, and Alexa's capabilities have greatly expanded. Many people tend to use the terms \"Echo\" and \"Alexa\" interchangeably, but even though their functions are deeply intertwined, they're actually quite different things. Amazon Alexa is the artificial intelligence system (kind of like its \"rival\" Google Assistant) that responds to your questions, acts on your voice commands, and does all the myriad other things that Alexa can do — but we'll get to that in a minute. On the flip side, Echo devices are simply the conduit for bringing that service to you. That's why Echo devices take on so many different forms, from spherical speakers to video screens to earbuds you can take on the go.  Echo devices are some of Amazon's keystone products, so you can expect to see their prices drop accordingly during Amazon Prime Day events, as well as other big shopping holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In 2024, many Black Friday deals have continued well into December. Ahead of the holidays, you can still find prices close to or on par with Black Friday pricing. You can find Amazon Echo devices and accessories for sale at retailers other than Amazon, such as Best Buy, Target, Staples, and even The Home Depot. However, you may not have access to as wide of a selection of styles and colors as you would if you shopped directly through Amazon. You're also not likely to score the best price when shopping from a store other than Amazon, mostly because of all the aforementioned sale periods (and not just Amazon's signature Prime Day) when prices drop dramatically. Possibly one of the best perks of purchasing an Amazon Echo device is that there's no monthly fee to use it. It's your entry point into Alexa's incredible AI and — aside from the purchase price of the Echo device itself — she and her ever-growing list of skills are totally free to use. The only reason you might encounter a paywall while using your Echo device is if you're asking Alexa to access another service, such as a streaming music service. (And yes, that includes Amazon Music; you may be prompted to start a Music Unlimited subscription if you try to access a song that's not free. Can't win 'em all, I guess.) Regardless of the Echo device you choose, its built-in access to Alexa’s artificial intelligence allows you to do all of the following — hands-free — simply by asking Amazon Alexa a question or voicing a command:Control your smart home technology from one central hubAccess your calendars and set remindersGet answers to any question you can think ofMake phone calls (and video calls with an Echo Show)Get the latest weather and newsFollow recipesShop on AmazonStream music (and video on an Amazon Echo Show)Play gamesBut honestly, that just barely scratches the surface; there are more than 100,000 Alexa skills that you can utilize via an Echo device, and Amazon is always adding more.It should also be noted that Alexa and Echo devices are built with many layers of privacy protection these days. You can turn the mic off if you don't want Alexa listening, and you can also view and delete your voice recordings. If your Echo device has a camera, the latest models also include a shutter to cover it up when not in use. According to Amazon, there are more than 30,000 smart home devices marked with the \"Works with Alexa\" badge — and if something works with Alexa, it works with Echo too. There's a whole host of smart home items you can connect to your Echo device, including light bulbs, switches, locks, thermostats, fans, and smart plugs that can turn pretty much any electronic device into a “smart home” device.Amazon's own brands (like Blink and eero) make a ton of smart home devices that will link up seamlessly, but Echo devices — especially those with a built-in Zigbee smart home hub — should be able to connect to any brand of smart home device fairly easily with the command \"Alexa, discover my devices.\" (To be clear, though, Zigbee isn't required for connectivity)Echo devices also work exceptionally well with each other. You can link as many of them together as you want, and you can even have them play the same music at the same time for a whole-home audio experience, or act as an intercom to let your family know dinner is ready.

Plus, you can easily connect your other smart home devices to this one central hub so that you can control all your little tech minions with your voice alone. It even has a built-in temperature sensor that can work in conjunction with your smart thermostat, and motion detection that can be used to automatically turn lights on when you walk into a room.

While the Echo stands just over 5 inches tall, the Echo Dot is a more squat 3.5 inches, making it better suited for a bedside table, shelf, home office setup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow in its 5th generation, the Echo Dot boasts more vibrant sound with clearer vocals and deeper bass, though it does not have Dolby audio like the latest-model Echo. It also only has one front-firing speaker as compared to the Echo\u0026#39;s two plus a woofer. However, the Echo Dot does have the same built-in mic and in-app privacy controls as the Echo, as well as a temperature sensor and motion detector to help automate other smart home devices. Amazon takes smart home functioning quite seriously with its Dot: If you enable sound detection routines, for instance, you can program a particular sound (dog barking, oven dinging, door opening) to trigger a certain Alexa Routine. \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cdiv @click=\"showGood=!showGood\"\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eThe Good\u003c/h3\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv @click=\"showBad=!showBad\"\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eThe Bad\u003c/h3\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv @click=\"showDetail=!showDetail\"\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eDetails\u003c/h3\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n            \n                                \u003cdiv x-data=\"{showGood:false, showBad:false, showDetail:false}\" id=\"product-03akw2wX49zyIaCi2j9fY9t\" data-ga-module=\"roundup-product-card\" data-ga-element=\"roundup-product\"\u003e\n                    \n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundup-products/03akw2wX49zyIaCi2j9fY9t/product-image.fit_lpad.size_672x378.v1728142497.jpg\" alt=\"echo spot alarm clock showing a time of 9 o\u0026#39;clock\" width=\"672\" height=\"378\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\n\n                            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\n                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eWho it\u0026#39;s for:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you want an Echo smart speaker in every room or just need a smarter alarm clock, the 2024 Echo Spot is made for your bedside. It has programmable routines to queue your morning wake-up and evening wind-down. Plus, it responds quickly and clearly to Alexa commands, so you can play music from the speaker without opening your phone or ask for a weather report as you\u0026#39;re getting dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy we like it:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 2024 Echo Spot improves about the previous models\u0026#39; shortcomings, creating an easy-to-use smart alarm clock that\u0026#39;s both useful and good-looking.

While we think it\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003ea little\u003c/em\u003e too small, it still has vibrant colors.

The speaker produces clear audio that doesn\u0026#39;t sound tinny, however, it\u0026#39;s meant for small spaces — don\u0026#39;t plan on using it for your next party. Alexa also answers quickly to questions and commands, making it easy to turn on a podcast to kick off your morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe alarm function works like any daily alarm clock. Snoozing is easy: Tap the top of the device with more than one finger to get another few minutes of rest. Meanwhile, turning off the alarm is slightly more annoying, requiring you to interact with the touchscreen.

With a 10-inch display, the Echo Show 10 is much more than just a larger screen to enjoy Alexa\u0026#39;s AI and video calls with loved ones. In fact, its whole form is different. Whereas the Echo Show 8 is a bit boxy, the Echo Show 10 boasts a slimmer screen perched atop a speaker, a cue that the Echo Show 10 is the superior choice when it comes to audio. It almost looks like an Amazon Fire tablet slapped on top of an Echo Dot, but we promise it\u0026#39;s more sophisticated than that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the Echo Show 10\u0026#39;s coolest features is that its HD screen moves with you.

You can also utilize this functionality to look around the entire room while you\u0026#39;re away from home.

First on our list is the Echo 8 with its 8-inch HD touchscreen and 13-megapixel camera. It can act as a sous chef in the kitchen, serving up recipes while keeping your hands free, and it can just as easily make video calls to keep up with friends and family or stay productive while WFH (though our reviewer SaVanna Shoemaker noted \u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/review/amazon-echo-8-2nd-generation-2021-review\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"\u003e\u003cu\u003esome issues with Zoom functionality\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).

The Echo Show 8 can even function as a security camera, and you can check in on what it sees via the Alexa app on your phone while you\u0026#39;re away. That said, you can close the camera shutter and shut off the mic for more privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re looking for the same capabilities in a smaller size for the bedroom or office, however, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08KJN3333\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\" title=\"(opens in a new window)\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eEcho Show 5\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is an equally nice choice.

The Echo Dot Kids is not just a pretty paint job, though; it also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, a digital subscription designed for kids aged 3-12 to access kid-friendly audiobooks, educational Alexa skills, interactive games, homework help, bedtime stories, and more — all without ads. (Though to be fair, you could always subscribe to Amazon Kids+ separately and use it via any other Echo device too.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to a built-in mic off button for privacy, the Echo Dot Kids is also packed with parental controls: Like only giving kid-friendly responses to any questions asked, filtering out explicit songs when playing music, and only allowing calls to parent-approved contacts. It also allows Alexa\u0026#39;s voice to be changed to that of an owl- or dragon-inspired character, making the whole experience more fun for little ones.

When this line of devices first launched, the Echo was a tall cylinder that was essentially a speaker that responded to your voice commands, thanks to the artificial intelligence of Alexa. This is still the core of today\u0026#39;s Amazon Echo devices, with some still offering just audio and others offering both auditory and visual content. Today\u0026#39;s Echo devices also now come in many different shapes and sizes, and Alexa\u0026#39;s capabilities have greatly expanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv x-data=\"{drawerOpen: false}\"\u003e\n            \u003chr/\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eMany people tend to use the terms \u0026#34;Echo\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Alexa\u0026#34; interchangeably, but even though their functions are deeply intertwined, they\u0026#39;re actually quite different things. Amazon Alexa is the artificial intelligence system (kind of like its \u0026#34;rival\u0026#34; Google Assistant) that responds to your questions, acts on your voice commands, and does all the myriad other things that Alexa can do — but we\u0026#39;ll get to that in a minute. On the flip side, Echo devices are simply the conduit for bringing that service to you. That\u0026#39;s why Echo devices take on so many different forms, from spherical speakers to video screens to earbuds you can take on the go. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv x-data=\"{drawerOpen: false}\"\u003e\n            \u003chr/\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eEcho devices are some of Amazon\u0026#39;s keystone products, so you can expect to see their prices drop accordingly during Amazon Prime Day events, as well as other big shopping holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In 2024, many Black Friday deals have continued well into December. Ahead of the holidays, you can still find prices close to or on par with Black Friday pricing.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv x-data=\"{drawerOpen: false}\"\u003e\n            \u003chr/\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eYou can find Amazon Echo devices and accessories for sale at retailers other than Amazon, such as Best Buy, Target, Staples, and even The Home Depot. However, you may not have access to as wide of a selection of styles and colors as you would if you shopped directly through Amazon. You\u0026#39;re also not likely to score the best price when shopping from a store other than Amazon, mostly because of all the aforementioned sale periods (and not just Amazon\u0026#39;s signature Prime Day) when prices drop dramatically. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv x-data=\"{drawerOpen: false}\"\u003e\n            \u003chr/\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003ePossibly one of the best perks of purchasing an Amazon Echo device is that there\u0026#39;s no monthly fee to use it. It\u0026#39;s your entry point into Alexa\u0026#39;s incredible AI and — aside from the purchase price of the Echo device itself — she and her ever-growing list of skills are totally free to use. The only reason you might encounter a paywall while using your Echo device is if you\u0026#39;re asking Alexa to access another service, such as a streaming music service.
