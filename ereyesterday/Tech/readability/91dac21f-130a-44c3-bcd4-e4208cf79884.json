Credit: Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP / Getty Images The Southern California wildfires continue to rage on, devastating areas around Los Angeles, including the Pacific Palisades, Hurst, and Pasadena. Over 180,000 people have had to evacuate their homes, and over 2,000 buildings have been destroyed. The fires, which are widespread and windy, have yet to be contained and have been stretching the limits of firefighting resources. However, according to the Los Angeles Times, California Governor Gavin Newsom has recruited more firefighters and resources, and President Biden has supplied federal support with air tankers from the U.S. Forest Service.  Meanwhile, those living in the area are undoubtedly affected by the air pollution caused by wildfire smoke. According to AirNow, which is run by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Park Service, NASA, Centers for Disease Control, and other federal agencies, the air quality index (AQI) in the Los Angeles area is listed as \"Unhealthy\" measuring at 188 PM2.5. The site's recommendation for this AQI level is to minimize outdoor activity, especially if you have symptoms or belong to a sensitive group.AirNow is a great resource for checking the AQI index, but it's not the only one. Below, we've compiled some of the best sites and apps for checking air quality. Mashable Top Stories The Weather app for iPhone users Did you know that Apple's native Weather app provides air quality information? If you open a location and scroll past the weekly forecast, you'll find the air quality index. If you click on the widget, you'll get more granular information about pollutant details and any pertinent health information. The World Air Quality Index ProjectThe World Air Quality Index Project is a collaboration of environmental agencies worldwide. Its site compiles air quality data from 50,000 monitoring stations in 132 countries to provide real-time AQI stats worldwide. However, you can also visit specific areas monitored by local stations and get detailed current and historical information from each device.  AirNowAirNow is a collaborative effort of federal agencies that provides air quality data across the U.S. The site also has up-to-date information about the wildfires, resources, data, and interactive maps to help users learn more about particular areas and how they might be affected. There's also a free AirNow mobile app.Air quality appsA quick iOS or Android app store search will yield numerous results for well-reviewed air quality apps. Unlike government-funded sites, these apps are a bit more polished and provide more features and ways to personalize your preferences. For example, several apps, such as IQAir, Air Matters, and the Plume Labs app, provide multi-day air quality forecasts, and Paku provides hyperlocal real-time AQI data. There are also apps specifically designed for tracking wildfires, such as Firesource and Watch Duty, which provide real-time data about fire perimeters, evacuation orders, wind conditions, and air quality.  Cecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.
