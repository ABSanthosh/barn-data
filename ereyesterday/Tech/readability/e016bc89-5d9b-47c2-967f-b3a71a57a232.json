  "description": "You'll soon be able to get into your favorite games even faster with the updated Xbox home screen. According to Microsoft, Xbox Insiders are due to get three new customization options later this week that will make their dashboard feel a little more personal. As detailed in Xbox Wire, certain Xbox players will have options to reduce clutter and allow them to pull their favorite games to the front of the list. The first major change lets you pin up to three of your favorite games or apps to the recently-played list. Pinning these means that they'll stay near the front of your list even when you launch other apps occasionally. Beyond that, your Xbox will get the option to \"Hide System Apps\" which should reduce the clutter and tuck those less important shortcuts away. To further streamline your home screen, Xbox will introduce the \"Reduce Tile Count\" feature that lets you set how many visible tiles are in the recently opened games and apps list. With more control thanks to these new features, Xbox players should get a cleaner homepage that lets their dynamic backgrounds shine more. \"We’ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,\" Eden Marie, principal software engineering lead of Xbox Experiences, wrote on Xbox's blog. \"Whether it’s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don’t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.\" According to Microsoft, these features will arrive on Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha users' consoles first. However, the company is still tweaking the Reduce Tile Count feature, adding that it \"will be coming soon.\" Now, if only there were a way to hide those ads on the homescreen.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-will-let-you-pin-up-to-three-favorite-games-to-your-homescreen-200051956.html?src=rss",
