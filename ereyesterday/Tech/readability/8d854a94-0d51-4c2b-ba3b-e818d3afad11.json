  "text": "Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn star in the July release from Marvel Studios. Obviously, we’re all interested in the next movie on Marvel’s release calendar, Thunderbolts—but most of us really have our eye on July 25 and the release of The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The first trailer ruled and at CinemaCon 2025, Marvel released what looked like maybe a second trailer, and the new footage has huge implications. We start on a TV show called The Ted Gilbert Show that sets up introducing the Fantastic Four. As Ted explains the story of them going into space, we see a few brief shots of each person, including one of Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) pulling a huge boat into the harbor. Gilbert says that the city and planet owe the group a debt and everyone wants to thank them, which they do. At family dinner, Reed (Pedro Pascal) and Sue (Vanessa Kirby) are late so Johnny (Joseph Quinn) gives them a little crap about it. Turns out, they’re late because Sue is pregnant. Johnny is ecstatic and tells Sue she’s gonna be a great mom but that Reed may not be a good dad. “Nothing is going to change,” Sue tells Reed. “We can do this.” Meteors fill the sky, coming towards the ground. Enter the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), asking if they are the protectors of Earth? Reed says yes. She tells them that this planet has been marked for death. Later, Reed talks to Sue and says that this is his fault. “I stretched the bounds of space and they heard.” Galactus’ (Ralph Ineson) shadow starts to cover all of New York City, A press conference is going on with people throwing questions at the group. “Are we safe?” one asks. “I don’t know,” replies Reed. We see him crossing out some math on a chalkboard and telling Sue he’s not giving up. The Surfer rises up through some lava. Sue says that they will face this together, as a family. On a street full of rubble, a girl runs out to grab her toy Thing as a giant rock starts bearing down on her. “We will protect you,” Reed says as the trailer ends. What we find most fascinating about this film is that it is so clearly in this other multiverse—and how it will tie back to the prime Marvel Universe should be interesting. We’ll find out July 25, when The Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters. Want more io9 news?
