  "description": "NoWayNoShapeNoForm writes: OpenVault believes that data caps on broadband are not a problem because most people do not exceed their existing data caps. OpenVault contends that people that do exceed their broadband data caps are simply being forgetful — leaving a streaming device on 24x7, or deploying unsecure WiFi access points, or reselling their service within an apartment building. Yes, there may be some ISPs that have older networks that they have not upgraded. Or maybe they are unable to increase network capacity in \"the middle mile\" of their networks, but the Covid pandemic certainly encouraged many ISPs to upgrade their networks and capacity while many ISPs that had broadband data caps ended that feature. Perhaps the biggest problem, according to OpenVault, is that most broadband users do not really have any idea how much bandwidth they \"consume\" every month. If Internet access is a service that people want to treat as a \"utility\", then you have to ask, Would they keep the water running after finishing their shower? In the article Ookla's VP of Smart Communities adds that \"Scrolling through social media feeds for hours can 'push' hundreds of videos to the user, many of which may be of no interest — they just start running.\" So the main driver for usage-based billing wasn't to increase revenue, OpenVault CEO Mark Trudeau tells the site, but to \"balance the network a little more...\" (Though he then also adds that sometimes a subscriber could also be reselling broadband service in their apartment building, \"And that's not even legal.\") \"If one or two customers on a given node is causing issues for 300 others, where those 300 are not getting the service that they paid for, then that's a problem right?\" he said. Having said that, the article also points out that \"Many major fiber providers, like AT\u0026T, Frontier, Google Fiber and Verizon Fios, don't have data caps at all.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
