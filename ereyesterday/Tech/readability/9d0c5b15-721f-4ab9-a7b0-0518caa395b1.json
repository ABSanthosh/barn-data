Sign up now!Maurice Schweitzer, Bliro’s co-founder, told TNW that the approach eliminates risks associated with audio and video recordings. “A transcript lacks personally identifiable elements like voice or facial recognition, making it impossible to verify who said what with absolute certainty,” he said. For those transcripts that do contain personal information like names, the company “prioritises compliance” at every step, Schweitzer added. Schweitzer co-founded Bliro in 2022 alongside data scientist Martin Thoma, as a privacy-first transcription tool, spun out from AI research at the Technical University of Munich.  In addition to eschewing the recording process, Bliro encrypts all data processed in the app and stores it on servers in Frankfurt. It does not share data with third parties, including its own employees, without explicit consent. Nor does it use user data to refine its AI models, the company said. “Many large companies avoid recording-based solutions due to privacy and compliance concerns — making Bliro the only viable option for them,” said Schweitzer. Bliro targets customer-facing teams who use the app to automate meeting transcriptions, generate AI-driven summaries, and create follow-up actions — while maintaining privacy and compliance. The app currently supports 15 languages.  Today, Bliro announced it has raised €2.8mn in a funding round led by German early-stage VC LEA Partners, with participation from 468 Capital and Dutch seed investor Rockstart. Bliro also launched its iOS app, which transcribes and analyses face-to-face conversations. The new funding will be used to accelerate product development and win more customers. Schweitzer said more than 1,000 companies already use Bliro, including well-known German brands such as ImmoScout24, OMR, and Telefónica Germany.",
