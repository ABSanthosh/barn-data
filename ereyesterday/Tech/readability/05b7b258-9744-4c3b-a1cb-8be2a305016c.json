  "text": "Amazon MGM’s upcoming Masters of the Universe movie just got a bit more real thanks another, more complete look at its musclebound lead, He-Man. Portrayed in the upcoming film by Nicolas Galtizine, the British actor released a picture of himself as Adam of Grayskull’s heroic persona, albeit from the back and bathed in shadow. The picture comes with the news that filming has wrapped, and Galtizine called it “an honour shouldering the responsibility of playing Adam and He-Man. It’s been the role of a lifetime and I put everything into it. There’s not much I can show you, but I am so proud of the movie we’ve made. Thanks to our amazing cast and crew for all your hard work.” Mattel’s been trying to make a new Masters movie for years, and Netflix almost had one in the works starring Kyle Allen before plans fell through. This new film comes courtesy of Bumblebee director Travis Knight, and also stars Camila Mendes as Teela, Idris Elba as Man-at-Arms, Alison Brie as Evil-Lyn, and Jared Leto as main baddie Skeletor. This past April, Amazon featured Masters of the Universe at CinemaCon, where the team said it was “making a live-action fantasy film about the most powerful man in the universe.” Plot details remain under wraps, but the footage we saw included Adam in Grayskull and a young man’s bedroom, working out in the gym, and using the Sword of Power as both himself and He-Man. Look for Masters of the Universe to hit theaters on June 5, 2026. Want more io9 news?
