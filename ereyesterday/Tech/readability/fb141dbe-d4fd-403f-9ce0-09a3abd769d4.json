  "text": "Big events like New York Comic-Con give publishers a good reason to tee up some upcoming comics and big events to come throughout the next year. Marvel already revealed their 2025 lineup will include Doctor Doom ruling the planet and an all-new Ultimate Wolverine, but what’s going on with DC? We broke down five of the biggest announcement to come from the publisher, which includes fresh new stories and several returning fan-favorites. Peacemaker is dipping into comics Mitch Gerads/DC Max’s Peacemaker is currently expected to come back for season two sometime next year. To tide you over until then, DC is releasing the show’s first-ever comic book spinoff, Peacemaker Presents: The Vigilante/Eagly Double Feature!. Tim Seely (Money Shot) and Mitch Gerads (Mister Miracle) will tackle the Vigilante stories, while Rex Ogle and Matteo Lolli handle Eagly’s tales. Set between the show’s two seasons, the Vigilante stories will see the goofy antihero tear his way through the criminal community based on the assumption that something bad’s happened to Peacemaker and Eagly when they’re not home. In Eagly’s story, we find out he and Peacemaker are on a “bromantic” trip to Alaska they forgot to tell Vigilante about, but things take a turn for the worse when their flight is hijacked by supervillains looking to hunt them and the other passengers for sport. The five-issue Vigilante/Eagly Double Feature! kicks off sometime next year. The Justice League will fight Godzilla fighting King Kong again DC/Legendary/Toho It was only last year that DC’s mightiest heroes were caught in the middle of a clash between Godzilla and King Kong. Come 2025, they’ll be back to do the kaiju dance again in Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong 2. Once again by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, the sequel sees the League hop over to the MonsterVerse when they learn some of their villains (Lex, Cheetah, and Harley, to name a few) have decided to try and weaponize Titans like Ghidorah and Rodan. You can guess how that’ll go, but hey, Wonder Woman or Batman riding on Mothra sure will be a sight to behold when the book lands in 2025. The Absolute universe is preparing to get bigger Break out the Chocos! Announcing Absolute Martian Manhunter series by @DenizCamp and @javiercaster! Coming March 2025 pic.twitter.com/4gsXeXcBu7 — DC (@DCOfficial) October 18, 2024 Last week, DC’s new Absolute line of comics kicked off with Scott Snyder and Nick Dragotta’s Absolute Batman. Kelly Thompson and Hayden Sherman’s Absolute Wonder Woman launches later this week, and Jason Aaron and Rafa Sandoval’s Absolute Superman arrives in November, but there’s more stories on the horizon: wave two of the line will feature Absolute Flash from Jeff Lemire and Nick Robles, Absolute Green Lantern by Al Ewing and Jahnoy Lindsay, and the newly announced Absolute Martian Manhunter from Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez. Camp, writer of 20th Century Men and The Ultimates, described Manhunter as “the most radical Absolute reinvention so far.” The book centers on FBI agent John Jones, who has his mind repeatedly invaded by an alien consciousness that just uses “Martian” as a shorthand to describe himself. This is a psychological horror story, and John will “slowly go insane, but in a really fun kind of way. The book is about a complete outsider’s perspective on the world combined with a complete insider’s view of the world.” As for Absolute Flash and Green Lantern, DC revealed some art from their respective books. The former stars a teen Wally West going up against classic Rogues like Captains Cold and Boomerang, while the latter is an ensemble piece featuring Jo Mullein, John Stewart, and Hal Jordan. All three Absolute books will release in 2025. Also on the docket for 2025 is some kind of crossover between the Absolute and prime DC universes: at the con, Snyder teased a “big, fun event” next fall that “brings a lot of this stuff together.” © Nick Robles/DC Comics © Nick Robles/DC Comics © Nick Robles/DC Comics © Nick Robles/DC Comics Absolute Green Lantern #1 art by Jahnoy Lindsay Al Ewing said This will be an ensemble book featuring Jo,Hal,John and Guy Gardner! But Hal and Jo Mullein are the main ones in the book! pic.twitter.com/IGGXYnX0n1 — DCU Updates (@dcuworld) October 18, 2024 Somehow, Hush has returned… Jim Lee/DC Comics At the “Jim Lee and Friends” panel, the artist revealed he and writer Jeph Loeb were reteaming on a sequel to Batman: Hush, which introduced Bruce’s childhood friend Tommy Elliot turned evil lookalike (and bandaged serial killer) Hush. A 20th anniversary re-release in 2022 featured a brand new epilogue, and Hush was recently adapted into one of DC’s animated movies, so a sequel felt almost inevitable. The duo will begin their sequel in March 2025 with Batman #158, seemingly confirming recent rumors that Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jimenez’s current run would be wrapping early next year so the two could take over the main Bat-comic. But before that point, there’ll be a prelude story in November’s Justice League Unlimited #1 to help set the stage for Batman’s next saga. …And so has Vertigo, too © Vertigo/DC Hush ain’t the only one making a comeback. The fan-favorite Vertigo imprint is being revived after being retired in 2019, with an emphasis on creator-owned projects. (DC Black Label, which effectively existed as its replacement, will seemingly stick to handling mature takes of the brand’s existing characters.) The first “new” Vertigo book will be a reprint of James Tynion IV and Álvaro Martinez Bueno’s The Nice House on the Lake, with upcoming issues of its current sequel series The Nice House by the Sea to be published under the imprint going forward. At the moment, this is the only book confirmed for the resurrected Vertigo, and executive editor Chris Conroy said more would be revealed in the coming months, along with some “surprises from the archives.” Want more io9 news?
