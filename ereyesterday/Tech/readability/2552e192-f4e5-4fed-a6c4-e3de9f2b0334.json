Occasionally, however, additional bugs and glitches can slip through the cracks. That's the case with the latest Pixel update: While Google added a number of new features to Android and patched 43 security vulnerabilities, users who have installed it are complaining of strange glitches on their Pixel phones. March 2025 Pixel drop glitches: Brightness, vibrations, and moreFirst up, as spotted by 9to5Google, some Pixel users are experiencing brightness variations while using their phones—without touching the brightness settings themselves. The issue seems to be limited to video playback, where the brightness will dip or flicker at random. This user reports it happens in just about every video app they use, including Netflix, Prime Video, VLC, or Google's built-in player. 9to5Google confirmed the bug on a Pixel 9, though the brightness glitch happened inconsistently.In addition to this brightness glitch, you may also experience changes with your device's vibrations. This thread represents a wide range of experiences with the issue: Some users are complaining that haptics are much stronger than they were before the update, with one user describing the change as a \"spring instead of a thump.\" On the other hand, another user says the vibrations of their Pixel are now weaker than they were before. Regardless, many seem to feel vibrations are \"different\" following the update. These are the bugs that have made the most buzz on forums since the Pixel Drop. However, there could be other issues that aren't quite as widespread. One r/GooglePixel user rounded up the bugs they've experienced so far, and, in addition to the brightness bug, they're also experiencing audio issues, including an issue with EQ settings, and a problem where song volume is much louder than video volume. That last point would make it quite annoying to jump between, say, Spotify and Netflix: Stranger Things will launch too quiet, and will make your brightness go berserk. How to fix the brightness glitch on Pixel phonesWhile Google is likely working on patches for the biggest bugs from the latest Pixel drop, there's currently a workaround for the brightness glitch: drop your phone's refresh rate. It appears that flickering and dimming problems only occur at this time when watching videos with 120Hz. Drop the refresh rate to 60Hz, and the brightness issues appear to dissipate. To change the refresh rate, head to Settings \u003e Display, then disable the toggle next to Smooth Display.
