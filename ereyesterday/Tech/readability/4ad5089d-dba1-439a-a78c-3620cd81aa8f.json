  "text": "Contigo Wells Chill Stainless Steel Filter Water Bottle: Iliked the design of this bottle, from its size to the autospout straw, and even the filter. My issue with this bottle is that the filter length was too short for the size of the bottle so there always seemed to be water left that you couldn't drink once it got below a certain point. Nathan QuickSqueeze 12 oz. Insulated Handheld Bottle: I found this handheld bottle to be heavier than I would like during a run. If the weight doesn't bother you, it's still a solid handheld choice and has a zipper pocket to store your gels, keys or credit cards. Camelbak Eddy Plus: Although the Camelbak Eddy Plus had a spout that I liked, I found the bottle to be on the heavier side. It lacked insulation and only parts of it are dishwasher safe. It came in a close second to the Nalgene Narrow Mouth Tritan Water Bottle, which also lacked insulation, but the latter was slightly cheaper and fully dishwasher safe. Yeti Rambler: This limited-edition Yeti water bottle feels durable but is on the heavier side if you're taking it on a hike or to the gym. This one would be better if you're going camping, fishing or tailgating and need a bottle to be able to withstand a fall or keep drinks cool. It didn't make the list because compared to other insulated bottles, I found it fell short in keeping water cold and lacked versatility.Yeti Yonder 1-liter / 34 oz. Water Bottle: I thought this was a rather overpriced water bottle that doesn't have any special features and lacks insulation. There are more affordable options that have comparable features to this bottle. Hydro Flask 32 oz. Wide Mouth w/ Straw Lid: This bottle is heavy and can be obtrusive, but it is well insulated. It's still a good option if you don't mind its size. If you want a more lightweight and affordable bottle that keeps your water cold, you're better off with one of the other bottles on the list.",
