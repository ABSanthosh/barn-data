On Search, just look for things like “where to vote” or “ballot dropboxes,” follow the prompt to enter your registered address, and you’ll see available locations nearby based on the type of voting information you’re looking for. And on Maps, you can look up a specific voting location to find more information about hours and the types of voting offered there. Just like in past years, the official information in this feature will come from the Voting Information Project, a partnership between Democracy Works, a nonpartisan civic organization, and state and local election officials.Information in Search and Maps will update as state and local election officials update voting locations through the Voting Information Project. You'll also always see a link directing you to your official state or local election office website to learn more.Get more information on how to vote in your stateWant to know if you can vote early in your state?
