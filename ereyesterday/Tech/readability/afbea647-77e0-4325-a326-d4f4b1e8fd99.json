  "description": "Late last week, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed they were investigating “the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.” At the same time, The New York Times reported that phones used by Donald Trump, JD Vance and Kamala Harris’ campaign staff were among the targets, though it was unclear what data the group may have been able to access. Now, The New York Times has new details about the extent of the hack, which is reportedly linked to a Chinese group known as “Salt Typhoon.” According to The Times, aides to President Joe Biden, as well as Trump’s family members were also targeted, in addition to diplomats and other government officials. Even more concerning, though, is what the hackers may have been able to access. From the report: F.B.I. investigators think the hackers may have been able to access unencrypted SMS text messages on the targeted devices, as well as call logs, according to people familiar with the investigation. They said there was also evidence indicating that audio communications were captured, though it was not immediately clear whether that meant voice mail or phone call conversations. CISA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment The agency said last week in a joint statement with the FBI that the investigation was “ongoing” and that the affected companies and other potential victims had been notified. At least 10 companies, including Verizon and AT\u0026T, were impacted, according to The Washington Post. A spokesperson for AT\u0026T declined to comment. Verizon didn’t immediately respond to questions, but previously told The Times the company was “aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several U.S. telecommunications providers to gather intelligence.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/fbi-suspects-china-linked-hackers-accessed-officials-call-logs-and-sms-messages-report-says-000434865.html?src=rss",
