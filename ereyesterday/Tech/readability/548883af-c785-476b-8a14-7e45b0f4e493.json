But some online brands have brick-and-mortar showrooms to let you see and experience the bed before you buy it. To me, that's one of Naturepedic's biggest selling points.Naturepedic is a popular online mattress brand that also has physical retail locations across the US and Canada. That makes it easier to determine if the company makes the right eco-friendly bed for you. The Serenade is Naturepedic's most popular mattress. It's a hybrid mattress, so you get sustainable materials for comfort and coils support. In this review, I'll cover what I like about it, what I don't and who I think it's best for.Video: Naturepedic Serenade mattress reviewWatch me review the Naturepedic Serenade mattress in this video review.First impressions of the Naturepedic SerenadeThis bed ships to you completely free with standard bed-in-a-box shipping, where the mattress arrives at your door in a box. The unboxing process is quick and easy. Once it's out of the box, you may want to give the bed some time to off-gas and fully inflate, but it should be ready to go on night one.Upon my initial tests, I found this to be a really bouncy and responsive mattress. The latex foam and coil layers produce a springy feel; it almost feels sponge-like, for lack of a better term. When I hopped on the bed, I felt lots of cushion on top, but I didn't experience any sort of sink-in sensation. I felt buoyant on the bed, like it was propping me up, giving my frame lots of support with plenty of comfort on top. Jonathan Gomez/CNETNaturepedic Serenade mattress firmness and feelWhat does the Naturepedic Serenade feel like?Being a natural and organic hybrid mattress, the Serenade definitely has more of a latex foam feel. You get some cushion from the organic cotton and wool batting on top, but the latex foam and coils underneath make the bed more responsive and supportive.A way to imagine this style of mattress feel is to basically picture the opposite of a memory foam mattress. Instead of a body-conforming sensation, you feel like you're floating on top of the sleeping surface rather than sinking into it. While that may sound off-putting at first, most people who try out latex foam beds ultimately end up loving them. Jonathan Gomez/CNETHow firm is the Naturepedic Serenade mattress?This mattress is available in a few different firmness options. There's a Plush, Cushion-Firm and Firm model to choose from. I've primarily tested the Cushion-Firm version, and would say it's between a medium and a medium-firm on our scale. This firmness works for all sleeper types with a slight edge for back and stomach sleepers.Being the softest option, the Plush model will likely be most suitable for side sleepers, while the Firm rendition is more supportive for strict back and stomach sleepers looking for a super firm bed. I'd also recommend the Cushion-Firm version to most couples, since it splits the difference firmness-wise.  Naturepedic Serenade mattress construction Jonathan Gomez/CNETSince this is a more sustainably sourced bed, it's naturally composed of eco-friendly materials. Here's what's going on inside the bed:1. On the bottom, you've got a thin layer of organic cotton batting. This provides the base for everything else to rest on.2. Then, you've got an 8-inch layer of pocketed coils to provide the bed's main support system. They're also reinforced along the edges.3. Next is a transition layer of organic cotton to buffer between the support and comfort layers for the bed.4. Then you have the primary comfort layer, which in this case is a 2-inch organic latex foam.5. Rounding everything out is a quilted organic cotton cover that has even more organic cotton and wool for extra comfort. It also incorporates a plant-based material called PLA. Jonathan Gomez/CNETNaturepedic Serenade mattress performanceMotion isolationGiven it's a hybrid mattress with latex foam on top for comfort, it's not the best option for isolating lots of cross-mattress movement. Since dense memory foam beds usually make up this category, you might get a superior amount of motion isolation from something like a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Comparatively, though, the Naturepedic Serenade is on par with other latex hybrid beds motion-isolation wise. Edge-to-edge supportThis bed also performs great in terms of supporting you along the edges. Since the edges feature reinforced coils, there's no apparent roll-off sensation when sleeping close to the perimeter of this mattress at night. If your partner tends to hog the bed, you shouldn't have any issues with falling off the Serenade. Dillon Payne/CNETTemperatureWhile the latex foam in the Serenade is naturally moisture-wicking, the bed isn't truly actively cooling. It may sleep slightly cooler than the average foam bed to an especially hot sleeper, but in general, this is a temperature-neutral mattress.DurabilityThis is a highly durable mattress given its supportive design. In addition to support coils, latex foam is also known for its higher durability as a comfort foam, often lasting longer than a more basic polyurethane foam. These factors will likely allow the mattress to last longer than a neutral hybrid bed, especially if you're a heavier person.Who is the Naturepedic Serenade mattress best for?Even though the Serenade could work for just about anyone, it still might not be the most suitable choice for everyone out there. Here's who will benefit the most from sleeping on this mattress.Sleeping positionGiven it's available in a few firmness options, the Serenade could work for just about any sleeping preference. Side sleepers might prefer the level of pressure relief found in the Plush option, while back and stomach sleepers who want a firmer sleeping surface will gravitate towards the Firm. If you're a combination sleeper, or you sleep with a partner, the Cushion-Firm might be your best bet -- it's pretty much the best of both worlds.  Jonathan Gomez/CNETBody typeSpeaking of couples, since it's a hybrid mattress, it should be supportive enough to handle two people. It offers plenty of support for heavier people. If you don't sleep with a partner and are also on the average to petite side, you may find the support here to be a little overkill. You could benefit more from sleeping on an all-foam mattress -- and likely save more money by doing so. Naturepedic Serenade mattress pricing Size Measurements (inches)PriceTwin 38x75 inches$1,399Twin XL 38x80 inches$1,599Full 54x75 inches$1,799Queen 60x80 inches$1,999King 76x80 inches$2,799Cal King 72x84 inches$2,799 Two grand for a queen-size mattress isn't exactly cheap. However, when you consider the quality and level of organically-sourced materials put into the Serenade mattress, it's easy to see why it costs this much. Compared to other natural and organic hybrid beds in its class, I'd say it's also pretty competitively priced.Trial, shipping and warrantyNaturepedic backs this bed with some generous policies. Their beds ship to you in a box for free, and once it's in your possession, you get a 100-night trial period to try it at home risk-free. If you happen not to like it within that time frame, you can return it for free, but a small return fee may be taken from your refund in some states. On the other hand, if you decide to keep it, you're backed by a 25-year limited warranty. Just be sure to use the right foundation for the bed. Otherwise, you could void your bed's warranty.How does Naturepedic Serenade compare to other mattresses?Naturepedic Serenade vs. Avocado GreenThese are two natural hybrid beds that contain certified organic materials, and they're also quite similar aesthetically. The Avocado Green is probably the more popular of the two and slightly more organically certified. Unlike the Serenade though, it is not available in different firmness options. You can spend more to get the Green with comfort upgrades like a pillow top or box top. These will soften up the Avocado Green, but they also raise the price of it considerably, making the Serenade a bit more versatile and affordable by default.Naturepedic Serenade vs. ZenhavenThis comparison is easier to make considering the beds are so different. The Serenade is a one-sided bed, whereas the Zenhaven is double-sided. This means you can flip the mattress over to try a different firmness on either side. The Zenhaven is also an all-latex foam bed, while the Serenade has coils for support, making it slightly more supportive for bigger people. Even though they're both pretty expensive, the Serenade is also the much more affordable choice.The final verdictI've tried a lot of hybrid beds of a more ethical design, but this is by far one of my favorites. I'd say if you're looking for a supportive hybrid bed with a latex foam feel that's organically certified and available in a few firmness choices, it's definitely worth considering. Not to mention, you can actually try this bed out in a store before you buy -- not many online mattress brands offer that these days. Jonathan Gomez/CNETYou might like the Naturepedic Serenade mattress if:You want an hybrid mattress.You want a latex foam feel.You like a bed available in multiple firmness levels.You want a bed backed by eco-certifications.You want to try it out in a store before buying.You might not like the Naturepedic Serenade bed if:You're looking for an all-foam mattress.You prefer the feel of a neutral or memory foam mattress.You're on a super strict budget. What types of certification is the Serenade backed by? There are many certifications that prove how ethically sourced this bed is. The mattress itself is GreenGuard Gold certified, the latex foam and cotton meets the Global Organic Latex and Textile standards (GOLS/GOTS). And no toxic chemicals or harmful adhesives go into the makeup of this mattress. Show more Can you try this mattress out in a store before you buy it? Yes, you can. Naturepedic has several storefronts all across the US and Canada where you can actually go to a physical location to test out the beds. This makes narrowing down your decision between the Naturepedic lineup of mattresses a bit easier. With other online brands, you don't really know what you're getting into before you buy. With Naturepedic, you actually have an advantage, and if you decide not to go to a store, you're also backed by a generous policy set -- it's always nice to have some options. Show more How long does the Naturepedic Serenade mattress last? Being a durable latex hybrid bed, the Naturepedic Serenade should last you for at least the next 7 to 10 years, if not much longer. Hybrid beds are often thought to last longer than all-foam beds, but that experience could vary on a case-by-case basis. For a hybrid mattress, I'd say the Serenade is plenty durable and should last the average sleeper for the next several years. Show more",

Not to mention, you can actually try this bed out in a store before you buy -- not many online mattress brands offer that these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9e99935c51ed2db76256ce0cac97487c7e169b6a/hub/2024/07/31/0da3da59-4170-4c93-a4fa-31fd5b05df65/naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=768\" alt=\"naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1023px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/3e9884fe1a8a7d4d486e7b1c3e16f21d81fecc78/hub/2024/07/31/0da3da59-4170-4c93-a4fa-31fd5b05df65/naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1024\" alt=\"naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(max-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/cb8b6410487134d58722d24fcf388bf0d54ed436/hub/2024/07/31/0da3da59-4170-4c93-a4fa-31fd5b05df65/naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1200\" alt=\"naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5\"/\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/cb8b6410487134d58722d24fcf388bf0d54ed436/hub/2024/07/31/0da3da59-4170-4c93-a4fa-31fd5b05df65/naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5.jpg?auto=webp\u0026amp;width=1200\" alt=\"naturepedic-mattress-2024-jg-5\" height=\"818.4000000000001\" width=\"1200\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e \u003cspan\u003eJonathan Gomez/CNET\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou might like the Naturepedic Serenade mattress if:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul data-ng-block=\"{\" id\":\"atlzzvp8ppm68rk\",\"type\":\"unordered-list\"}\"=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou want an hybrid mattress.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou want a latex foam feel.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou like a bed available in multiple firmness levels.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou want a bed backed by eco-certifications.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou want to try it out in a store before buying.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou might not like the Naturepedic Serenade bed if:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul data-ng-block=\"{\" id\":\"rq08xf9030mvcsd\",\"type\":\"unordered-list\"}\"=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0026#39;re looking for an all-foam mattress.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou prefer the feel of a neutral or memory foam mattress.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0026#39;re on a super strict budget.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-68007315-d526-40f3-99a8-2d5467c02925\" data-location=\"LIST\" pagelayout=\"Review - Article Page\" imagegroup=\"{\u0026#34;imageData\u0026#34;:{},\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;float\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lightbox\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotCrop\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotResize\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageWatermark\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageParallax\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCrop\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageEnlarge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eWhat types of certification is the Serenade backed by?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many certifications that prove how ethically sourced this bed is.
