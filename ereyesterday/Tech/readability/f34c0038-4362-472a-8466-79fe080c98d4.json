The renowned NordPass is slashing the price of its subscription, with a discount you won’t want to miss for anything in the world. This account, that account, the other account… so many accounts and passwords to remember! Well, not anymore; experience NordPass at 57% off! NordPass combines top-of-the-line password management with auto-fill-in to ensure smoother sign-ins, easier sign-ups, and ultimate password control. January is a great time to rejoice, with a staggering 57% discount and a price of just $1.27/mo, which is almost free. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer. See at NordPass What Makes This Password Manager So Great? NordPass isn’t your run-of-the-mill password manager. This all-arounder’s roots go back to Nord Security, a prevalent cybersecurity company behind NordVPN and NordLocker. It allows you to promptly store, access, and organize your passwords on all devices. One of its best features is password generation. You’ll be able to generate strong, unique, and bespoke passwords for new accounts in no time. Additionally, NordPass detects weak passwords and advises modifications to prevent unpleasant security breaches. © NordPass NordPass sports a no-logging policy similar to some VPN providers. This means it won’t glance at your passwords and will have no clue about them. A great addition is data leak scanning, which instantly informs you if some have been found. It’s also suitable for multi-user environments, where you can share passwords with friends, family, or colleagues for added convenience. NordPass offers more than just password management. This powerful password manager can store and manage various types of information, such as credit cards, notes, and much more. Enjoy all of this with Nord Security’s 24/7 support to resolve any issues quickly. How to Get NordPass at $1.27/mo? Okay, so to get started with NordPass, you’ll have to use buttons or links found in this guide. The buttons above and below allow you to go straight to NordPass. Once you’re there, click “Buy Now” and you’ll see the two subscription plans: © NordPass The one on the left is a 2-year plan at 57% off and just $1.27/mo. It costs as little as $30.40 upfront with our “Gizmodo15” code applied automatically. Click on the 2-year plan, press “Continue to Payment“, and finish the process by following the steps on the screen. Now, install NordPass on all devices, and voila! You can do your thing. Beware that NordPass also has the 1-year plan, albeit, at $1.99/mo and only 33% off. While it’s great for a shorter commitment, the value of the 2-year plan is undeniable. We suggest reading our NordPass review for more information. Given the deal’s exclusivity, we’re unsure how long it’ll last. One thing is certain. You’ll never get NordPass Premium at this cheap. It’s time to get the ball rolling and give it a shot. A 30-day money-back guarantee removes all money loss risks. Purchase NordPass At 57% Off",
