  "description": "The super slim Galaxy S25 Edge, which Samsung teased at the tail end of its January Unpacked event, has been officially revealed. During tonight's Unpacked, we got full specs, pricing and shipping dates for Samsung's latest phone, as well as a chance to put our hands on the new handset.  Pricing is set at $1,100 for 256GB of storage or $1,220 for the 512GB model and the phones ship May 30. Pre-orders are open at Amazon, Best Buy and directly from Samsung, which is offering a $50 pre-order store credit and a no-charge upgrade to the 512GB model.  The Edge's headline features include its thin build and AI-supported photography chops — both of which we'd suspected from various leaks, only to have the rumors confirmed by Samsung's own press release last week. And indeed, when Engadget's Mat Smith got his hands on an Edge, he immediately felt how much lighter the device was — yet, he noted, it still felt premium.  We now know for sure that the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch screen but measures just 5.8mm (0.22 inches) thick. That's slightly less surface area than the 6.9-inch Ultra, but a full 2.4mm thinner. It weighs 163 grams, nearly the same as the standard Galaxy S25, but the Edge measures more than 10mm taller and 5mm wider than its base-model sibling.   To shave off the grams and trim the width, Samsung developed a broader yet slimmer vapor chamber and a new Thermal Interface Material (TIM) for better heat dissipation. It uses Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front display. It's the first phone to use the material, which Corning says offers \"enhanced drop performance on rough surfaces,\" allowing for a thinner glass layer. The frame is made from titanium, like the Ultra model, a material many phone manufactures have put in higher-end models for its lightweight strength.  As for camera power, the Edge has the same 200MP sensor as the S25 Ultra, which Samsung claims captures 40 percent brighter images in low light situations compared with the standard S25. There's also a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 12MP selfie cam up front. Those two rear cameras do protrude noticeably from the thin frame of the phone, but Mat was impressed how well-balanced the phone felt — it's not lopsided at all.  Of course, the phone also packs plenty of AI-powered tricks, including Pro Scaler, Audio Eraser and Drawing Assist. To support all the AI, Samsung is using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip as the other S25 phones and comes with 12GB of memory and either 256 or 512GB of storage. It packs a 3,900mAh battery, which is smaller than both the 4,000mAh one found in the standard S25 and the 5,000mAH power supply in the Ultra. Though Samsung claims the Edge can run for 24 hours on a charge.  You can get the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in three color options: Titanium Silver, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Icy Blue. Samsung is promising seven years of security and software updates. We only spent a short time with the phone so far and our full review will be out shortly.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-pre-order-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-000029138.html?src=rss",
