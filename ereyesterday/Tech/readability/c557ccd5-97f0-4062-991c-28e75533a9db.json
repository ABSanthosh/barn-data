  "description": "Belkin is best known for high-quality smartphone accessories, but just like everyone else, it appears it has a case of Nintendo Switch 2 fever. The company has announced that it will be selling several Switch 2 accessories in time for the console's launch, including screen protectors and a charging case that comes with a power bank. The Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2 is the thicker of Belkin's two case options, primarily because it has a designated spot for an included 10K external battery. The case also includes a flap for storing Switch 2 game cartridges, a hidden pocket for slotting an AirTag so you can track the case if it's lost and slots on either side of the battery for cables and other accessories. When you need to prop up your Switch 2 with its kickstand while it's charging, there's also a groove in the case that's specifically designed to hold it. Belkin If you're looking for something more compact and portable, the Travel Case for Nintendo Switch 2 is only moderately thicker than the console itself. Like the charging case, the travel case includes a built-in sleeve for Switch 2 game cartridges and a spot to hide an AirTag. It also has a built-in handle and a wrist strap so you have multiple ways to carry it when you're out and about. For an extra layer of protection, Belkin is also selling two different screen protector options: a Tempered Glass Anti-Reflective Screen Protector and a Tempered Glass Blue Light Screen Protector. Both will shield your Switch 2's screen from major scratches and can be applied in a few steps. In the case of the blue light screen protector, Belkin is also claiming that it'll help reduce eye strain if you use your console for an extended period of time. Whichever you pick, just don't remove the Switch 2's pre-installed protective film before you apply. All of Belkin's new accessories are available to order today from Belkin's website and Amazon. You can get either the Charging Case or Travel Case in gray, tan or green, and the cases cost $70 or $30, respectively. The Tempered Glass Anti-Reflective Screen Protector costs $25 and the Tempered Glass Blue Light Screen Protector costs $30.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/belkins-new-line-of-switch-2-accessories-include-a-simple-but-effective-charging-case-230019750.html?src=rss",
