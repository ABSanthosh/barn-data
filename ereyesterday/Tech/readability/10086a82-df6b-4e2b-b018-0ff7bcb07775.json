Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost.Our new 2.5 Flash model has an amazing performance to cost ratio, putting it on the pareto frontier. It is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, allowing developers to turn thinking on or off, and set thinking budgets to optimize the balance between quality, cost, and latency. Even with thinking off, developers can maintain the speed of 2.0 Flash and improve performance. We can’t wait to see how you put Gemini 2.5 Flash to work in your apps, and to get your feedback.Gemini 2.5 Flash is also available to everyone in the Gemini app, and can be used with new features like Canvas, an interactive space for refining your documents and code.",
