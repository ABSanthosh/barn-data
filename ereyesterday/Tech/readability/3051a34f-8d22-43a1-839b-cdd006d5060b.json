  "text": "Dutch software firm Bird is moving most of its operations out of the Netherlands and opening new global hubs as it seeks a reprieve from “overregulation” in Europe, said co-founder and CEO Robert Vis. “The AI Act, financing, compensation, taxes, employment law — starting and running a company [in Europe] is hard,” Vis told TNW, adding that there are “too many disparate markets that are overregulated with no clear vision for the future while the world around us is changing.” Bird (formerly MessageBird) is one of the Netherlands’ leading tech scaleups, reaching unicorn status in 2018. Bird’s main product is a cloud-based platform that manages customer communications across messaging apps, calls, video, SMS, and email. The company also recently launched a new “AI employee” chatbot, which handles tasks such as responding to customer inquiries, qualifying leads, and providing personalised support.   Vis is now looking overseas to fuel the company’s next advances. “Both The Hague and Brussels enjoy being in meetings and talking more than they get shit done,” Vis said, adding that EU policymakers are “killing innovation.”    Amsterdam-based Bird will now open up three new offices in the US, and one each in Singapore, Dubai, and Istanbul. It will also open a “meditation, rejuvenation, and health centre” in Thailand for its employees, Vis said in a LinkedIn post.  Nevertheless, Bird will maintain an office in Lithuania and keep its tax base in the Netherlands for now — so it’s not leaving the EU entirely.  Earlier this month, Bird cut 120 jobs — roughly one-third of its total workforce, which is mainly based in Europe. New AI tools contributed to the staff cuts, said Vis, but it was also an effort to “position our teams closer to our customers” in the “Americas and Asia,” he told TechCrunch.   The news comes as the EU pushes ahead with its landmark AI Act, which entered force last year. The act lays out a rulebook for governing AI based on risk levels, designed to ensure the technology is deployed safely, transparently, and ethically.    The US, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction. While the EU imposes strict rules, the Trump administration is removing AI restrictions and giving tech sector leaders such as Elon Musk prominent roles in government.  “There is no stopping this technology whether we like it or not,” said Vis. “Whatever the future will hold — if you want to compete you need to be liberal not restrictive.” Vis is a former speaker at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
