  "text": "Anker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K: The Anker MagGo Power Bank 6.6K has a 6,600-mAh battery that can fully charge most iPhones once. It's Qi2-certified, which means it offers 15-watt fast charging capabilities and is fully MagSafe compatible, offering twice the speed of standard 7.5-watt wireless chargers for MagSafe-enabled iPhone 13, 14 and 15 models and Android smartphones that support 15-watt wireless charging.Anker Nano Power Bank (USB-C): This 5,000mAh power bank weighs in at 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams. It features 22.5 watts of fast charging power with the option to charge two devices at the same time if you plug a cable into the power bank's USB-C in/out charging port. (Charging two devices simultaneously divides the charging power in half, delivering 11.25 watts to each device.) myCharge Hub 6700 (Discontinued): MyCharge's Hub portable chargers come in a few different sizes and not only have an integrated foldable wall plug but also integrated Lightning and USB-C cables, so you can charge both Apple and Android devices. It's a little bulky, but with a 6,700-mAh battery, it should be able to almost fully charge your smartphone, depending on its size. The step-up 10,050-mAh model is still available and about $25 more.Nimble Champ: Nimble's updated Champ portable charger uses recycled plastic in its construction. You have to pay a bit more for going green, but it's a nice, compact 10,000-mAh charger that features 20-watt PD fast-charging with dual USB-C ports (one on either side of the power bank) that allow you to charge two devices at the same time. If you are charging two devices, your charging speeds will be limited to 10 watts per device.",
