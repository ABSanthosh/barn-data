The Bird Buddy's app works with the camera, alerting users when their favorite birds are having a snack.Keeping the camera charged is easy with the feeder's solar-powered roof. The Bird Buddy's manufacturer ensures the feeder's camera is respectful of privacy and does not share data without a user's acknowledgment.
