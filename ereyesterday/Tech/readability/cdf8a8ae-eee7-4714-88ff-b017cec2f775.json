  "text": "Dreamworks' first go at a live-action remake with 'How to Train Your Dragon' is a success. A second live-action remake has hit theaters with Universal’s How to Train Your Dragon, and shocker, it’s taking off big. Per Variety, the film has opened to $197.8 million worldwide. Of that, $114 million came from the international market, with Mexico, the UK and Ireland, and China listed as big contributors. Critic and audience reactions to the movie have been pretty solid, and it likely helps the larger How to Train Your Dragon franchise has never really went away: along with the three animated films, there’s been numerous TV shows continuing Hiccup and Toothless’ adventures over the years. Combined with trailers being in front of everything and this being the first Dreamworks movie to get a remake, it’s no wonder families and young adults flocked to see the remake, or why Universal’s already locked in a sequel for June 2027. As for our other big summer remake, Lilo \u0026 Stitch keeps on making money. The Disney movie added another $46.6 million global to its bag, making for a new take of $858 million. Like with Dragon, the heavy lifting came from its international aduience, where its made $31.3 million, while it earned $15.5 million domestic. If things keep going the way they are, Lilo could be the first movie of 2025 to hit the billion-dollar mark in the next couple of weeks. Dragon and Lilo will be joined by Pixar’s Elio next week as the big kid movies for a while in theaters: the older-skewing M3GAN 2.0 and F1 close out the month on June 27, then July opens with Jurassic World Rebirth (July 2) before eventually giving us Superman (July 11) and Fantastic Four: First Steps (July 25). We’re fully in the summer movie season now, folks! Want more io9 news?
