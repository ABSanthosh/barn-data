Credit: Amazon I recommend a lot of organizational tools around here, from high-quality shelves to renter-friendly options. While having a bunch of designated storage space is crucial for maintaining the decluttering and organizational principles that keep a home in order, some of the products on the market are a little spendy. Sometimes, sure, you need to drop some significant cash on something that will really help you whip a space into shape, but most of the time, there are inexpensive options that get the job done just as well. Here are some of my favorite organizing staples, all of which cost me less than or around $25. Storage carts save money and spaceFirst up, I got a new storage cart this week. You might not think that something so small—it's just 15 inches deep and under five inches wide—would be useful, but it absolutely is. A few notes: It was outrageously easy to build. The pieces were simple, they all snapped into place in a logical way, and I didn't even need any tools. It took me about two and a half minutes to do. It came with six different hooks, which really expands the potential it has for storage beyond its three tiered shelves. Crucially, it also came with wheels, but unlike the ones I've seen on a lot of build-it-yourself furniture, these actually work. The little casters don't get tangled or messed up. They're not sticky. They just... roll. Best of all? I got it for $16.71 after watching its price fluctuate between $17 and $21 while it was sitting in my Amazon cart. I am in love. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson As I've admired this over the past few hours, I've been stuck on what I want to do with it. It might be small, but it has a lot of potential. I'm tempted to make a new cleaning cart, which requires a rolling contraption such as this, but I'm also tempted to slide it next to my toilet for extra bathroom storage. Then again, it could fit easily in my closet, too, where it could help me with all the accessory organizing I struggle with—shoes and bags could go on the shelves while scarves, necklaces, and belts drape from the hooks. At this price point and knowing how versatile and simple it is, I'm thinking I should buy three more right now and just do it all. Under-cabinet storage is key (and cheap)On second thought, I probably won't create a cleaning cart out of my wonderful, tiered organizer—but only because I have finally organized my cleaning supplies just how I like them (and for under $25, again). I have an under-cabinet storage unit similar to this, but this product actually is better because you get two for $21.99. I only got one before, but it was around $17. Even though I just have the one, it's made a world of difference in keeping my cleaning supplies organized, mostly because of the bottom shelf's ability to slide out, which means I don't have to dig through a bunch of carefully stacked items to reach what I need. Again, there are hooks on the side, which are perfect for rags, so everything stays together. Acrylic organizers for existing shelvesI've mentioned this before, but acrylic organizers have done wonders for organizing my shelving. You can get wooden ones, too, but acrylic tends to be cheaper. Look for anything with tiered, tiny steps built in, like this: I use little risers like this all over my apartment: They store my makeup, my perfume, and, in some cases, smaller knick-knacks like candles and little decorations. Beyond the fact that they're just ridiculously cheap, the tiers make them perfect for holding delicate objects, since I don't have to disrupt any of the items in front to get to what's in the back and they don't touch or rub on each other. I can see and reach what I have and everything stays safe. (If you're worried about knocking things over on these delicate little units, though, pick up some museum gel, which is a sticky substance you can place under items on flat surfaces to keep them in place.)Cube shelving for creating subdivisionsI am, I believe, in my 12th year as a cube-shelving enthusiast. I've evangelized about these before, but I really stand by it for a few reasons. First, the shelves being broken up into square compartments makes it very easy to organize your possessions by niche categories. With longer shelves or drawers, you may only have one to dedicate to \"shirts,\" but shirts can refer to long-sleeved tops, t-shirts, going-out tops, camis, button-ups, sweaters, and a whole slew of other types. With cube storage, you can drill down on more refined categories, keeping everything in better order and making it easier to find what you need when you need it. The second reason is that they're cheap—most of the time. Yes, you can find larger versions that retail up into the $80 or $90 range, but my apartment is stocked up with these three-cube types, which are usually around $25. (I know the one linked above is $25.92, so not under $25, but according to price-tracking tool CamelCamelCamel, it's been down to $17.99 before and that's close to the price I remember purchasing these at most often. It's a waiting game, that's all.) I have them in my closet behind my hanging garments, in my kitchen (doubling as extra work space, with their flat tops), in my bathroom, and in my living room. They're compact and buying them in smaller configurations makes them more versatile and adaptable, especially when you're living in a smaller space. Cube shelves forever! I remain obsessed with my storage lamp (though its price fluctuates)Finally, since buying a storage lamp during October Prime Day, I've been consistently impressed with how useful it is—but the price has gone up recently. I cannot tell you this is something you can get for below or around $25, though it pains me to admit it. The one I have was in the $33 range in the fall, but is now $51.09. Kind of despicable, if you ask me, but I'm lucky I got it when I did because I use one level to hold lotions and cozy items, another for my gaming stuff, and the top one as a display area to take pictures of things I want to sell online, since the lighting from up top illuminates my goods just right. Plus, it's just a damn useful lamp in its own right, with or without the storage shelves underneath.The good news is that competing brands and products are available in the lower range, for about $29. Again, it's not $25, but it's still close and if you're looking for classy storage that doubles as functional decor, this is what I recommend.
