  "text": "Elden Ring Nightreign is the new multiplayer title from developer FromSoftware. It features the same combat as Elden Ring, but is a unique type of game. Players can adventure solo or in groups of three to try and defeat the Nightlord in short online matches, which could make it a perfect game for the Steam Deck. Portable gaming devices like the Steam Deck continue to gain in popularity as gamers want to take their favorite PC games on the go. A game like Elden Ring Nightreign is intended for short runs, meaning it won't be a big drain on the battery while playing. However, with all new games, there is a question of whether it will run on the Steam Deck. Is Elden Ring Nightreign Steam Deck verified?As of right now, Elden Ring Nightreign is not Steam Deck verified, but it very likely will be when it launches. Being Steam Deck verified means the game has controller support, works with the default resolution of the Steam Deck, has no compatibility issues, and supports the Steam Deck Proton system. However, being verified doesn't necessarily mean the game will run well. There are some games that are not Steam Deck verified that can still be played on the handheld, but they aren't a seamless experience. What are the Elden Ring Nightreign specs?Here are the minimum and recommended specs for Elden Ring Nightreign:Elden Ring Nightreign MinimumRecommendedCPU Intel Core i5-10600 or AMD RYZEN 5 5500Intel Core i5-11500 or AMD RYZEN 5 5600GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB or AMD Radeon RX 580 4GBNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8GB or AMD Radeon RX Vega-56 8GBRAM 12GB16GBStorage 30GB30GBWindows Windows 10Windows 11 And here are the specs for the Steam Deck:Steam Deck Specs CPU Zen 2 4c/8t, 2.4–3.5GHzRAM 16GB LPDDR5GPU 8 RDNA 2 CUs, 1.6GHzStorage Up to 2TB Can the Steam Deck Run Elden Ring Nightreign?Yes, and quite easily. I was able to do a few runs of Nightreign with the Steam Deck and didn't experience any slowdowns or other graphical issues while playing. It makes sense that it was able to handle the game, as it uses the original Elden Ring engine, which didn't strain most computers when it came out in 2022.There is, however, a catch. Nightreign servers require a certain level of system performance for multiplayer, and if that isn't met, you'll be locked into single-player mode.This requirement is likely due to the game's anticheat tech. Back in February, developer FromSoftware updated the Nightreign SteamDB page, confirming that the game would include anticheat software. This could mean that portable gaming devices not running Windows, like the Steam Deck or computers using Linux, may have an issue participating in multiplayer matches. Elden Ring Nightreign launches on May 30 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles for $40. Owning the original Elden Ring is not required to play this game.",
