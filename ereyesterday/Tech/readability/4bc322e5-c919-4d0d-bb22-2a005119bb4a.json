  "text": "Saturday Night Live’s \"Jury Duty\" sketch feels like what happens when the writers have too many absurd character ideas and decide to throw them all in one room. The result is a chaotic courtroom of misfits all trying (and failing) to dodge civic responsibility, much to the dismay of Ego Nwodim’s increasingly unamused judge. Host Mikey Madison and nearly the entire cast rotate through as over-the-top jury candidates, including a male feminist, a clocked bisexual who’s pro-mass incarceration, a prank-calling radio host who impersonates Jay-Z, and the return of Luigi Mangione —alongside a woman who wants to know if her nudes got to him.Madison plays a \"celebrity\" juror claiming fame as \"one of the people Caitlyn Jenner hit with her car.\" Shockingly, that excuse doesn’t fly.There’s no real point to the sketch, and that’s kind of the point. It’s dumb, it’s chaotic, and the cast is clearly having a blast.
