We had to put them to the test. Corin Cesaric is a Flex Editor at CNET currently covering home tech. She received her bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Before joining CNET, she covered crime at People Magazine and national and international news at NBC Local Television Stations. Expertise Home | Home Tech | Home Energy | Energy | Climate Change | AI | Appliances From sparkling water made by a bottle cap to make-believe salt, CES 2025 -- or rather the fascinating tech that is being unveiled during the event -- has it all. And our brave crew attending the event in Las Vegas this week has been tasting numerous tech-made foods and drinks that the groundbreaking devices created for them. Here's everything the CNET team tasted this week. Plus, when each of these gadgets will be available for purchase in the US. Watch this: I Spat on A Stick at CES to Measure My Stress Hormones (Eli Hormometer Test) 03:22Robot-made tortillasSenior Editor Jon Reed was thoroughly impressed with Apecoo's tortilla and roti maker, calling the tortilla the machine cooked up, \"a beautifully warm, perfectly flaky tortilla that almost instantly seemed to bring my weary soul back to life.\"Although the nearly $900 gadget isn't on the market yet, it should be in the next few months, according to the company. That might be a bit too pricey for the occasional tortilla eater. Instead, we can envision this being used in a restaurant or perhaps a food truck. The Apecoo tortilla and roti maker churns out another warm, fresh tortilla at CES 2025. Jon Reed/CNETPremeasured coffee from a $7,000 machineReed also made his way to Frazy Bot's booth to taste a frappuccino it made. He likened the taste to a Starbucks drink, but was a bit disappointed that he couldn't have it made with a diary-free milk (he's lactose intolerant), because the Frazy Bot uses premeasured ingredients to create the drink, and the frappuccino recipe used whole milk.  The Frazy Bot is a $7,000 coffee-making robot that uses customized, premeasured ingredients to make coffee the exact way you want. Jon Reed/CNETAlthough this product has not yet hit the market, it's expected to cost a whopping $7,000. But, if you can save money on coffee every single day by making it at home with a machine such as this one, there's a chance it could be worth it to some coffee lovers. Salt spoon Reed using the Kirin Electric Salt Spoon at CES 2025. CNETIf you have to cut back on your salt intake for health reasons, the Kirin Electric Salt Spoon wants to ensure that doesn't take a toll on the quality of your meals. The chunky spoon can add a salt flavor to your food without actually adding any salt into it, which could be a game-changer for people who can't indulge in too much of the seasoning. The spoon features different levels of saltiness and is expected to be available sometime this year in the US with a price tag of around $125. You can see Reed try the spoon in real time here.Sparkling water on the goIf you're a fan of sparkling water, you may be excited to learn that there will soon be a simple way for you to make it on the go. Roam, a hydration innovator, unveiled a water bottle that features a CO2 cartridge in the lid, so you can put still water in and pour carbonated water out. Reed tasted the fizz and says it had a \"gentle, drinkable level of carbonation.\" The process took mere seconds. It's expected to cost $50 when it becomes available. The magic happens in the lid of a Roam water bottle. James Martin/CNETFrozen Treats Editor at Large Bridget Carey got to taste a few sweet treats from ColdSnap during CES 2025, and she had no complaints about the passion mango smoothie the machine churned out for her.\"ColdSnap's new healthy options like smoothies and protein shakes were yummy,\" Carey says, adding that it's perfectly designed for a \"shared office space or waiting room lobby.\"ColdSnap has introduced new types of frozen treats it can create, and the machine is now available for purchase. The machine is currently on sale for $3,000. \"It's a neat example of something also you can buy now, and they worked on how the swirl dispenses so it looks more appealing.\" she says.  Bridget Carey tasted a variety of new options from ColdSnap during CES 2025. Faith Chihil/CNETHormometer Although this isn't something Carey ate per se, Eli Health's Hormometer, a hormone tester that you can use at home, does have to sit in your mouth for 60 seconds to collect your data -- or, saliva -- so it earned a spot on this list. With the small stick, Carey was able to test her stress during CES. We're happy to report she received optimal results.In addition to the cortisol test, the company also plans to offer progesterone tests in the same form, but we didn't get the chance to test those ones first-hand. A four-pack of the tests will run you $32 and you can join the waitlist now if you're interested in trying these out for yourself when they become available. Carey said the test felt a bit like there was cotton in her mouth, but it was only for 60 seconds. 23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth See all photos",
