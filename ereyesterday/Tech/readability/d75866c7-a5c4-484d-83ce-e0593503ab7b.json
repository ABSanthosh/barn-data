  "description": "Epic Games has dropped its suit against Samsung. \"We’re dismissing our court case against Samsung following the parties’ discussions,\" Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney posted on X. \"We are grateful that Samsung will address Epic’s concerns.\" The company filed the action in September. The lawsuit centered on the company's Auto Blocker feature, which only allows apps to be installed from the Google Play Store and Samsung Galaxy Store. Epic claimed this made it difficult for potential customers to use its own Epic Games Store and was a united effort by Google and Samsung to block that platform. Sweeney did not elaborate on what actions Samsung would take as a result of the negotiations. Epic Games has been quick to take its rivals to court. This suit followed a successful one it filed against Google on claims that the tech giant's operation of the Google Play Store violated US antitrust laws. The gaming company wasn't as fortunate when it pursued similar charges against Apple, but after several appeals Epic did force Apple to reverse course on transaction fees and it got Fortnite back in the App Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/epic-games-ends-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-samsung-215806962.html?src=rss",
