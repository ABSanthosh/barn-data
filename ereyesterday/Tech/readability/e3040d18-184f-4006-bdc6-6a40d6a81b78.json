Since there was so much going on, we wanted to try a fresh way to explore and understand some of these updates — so we asked Gemini for some help. We used Canvas (which also got some updates last week) to analyze the transcript from the keynote, pull out some impressive numbers and offer explanations of them.

There’s even a post-I/O item in there we think many of you will be interested in!",
