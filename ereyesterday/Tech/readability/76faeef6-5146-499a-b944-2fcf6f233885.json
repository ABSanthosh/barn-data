Credit: Mashable Photo Composite | Ninja | LifeStraw | Apple Having covered Prime Day for Mashable since 2022, I can tell you that the end of the sale doesn't always mean the end of the deals. The official four-day shopping event is over, and while most of the lightning deals have vanished, a surprising number of top-tier products are still available at their discounted prices.I've been sifting through the aftermath to find the best of the best that are still live. From must-have Apple gadgets to Ninja appliances, here are the 10 post-Prime Day deals that are absolutely still worth your money this weekend.Buy 2, Get 1 Free Why we like itAs much as we love streaming service, sometimes you want to own your favorite media, not rent it. So, cap off the Prime Day shopping week with a free book or Blu-ray of your choice. Popular titles included in the promotion include movies like Moana 2, books like Project Hail Mary, and new CDs like Lorde's Virgin. This post-Prime Day Amazon sale lets you buy three pieces of physical media for the price of two. It's not quite a BOGO deal, but it's still much appreciated.Get 3 for the price of 2: Blu-RayGet 3 for the price of 2: Books \u0026 CDsBest AirPods deal still live Why we like it I am genuinely shocked this deal is still live. This record-low price on Apple's AirPods Pro 2 was a pre-sale surprise; it first dropped to $149 on July 7, the day before Prime Day even kicked off.Somehow, they're still available for that price. For under $150, you're getting Apple's top-tier earbuds, which feature active noise cancellation (ANC), Adaptive Audio that adjusts to your environment, and new hearing health features like a scientifically validated Hearing Test. This is, without a doubt, the best value you'll find on the best earbuds Apple makes.Read our review: The new AirPods Pro look old but sound freshBest runner-up AirPods deal still live Why we like it While the AirPods Pro 2 are my top pick, I also have to highlight the deal on the AirPods 4 with ANC. Former Mashable Tech Editor Kimberly Gedeon, tested them on a 3,319-mile flight and was seriously impressed. She found that the ANC \"significantly reduce[d] the drone of the airplane engine\" and the sound quality was \"honeyed,\" especially when using Personalized Spatial Audio. She also praised the new \"one-size-fits-most\" design, which stayed snug even while running on a treadmill. If you don't need ANC, you can get the Apple AirPods 4 w/o ANC for $89, down from $129.Read our review: Apple AirPods 4 with ANC review: I flew 3,319 miles on a plane with active noise cancellationBest iPad deal still live Why we like it For a long time, buying the base-model iPad meant settling for an outdated design with a home button. Not anymore. The new 11-inch iPad is essentially a more affordable iPad Air, making it our top pick for the best value tablet deal still available post-Prime Day. As Mashable's Samantha Mangino argues, it's \"a great entry-level tablet\" for anyone working on a budget.It has the modern all-screen design with a Liquid Retina display, the speedy A16 chip for a nice performance boost, and a landscape front camera that's much better for video calls. Most importantly, the base storage has been doubled to 128GB, so you don't need to worry about loading up on apps and photos. The post-Prime Day deal price of $279.99 — a record-low for this model — is still active on the Blue model, but be aware that the Pink is sold out and the Yellow model is currently priced about $20 higher.Best AirTag deal still live Why we like it I have two beagles who are professional escape artists, so my favorite use for Apple's AirTags is putting them on their harnesses. It gives me peace of mind knowing I can track them down using the Find My network if they ever get loose. While the price for a four-pack has ticked up by about $3 since its Prime Day low, it's still a pretty good deal. With summer travel upon us, now's the perfect time to grab a pack for your keys, wallet, and especially your luggage. You can get a four-pack for just $67.99, which is a 31% discount off the usual $99 list price. Best Amazon deal still live Why we like it Amazon's own devices always see some of the steepest discounts during Prime Day, and my pick for the best deal still live is, without a doubt, the Fire TV Stick 4K. It's a massive upgrade for a tiny price. If you have an older TV or even a newer one with a slow, clunky interface, this is the easiest and most affordable way to fix it. This newest model delivers a cinematic experience with support for 4K Ultra HD and Dolby Vision, plus WiFi 6 for smoother streaming with less buffering. For $24.99 — a full 50% off its list price — it's the best tech upgrade you can make for under $25.Best TV deal still live Why we like it Finding a 65-inch 4K TV for under $400 is a good deal. Finding a QLED model with premium gaming and home theater features at that price is almost unheard of, which makes this Hisense my pick for the best TV deal still live after Prime Day.With this deal, you're getting a big screen plus QLED panel which produces over a billion shades of vibrant color. It also supports high-end home theater formats like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound. It's an absolute steal for just $359.99, which was a record-low price as of July 10.Best Ninja deal still live Why we like it I've never bought an air fryer of my own, but I've had my eye on the Ninja Crispi for months. I'm genuinely interested in how well this meal-prepping gadget works, and when it finally went on sale, I was ecstatic. The best news is that its post-sale discount is still live, but I definitely don't see it staying at this price for very long. Mangino reviewed this product too, and admitted she was initially skeptical of the strange-looking glass air fryer. However, she found that it \"delivered food that was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside,\" handling her tests of both tofu and frozen French fries with \"flying colors.\" She also noted its convenience for meal preppers and praised its ability to cook, serve, and store leftovers all in the same dishwasher-safe glass container. For anyone with a small kitchen or a love for clever gadgets, it's a great buy at its current sale price of $159.95. Mashable Deals Read our review: We tested the most popular Ninja appliances in our own kitchens. Here's what we found.Best Lego deal still live Why we like it Some of my favorite deals are the ones I have personal experience with, and this is one of them. My nephew has this exact Lego Classic set, and we play with it all the time. What I love about it is that it's just a giant box of creative potential. Unlike the themed sets that you build once and put on a shelf, this one encourages imaginative, free-form building. It comes with 484 pieces in 35 different colors, including plenty of wheels, eyes, and windows, so you can build whatever you can think of, from tigers to trains to weird-looking cars. It even comes in a convenient plastic storage box. The fact that it's still on sale for its all-time record-low price after Prime Day is crazy in the best way possible. Best hydration deal still live Why we like it I've never personally used a LifeStraw, but it was the number-one best-selling product among our readers during Prime Day this year. This super-practical personal water filter removes over 99.9% of waterborne bacteria, parasites, and microplastics, so you can drink from a river or lake without getting sick.It's an essential for any hiker, camper, or emergency go-bag. The fact that this deal is still live for under $10 is why it continues to be a best-seller, even after the main event has ended.Best coupon deal Why we like it I know what you're thinking. This is a tech deals list, so what are acne patches doing here? While we rarely cover beauty products (unless it's a Shark, Dyson, or a beauty tool like the Solawave skincare wand), this coupon deal was too good to ignore.These hydrocolloid patches (144 count) can be an absolute lifesaver whenever you have a big event coming up. They're infused with Salicylic Acid and Tea Tree Oil to help reduce redness and shrink pimples overnight. They're also discreet and ultra-thin, but you can also use them as an overnight spot treatment. A pack of 144 patches is already a great value, but right now there's a coupon on the page that drops the price under $8. Tabitha Britt is a freelance writer, editor, SEO \u0026 content strategist.
