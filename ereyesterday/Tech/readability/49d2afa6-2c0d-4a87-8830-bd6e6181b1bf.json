  "text": "The long-awaited phone will make its debut at a virtual Unpacked event. Here's everything to know and how to tune in. Abrar Al-Heeti is a senior technology reporter for CNET, with an interest in phones, streaming, autonomous vehicles, internet trends, entertainment, pop culture and digital accessibility. She's also worked for CNET's video, culture and news teams. She graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Though Illinois is home, she now loves San Francisco -- steep inclines and all. Expertise Abrar has spent her career at CNET analyzing tech trends while also writing news, reviews and commentaries across mobile, streaming and online culture. CredentialsNamed a Tech Media Trailblazer by the Consumer Technology Association in 2019, a winner of SPJ NorCal's Excellence in Journalism Awards in 2022 and has three times been a finalist in the LA Press Club's National Arts \u0026 Entertainment Journalism Awards. At long last, the super-thin Galaxy S25 Edge that Samsung teased earlier this year is slated to make its official debut. The company will showcase the phone at a virtual Unpacked event on Monday, May 12.Samsung introduced the S25 Edge at its Galaxy Unpacked event in January, and had models of the phone on display -- but no one could touch or get too close to them. The company had a similar hands-off display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. At last, it appears we're one step closer to seeing just how thin -- and hopefully light -- the latest addition to the Galaxy lineup is.  Watch this: First Look at Samsung's Surprise Galaxy S25 Edge 01:53How to watch the Galaxy S25 Edge unveiling Samsung's Unpacked event for the S25 Edge will be fully virtual and will be held on Monday, May 12, at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT). The event will be livestreamed on Samsung's YouTube channel, on Samsung.com and on the Samsung Newsroom. CNET will be covering all the live updates, so be sure to follow along.The launch of the S25 Edge comes about three months after the release of the baseline Galaxy S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra.What features will the S25 Edge have?When Samsung first teased the Galaxy S25 Edge, details were slimmer than the device itself. There have been plenty of rumors, though, primarily relating to the phone's battery and camera. With less space, just how much battery capacity and camera specs could Samsung pack in?A leak from German tech blog WinFuture earlier this month suggests the S25 Edge will have a 3,900-mAh battery, which is less than both the baseline S25's 4,000-mAh battery and the S25 Plus' 4,900 mAh. We'll have to see if these leaks align with what Samsung unveils on Monday, and, if true, whether the company manages to improve battery efficiency so you don't really feel that difference. Regarding the camera, Samsung's display models showed two lenses on the back. Subsequent rumors have suggested a 200-megapixel wide lens paired with a 12-megapixel ultrawide lens. Samsung has remained quiet on any specifics until now, but confirmed in a post Wednesday that the S25 Edge will indeed feature that 200-megapixel wide lens. \"And thanks to Galaxy AI, the camera transforms into a smart lens that helps recognize what matters to create new memories,\" Samsung added. AI capabilities will extend to photo editing as well, it says. Other rumors from leaker Evan Blass suggest the S25 Edge will weigh 163 grams, measure 5.8mm thick and feature a titanium bezel, along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 display. It could also be equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip.Additional rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 Edge could have a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2,130 x 1,440 resolution, 12 GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. Again, we'll have to see what the official specs are from Samsung come May 12.Why is Samsung making a thin Galaxy phone?So, why would someone want a thin phone anyway? It appears many phone makers, from Samsung to Apple to Oppo, are eyeing slim phones as the next design iteration to lure in potential customers. Oppo released its super-thin Find N5 foldable earlier this year, which it calls the \"world's thinnest book-style foldable,\" measuring just 8.93mm thick when closed and 4.21mm thick when opened. Apple is rumored to be developing an \"Air\" version of the iPhone 17, a thinner (and presumably lighter) version of its handset. At MWC 2025, phone-maker Tecno showed off its Spark Slim phone concept, a handset measuring 5.75mm thick (skinnier than a standard pencil) and weighing only 146 grams, according to the company. But thin phones have a big hurdle to overcome: Less space often means a smaller battery, scaled-back camera hardware and less storage. And as it so happens, those are three of the biggest considerations when people buy a new phone, according to a CNET survey from August. \"You can't just be thin; you have to still have all the bells and whistles of a premium phone,\" Nabila Popal, senior director of data and analytics at IDC, told me at MWC in March. \"The question is, how are OEMs [phone makers] going to achieve that without compromising the other more important features like battery and camera?\"Popal also noted that the \"slim is in\" trend is largely an attempt by phone makers to differentiate their products. AI has also been a means for companies to make their offerings stand out, but that's already become rather ubiquitous. An eye-catchingly thin phone could be one way to grab people's attention -- and dollars.As Samsung sees it, it's all about \"merging flagship-level performance with superior portability,\" it noted in its post, adding, \"As our reliance on these devices grows, so do our expectations for them to be portable and lightweight without sacrificing power and innovation.\"Starting Wednesday, eligible customers who reserve the Galaxy S25 Edge can get a $50 Samsung credit toward the device.  We'll see what's in store come May 12.",
