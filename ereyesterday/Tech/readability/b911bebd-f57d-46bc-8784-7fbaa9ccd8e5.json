It can track indoor and outdoor runs, cycling, swimming, and more, making it versatile for various fitness routines. On the other hand, the Garmin Forerunner 255 is available for $249 with a 29% discount from its list price of $349 and offers a more advanced feature set aimed at serious athletes. With a slightly larger 27.5mm display, this smartwatch not only tracks your runs but also provides deeper insights into your health and performance.
