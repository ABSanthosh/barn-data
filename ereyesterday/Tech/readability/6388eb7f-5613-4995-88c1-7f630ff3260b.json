  "text": "Former theater kids, rejoice! Tickets are now on sale for the official sing-along version of Jon M. Chu’s Wicked, just in time for the holidays. In gratitution for your efforts to not belt “Defying Gravity” along with Cynthia Erivo and “Popular” with Ariana Grande, Universal Pictures and movie theaters across the nation have made it so you can be unlimited in your vocal aspirations. Find out more about the upcoming Wicked experiences below! Alamo Drafthouse: Probably the most immersive version of the sing-along will be held as part of the special Alamo Drafthouse Movie Party screening series. Here you can fully sing, talk, and treat yourself. You’ll lose your Shiz over the party favors like broomstick pens, pink bubbles, Shiz notebooks, emerald green glasses, and even a limited edition Glinda hot cocoa glass. As you might expect at the Drafthouse, there’s also a dining component to the experience: the Wicked Holiday Wonderland Menu. The limited time food fare includes a Shiz University Chicken Wrap and a Yellow Brick Burger, as well as drinks like the Defying Gravi-Tea (boozy with Jameson Irish Whiskey), and the Witch’s Brew horchata (with Malibu Coconut Rum). There’s also Alamo Drafthouse x Wicked exclusive merch (including a lunchbox) while supplies last. These offerings are available until January 13, 2025. Learn more here. AMC and Regal Theaters: Make your local cineplex the most swankified place in town and check out the listings for the Wicked sing-alongs. Here’s where you can find more widely available movie theaters with special showtimes and limited time Wicked merch (if it’s not sold out already). If you have AMC A-list, good news: you can use your pass to watch the sing-along in your weekly movie slot allotment. For the full theater listings visit here. Wicked is now in theaters (for non-singers) and Wicked Part Two is set for release Thanksgiving of next year. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
