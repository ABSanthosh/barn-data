Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! As hybrid work expands, more employees are using Android devices to access company resources — often without proper security controls. In fact, 54% of organizations experienced a data breach due to inappropriate access to sensitive and confidential information on employee mobile devices.That’s why we’re introducing Device Trust from Android Enterprise, a new way to verify and secure any Android device used for work, managed or not. 1 By making it easy to continuously check the security status of a device through the Android Management API, Device Trust from Android Enterprise helps reduce the risk of data breaches caused by outdated security patches, on-device malware and weak lock screen passcodes.Built upon the principles of Zero Trust, this new solution gives businesses real-time insight into device posture before granting access to sensitive data — whether or not the device is enrolled with an enterprise mobility management (EMM) provider. Integrated security, all in one viewMobile security has often been treated as a silo, separate from endpoint and identity security. Device Trust from Android Enterprise helps change that. By integrating with leading security partners like CrowdStrike, Okta, Omnissa, Urmobo and Zimperium, Device Trust from Android Enterprise brings more than 20 Android-specific signals directly into the tools your security team already uses:Device management: Enterprise mobility management (EMM) or unified endpoint management (UEM) systemsIdentity: Identity provider (IdP) solutionsThreat detection: Endpoint detection and response (EDR) or mobile threat defense (MTD) toolsMonitoring: Security information and event management (SIEM) platformsThis makes it easier to set layered, robust access policies across any Android device.Comprehensive security for all devicesKeeping company data secure is a top priority, no matter what devices your employees use. Whether or not a device is managed via an EMM, Device Trust from Android Enterprise provides IT teams with consistent capabilities like security patch level, OS version, pending update status, screen lock, network state and more. To easily get security insights into employee-owned devices or for device environments without an EMM, installing a partner security app can help you verify the device's trust status without requiring enrollment. For company-owned and EMM-managed devices, Device Trust from Android Enterprise adds an extra layer of security for your business data and helps you integrate directly with your organization's security tools.“Organizations demand a certain level of security on personal devices when connecting to work data and applications,” says Mike Jude, research director for endpoint security at IDC. “Device Trust from Android Enterprise is a valuable step in that direction. If you as an employee are bringing your personal Android device to work, your company needs to ensure that the connection is secure.”Fast onboarding for contractors and temporary workersTemporary staff often need fast, secure access to business systems — without lengthy enrollment processes. Device Trust from Android Enterprise helps consultants and short-term workers to access company apps securely. No corporate IT setup needed. When the engagement ends, access to any applications can be revoked immediately with the employee’s work credentials.Real-time threat responseWith direct access to on-device trust signals, your IT team can make smarter decisions fast. Lost phone? Use integrated partner tools to begin forensics. Outdated OS? Block access automatically. These proactive controls reduce risk and improve incident response.Learn moreRegister for our digital event Android Talks Device Trust, to learn about benefits and use cases from Android Enterprise experts and partners.
