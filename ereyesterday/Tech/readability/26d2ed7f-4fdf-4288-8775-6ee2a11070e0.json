  "text": "Zohran Mamdani has managed to do something rare in today’s fractured political climate: he has united a faction of the Democratic establishment with an army of online alpha males in shared outrage. Since his victory in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York on June 24, the socialist assemblyman has been subjected to a relentless and violent online onslaught, particularly from the influencers of the self described manosphere. For these men, who view feminism, wokeness, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as existential threats, the attacks are constant. Through a torrent of posts, memes, and reposts, their message boils down to two simple lines: Mamdani, 33, is “dangerous” because he is a “socialist,” and he will ruin New York. He must be stopped at all costs. This campaign has taken on a special urgency given that in deep blue New York City, the Democratic candidate is heavily favored to win the mayoralty. The operation to stop Mamdani received its kickoff from the highest level of the Republican party. “The Democrats have crossed the line,” President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on June 25. “Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Democratic Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor.” Trump’s post signaled the start of a coordinated effort. Realizing a Republican victory would be difficult, if not impossible, pro-Trump billionaire Bill Ackman is offering to fund a “centrist” candidate willing to challenge Mamdani in the November election. He framed this as a heroic mission to save New York from impending doom. “New York City under Mamdani is about to become much more dangerous and economically unviable,” Ackman wrote in a lengthy post pinned to his X profile on June 26. “If someone is ready to raise their hand, I will take care of the fundraising,” he offered, attempting to entice a challenger. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the right candidate. More importantly, it is an opportunity to save our City and be a superhero. Life is short and you must dare to be great.” I awoke this morning gravely concerned about New York City. I thought “What has NYC become that an avowed socialist who has supported defunding the police, whose solution to lowering food prices is city-owned supermarkets, who doesn’t understand that freezing rents will only… — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) June 26, 2025 Mamdani is a 33‑year‑old Ugandan‑born, naturalized Muslim American state legislator whose progressive platform—fare‑free buses, public child care, rent freezes, wealth taxes—has energized grassroots support. His upset win over Andrew Cuomo represents both a generational and ideological shift within the Democratic Party. His ascent has particularly inspired Muslim, South Asian, and immigrant communities, even as it triggers alarm among conservative and establishment circles Within the core manosphere, sometimes known as the red pill community, which often spreads ideas of white supremacy under the guise of protecting Western civilization, Mamdani is described as an anti white racist. “Mamdani has been posting racist, anti white musings for over a decade,” conservative activist Charlie Kirk posted on X on June 27. Kirk resurrected a 2013 tweet from Mamdani that quoted comedian Hari Kondabolu criticizing systemic inequality. “I guess white New Yorkers hate themselves so much they’ll vote for him anyway. Sad!!” Kirk deduced. His post quickly generated over half a million views, flooded with comments calling for Mamdani’s deportation. Mamdani has been posting racist, anti-white musings for over a decade. I guess white New Yorkers hate themselves so much they'll vote for him anyways. Sad!! https://t.co/GXyg5ohQae — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) June 27, 2025 The quote in question reads, “The invisible hand of the market, my ass. That hand is white and wearing a ring with a conflict diamond in it.” The line, which Mamdani posted on December 19, 2013, is a satirical critique of capitalism. It riffs on Adam Smith’s famous concept of the “invisible hand” to suggest that markets are not as neutral as claimed, especially for marginalized communities. But in the manosphere, reality and nuance are words that rarely find purchase, especially when they might disrupt a narrative. Other prominent commentators have joined the pile on. Ben Shapiro shared a meme anticipating an exodus of the wealthy from New York to Florida because “maniacs” have “blew” the city up. Conservative pundit Matt Walsh claimed Mamdani’s victory is tantamount to New York’s destruction, making sure to point out that Mamdani is “Muslim.” “New Yorkers Embrace The Destruction Of Their City By Voting For Socialist Muslim Mayor,” Walsh posted on X. He has since accused Mamdani of wanting to “castrate children with tax money, nationalize grocery stores, and abolish the police in the name of ‘queer liberation.'” Walsh also attacked Mamdani’s citizenship. “Mamdani became a US citizen in 2018,” he posted. “Two years later, he was already working to tear down monuments to our historical icons. The incredible arrogance and entitlement of this whiney, ungrateful brat.” Mamdani became a US citizen in 2018. Two years later he was already working to tear down monuments to our historical icons.

New York City is headed for disaster if Zohran becomes Mayor. https://t.co/4V3vwEx7X3 — Mike Lawler (@lawler4ny) June 27, 2025 Even prominent liberals have joined the hunt, attacking Mamdani’s platform. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers took aim at his housing policy. “Rent control is the second best way to destroy a city, after bombing,” he criticized, adding, “I think this is likely to exacerbate rather than improve issues around housing affordability in New York. This would be a gross policy error by @ZohranKMamdani.” Rent control is the second-best way to destroy a city, after bombing. And, because of what it leads to in terms of under investment in repairing, maintaining, constructing new apartments, I think this is likely to exacerbate rather than improve issues around housing affordability… — Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) June 27, 2025 Meanwhile, conservative journalist Daniel Greenfield questioned Mamdani’s appearance in “a terror mosque that prayed for Hamas to win, cursed Jews and Christians, and teaching urged their children to hate everything about America,” implying Mamdani is an anti-Semitic, anti-American radical.

His victory upsets the balance within a Democratic Party still finding its footing after the last presidential election. As November approaches, the attacks will only intensify. The lines of assault are clear: he is dangerous because he is Muslim; he will drive away the rich because he is a socialist; and he is an anti Semitic, anti white radical. The manosphere and its allies are using a potent combination of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant tropes to try and bring him down.",
