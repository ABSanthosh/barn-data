  "text": "Robot vacuums have become an increasingly popular tool for maintaining a clean and tidy home with minimal effort, and over the past decade, the market has grown increasingly competitive. One of the more recent major players in the game is Eureka, and if you're looking for a way to simplify your cleaning routine, the Eureka E10s Robot Vacuum might be the solution you need. What is the Eureka E10s?The Eureka E10s is a hybrid robot vacuum and mop from Eureka that offers up a range of new features designed to streamline household cleaning. As a mid-range offering (RRP A$1,099), the E10s has a lot going for it. Ultra-high precision laser navigation and a 2L transparent dust cup design help protect the environment and save you money by eliminating the need to purchase dust bags. It’s self charging, with 180 minutes of continuous battery life, 4,000pa suction power, and an operating volume of 65Db. It can automatically detect your floor type to avoid wetting the carpet, has a range of smart features and tools to help it navigate a wide variety of surfaces and spaces and a powerful app that is fairly straightforward.Want to know more? We’ve got you covered. Here are all the key features that the Eureka E10s brings to the table:Self charging, and self-emptyingThe E10s takes care of recharging itself. When the battery runs low, it automatically returns to its charging dock and resumes cleaning when fully charged. This feature saves you from having to monitor the vacuum, ensuring it’s always ready for the next cleaning session without wasting energy. The 2L super-sized dustbin can store up to 45 days' days of dust and floor debris.Smart mapping \u0026 controlsThe Eureka Smart Mapping technology quickly learns the layout of your home, with a scanning speed of 3.5 seconds per square metre. This helps it to clean efficiently straight away, covering every key area, avoiding obstacles, and minimising missed spots. This also allows you to create custom zones to direct the vacuum’s behaviour within the app, like focusing on specific rooms or high-traffic areas in your home. Mashable Light Speed Multi-surface functionalityWhether your floors are hardwood, tile, or carpet, the E10s automatically detects the floor in a room and adjusts to handle them all. Its suction power adapts to the surface, delivering effective cleaning across different floor types, and it will lift its cleaning cloth to avoid wetting carpet. This versatility means you won’t have to worry about changing settings manually.AccessibilityThe E10s is designed to be user-friendly, and is complimented by an impressively simple app. Its automated features and remote controls make it easy for anyone to use, including older people, the technologically illiterate or those with mobility challenges. With just a few taps on the app or a simple voice command using Alexa or Google Assistant, you can keep your home clean effortlessly.Designed with pets in mindIf you have pets, you know how quickly hair and dander accumulate. The Eureka E10s is equipped with strong suction and specialised brushes to collect pet hair effectively. It can help you keep floors free from fur and allergens, creating a cleaner environment for you and your family.Small and quietWith its slim design, the E10s can clean under furniture and reach tight spaces that traditional vacuums might miss. It also takes up very little storage space, making it a good fit for small homes or apartments where storage space is limited. It also operates with minimal noise, so it can clean during the day while you work or at night without disturbing your sleep.Instead of requiring you to constantly change out the bag in the charging dock like other robot vacuums, the Eureka E10s features a self-emptying base station where a transparent, reusable dust cup is used instead. Emptying the dust container works similar to traditional cyclonic vacuum cleaners, and an in-built HEPA filter helps to hold most particles inside.Key specifications Credit: Eureka Is the Eureka E10s right for you?For households with pets, busy schedules, or for those just seeking more accessible cleaning solutions, the Eureka E10s is a robot vacuum worth considering.  While it may feel like a large upfront investment, a decent robot vacuum and mop can save you money over time on professional cleaning services. Additionally, keeping floors consistently clean can help prevent damage caused by dirt and debris, potentially extending the life of your floors. While it may not replace deeper cleaning methods entirely, it can complement existing cleaning routines and help users maintain a more consistently tidy home. You can pick one up on Amazon in Australia here.",
