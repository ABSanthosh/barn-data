  "description": "In 2024, North Korean state-sponsored hackers stole $1.34 billion in cryptocurrency across 47 attacks, marking a 102.88% increase from 2023 and accounting for 61% of global crypto theft. BleepingComputer reports: Although the total number of incidents in 2024 reached a record-breaking 303, the total losses figure isn't unprecedented, as 2022 remains the most damaging year with $3.7 billion. Chainalysis says most of the incidents this year occurred between January and July, during which 72% of the total amount for 2024 was stolen. The report highlights the DMM Bitcoin hack from May, where over $305 million was lost, and the WazirX cyberheist from July, which resulted in the loss of $235 million. As for what types of platforms suffered the most damage, DeFi platforms were followed by centralized services. Regarding the means, the analysts report that private key compromises accounted for 44% of the losses, while exploitation of security flaws corresponded to just 6.3% of stolen cryptocurrency. This is a sign that security audits have a significant effect on reducing exploitable flaws on the platforms. However, stricter security practices in the handling of private keys need to be implemented. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
