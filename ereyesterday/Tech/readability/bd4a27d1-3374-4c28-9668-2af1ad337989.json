This means protecting your personal and financial data is more critical than ever, but also more complicated than ever.Here are some key strategies to help you stay secure and maintain your peace of mind online:Use strong, unique passwords for every accountPasswords are the first line of defence against unauthorised access to your accounts. Yet, many users still reuse simple passwords across multiple platforms, making them easy targets for hackers. To enhance your security, create strong, unique passwords for every account – combining letters, numbers and special characters. Using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords ensures that you never need to rely on memory or repetition. Password managers can be bought as standalone subscriptions, but are also normally included security suites such as Bitdefender Premium Security and Bitdefender Ultimate Security.Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)Multi-factor authentication (MGA) and two-factor authentication (2FA) add an additional layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password. This could be a one-time code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or an app-based authenticator. With MFA or 2FA enabled, even if your password is compromised, unauthorised access is nearly impossible without the secondary credential. Lean more about enabling MFA here.Be aware of phishing attemptsPhishing is a common online threat where scammers trick users into providing sensitive information by posing as legitimate entities. These scams often appear as emails, text messages or even fake websites. To counter this threat, educate yourself in identifying phishing scams, and use detection tools like Bitdefender’s Scam Copilot, which identifies and blocks scams in your email, browser, messages and other apps. Scam Copilot is included in Bitdefender’s Premium and Ultimate security suites. Mashable Light Speed Keep your software updatedOutdated software makes you a prime target for cybercriminals looking to exploit vulnerabilities. Whether it’s your operating system, browser, apps and even antivirus software, keeping everything up to date ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches and features. Most software platforms offer automatic updates – make sure this is enabled to stay protected without the hassle of manual checks.Use comprehensive security softwareInvesting in reliable security software is one of the best ways to safeguard your devices. At the bare minimum, you should get a no-frills antivirus like Bitdefender Antivirus Plus, which will keep you protected against malware, spyware and ransomware. Meanwhile, security suites like Bitdefender Premium Security and Bitdefender Ultimate Security bundle in many other useful tools, such as Scam Copilot scam detection, unlimited VPN, password manager and more. Read more about security suites here.Practice safe browsing habitsCybercriminals often exploit risky online behaviour to gain access to sensitive information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links, downloading files from unverified sources, or visiting unsecured websites. While the presence of the HTTPS padlock in the browser no longer indicate that the website is safe to visit, it's still a good indicator that the data you are about to enter will not be intercepted as it goes to its destination. Never submit sensitive information on sites that do not offer HTTPS connections. You should also limit the amount of personal information you share online to minimise your exposure to potential attacks.Educate yourself and stay informedAt the end of the day, online safety begins with you. Stay informed about the latest online threats. Since you’re reading this article, you already know that PCMag is a great place to start. Cybersecurity providers also share information about the threats they are up against, such as on this Bitdefender blog. Knowledge is power, and by educating yourself, you can proactively defend against potential risks.Stay safe out there!",
