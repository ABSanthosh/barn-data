  "text": "Apple today announced some minor updates to Logic Pro for both the Mac and the iPad, including the ability to search for plug-ins and sources and the addition of more analog-simulating sounds. In Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1, you can now reorder channel strips and plug-ins in the mixer and plug-in windows to make it easier to organize the layout of an audio mix. As for the new sounds, Apple added a library of analog synthesizer samples called Modular Melodies, akin to the Modular Rhythms pack already found in Logic. A more exciting sonic addition is the new Quantec Room Simulator (QRS) plug-in, which emulates the vintage digital reverb hardware of the same name, found in professional recording studios all over the world. Apple has acquired the technology for the classic QRS model and the later YardStick models to integrate into this software. I wish the QRS plug-in looked like the real life reverb unit Image: AppleSpecific to Logic Pro for Mac, you are now able to share a song to the Mac’s Voice Memos app — which may be a great feature for when Voice Memos gets that multitrack option on the iPhone in iOS 18.2 Added to the iPad version of Logic Pro is the ability to add your own local third party sample folders to the browser window, to make it easier to bring external audio files into tracks and sampler plug-ins.These upgrades are small for current Logic users, but they do overall make the digital audio workplace easier to use and adds to the plethora of useful tools for no additional cost. Users will have access to upgrade to Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1 today.",
