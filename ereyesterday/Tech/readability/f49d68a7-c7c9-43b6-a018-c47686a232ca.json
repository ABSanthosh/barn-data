This collaboration has resulted in \"Reflection Point,\" a new public sculpture unveiled today at Rockefeller Center. It’s an interactive mirrored maze with prominent graphic shapes, designed to invite visitors to explore and navigate through the artwork.Wade and Leta used Google's generative AI tool, Whisk, to influence, support and enhance their creative process from initial concepts through to physical construction. They integrated Whisk to expand possibilities, testing visual directions rapidly and exploring unexpected aesthetics. The artists see Whisk as a \"creative partner\" that helped them push boundaries and challenge their typical methods. The sculpture aims to be accessible and interactive for people of all ages and backgrounds. Reflection Point is on display at Center Plaza until July 20.",
