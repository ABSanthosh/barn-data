The app already has a voice mode where you can chat back and forth with a faceless version of Grok, and that has an NSFW toggle.The addition of the animated characters follows Grok posting antisemitism and Hitler praise last week, which xAI said was due to an “update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot.”",
