It also provides tools for reporting and analytics. Earlier this month, Mews raised $75mn, bringing its total funding to date to $411mn, according to PitchBook data. To date, the company has acquired 12 competitors as it looks to increase its market share. The scaleup is riding sustained growth in global travel to fuel its expansion. Mews reported 50% year-on-year growth in 2024, processing more than $10bn in payments volume and surpassing $200mn in revenue. Last year, the scaleup also earned unicorn status after raising $110mn at a valuation of $1.2bn.  While things are going well at Mews, Welle feels that the Dutch government isn’t doing enough to support entrepreneurs. “There’s no plan for tech startups,” Welle said in a recent interview. “That is the biggest problem.” Growing concerns over Dutch plans for startups Welle is not the only Dutch tech leader frustrated with the lack of support for up-and-coming businesses.  Robert Vis, co-founder and CEO of Bird, announced last month that the company plans to move most of its operations out of the Netherlands. He didn’t mince his words, either. “Both The Hague and Brussels enjoy being in meetings and talking more than they get shit done,” Vis told TNW, adding that EU policymakers are “killing innovation.”    Job van der Voort, CEO and founder of Remote, an HR platform valued at over $3bn, believes Europe as a whole is not doing enough to nurture the next big tech success stories.  Van der Voort also warns that burdensome tech regulation is encouraging moves beyond the continent. “It’s becoming unattractive to start and maintain a business here,” he told TNW last month. “That’s why I tell startups to leave Europe if they want to succeed.” Van der Voort has followed his own advice. After he and Marcelo Lebre founded Remote in 2019, the partners decided to base the company in San Francisco. “It was simply easier to start it there,” he said. The future of Dutch tech will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam. Tickets for the event are now on sale.
