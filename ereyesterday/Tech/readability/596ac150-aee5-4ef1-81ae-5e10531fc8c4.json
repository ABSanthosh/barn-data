  "text": "If all the high-quality gifs running the mill on social media are any indication, Marvel fans worldwide are getting good use out of the home video release of Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine by reminding people how madcap the blockbuster film was. In case there were still holdouts hesitant in rushing over to their local movie distributor for a physical copy of what the brave folks at Screen Junkies dubbed “Cash in of the Christ” in their latest Honest Trailers (get it?), Marvel has sweetened the deal by giving prospective buyers a sneak peek at one of the many deleted scenes the rated-R MCU film offers. Chief among them is an emotional kiss left on the cutting room floor. Before you get too excited, it would behoove us to mention that, despite how sexually charged Wade Wilson and Logan Howlett’s intimate Honda Odyssey fight scene may have been, the kiss isn’t between the healing factor-riddled heroes. Instead, the kiss is between Wade’s actual best friend, Peter, and Loki‘s own B-15. In the clip titled “Daddy’s in Love” shared by the Hollywood Reporter on X/Twitter, we see B-15 and Peter walk down a hallway before Peter thanks her for her assistance with the “Laura thing.” We guess he’s potentially referencing how the gang managed to save X-23 and bring her into Wade’s reality. What follows is B-15 perishing the thought of Peter’s mild-mannered thanks, giving him come hither eyes not seen since Simba and Nala’s reunion in The Lion King, and planting a big smooch on the guy. The music swells, and B-15 winks and waves goodbye before walking into a portal. Peter then celebrates his accomplishment with Kidpool and Headpool, who had been squatting in his apartment all this time. Apparently the characters’ chemistry had enough going for it from the brief snippet the official film teased to warrant the folks behind the scenes to work on culminating their budding romance with a kiss. \"Daddy's in love\" – B-15 and Peter share a kiss in this exclusive deleted scene from #DeadpoolAndWolverine pic.twitter.com/Zj9bNadf83 — The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) October 10, 2024 If the above clip has piqued folks’ curiosity in forking over their money for a chance to own Marvel’s latest cameo-filled thrill ride, its Blu-ray release is coming October 22.
