  "text": "NordVPN is available at a bargain price, and on top of that, you get a free eSIM for data while traveling abroad. Treating yourself to a latte a few times a month is a simple way to indulge in a bit of hedonism. But you can be as much of a hedonist as you want—until your online privacy has holes. Luckily, NordVPN is here to patch those up for just pocket change each month. This new sale shines brightly, but the glow won’t last forever. You have a limited time to grab NordVPN on sale—and score a great freebie along the way. Speaking of limited time, here’s what the VPN provider offers before this deal runs out. Check Out NordVPN Deals Security Meets Savings: NordVPN Deals Are Live Your digital privacy doesn’t have to be poked by the prying eyes of your ISP, data brokers, and various agencies. NordVPN allows you to stay off the radar with its solid encryption and other features available at as low as $3.39/mo. The Basic plan at this price is almost all you need. However, if you feel like you could do better with more, NordVPN Plus is easily the best-value plan at only $4.39/mo — still cheaper than an overpriced latte! With Threat Protection Pro, this plan keeps ads, malware, and trackers at bay. It also solidifies your online security with NordPass, allowing you to properly manage and create impenetrable passwords on all devices. Complete and Prime plans are slashed by more than 70%, as well. The former comes with NordLocker that offers 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage. The latter is superior to all others with NordProtect for added online privacy. We shouldn’t forget that each plan now comes with a free eSIM offer. Basic offers 1 GB, while Plus comes with 5 GB of data. The latter two have a whopping 10 GB of eSIM data allowance for seamless communication wherever you are. Don’t Like It? Get a Refund! NordVPN makes it easy to recall your decision if you don’t end up satisfied. Thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee, all purchases are fully refundable within the first 30 days. This leaves ample room to test NordVPN, enjoy it for a while, and decide if you want to settle for it. Let’s remind the audience that NordVPN is a world-class VPN with millions of users around the world. It offers 7,600+ servers, unlimited bandwidth, streaming-ready apps, rock-solid privacy, ironclad security, and more. It’s also famous for a Double VPN function that doubles the user’s encryption and prevents tracking. Look at it as an all-in-one security bundle. With some free eSIM data and a spectrum of VPN features, it’s odd that the price is comparable to a latte. The only thing in common is that they don’t last long, so act without hesitation. Try NordVPN Risk-Free",
