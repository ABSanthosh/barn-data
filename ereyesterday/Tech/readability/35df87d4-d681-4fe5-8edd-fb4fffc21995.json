  "text": "Welcome back to This Week in Stratechery! As a reminder, each week, every Friday, we’re sending out this overview of content in the Stratechery bundle; highlighted links are free for everyone. Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings. On that note, here were a few of our favorites this week. Will AI Kill the Web, or Save It? The original web that we know and love was the human web; that’s why advertising was the preferred business model, and Google was the big winner. So what happens when AI Agents are the preferred means to gather information? AI’s don’t care about ads, which means the web needs a new business model; I’ve been a long-time critic of micro-transactions, because they are anti-human, but they might be the solution to an AI-mediated future. Or, to put it another way, AI won’t just save AR and VR, it might save crypto as well. — Ben Thompson Slam Dunks and Moonshots at Google. Google I/O in 2025 was classic Google in two respects. On one hand, it featured a spate of great demos and jaw-dropping displays of new features and capabilities that may or may not ever find a market among mainstream users. That’s become something of a Google I/O tradition. On the other hand, Google also introduced “AI Mode” for search, a collection of AI-powered features that will lean into Google’s advantages in audience and infrastructure and allow the company to gradually integrate more AI features into search. This, too, is classic behavior from a company that for all its excesses and eccentricities still understands its core business and how to move when it’s time to leverage and preserve search dominance. Wednesday’s Daily Update broke it all down, highlighting questions that still linger, as well as AI hardware and software possibilities in Mountain View and beyond. — Andrew Sharp OpenAI Enters the Hardware Business. On Wednesday OpenAI interrupted Google’s big week when it announced plans to acquire Jony Ive’s hardware startup for $6.5 billion worth of stock, telling the world that the company will work with the Apple legend to develop a family of AI-powered devices and design “the coolest piece of technology that the world has ever seen.” If you’re looking to process that news, start with Ben’s analysis on Thursday, which comes with a bonus section on Apple’s dwindling options in AI (and a withering parenthetical on the “Tim Cook Doctrine”). Then head to Sharp Tech, where we had a great time talking through the logic of this move for OpenAI, challenges that lay ahead for Ive’s team, and a few emails from haters who are skeptical of this roadmap and/or despise the aesthetics of the OpenAI PR blitz. All of it was great fun, and whatever happens from here, the next few years just got a lot more interesting. — AS Stratechery Articles and Updates An Interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang About Chip Controls, AI Factories, and Enterprise Pragmatism — An interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about new problems, including chip controls and China, and new opportunities, including AI Factories and enterprise pragmatism. The Agentic Web and Original Sin — Microsoft is putting forth compelling proposals for the Open Agentic Web. However, the proposal needs digital payments, which will be key to creating a new content marketplace for AI. Google I/O, The Search Funnel, Product Possibilities — Google I/O was impressive and overwhelming, but the only product that impressed was Search. OpenAI Acquires io, OpenAI’s Strategic Positioning, Apple’s Worsening AI Problem — OpenAI is acquiring io, Jony Ive’s hardware company. Is the company actually focused on displacing Apple?
