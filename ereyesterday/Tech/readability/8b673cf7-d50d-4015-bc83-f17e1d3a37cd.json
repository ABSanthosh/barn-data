  "text": "Credit: Wongsakorn 2468 / Shutterstock.com The Trump administration's tariffs are having swift and serious consequences on global markets. Companies are pausing sales to the United States, while others are thinking about price increases to compensate for the added tariff fees. Combine that instability with inflation and other financial insecurities, and it's a tough time for economies everywhere.Unfortunately, these increased costs of doing business don't usually end up benefitting the consumer. In fact, quite the opposite: We end up eating the extra cost. Such is the case with the PlayStation 5. Depending on where you live, it's now more expensive than ever—despite being more than four years old. PS5 prices are going upIn a Sunday post on the PlayStation Blog, Sony announced that SIE (Sony Interactive Entertainment) made the decision to bump the MSRP for the PS5 in \"select markets.\" That includes Europe, Middle East and Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. (However, Sony did not specify price increases for its Middle East and Africa markets.) The company did not mention tariffs as part of its reasoning, and, to that point, spared the U.S. from a price increase—as well as the rest of North America. These are not incremental price increases, either. Australia, for example, gets a AUD $100 increase on the Digital Edition PS5, while its standard PS5 is now above AUD $800. I suppose the small silver lining is Sony reduced the price of the Disc Drive accessory in these markets, but I doubt that will come as too much comfort for affected consumers here:Here's what the PS5 now costs in these regions:EuropePS5 Digital Edition: €499.99 (€50 increase)Disc Drive: €79.99 (€40 decrease)UK What do you think so far? PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99 (£40 increase)Disc Drive: £69.99 (£30 decrease)AustraliaPS5 Digital Edition: AUD $749.95 (AUD $100 increase)PS5 with disc drive: AUD $829.95 (AUD $30 increase)Disc Drive: AUD $124.95 (AUD $30 decrease)New ZealandPS5 Digital Edition: NZD $859.95 (NZD $90 increase) PS5 with disc drive: NZD $949.95 (NZD $50 increase)Disc Drive: NZD $135.95 (NZD $30 decrease)Could the U.S. be next?It's definitely possible. The U.S. under the Trump administration is roiling global markets with inconsistent and severe tariffs. If Sony finds they're on the hook for importing PS5 units into the U.S., they very well may pass the increased costs onto American consumers.Experts believe the situation could go either way. Christopher Dring of The Game Business thinks Sony won't increase PS5 prices in the U.S. even if they're affected by tariffs. Dring believes Sony wants to \"protect\" the U.S. market, and, as such, is willing to increase global prices instead. Serkan Toto of Kantan Games thinks the opposite, that Sony will likely raise prices and soon, as the timing is \"right.\" Jake Peterson Senior Technology Editor Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.
