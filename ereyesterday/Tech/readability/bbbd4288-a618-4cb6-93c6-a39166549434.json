  "text": "Perplexity's Comet wants to kill the click. OpenAI is poised to follow. Google Chrome might be next on the chopping block. The internet as we know it runs on clicks. Billions of them. They fuel ad revenue, shape search results, and dictate how knowledge is discovered, monetized, and, at times, manipulated. But a new wave of AI powered browsers is trying to kill the click. They’re coming for Google Chrome. On Wednesday, the AI search startup Perplexity officially launched Comet, a web browser designed to feel more like a conversation than a scroll. Think of it as ChatGPT with a browser tab, but souped up to handle your tasks, answer complex questions, navigate context shifts, and satisfy your curiosity all at once. Perplexity pitches Comet as your “second brain,” capable of actively researching, comparing options, making purchases, briefing you for your day, and analyzing information on your behalf. The promise is that it does all this without ever sending you off on a wild hyperlink chase across 30 tabs, aiming to collapse “complex workflows into fluid conversations.” “Agentic AI” The capabilities of browsers like Comet point to the rapid evolution of agentic AI. This is a cutting-edge field where AI systems are designed not just to answer questions or generate text, but to autonomously perform a series of actions and make decisions to achieve a user’s stated goal. Instead of you telling the browser every single step, an agentic browser aims to understand your intent and execute multi-step tasks, effectively acting as an intelligent assistant within the web environment. “Comet learns how you think, in order to think better with you,” Perplexity says. Comet’s launch throws Perplexity into direct confrontation with the biggest gatekeeper of the internet: Google Chrome. For decades, Chrome has been the dominant gateway, shaping how billions navigate the web. Every query, every click, every ad. It’s all been filtered through a system built to maximize user interaction and, consequently, ad revenue. Comet is trying to blow that model up, fundamentally challenging the advertising-driven internet economy. And it’s not alone in this ambitious assault. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is reportedly preparing to unveil its own AI powered web browser as early as next week, according to Reuters. This tool will likely integrate the power of ChatGPT with Operator, OpenAI’s proprietary web agent. Launched as a research preview in January 2025, OpenAI’s Operator is an AI agent capable of autonomously performing tasks through web browser interactions. It leverages OpenAI’s advanced models to navigate websites, fill out forms, place orders, and manage other repetitive browser-based tasks. Operator is designed to “look” at web pages like a human, clicking, typing, and scrolling, aiming to eventually handle the “long tail” of digital use cases. If integrated fully into an OpenAI browser, it could create a full-stack alternative to Google Chrome and Google Search in one decisive move. In essence, OpenAI is coming for Google from both ends: the browser interface and the search functionality. Goodbye clicks. Hello cognition Perplexity’s pitch is simple and provocative: the web should respond to your thoughts, not interrupt them. “The internet has become humanity’s extended mind, while our tools for using it remain primitive,” the company stated in its announcement, advocating for an interface as fluid as human thought itself. Instead of navigating through endless tabs and chasing hyperlinks, Comet promises to run on context. You can ask it to compare insurance plans. You can ask it to summarize a confusing sentence or instantly find that jacket you forgot to bookmark. Comet promises to “collapse entire workflows” into fluid conversations, turning what used to be a dozen clicks into a single, intuitive prompt. If that sounds like the end of traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and the death of the familiar “blue links” of search results, that’s because it very well could be. AI browsers like Comet don’t just threaten individual publishers and their traffic; they directly threaten the very foundation of Google Chrome’s ecosystem and Google Search’s dominance, which relies heavily on directing users to external websites. Google’s Grip is Slipping Google Search has already been under considerable pressure from AI native upstarts like Perplexity and You.com. Its own attempts at deeper AI integration, such as the Search Generative Experience (SGE), have drawn criticism for sometimes producing “hallucinations” (incorrect information) and awkward summaries. Simultaneously, Chrome, Google’s dominant browser, is facing its own identity crisis. It’s caught between trying to preserve its massive ad revenue pipeline and responding to a wave of AI powered alternatives that don’t rely on traditional links or clicks to deliver useful information. Comet doesn’t just sidestep the old ad driven model, it fundamentally breaks it. There’s no need to sort through 10 blue links. No need to open 12 tabs to compare specifications, prices, or user reviews. With Comet, you just ask, and let the browser do the work. OpenAI’s upcoming browser could deepen that transformative shift even further. If it is indeed designed to keep user interactions largely inside a ChatGPT-like interface instead of linking out, it could effectively create an entirely new, self-contained information ecosystem. In such a future, Google Chrome would no longer be the indispensable gateway for knowledge or commerce. What’s at Stake: Redefining the Internet If Comet or OpenAI’s browser succeed, the impact won’t be limited to just disrupting search. They will fundamentally redefine how the entire internet works. Publishers, advertisers, online retailers, and even traditional software companies may find themselves disintermediated—meaning their direct connection to users is bypassed—by AI agents. These intelligent agents could summarize their content, compare their prices, execute their tasks, and entirely bypass their existing websites and interfaces. It’s a new, high-stakes front in the war for how humans interact with information and conduct their digital lives. The AI browser is no longer a hypothetical concept. It’s here.",
