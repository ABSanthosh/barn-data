Written by  Giselle Castro-Sloboda Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Giselle Castro-Sloboda Fitness and Nutrition Writer I'm a Fitness \u0026 Nutrition writer for CNET who enjoys reviewing the latest fitness gadgets, testing out activewear and sneakers, as well as debunking wellness myths. On my spare time I enjoy cooking new recipes, going for a scenic run, hitting the weight room, or binge-watching many TV shows at once. I am a former personal trainer and still enjoy learning and brushing up on my training knowledge from time to time. I've had my wellness and lifestyle content published in various online publications such as: Women's Health, Shape, Healthline, Popsugar and more. Expertise Fitness and Wellness Think about where you'll mainly be using the app. Do you work out at home, at the gym, outside or a mix of all three? If you like to run outdoors, for example, you'll likely want an app that offers location tracking. You'll also want to figure out whether the app's classes require you to have certain pieces of equipment on hand, like dumbbells or a yoga mat. Make sure you either have these items, or you have the budget to purchase them. Think about what goals you're trying to achieve when using the app. Do you just want to get moving more often, or are there specific fitness milestones you want to hit (like running a certain speed or lifting a certain amount of weight)? Some apps let you personalize your goals or even connect with a personal trainer to help you meet them. There are fitness apps for every budget. Some are completely free or offer a free trial, and some require a monthly subscription. Your choice will ultimately depend on whether you think investing in a paid app will actually help you get closer to your goals and what you're comfortable spending. Other things to consider are if you prefer live streaming or On Demand workouts. Do you have a home gym but need more workout ideas? A fitness app can be really helpful, and there's one for every kind of workout type. These workout apps focus on yoga, cardio, strength training and more. After the COVID-19 pandemic, I learned to adapt to at-home workouts and found I was most consistent when I downloaded the Future app, which paired me up with a coach who programmed my workouts around my goals. We tested various workout apps to provide you with some of the best options. Many of these apps also offer free trials. That way you can give them a try before fully committing to them. Below are our picks for best workout apps as a guide at home or in the gym. What is the best workout app overall?The Nike Training Club is our pick for the best overall workout app because it's free and offers a variety of classes, like HIIT, strength training, mobility and yoga, and you can even follow a program over the course of a month and decide how often you're looking to work out. Because Nike is such a big name in fitness, a lot of its workouts draw inspiration from famous athletes, like Simone Biles or Serena Williams. If you prefer a workout app that's more specific to your interests, such as yoga, there are others we recommend in the list below. Best workout apps of 2025When I first started working out regularly, Nike Training Club was my go-to app. It provides various workout programs such as bodyweight exercises, high-intensity interval training, cross-training, yoga, core exercises and expert health tips by Nike trainers to keep you on track. The workouts are easy to follow because there are video demonstrations of each exercise with the allotted time you should be doing them. This prevents you from losing track during your workout and mentally prepares you for the next exercise. The app also connects to your Apple Watch to provide health metrics such as your heart rate and logs your activities. The best part of this app is that it's free and gives you access to many resources no matter if you're a beginner or more advanced. The Future app is unique because it connects you to an elite personal fitness coach who checks in regularly, gives you feedback and customizes the workout for you. They take into account your fitness level, goals and even what equipment is available to you. Having used this app for over a year now, I can vouch that it's a great option if you want the feel of a personal trainer in your home. The creators of the app believe that connection is the best way to stick to your goals. That's why they set you up with a partner who can hold you accountable.To get started on this app, you have to take a short quiz about the type of workouts you like or dislike, what type of coach you work best with and your goals. There are plenty of coaches on this app with numerous years of experience in their respective fields. To get the most out of the experience, users are recommended to wear an Apple Watch or a compatible Android wearable, which provides detailed information to your coach so they can see your progress and edit your plan as you go. At $199 a month, Future isn't the most affordable app on the market, but compared with a standard personal training session, which can cost more than that, it's worth the price. Future often offers promotional discounts on your first month and offers a $50 credit for every friend who signs up using your guest pass for the app. There's no doubt that the popularity of the Peloton indoor cycling bike exploded in popularity during the pandemic. The company's app, which is available to non-Peloton owners, gives you access to Peloton's library of on-demand workouts, from cycling, running and strength training to yoga, pilates and stretching. My husband and I use this app regularly and love that it has options to do shorter or longer workouts, as well as beginner and advanced classes. The difference between the all-access membership available to Peloton owners and the app is that the former allows multiple member profiles, access to exclusive classes and better access to the Leadership board (where you can compete against other users). If you opt for the all-access membership, it costs $24 a month and can be used whether you own the bike, treadmill or rower. Peloton also recently updated its search function so it's easier than ever to find your favorite artist, class title and genre. If you're not a fully converted Peloton junkie, the Peloton app One is a good stepping stone to see what the hype is about and whether you enjoy the classes.The price doesn't hurt either. The first two months are $2.49 and then it's $13 a month with access to thousands of on-demand and live classes via your smartphone, tablet, TV or web browser. If you're looking for an app that tracks your running mileage, Strava is your best bet. As an avid runner who's tried various running apps throughout the years, the Strava app remains my favorite. Although I mainly use it for running, it can interchangeably be used for cycling and other workouts as well. The app is GPS powered and turns any Apple or Android phone into a detailed performance monitor. It connects to heart rate monitors and various popular GPS devices, such as an Apple Watch, Garmin, Fitbit or a Suunto watch.It also connects you to friends on the app who can cheer you on or comment on your posts that get uploaded to your Strava feed after your workout. If you prefer to keep your data and running routes private, you can also make those changes through your settings via the app. One of the newer safety features on the Strava app is called the Beacon, which lets you share your location in real time with an emergency contact. I've found the free version of the app to be sufficient for my purposes, but you can upgrade it to receive more detailed data and other perks, such as building your own routes, accessing new routes in your area and more. The paid version of the app will run you $12 a month (or $80 a year). There is a student discounts for $40 a year and a family plan for up to 4 accounts at $140 a year. The good news is Strava offers a free 30-day trial to users who want to try out its upgraded features before committing. This app was co-founded by popular Australian personal trainer Kayla Itsines. It was created with women in mind, and at the time it served as a platform to access Itsines' HIIT workout plans, but it has since evolved. In 2021, Sweat was acquired by iFit (an interactive global health and fitness technology company), giving the app more exposure via its existing members and internationally. Now you have access to various workout programs that can be done at home or in the gym, such as yoga, strength and pilates, all taught by different female personal trainers. The app also offers meal plan options if you're looking for healthy recipe ideas. This app costs $25 a month but often offers introductory deals. This is a good way to determine if the workouts on the app are the right fit for you and your goals.If you're worried about how to maintain your gains outside of the gym, then you'll love the Ladder app. Ladder is specifically designed for strength training and connects you to many strength coaches who specialize in various fields. To find the coach that's the best fit for you, you'll have to answer questions such as your preferred training style, what your goals are, how often you'd want to workout and the type of equipment available to you. Ladder takes the guesswork out of planning your workout because the coach for your designated program will provide a weekly workout plan that you receive Sunday nights to prepare you for the week ahead.Currently, the app works only with Apple iPhone or iPad devices and can be used with an Apple Watch or cast to a TV screen using Apple AirPlay or Screen Mirroring. However, the developers are working on creating an Android app. When I tried out this app, I signed up for a kettlebell class called Body \u0026 Bell, and what's great is you get video demonstrations for the different exercises you'll be doing. The videos also tell you the type of weight you should be using (light, medium, heavy) and the length of time of the exercise.You can also connect with your coach via the chat in the app if you ever have questions on your training or want to chat with other members on your team. Ladder offers a free seven-day trial, and afterward you can pick from a Pro plan for $30 a month or the Pro Plan-Annual which is an upfront fee of $180 for the year and offers unlimited access to the app. If yoga is more your speed, the Alo Moves app is a favorite among yogis. The Alo Moves app was created by the athleisure line Alo, and it connects you to various types of workouts beyond yoga, such as pilates, barre, meditation and more. The yoga option on the app lets you pick from various practices, including hatha, ashtanga, vinyasa, restorative and even prenatal yoga. You can customize your yoga practice also based on your experience level, your goals and how long you'd like your sessions to be. This app is accessible only to Apple users and connects you to world-class instructors and new classes every week. If you're trying to achieve a specific skill, such as a handstand or other yoga poses, the app also has a series to help you improve those positions. If you're ready to dive into improving your flexibility or mastering crow's pose, the Alo Moves app is currently offering a free trial for 14 days. If you choose to commit, it's $13 a month or $129 for the year.Working out requires being consistent and motivated and sometimes that's hard to come by. The FitOn app takes away the pressure of having to commit to any type of exercise program by offering a variety of live and on demand classes. This is the ideal workout app if you don't like working out. It's free for the basic membership but will cost you around $25 a month for six-months or $30 for a year long FitOn Pro subscription. You can take anything ranging from everything from yoga, dance, Pilates, HIIT, Barre and more. Additionally, you can receive nutrition guidance and expert tips and access to your music through Spotify or Apple music with the Pro subscription. This app is available for iOS and Android. Some positive reviews users have shared are that the app finally got them to be more active, while another says it gave them the freedom to get in shape on their own time frame. Overall most users seem to enjoy the variety and length of the workouts. Some complaints users had were with the app interface itself sometimes being glitchy, issues connecting some smart watches and it's inaccurate step counting. Apple Fitness Plus is a workout app that is convenient for iPhone users. It gives you access to over 5,000 live and On Demand workouts ranging from yoga, HIIT, Time to Walk, core, strength training to meditation classes. There are plenty of beginner and advanced classes ranging from five to 45 minutes, so you're sure to find something that is right for your fitness level. To join Apple Fitness Plus, you can try it out for free for up to three months and then have the option to pay month-to-month, $9.99 or $79.99 for the year. If you're on a family plan, you can share access to Apple Fitness Plus with up to five family members.Apple Fitness Plus lets you schedule your workouts ahead of time so you can prioritize them no matter how busy you get. If you have an Apple Watch, the app makes it convenient to access it and view your metrics on the smartwatch during your workouts as well. If you own an iPhone, it's a no-brainer to sign up for a workout app that is already built into your smartphone and allows you to workout anywhere.
