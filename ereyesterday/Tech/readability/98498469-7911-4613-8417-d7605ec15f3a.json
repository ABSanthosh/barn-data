  "description": "According to Bloomberg, the U.S. Justice Department wants Google to sell off its Chrome browser as part of its ongoing search monopoly case. The recommendations will be made official on Wednesday. 9to5Google reports: At the top of the list is having Google sell Chrome \"because it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine.\" There are many questions about how that works, including what the impact on the underlying Chromium codebase would be. Would Google still be allowed to develop the open-source project by which many other browsers, like Microsoft Edge use? \"The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy create a more competitive market,\" reports Bloomberg. Google, which plans to appeal, previously said that \"splitting off Chrome or Android would break them.\" Bloomberg reports that \"antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android.\" However, the government wants Google to \"uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle.\" Meanwhile, other recommendations include licensing Google Search data and results, as well as allowing websites that are indexed for Search to opt out of AI training.
