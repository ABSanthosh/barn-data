Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! As consumers seamlessly search, scroll, shop and stream across their devices, their behavior on Connected TV (CTV) is evolving. That big screen now hosts live events they don't want to miss, video podcasts they listen to while multitasking, and engaging short-form videos they scroll through for quick entertainment. It’s time to rethink CTV beyond streaming. At Google NewFront, we unveiled new Display \u0026 Video 360 capabilities to empower you to meet your audience in all those moments. Continuing to create a one-stop shop for content, we announced access to live inventory alongside enhanced integrations with top inventory partners like Netflix. We unveiled Display \u0026 Video 360’s commerce and retail media solution to help you turn viewers into buyers wherever they shop. Finally, we showcased our new Google AI-powered buying experience, integrating generative and predictive AI throughout campaigns. Be where people are watching now with Display \u0026 Video 360's enhanced and new partnershipsDisplay \u0026 Video 360 now reaches 98% of CTV households and can help you connect with audiences where they watch most — across blockbusters, live sports, short-form video, podcasts and more — totaling more than 5 billion hours of US ad-supported viewing monthly, the most watch time inventory of any demand side platform (DSP).We keep expanding inventory partnerships so it's easier and more efficient for you to reach the people watching high-quality content, all in one place. For example, over the last few months, our partnership with Netflix has expanded into EMEA and Google affinity Audiences are now available for Netflix campaigns.Display \u0026 Video 360 now also offers live inventory so you can buy across more tentpole moments like live shows and sports events — including NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube — with our CTV live inventory. Thanks to key partnerships with providers like NBCUniversal and Disney, who awarded us their Live Certification badge, our live inventory grew 50% year-over-year in Q1 2025.To give you even more ways to connect with your viewers, Display \u0026 Video 360 also now directly integrates with Tubi and Spotify for video and audio ads, and provides access to Roblox to reach their highly engaged gaming community with video ads.In the past, top content was primarily bought through guaranteed deals, but today, more is available via auction, with biddable CTV campaigns in Display \u0026 Video 360 growing over twice as fast. That’s because programmatic bidding offers scalability, flexibility and dynamic real-time optimization. And now, we’re taking this a step further with curated CTV auction inventory in Display \u0026 Video 360 — a new, one-click feature that effortlessly connects you with a broad set of biddable inventory from the most highly-demanded publishers in your region. Turn viewers into buyers, wherever they shopTo help advertisers connect commercial intent to purchase, we’re launching a comprehensive commerce and retail media solution in Display \u0026 Video 360. This diverse ecosystem — including Costco, Intuit, Regal Cinemas, Kinective Media by United Airlines and more — accurately reflects the varied places consumers actually shop. Our offering gives brands powerful audience segments to boost ROI and end-to-end sales insights, combining brand and shopper marketing in one campaign to reach customers at any point.We’re also bringing commerce and retail media to YouTube via Display \u0026 Video 360, empowering advertisers to use commerce audience insights for YouTube ad buys and measure the sales impact within the online stores or physical locations of our commerce partners. Later in the summer, this solution will be available via retailers and directly in Display \u0026 Video 360 for brands. Generate tailored business results with Google AI-powered campaignThe real game-changer for advertisers is when you combine programmatic ad buying with the power of AI — both to predict what will work best and to create new possibilities. Building on our existing AI tools like Commitment Optimizer and Audience Persona, we’re weaving Google AI into the core of buying ads in Display \u0026 Video 360. This will help you with everything from finding the right ad deals to getting smarter insights, going far beyond just making things automatic to deliver results that are specifically tailored to your business goals. Here’s what is coming up:Smarter inventory selection: Just tell Display \u0026 Video 360 what kind of inventory you need — like \"premium CTV deals for live sports fans\" — and AI will find personalized suggestions for you, including custom agency pre-negotiated deals. We focus on what's relevant for your business, not just general lists.Easy campaign setup: Give Display \u0026 Video 360 a quick overview of your goals, and Google AI will automatically fill in the best settings for things like audiences, categories, brand safety, genres and more. You can edit that recommendation using your expertise.Quick help \u0026 improvements: No matter where you are in the Display \u0026 Video 360 interface, you can now ask questions like \"Show me under-pacing line items\". It will give you immediate answers to help you improve your campaigns faster.Instant reports: Just ask for the specific data you need, like \"How many sales did my sports ads bring?\", and Google AI will quickly create a ready-to-use report for you. Display \u0026 Video 360’s new Marketplace uses Google AI to generate personalized inventory recommendations This new Google AI powered buying experience isn't a bolt-on; it's the Display \u0026 Video 360 you know, supercharged for unparalleled simplicity and efficiency — no complex transitions needed. It will be rolling out in phases in the coming months.CTV has evolved. Has your DSP?",
