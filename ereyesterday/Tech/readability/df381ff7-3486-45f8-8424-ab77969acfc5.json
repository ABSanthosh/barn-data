  "description": "Netflix calls it \"a live-action reimagining of the acclaimed Nickelodeon animated series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. And this weekend Netflix shared a blooper reel from their live-action show's first season, reports Engadget, \"giving fans a look at some cute behind the scenes antics while they wait for the next season.\" The first season was released a year ago, and Netflix announced shortly after that the show had been renewed for two more [with the third season being its last]. There's no release date yet for the new episodes, but the streaming service said on Saturday that production for the second season is underway. \"Just as the animated series matured and progressed, the live-action will also take these characters and worlds and grow them,\" executive producers Christine Boylan and Jabbar Raisani said in Netflix's announcement. And speaking of Nickeloden's 2005 animated series, \"The mythology and adventure of Avatar: The Last Airbender will continue,\" writes Deadline, \"with Avatar: Seven Havens, a new 26-episode, 2D-animated series ordered by Nickelodeon, from original series creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and Avatar Studios.... \"The duo also was originally involved in Netflix's live-action series adaptation but left in 2020 due to creative differences.\" Avatar: Seven Havens is set in a world shattered by a devastating cataclysm. A young Earthbender discovers she's the new Avatar after Korra — but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity's destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization's last strongholds collapse... \"When we created the original series, we never imagined we'd still be expanding the world decades later,\" said DiMartino and Konietzko.... Previously announced, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies' Untitled Animated Aang Avatar film debuts only in theaters on January 30, 2026, featuring a voice cast that includes Dave Bautista, Dionne Quan, Jessica Matten, Román Zaragoza and introducing Eric Nam.
