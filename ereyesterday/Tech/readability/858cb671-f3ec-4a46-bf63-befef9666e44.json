  "text": "It isn't ideal for most games. Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt/Lifehacker If you're a gamer born in the '80s or '90s, you might have some strong nostalgia for the Nintendo GameCube. It's not just your childhood memories fueling those opinions: It's a great console, with classic library to boot: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker; Mario Kart: Double Dash; and Super Smash Bros. Melee, just to name a few.It might be tempting, then, to pick up a new GameCube controller, specifically designed for Nintendo Switch 2, and all the GameCube games Nintendo plans to make available through a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. If you're lucky enough to snag the new console at launch, you'll be able to play Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX, with more titles on the way. Sure, you could use the Joy-Cons or Switch Pro controller to play these games, but why not fully commit to the bit, and play these GameCube titles with the controller they were designed for? The GameCube controller is not ideal for modern Switch 2 games I have no doubt the GameCube controller for Switch 2 is going to be massively fun for these GameCube titles. But when it comes to using the controller beyond these Nintendo Switch Online games, things aren't so rosy. In fact, for a time, it seemed like these GameCube games were the only ones you could use the controller for. IGN found some small print on the UK version of the Switch 2 GameCube controller trailer that said, \"The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics.\" That seems pretty unambiguous. Luckily, the limitations don't appear to be so severe. Nintendo recently clarified this compatibility question, confirming that while the controller is designed for these GameCube titles, it isn't incompatible with other Switch 2 games. But that doesn't mean it's meant for these games. Nintendo has gone so far as to say there \"may be some issues\" if you use the GameCube controller for standard Switch 2 titles. Part of the problem is the GameCube controller is missing certain buttons and features that modern controller designs have—buttons that developers expect players to have when designing their games. There are more buttons on this unit than the original GameCube controller, as you now have a tiny ZL button on the left side, accompanying the original Z button on the right. But most buttons are not for game play: The C-Button is meant to launch GameChat on the Switch 2; the Capture button takes screenshots; the Home button takes you to the home screen; and the pairing button pairs the controller to your Switch 2. To that point, it seems the joysticks don't push in for L3 and R3 button responses, which takes away another two button options. Of course, there's also the fact the GameCube controller doesn't offer your average button layout in the first place. The left joystick is relatively large, while the right stick (the C-stick) is tiny. The d-pad and ZL buttons are also tiny, and the A, B, X, and Y buttons are as non-traditional as you can get. I love the controller, but I can imagine even with all buttons accounted for, it might not be ideal for someone used to playing modern games on modern controllers. What do you think so far? Cost and exclusivity Then, there's the price tag: You'll need to spend $64.99 if you want a GameCube controller for your Switch 2. That's not a terrible price as far as console controllers go, but it is pretty steep when you factor in the limitations. You could, instead, put that money towards another set of Switch 2 Joy-Cons for $89.99, or a Switch 2 Pro Controller for $79.99—both of which will work with every game you buy for your new console. Speaking of the new console, this GameCube controller is exclusive to the Switch 2. If you're looking for something you can use with your original Switch, this controller ain't it. Nintendo is making the entire GameCube feature a Switch 2-only affair, which is frustrating. Why can't my console from 2017 play games from 2001? If you're already buying a Switch 2 and you know you want to fully emulate the GameCube experience on your new console, you shouldn't have reservations in picking up the controller. But it's important to know these caveats before you do: You wouldn't want to drop $65 only to find Mario Kart World or Donkey Kong Bananza don't play as well as you expected.
