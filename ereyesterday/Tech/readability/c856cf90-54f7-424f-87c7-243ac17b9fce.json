  "description": "Francois Chollet, an AI pioneer and creator of the Keras framework, announced that he's leaving Google to co-found a new company. Neowin reports: In his parting message, Chollet assured that he would still be active with Keras and participate in its development on GitHub. His successor, Jeff Carpenter, will now lead Keras at Google, and Chollet expressed his full confidence in the team's future direction. Keras has come a long way since Chollet released it in 2015, initially as a high-level neural network API meant for simplicity and accessibility. Keras quickly gained traction in the AI community for its user-friendly Python interface and compatibility with frameworks like TensorFlow, simplifying machine learning model building for developers across various levels. Google published a blog post praising Chollet and reaffirming their commitment to Keras. Last year, Google lost the \"Godfather of AI,\" Geoffrey Hinton, who left the company after nearly a decade. He said he quit his job at Google so he can freely speak out about the risks of AI. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
