  "description": "Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to \"Gulf of America\" for U.S. users on Google Maps, following a Republican-led House vote on Thursday to codify the name change. President Claudia Sheinbaum argues the U.S. only has authority to rename its portion of the continental shelf and warned of legal action unless Google reversed the change. The Guardian reports: \"All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,\" Sheinbaum said. \"The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn't have the authority to name the entire gulf,\" she added. In response to Trump, Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States \"America Mexicana\" -- Mexican America, pointing to a map dating back to before 1848, when one-third of her country was seized by the United States.
