Hailing from Texas, Imad started his journalism career in 2013 and has amassed bylines with The New York Times, The Washington Post, ESPN, Tom's Guide and Wired, among others. Expertise Google | AI | Internet Culture OpenAI is preparing to launch GPT-4.1 along with a full version of its o3 reasoning model soon, according to a report from The Verge on Friday. GPT-4.1 will launch along with smaller GPT-4.1 mini and nano versions. This updated model is supposed to be a revamped version of GPT-4o, a multimodal model released last year. The Verge also points to a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, by Tibor Blaho, an AI engineer at AIPRM. Blago found mentions GPT-4.1 on the OpenAI API Platform. After The Verge posted its article, Blaho also found references to GPT-4.1 on the OpenAI API Platform.I am still thinking about the article from The Verge yesterday mentioning \"GPT-4.1\" because I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else yetBut here is undeniable confirmation - model art for model pages on the OpenAI API Platform is already being prepared for o3, o4-mini, and… https://t.co/hn7vIx0T4u pic.twitter.com/Jz95qSMNtP— Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) April 11, 2025 Blaho earlier found referrals to \"o4-mini\" in ChatGPT's web code, indicating that more AI models are coming.New ChatGPT web app version deployed just now (after midnight San Francisco time) adds mentions of \"o4-mini\", \"o4-mini-high\" and \"o3\" pic.twitter.com/huz9XWQWGP— Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) April 10, 2025 OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.As the AI race continues, OpenAI has repeatedly made headlines for its ability to introduce more powerful models to an increasing number of users. Last month, OpenAI introduced image generation in ChatGPT-4o, which impressed with its accuracy and realism. The feature became so popular that OpenAI had to set rate limits after CEO Sam Altman posted, \"Our GPUs are melting.\" Earlier this week, OpenAI increased the memory capabilities of ChatGPT so that it could do a better job of recalling information from past conversations. This comes as Google, too, is pushing to lead the AI space with more offerings, including a powerful and efficient new AI chip called Ironwood. The company launched a \"practically unlimited\" coding assistant for free earlier this year and is currently rolling out Veo 2, a new generator tool to compete with OpenAI's Sora.While OpenAI isn't profitable and is actually trying to restructure itself from a non-profit to a for-profit organization, it's currently valued at $300 billion. Even though ChatGPT is still far from overtaking Google, it was the most downloaded app on app stores last month.",
