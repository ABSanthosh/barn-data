  "text": "Throughout the year, Paramount’s upcoming Running Man reboot from Edgar Wright has been picking up stars. First it was Glen Powell and Katy O’Brian as the leads, then it expanded to include Josh Brolin and Lee Pace as the main villains. Now you can add another pair of actors to its supporting cast, including an old slacker friend of Wright’s. Per the Hollywood Reporter, Michael Cera (Scott Pilgrim) and Emilia Jones (Locke \u0026 Key) are joining the cast of the upcoming film. Cera’s said to be playing an unnamed “naïve rebel” trying his best to help Powell’s Ben Richards, while Jones will portray a privileged woman said to be “blind to the oppression of the government” Richards is fighting against. Filming will take place in London at the start of 2025 before its release later in the year. Based on Stephen King’s 1982 sci-fi novel, The Running Man is set in a dystopian 2025 where a totalitarian regime has ruled over America and uses a violent game show to keep citizens happy. The titular show sees ruthless killers hunt down contestants, and Richards signs up to get money for his sick daughter. Contestants get more money the longer they survive, and as he stays alive, he also draws more attention to himself from the show’s producers and the killers, who would rather he lose. Running Man was previously adapted into a 1987 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger by Paul Michael Glaser, and back in June, Powell teased what would make this new version different from its predecessor. Wright’s film, he said, is “more grounded” in King’s book, which made the hunt for Richards into a global one rather than just the US. We’ll find out how the two films differ when Wright’s The Running Man hits theaters on November 21, 2025. Want more io9 news?
