That infrastructure is being built with unprecedented investment. In 2025 alone, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft plan to spend over $300bn (‚Ç¨261bn) combined on data centres, networking, and cloud services for AI, according to CNBC. Van Glabbeek called it ‚Äúthe biggest investment in technology in the history of mankind.‚Äù European tech firms can‚Äôt match this scale of spending on hardware. But they can capitalise by building AI apps on the foundations laid in the US. Europe already has a strong record of building top-tier apps, from Spotify and Grammarly to Revolut and Klarna. In the AI era, Van Glabbeek envisions a new wave of them emerging from the region. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt win the hyperscaler AI platform play, but there‚Äôs still something positive to compete for ‚Äî and it‚Äôs on the application side,‚Äù he said. The sentiment was echoed by other tech leaders on stage. Sohrab Hosseini, co-founder of Amsterdam-based generative AI startup Orq.ai, highlighted the opportunities at the ‚Äúorchestration and application levels,‚Äù while Lucien Burm, President of the Dutch Startup Association, pointed to where the profit lies. ‚ÄúThe money is probably to be made in the application layer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to win that much in very deep AI hardware tech.‚Äù To fulfil Europe‚Äôs AI potential, the speakers called for a trio of financial changes: greater risk appetite from investors, less red tape around public funding, and more local procurement. But their most pressing demand is one that reverberates across the continent‚Äôs tech sector: innovation-friendly regulation.",
