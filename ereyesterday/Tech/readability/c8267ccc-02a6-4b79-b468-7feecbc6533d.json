  "text": "It almost feels like a pricing error given how unusual this is for Apple. Apple is well-known for keeping its prices tightly fixed – especially for newly released items. Sales of recently released models are virtually non-existent on Apple’s own web site, and when they do happen, it’s typically months or years later (and often only very small ones). So, to discover Amazon offering a brand-new MacBook Air M4 (2025) at a major discount just a few weeks after its launch is a surprise-and it’s safe to say Apple isn’t pleased about it. Amazon is currently offering the 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with the brand-new M4 chip and 256GB storage for $899 which is a full $100 less than its standard $999 price. This is the cheapest price ever for this model (released six weeks ago) and it’s driving consumers crazy: The MacBook Air M4 is the current best-selling laptop on Amazon, with units selling off virtual shelves in what can only be described as a bloodbath for the competition. See 256GB at Amazon The 15-inch 2025 model is also discounted to $1,499 from $1,599, featuring 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. See 512GB at Amazon Best Ultra Laptop in 2025 In the past, Apple’s new laptops remain at full price for at least a year. Only when the initial mania has passed and a new generation looms do we see timid discounts—and even then, they’re typically limited to a handful of resellers and taken in a heartbeat. This time, the MacBook Air M4 is being discounted by a huge amount just weeks into its availability, and it’s no small cut. Amazon is pushing the price to levels unimaginable for any new MacBook Air, much less one powered by Apple’s latest silicon chip. The new M4 chip boasts a 10-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which provides an enormous performance and efficiency boost. Apple claims up to 1.6 times faster performance in productivity apps and up to twice the speed in creative workflows compared to the M1 chip. Whether you’re editing 4K video or crunching numbers, this processor handles it all with ease. And with 16GB of common memory and a 256GB SSD on sale in this Amazon offering (there is a 512GB version too that is discounted $100…), you’ve got plenty of multitasking heft. The MacBook Air M4 holds on to its mythical thin-and-light status and tips the scales at a mere three pounds and a scant half-inch thickness. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display remains as beautiful as ever. The Midnight finish (only available on this deeply discounted model) adds a dash of premium flair. There’s also a 12MP Center Stage camera for sharp video calls, a four-speaker sound system, and Touch ID for secure logins. What you will also love about the 2025 MacBook Air is the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, Apple’s new suite of AI-powered tools built into macOS Sequoia. With the M4’s advanced Neural Engine, you can expect smarter writing capabilities, better organization and more automation. By the way, you can check our review on the 2025 MacBook Air here. To see a 10% discount on such a new and great MacBook Air is unheard of, and it’s no surprise that Amazon is selling them by the pallet. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to upgrade, this is your chance to grab the latest 13-inch MacBook Air M4 at a record low price. Make sure you grab yours, Amazon a already sold over 4,000 units of the latest MBA. See at Amazon",
