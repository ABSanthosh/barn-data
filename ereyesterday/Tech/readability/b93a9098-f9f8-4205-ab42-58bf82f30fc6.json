  "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from PCWorld: Smart home devices compatible with the Matter standard have garnered most of our attention lately, but the compelling features in the latest generation of Z-Wave chips convinced the IoT developer Shelly Group to build no fewer than 11 new products powered by Z-Wave technology. The new collection includes a smart plug, in-wall dimmers, relays, and various sensors aimed at DIYers, installers, and commercial builders. Citing the ability of Z-Wave 800 (aka Z-Wave Long Range or LR) chips to operate IoT devices over extremely long range -- up to 1 mile, line of sight -- while running on battery power for up to 10 years, Shelly Group CTO Leon Kralj said \"Shelly is helping break down smart home connectivity barriers, empowering homeowners, security installers, and commercial property owners and managers with unmatched range, scalability, and energy efficiency to redefine their automation experience.\" [...] While most homeowners won't need to worry about the number of IoT devices their networks can support, commercial builders will appreciate the scalability of Z-Wave 800-powered devices -- namely, you can deploy as many as 4,000 nodes on a single mesh network. That's a 20x increase over what was possible with previous generations of the chip. And since Z-Wave LR is backward compatible with those previous generations, there should be no worries about integrating the new devices into existing networks. Shelly says all 11 of its new Z-Wave 800-powered IoT devices will be available in the first half of 2025. The new Shelly devices will be available in the U.S. in the first half of 2025. Here's a list of the devices enhanced with the new long-range capabilities: - Shelly Wave Plug US - Shelly Wave Door/Window - Shelly Wave H\u0026T - Shelly Wave Motion - Shelly Wave Dimmer - Shelly Wave Pro Dimmer 1 PM - Shelly Wave Pro Dimmer 2 PM - Shelly Wave 1 - Shelly Wave 1 PM - Shelly Wave 2 PM - Shelly Wave Shutter Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
