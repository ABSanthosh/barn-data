He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.International shipping company DHL is temporarily suspending packages bound for consumers in the US that are valued at over $800 “until further notice.” The BBC reports that DHL was hit with a surge in formal customs clearances due to the Trump Administration’s new tariff changes, which added the need for additional paperwork for more packages.This isn’t just a problem for ecommerce giants like Shein and Temu, as it introduces a new hurdle for many companies that ship goods directly from China to customers in the United States. It’s also kicking in with only days left before the de minimis exception is set to expire on May 2nd, ending the rule that allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the US duty free, and for recipients in the US to receive up to $800 worth of stuff per day without paying import taxes.DHL explains the change in a statement posted to its site: Effective April 5, 2025, all shipments to the U.S. with a declared customs value over USD 800 require formal entry processing - down from the previous USD 2,500 threshold due to new U.S. Customs regulations.This change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock.While we are working diligently to scale up and manage this increase, shipments over USD 800—regardless of origin—may experience multi-day delays.To manage this, starting Monday, April 21, 2025, and until further notice, we will temporarily suspend B2C shipments to private individuals in the U.S. where the declared value exceeds USD 800.",
