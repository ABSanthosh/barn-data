  "description": "\"Security researchers say the Chinese government-linked hacking group, Salt Typhoon, is continuing to compromise telecommunications providers,\" reports TechCrunch, \"despite the recent sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on the group.\" TechRadar reports that the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor is \"hitting not just American organizations, but also those from the UK, South Africa, and elsewhere around the world.\" The latest intrusions were spotted by cybersecurity researchers from Recorded Future, which said the group is targeting internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco's IOS software that powers different routers and switches. These devices have known vulnerabilities that the threat actors are actively exploiting to gain initial access, root privileges, and more. More than 12,000 Cisco devices were found connected to the wider internet, and exposed to risk, Recorded Future further explained. However, Salt Typhoon is focusing on a \"smaller subset\" of telecoms and university networks. \"The hackers attempted to exploit vulnerabilities in at least 1,000 Cisco devices,\" reports NextGov, \"allowing them to access higher-level privileges of the hardware and change their configuration settings to allow for persistent access to the networks they're connected on... Over half of the Cisco appliances targeted by Salt Typhoon were located in the U.S., South America and India, with the rest spread across more than 100 countries.\" Between December and January, the unit, widely known as Salt Typhoon, \"possibly targeted\" — based on devices that were accessed — offices in the University of California, Los Angeles, California State University, Loyola Marymount University and Utah Tech University, according to a report from cyber threat intelligence firm Recorded Future... The Cisco devices were mainly associated with telecommunications firms, but 13 of them were linked to the universities in the U.S. and some in other nations... \"Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property,\" said the report, led by the company's Insikt Group, which oversees its threat research. The cyberspies also compromised Cisco platforms at a U.S.-based affiliate of a prominent United Kingdom telecom operator and a South African provider, both unnamed, the findings added. The hackers also \"carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses\" owned by Mytel, a telecom operator based in Myanmar... \"In 2023, Cisco published a security advisory disclosing multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE software,\" a Cisco spokesperson said in a statement. \"We continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
