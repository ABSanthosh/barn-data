  "text": "With Valentine’s Day almost upon us, we’re looking at good parenting moments from our favorite TV mom and dad, Chilli and Bandit Heeler from Ludo Studios’ Bluey. The duo are goals in how they have raised Bluey and Bingo with lots of play while also retaining their healthy partner dynamic. And notably, they’re not perfect—as seen in Bluey‘s many episodes in which the parents do a lot of unlearning and must figure out how to best show up for not just their kids, but also for each other. In “Pool,” Bandit’s the fun dad who may have forgotten swimming essentials because that’s the “boring” parent’s job. The Heeler family quickly learns how things that seem boring are essential to having fun. And there’s adorable romantic shorts where mom and dad can just enjoy one another in play with their kids, as seen in “Daddy Robot” and “The Bus.” Some of the most heartfelt moments between the two occur while the kids are performing for them, in particular in “The Show.” Bingo’s pretending to be a pregnant Chilli when a balloon pops in her fake belly, and we see Bandit immediately take Chilli’s hand, a gesture that ties into the show’s implication that Bingo is a rainbow baby. Here are the Bluey episodes that most remind us that Bandit and Chilli are relationship goals. “Fairytale” –  Bluey season 3, episode 26 Bandit imagines or remembers meeting Chilli as a kid at a vacation spot their families frequented. This is reminiscent to Bluey and Jean-Luc having their childhood introduction in the “Camping” episode before reuniting in the future—he’s our pick as the father of Bluey’s kid. “The Show” – Bluey season 2, episode 19 Bandit and Chilli watch Bluey and Bingo recreate how their parents met in London. They adorably confirm their relationship evolution and give the kids notes along the way. “The Bus” –  Bluey season 2, episode 22 The Grannies play matchmakers for a fun meet-cute on a bus as they pretend to be strangers. “Daddy Robot” – Bluey season 1, episode 4 Bandit plays Daddy Robot with the kids, and he finds love with Mommy Robot. “The Pool” – Bluey season 2, episode 22 Teamwork makes the dream work. This episode has a really cute kiss set up with one of our favorite shots in the whole series. “Smoochy Kiss” – Bluey season 3, episode 35 Chilli says she doesn’t like dad so the kids naturally take him away from her attempts at “smoochy kisses.” More sweet Chilli and Bandit moments Here’s a cute compilation of some of the most relatable and goals moments between Chilli and Bandit Heeler to celebrate the season of love. Are there any favorites we missed? Let us know in the comments below! Watch Bluey online and on Disney+. Want more io9 news?
