  "text": "antirez 9 hours ago. 112544 views. Five months ago, I rejoined Redis and quickly started to talk with my colleagues about a possible switch to the AGPL license, only to discover that there was already an ongoing discussion, a very old one, too. Many people, within the company, had the feeling that the AGPL was a better pick than SSPL, and while eventually Redis switched to the SSPL license, the internal discussion continued. I tried to give more strength to the ongoing pro-AGPL license side. My feeling was that the SSPL, in practical terms, failed to be accepted by the community. The OSI wouldn’t accept it, nor would the software community regard the SSPL as an open license. In little time, I saw the hypothesis getting more and more traction, at all levels within the company hierarchy. I’ll be honest: I truly wanted the code I wrote for the new Vector Sets data type to be released under an open source license. Writing open source software is too rooted in me: I rarely wrote anything else in my career. I’m too old to start now. This may be childish, but I wrote Vector Sets with a huge amount of enthusiasm exactly because I knew Redis (and my new work) was going to be open source again. I understand that the core of our work is to improve Redis, to continue building a good system, useful, simple, able to change with the requirements of the software stack. Yet, returning back to an open source license is the basis for such efforts to be coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company. So, honestly, while I can’t take credit for the license switch, I hope I contributed a little bit to it, because today I’m happy. I’m happy that Redis is open source software again, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license. Now, time to go back to the terminal, to show Redis users some respect by writing the best code I’m able to write, and make Vector Sets more useful and practical: I have a few more ideas for improvements, and I hope that more will be stimulated by your feedback (it is already happening). Good hacking! P.S. Redis 8, the first version of Redis with the new license, is also GA today, with a many new features and speed improvements of the core: https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/ You can also find the Redis CEO blog post here: https://redis.io/blog/agplv3/ blog comments powered by Disqus",
