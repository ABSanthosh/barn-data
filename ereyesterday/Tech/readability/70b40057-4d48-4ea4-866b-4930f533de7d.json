  "text": "10 years of Pixel. Credit: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images In May, an X user stumbled across a Pixel commercial shoot in the wild, fueling the online rumor mill and giving us a not-quite-up-close look at the flagship smartphone. Now, a fresh leak provides a possible August launch date, which means we could be just a few months away from the next generation of Pixel smartphones. It's hard to believe, but we're about to experience the tenth year of Google Pixel annual upgrades.What started as an uncertain experiment a decade ago is now a solid and dependable smartphone lineup from Google, year in and year out. This year looks to be no different, according to various rumors and leaks. The Google Pixel 10 lineup isn't quite ready to step into the spotlight, but that doesn't mean we can't get prepared in the meantime. Here is everything we know (and everything we think we know) about the Google Pixel 10 right now, including the latest launch date leak. There isn't a lot of concrete info yet about the Google Pixel 10 lineup, but we have enough to get a general idea of what to expect.The latest: A rumored August launch dateOn June 2, a leaker on X reported that the Google Pixel 10 will officially launch on August 13. Soon after, Android Headlines also reported an August launch, though the details are slightly different. Per Android Headlines, the next generation of Pixel phones will launch at a Made by Google Event on August 20, with the phones being shipped on August 28. The site reported the lineup \"will include the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold.We haven't been able to independently verify the leak, and the details don't match up precisely. That could mean Google is still finalizing the exact launch date, and as with all leaks, manage your expectations.That Google Pixel 10 video commercial shootWe know Google is actively prepping for the launch of the Pixel 10. How do we know this?MarksGonePublic apparently caught a video team shooting a commercial for the Pixel 10. You don't see that much of the phone in the screenshots, but this looks real. (Update: The MarksGonePublic account and post with photos from the commercial shoot have since been deleted.)Google Pixel 10 models and release dateGoogle traditionally announces each year's lineup in August, so we likely won't get official confirmation of the launch until then.As for how many Google Pixel 10 phones there will be in August, we can look to last year's launch to make a prediction. In 2024, Google launched the base Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold all at the same time. So far, there are no indications that Google plans to do anything differently this year. Until that changes, it's probably safe to assume this year's lineup will look the same, except with \"10\" in each phone's name instead of \"9.\" Mashable Light Speed According to Android Headlines, this year we'll be getting a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and a foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold.I should also note that there may be a Pixel 10a at some point in the future, but if tradition holds, that won't be until 2026. The Pixel 9a arrived roughly six months after the Pixel 9.Google Pixel 10 specsFor the past few years, Google has been using its own custom Tensor chipset to power Pixel phones. It would be a huge surprise if anything other than a \"Tensor G5\" chipset was powering the Pixel 10 family. Android Authority has a detailed technical report on Tensor G5, but in summary, the main thing to know is that it likely won't be a huge jump over Tensor G4. Google hasn't really been setting benchmark scores on fire with the past few Pixel phones, but the Tensor chips have always provided smooth performance and good battery life, so maybe that doesn't matter. Of course, Tensor G5 will also enable plenty of wacky new AI features, but we don't know about any of those for certain yet.Google Pixel 10 priceAgain, we don't know for sure how much any of these phones cost until Google tells us. That said, Android Headlines has done some reporting about this, and the answers are pretty interesting.According to that report, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro will retain the same price points as the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, or $799 and $999, respectively. Unfortunately, if you want a Pixel 10 Pro XL (which typically comes with a bigger display and battery), you'll apparently have to pay $1,200, up $100 from last year. Fascinatingly, it sounds like the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will actually get a price drop from last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The 2024 model started at $1,799, while this year's phone should be $1,599. Again, none of this is confirmed and is all subject to change, but for now, these are the prices we expect to see in August.Google Pixel 10 cameras The camera setup on the new Pixel 9a smartphone from Google. Credit: Alex Perry / Mashable Lastly, cameras are obviously a huge part of the appeal with smartphones, and Pixel phones have generally performed well in that respect. It sounds like Google is making a few interesting changes this year, if leaks are to be believed.Namely, it looks like the base Pixel 10 could get a third camera lens on the back, after years of Google only putting a wide and ultra-wide lens back there. This is according to renders obtained by Android Headlines earlier this year. A third telephoto lens could give the base Pixel 10 a huge leg up on zoomed in photos against similarly priced competition.That might come at a cost, though. According to Android Authority, the Pixel 10's rear camera array is a downgrade in terms of megapixel count from the Pixel 9. The new phone will have a 48MP wide lens and a 13MP ultra-wide lens, down from 50MP and 48MP, respectively, on Pixel 9. Those are actually the same camera specs as the recent mid-range Pixel 9a. It seem that the inclusion of a third telephoto lens necessitated these compromises in some way.It seems like the 10 Pro and Pro XL models will stay the same as the 9 Pro models, at least. According to Android Authority, they'll have the same 50MP/48MP/48MP array as last year. Lastly, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is allegedly receiving a slight bump in its main rear sensor up from 48MP to 50MP, but the rest of the array is the same: a 10.5MP ultra-wide lens to go with a 10.8MP telephoto lens.A ton of new AI featuresWe don't have any specific insight here, but considering that Google I/O 2025 focused entirely on Gemini, artificial intelligence in general, and the upcoming Android XR augmented reality platform, we can confidently say Pixel 10 will launch with a full suite of AI tools. That includes the standard AI features you get with Google products like Gmail, Docs, and Gemini, as well as tools specifically for Pixel hardware. If we had to guess, our money would be on new AI image editing and video editing tools, as that's been a big focus for Google recently. Ditto real-time language translation.Google Pixel 10 colorsA new rumor claims the Google Pixel 10 will come in the following colors: Obsidian (black), Iris (purple), Limoncello (yellow), and Blue (yes, blue doesn't get a fancy name for some reason). As for the Pixel 10 Pro and XL, we can expect Obsidian (black), Green (same fate as blue, it appears), Sterling (grey), and Porcelain (white).
