Read Full Bio  on July 19, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Ring, the Amazon-owned home surveillance company, is partnering with taser-maker Axon to once again help law enforcement request footage from users’ doorbell cameras.The move reverses Ring’s 2024 decision to kill its \"Request for Assistance\" feature, which let police ask users for video via the Neighbors app. At the time, Ring framed the change as a shift toward becoming a more community-focused brand, one less reliant on law enforcement integrations. That ethos now appears to be on pause. The about-face coincides with the return of Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who rejoined Amazon in April. Under his renewed leadership, Ring is doubling down on AI and rekindling its relationship with law enforcement. As first reported by Business Insider, the new partnership with Axon will allow police to request video from Ring users via Axon’s evidence management system. Ring is also reportedly exploring an option that would let users consent to live streaming their doorbell feeds directly to law enforcement. Mashable Light Speed In a public statement, Siminoff called the Axon partnership a way to \"foster a vital connection between our neighbors and public safety agencies,\" positioning it as a tool for safer neighborhoods.The Axon deal is just one part of Siminoff’s broader return strategy. He now oversees not just Ring, but also Amazon’s Blink camera line, its Key in-home delivery system, and the Sidewalk wireless mesh network. Since his return, Siminoff has pushed a hyper-AI agenda, including internal mandates to \"do more with less\" by using AI to streamline operations. Per Insider, even promotions now require proof of AI-driven impact on efficiency or customer experience.Internally, the shift has raised eyebrows. Current Ring employees told Insider they’re unsure how the collected footage will be used — and raised flags about privacy and data concerns that have long haunted the brand.In 2023, Amazon reached a $5.8 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for spying on Ring and Alexa users, though the company denied any wrongdoing.
