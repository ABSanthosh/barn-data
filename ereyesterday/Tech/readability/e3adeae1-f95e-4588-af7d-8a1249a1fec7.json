  "text": "The future looks dire for Rand and Moiraine. The Wheel of Time's heroes may have won the Battle of Falme in Season 2, but their war against darkness is far from over. That darkness is on full display in the Season 3 teaser, which offers glimpses of all the enemies Rand (Josha Stradowski), Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), and co. will face in the episodes to come. The evil faction of the Aes Sedai known as the Black Ajah has stepped out of the shadows while the Aes Sedai are still divided amongst themselves. Meanwhile, the Forsaken — including Lanfear (Natasha O'Keeffe) and Moghedien (Laia Costa) — are hunting Rand with a vengeance. (And impeccable villain fashion sense.) But the most foreboding moments of the whole teaser are Moiraine's visions of \"a thousand thousand futures,\" which hint at two very frightening character deaths.\"In every future where I lived, Rand dies,\" she says. \"And the only way he lives, is if I don't.\"So there we have it: an impossible choice between two of the show's most important characters. Will only one of them survive Season 3?The Wheel of Time Season 3 premieres March 13 on Prime Video. Belen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.
