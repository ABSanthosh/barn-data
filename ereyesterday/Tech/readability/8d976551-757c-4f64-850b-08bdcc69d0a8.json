Starting today, we're rolling out scheduled actions in the Gemini app, a new feature designed to proactively handle your tasks.With scheduled actions, you can streamline routine tasks or receive personalized updates directly from Gemini. In your conversation, simply ask Gemini to perform a task at a specific time, or transform a prompt you're already using into a recurring action. You can manage them anytime within the scheduled actions page within settings.Now you can wake up with a summary of your calendar and unread emails, or get a creative boost by having Gemini write five ideas for your blog every Monday. Stay informed by getting updates on your favorite sports team, or schedule a one-off task like asking Gemini to give you a summary of an award show the day after it happens. Just tell Gemini what you need and when, and it will take care of the rest.Scheduled actions are now available to Gemini app users with a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription and qualifying Google Workspace business and education plans.",
