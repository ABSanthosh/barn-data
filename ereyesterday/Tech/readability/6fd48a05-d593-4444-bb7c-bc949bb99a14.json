It’s the opposite, as it gifts its loyal user base for its own birthday, with two exclusive incentives. Users can save up to 72% on NordVPN’s 2-year plans and get up to 1 year of NordVPN Prime for free on top. This means you pay for a 2-year plan and get 3 years instead! Let’s see what’s in store for this fiery NordVPN celebration. See At NordVPN Get Up to 1 Year of NordVPN for Free We’ll first explain its free VPN deals. The VPN offers four plans – the Basic one is the least expensive but doesn’t come with a free offer. On the flip side, we have three more packages: Plus at $4.39/mo (70% off) + 6 free months Complete at $5.39/mo (70% off) + 6 free months Prime at $8.39/mo (72% off) + 12 free months The first two, when bought, grant you 6 free months of NordVPN’s corresponding plans. For example, if you get Plus, you’re awarded 6 free months of Plus, etc. Plus and Complete plans offer Threat Protection Pro and NordPass or NordPass + NordLocker respectively. Finally, there’s the Prime plan – the star of the show. This plan is equipped with all of the above plus NordProtect, for additional identity theft protection and cyber extortion insurance. At $8.39/mo, it’s 72% off and comes with a free year on top. NordVPN Basic: The Cheapest Birthday Deal If you’re in it for the VPN only, the Basic plan may be your ideal pick. NordVPN graces us with a 70% discount on this plan, which drops the price to only $3.39/mo or $81.36 upfront for 24 months. It’s way less expensive than Plus. However, you don’t get 6 or 12 free months and NordVPN doesn’t include other extras. Despite that, we think this is a brilliant deal because the VPN alone has many features. Some of them are: 7,300+ servers in 118 countries Streaming and torrenting allowance Unlimited bandwidth Double VPN No-logging policy Kill switch Applications for all devices 10 simultaneous connections, and more. At this price, NordVPN is one of the best affordable VPNs. Not to forget its 30-day money-back guarantee, which permeates each plan. With it, you can test the VPN and be refunded in 30 days if you want. You don’t need to explain your reasons and answer tedious questions. It’s time to let NordVPN gift you its best birthday deal. If you’re dead-set on this phenomenal VPN, now is the time to get up to 3 years of subscription for a two-year price. Don’t wait until the next birthday. Get NordVPN Basic at $3.39/mo",
