  "description": "Google announced Wednesday it is expanding its AI Overviews to more query types and users worldwide, including those not logged into Google accounts, while introducing a new \"AI Mode\" chatbot feature. AI Mode, which resembles competitors like Perplexity or ChatGPT Search, will initially be limited to Google One AI Premium subscribers who enable it through the Labs section of Search. The feature delivers AI-generated answers with supporting links interspersed throughout, powered by Google's search index. \"What we're finding from people who are using AI Overviews is that they're really bringing different kinds of questions to Google,\" said Robby Stein, VP of product on the Search team. \"They're more complex questions, that may have been a little bit harder before.\" Google is also upgrading AI Overviews with its Gemini 2.0 model, which Stein says will improve responses for math, coding and reasoning-based queries.
