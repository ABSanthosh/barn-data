However, most NordVPN users choose to stay along for the ride and revel in all the features they can get. Some of them include over 6,400 servers, Double VPN, Threat Protection, Meshnet, NordLynx protocol, streaming/P2P support, no-log policy, and AES encryption. NordVPN’s apps are also available across all devices. You can install them on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Better yet, all plans are supported by 10 simultaneous connections, meaning you can share the subscription with your friends and family. More info about NordVPN is in our review written not long ago.
