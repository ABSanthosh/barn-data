  "description": "Stanford law school graduate Peter Thiel later co-founded Facebook, PayPal, and Palantir. But in 2010 Thiel also created the Thiel Fellowship, which annually gives 20 to 30 people under the age of 23 $100,000 \"to encourage students to not stick around college.\" (College students must drop out in order to accept the fellowship.) And now Palantir \"is taking a similar approach as it maneuvers to attract new talent,\" reports financial news site The Street: The company has launched what it refers to as the \"Meritocracy Fellowship,\" a four-month internship program for recent high school graduates who have not enrolled in college. The position pays roughly $5,400 per month, more than plenty of post-college internship programs. Palantir's job posting suggests that the company is especially interested in candidates with experience in programming and statistical analysis. Palantir's job listing specifically says they launched their four-month fellowship \"in response to the shortcomings of university admissions,\" promising it would be based \"solely on merit and academic excellence\" (requiring an SAT score over 1459 or an ACT score above 32.) \"Opaque admissions standards at many American universities have displaced meritocracy and excellence...\" As a result, qualified students are being denied an education based on subjective and shallow criteria. Absent meritocracy, campuses have become breeding grounds for extremism and chaos... Skip the debt. Skip the indoctrination. Get the Palantir Degree... Upon successful completion of the Meritocracy Fellowship, fellows that have excelled during their time at Palantir will be given the opportunity to interview for full-time employment at Palantir.
