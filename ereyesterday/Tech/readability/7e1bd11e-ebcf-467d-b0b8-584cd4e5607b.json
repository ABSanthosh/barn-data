The rental car company is apparently looking to unload a portion of its EV fleet and is proactively reaching out to customers about the option to outright buy the vehicles they're renting.A viral post on Reddit showed an apparent email from Hertz offering a customer the option to buy the very EV they were renting. In this case it was a 2023 Tesla Model 3 for $17,913. Folks in the comments mentioned getting similar offers for other EVs. Hertz communications director Jamie Line told The Verge that this wasn't a new strategy and seemed to suggest it wasn't limited to EVs. Mashable Light Speed \"By connecting our rental customers who opt into our emails to our sales channels, we’re not only building awareness of the fact that we sell cars but also offering a unique opportunity to someone who may be in the market for the same car they have on rent,\" Line said. Hertz has long sold vehicles from its fleet and there are a number electric cars currently for sale on its site. Hertz did announce this year a plan to sell-off some 30,000 EVs after major losses.",
