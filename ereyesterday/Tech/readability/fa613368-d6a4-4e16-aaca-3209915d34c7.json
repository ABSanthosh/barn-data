  "text": "Cena, Brooks, Holland, Agee, and Stroma are all back for S2, along with Nhut Lee as Judomaster and Eagly, of course. Robert Patrick is also listed in the S2 cast, reprising his role as Chris's father Auggie; since Chris killed him in S1, one assumes Auggie will appear in flashbacks, hallucinations, or perhaps an alternate universe. (This is a soft reboot, after all.) New cast members include Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr. (Grillo voiced the role in the animated Creature Commandos), now head of A.R.G.U.S. and out to revenge his son's death; Tim Meadows as A.R.G.U.S. agent Langston Fleury; and Sol Rodriguez as Sasha Bordeaux. Set to \"Oh Lord\" by Foxy Shazam, the teaser opens with Leota driving Chris to a job interview, assuring him, \"They're gonna be doing backflips to get you to join.\" It turns out to be an interview with Justice League members Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders (Isabel Merced), and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), but they are not really into the interviewing process or taking note of Chris's marksmanship and combat skills. They even diss poor Chris while accidentally keeping the microphone turned on: \"This guy sucks.\" (All three reprise their roles from Superman and are listed as S2 cast members, but it's unclear how frequently they will appear.) The other team members aren't faring much better. They saved the world from the Butterflies, you'd think people would treat them with a bit more respect, if not as outright heroes. Leota is \"living in the worst level of Grand Theft Auto,\" per John Economos; Emilia Harcourt has anger management issues and is diagnosed with \"a particularly severe form of toxic masculinity\"; and Vigilante is working in the food service industry;. There's not much detail as to the plot, apart from Chris going on the run from A.R.G.U.S., but the final scene shows Chris walking through a door and encountering another version of himself. So things are definitely about to get interesting. The second season of Peacemaker will premiere on Max on August 221, 2025",
