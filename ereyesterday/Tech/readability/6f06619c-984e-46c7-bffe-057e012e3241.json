  "description": "Microsoft introduced an AI-powered video generator to its Bing search engine. Bing Video Creator is powered by OpenAI's Sora, which creates short clips based on text prompts. The free feature is rolling out to the Bing mobile app starting today and is slated to arrive later on desktop and to Copilot Search. Microsoft has invested multiple billions of dollars into OpenAI in support of its artificial intelligence endeavors over the years. The tech giant integrated the DALL-E image generation capability from OpenAI into the Bing search engine in 2023, so it's not surprising that it has followed a similar path with the company's Sora video tool. However, Sora had a rocky launch with a rebuke from YouTube's CEO not to train on its videos and protests from several of its early testing participants. The model became broadly available at the end of last year. It's also facing more competition from other video AI models offering more complex features, such as Google's Veo 3.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-integrates-openais-sora-video-creator-into-bing-215421408.html?src=rss",
