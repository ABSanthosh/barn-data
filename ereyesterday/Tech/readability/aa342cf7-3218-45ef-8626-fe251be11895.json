NordVPN Plans \u0026 Offers Rundown The Basic 2-year plan is by far the cheapest VPN of this quality and NordVPN’s least expensive deal. It’s enough if you need only a VPN with a Double VPN, P2P servers, streaming support, fast speeds, NordLynx protocol, and much more. However, many users find themselves opting for Plus. It includes: Threat Protection Pro, which blocks malware, trackers, and ads in real time. NordPass, which serves as a password manager. The Prime plan is NordVPN’s magnum opus, alas, at the highest price. It comes with everything from the previous plans plus: NordLocker, where you get 1 TB of end-to-end encrypted cloud storage NordProtect, which provides identity theft insurance and credit monitoring services to further enhance your online privacy All of the plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. This allows you to test the desired NordVPN deal thoroughly and decide if you want to keep using it. If not, you’ll be refunded the same day – no questions asked! Holidays are nearly over and NordVPN’s fresh deals will leave the market. We don’t want to sound panicky but they’ll last for a few more days. Don’t you think it’s time to act?
