  "description": "An anonymous readed shared this report from CNN: [U.S. army boats] are poorly maintained and largely unprepared to meet the military's growing mission in the Pacific, a new government oversight report said this week. The Government Accountability Office released a report on Wednesday that concluded there are \"wide-ranging\" issues facing Army watercraft, which limit the Army's ability \"to meet mission requirements in the Indo-Pacific theater where the need for Army watercraft is most pronounced.\" Despite Army policy requiring the vessels to be at least at a 90% mission capable rate — meaning the vessels are ready to perform their mission — the boats currently have a less than 40% capable rate this year. Overall, the fleet of watercraft has dropped by nearly half since 2018, going from 134 vessels to 70 as of May this year, in part due to divestment of vessels in 2018 and 2019... \"Army boats have not been ready, capable, or in a mindset they'll have to do something dangerous or in the real world ... for decades now,\" a retired warrant officer and former chief engineer on Army watercraft told CNN at the time... [Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith] said that the Army is \"actively\" working to address gaps in the watercraft's capability as a whole, and prioritizing improving the current fleet while also \"investing in a modernized fleet to meet the needs of the 2040 force.\" Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, told CNN that the Army is also looking at possibly replacing the existing fleet of Army watercraft with autonomous vessels in the future. \"What we see is the oil industry and other shipping industries are doing this already, we see that happening all around the world,\" Butler said. \"There's no reason the Army shouldn't be thinking that way ... leaders from down at ship level all the way to the Pentagon are looking at this and determining the best way to deploy our forces... \"Maybe the future fleet is all autonomous, we just don't know,\" he said. \"This is all stuff we're looking at in terms of trying to modernize the way we move people, weapons, and equipment.\" CNN notes that the report \"also said the Army is considering leasing civilian watercraft to bolster its existing fleet and moving all of its watercraft to the Pacific.\" The report also included a response from Army Secretary Wormuth, who said the Army is \"actively pursuing a holistic approach to mitigate the gaps in Army watercraft capability and capacity.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
