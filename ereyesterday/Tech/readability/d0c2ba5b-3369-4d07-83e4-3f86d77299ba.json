  "description": "Remedy's multiplayer spin on Control is coming to the PlayStation Game Catalog. Sony's June PS Plus additions start with the day-one arrival of FBC: Firebreak. Other entries this month include the latest Battlefield entry and sticky-ball Katamari fun. FBC: Firebreak lets you and up to two others team up to kick some Hiss ass. Play as a government employee who volunteered to take out extra-dimensional monsters. But the wicked delights really kick in when you enhance your plain ol' guns with supernatural gear. In our preview, Engadget's Jessica Conditt saw a promising and \"incredibly fun\" shooter that only needed a bit of fine-tuning before launch. \"Firebreak is poised to be a thoughtful and focused entry in the co-op shooter genre, and it's already an inviting extension of Remedy's darkest and silliest sensibilities,\" she wrote. FBC: Firebreak will be available in the Game Catalog on its launch day, June 17. You'll need a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership to claim it. EA Also coming on that date is Battlefield 2042. This could be a good time to catch up on the franchise before its next installment. (It's expected by April 2026.) Also arriving this month is We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. Who doesn't love rolling a satisfyingly growing blob of random shit? Both of those titles require a PS Plus Extra or Premium membership. Ditto for other June entries like Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 and theHunter: Call of the Wild. Meanwhile, the 2000 classic Deus Ex: The Conspiracy will only be available for Premium subscribers. You can check out the PlayStation blog for the complete list.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fbc-firebreak-headlines-junes-ps-plus-additions-211440207.html?src=rss",
