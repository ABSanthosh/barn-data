  "text": "Solid vs. inflatable There are two kinds of paddleboards you can buy, inflatable or rigid, aka solid. One isn't better than the other -- it will primarily depend on your current circumstances and what you're looking to get out of your board.  Solid paddleboards tend to be better for the ocean because they're more durable and can likely withstand the hit from jagged rocks and coral reefs. They're also more stable when you hit choppy waters, boat wakes and waves. They're also usually heavier, harder to transport and more difficult to store.  Inflatable paddleboards allow you to easily store it in small spaces like apartments, studios or the trunk of your car. They are also easier to get to the water, especially if you don't own a truck or vehicle with roof racks.  Functionality You can buy specific types of paddleboards you can buy that are ergonomically designed for certain activities. There are different lengths, widths and styles to maximize functionality.  Touring: Touring paddleboards are meant to go long distances over flat water and enable you to cut through choppy waters without trouble. They tend to be long with pointed noses to maximize speed but are wider than a racing board to help you feel more balanced over a long period of time. Racing: Racing paddleboards are built for speed. They are usually long, skinny and agile for great maneuvering. Expect to pay over $1,000 for a quality racing paddleboard. Yoga: Yoga paddleboards are longer and wider than your average SUP, so you can feel more balanced while practicing your poses. The foot pad also tends to take up a lot of the board's surface area, so you have plenty of space to move around in.Fishing: Fishing paddleboards are like yoga SUPs in that they are longer and wider for better balance. They also typically have a recessed deck to help lower the center of gravity and improve balance. Not to mention, more D-rings to hook your fishing gear to. Multi-person: Most paddleboards fit up to 250 to 300 pounds. Paddleboards meant to fit more than one person are quite large, wide and can sit up to 20 feet long. Leisure: The average paddleboarder wants to glide through the water and balance without falling off. A paddleboard can range between 10 to 11 feet long and offers a nice combination of speed, stability and maneuverability. Budget You can find a wide price range with paddleboards, so you can enjoy the sport on almost any budget. Inflatable boards tend to be more affordable than hard-top ones, while performance and racing boards are among the most expensive you can buy. For a good paddleboard, prices start around $300 and go all the way up to $2,000 or more.  Storage Once upon a time, I lived in a one-bedroom, 750-square-foot apartment and bought a 10-foot paddleboard. Did I have a detached garage? No. Did I have an abnormally large storage closet? No, I didn't have that either. Not understanding the sheer size of a paddleboard, I didn't take storage into account. I had to buy wall mounts to hold my paddleboard above my bed, almost like a makeshift headboard. Before I knew it, my place felt like a beach house in the middle of Reno, Nevada.  Moral of the story is, make sure you have the storage space for a solid SUP before you buy if that's the kind you're leaning toward.",
