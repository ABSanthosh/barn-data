If it sees something suspicious, the AI pings the store owner or security guard via an app, where it displays a recording of the activity.

Founded in 2018, Veesion’s AI shoplifter-spotter is already installed in over 6,000 stores in 25 countries, including France, the UK, Brazil and the US, where it is now looking to expand.   In 2022, US retailers reported inventory losses amounting to $112bn (€100bn), $40.3bn (€36bn) of which was attributed to shoplifting. Meanwhile, the UK, with a population around a quarter of the US, is also experiencing a rise in incidents of shoplifting. The country suffered losses of £2.2bn (€2.5bn) in 2023, according to a recent survey by the British Retail Consortium (BRC).  “Shoplifting is a huge pain point for retail stores, especially in the US, which is suffering from a theft epidemic,” said David. However, spotting the crime is just one part of the puzzle — confronting shoplifters is another. According to the same BRC survey, violence and abuse against UK shop workers rose by 50% in 2023, with more than 2,000 such incidents recorded on average per day. In both the UK and the US, enforcement against shoplifters is free-falling.   As retailers struggle to keep pace with rising theft, some are turning to technology for support. While Veesion’s AI doesn’t promise to solve shoplifting outright, it might give store owners better tools to detect it and decide how to respond.  As part of its US expansion plans, Veesion will open an office in Florida that aims to employ about 50 people. One of its co-founders, Benoît Koenig, is also moving across the Atlantic permanently as part of the company’s expanded presence in the country.  Looking ahead, Vession hopes to use its computer vision technology to spot other issues in retail stores, such as falling or slipping risks. It’s also considering expanding to other sectors like manufacturing and healthcare.  AI’s evolution will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.
