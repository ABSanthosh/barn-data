Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Product image courtesy of Amazon Amazon has kicked off its Black Friday sales well before the day itself, but that isn’t stopping it from delivering some absolutely wild discounts. The AOC Agon PRO AG276QZD2 is one of these deals, and it's great for gamers with a discerning eye. It’s a 27-inch, 1440p gaming monitor that uses a 240Hz QD-OLED panel. When OLED technology hit the gaming monitor market just a few years ago, it was very expensive and had some big drawbacks. That’s been changing rapidly, and this deal highlights that. You can snag this killer gaming monitor for just $400 at Amazon, a price that would have been practically unthinkable even last year.  Late last year, I had the chance to test out AOC’s Agon Pro AG276QZD for IGN (which is owned by the same parent company as Lifehacker). It was a stunning monitor with a fast OLED panel offering sharp 1440p visuals and all-around great value even when it was going for around $749. Since then, AOC introduced the Agon PRO AG276QZD2, which swaps the WOLED panel for a slightly more vibrant QD-OLED one. While I haven’t had a chance to test this variant yet, I’ve generally seen QD-OLED displays proving themselves just as good or better than WOLED ones. There are two big perks for OLED gaming monitors like this. OLED has effectively infinite contrast, which makes game visuals look outright stunning. OLED pixels are also very fast, so even in the thick of intense action, visuals remain sharp without blurry ghosting trails or unsightly pixel overshoot. Pair that with the 240Hz refresh rate of the Agon Pro AG276QZD2, and you can expect to see your games in a whole new light. You’ll also get a wide color gamut, making your games appear all the more vibrant. It would be enough just to get such a great display for $400, but the AOC Agon PRO AG276QZD2 is also stylishly built, with a thin panel, RGB backlighting, a two-port USB hub, and even five-watt speakers. And with two HDMI ports and two DisplayPort connections, you can set this display up with a bunch of different gaming systems without having to juggle cables.  Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.
