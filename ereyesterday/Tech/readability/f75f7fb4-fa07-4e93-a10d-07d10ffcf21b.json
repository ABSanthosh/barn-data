  "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is flying into the limelight on Gossamer-thin wings on May 12. Samsung’s hosting an “Unpacked” event—fully virtual this time—to share details on the super-thin smartphone that’s barely thicker than a USB-C charging port. The virtual event will take place on May 12 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT. You’ll be able to watch the livestream on Samsung’s website or its official YouTube channel. Don’t expect new versions of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6, though—those will likely come at a separate event this summer. © Samsung Samsung first showed off the Galaxy S25 Edge at its January Unpacked event. The company burped out the news for the phone as the “one more thing” for the event, but it didn’t offer many details other than highlighting its thin frame. The anticipated April launch date didn’t pan out, and Samsung still hasn’t gone into details about the device. In a release, Samsung said the S25 Edge is “more than a slim smartphone” that “unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.” What can we expect other than executives boasting about the phone’s thinness? Boasting about the camera, perhaps. The company confirmed its slim device houses a 200-megapixel camera that may be based on the main sensor found on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but we’ll need to see if it has the same levels of zoom. Images show the phone has two lenses compared to three or five found on Samsung’s other Android phones. Samsung has previously said the S25 Edge cameras have “pro-grade capabilities,” which implies they will have access to Samsung’s suite of photo editing tools. The phone will also likely be engineered with AI in mind, with at least some of the generative AI editing and creation tools available on current Galaxy phones. © Florence Ion / GizmodoA look at how Samsung displayed the Galaxy S25 Edge at Galaxy Unpacked. The Galaxy maker will need to convince us why we should want a super-slim phone. Rumors suggest Apple is set to launch its own skinny phone, the iPhone 17 Air, and might bring back an external battery case to make up for what sources have described as more limited battery compared to regular and pro iPhones. Ultimately, Samsung needs to prove users won’t sacrifice too much for the sake of a slightly thinner, slightly lighter device.",
