He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Smart home company SwitchBot is preparing a new Matter-enabled smart hub called the SwitchBot Hub 3, according to a registration with the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) that HomeKitNews spotted. It has a display like the $70 Hub 2, but adds physical controls — including, delightfully, a knob.According to the CSA listing, the Hub 3’s knob works for things like tweaking temperature on your smart thermostat or adjusting media volume — it says it’s compatible with “Apple TV, Spotify, and other streaming platforms for unified audio management.” The other physical controls include what looks like a home button, back button, and a mysterious button with an “S” logo on it. It also has four “editable quick-scene buttons on the home page for one-touch activation of customized modes.”The SwitchBot Hub 3’s display will turn on when it detects motion, including “hand gestures or device movements,” and will show indoor temperature and humidity, third-party weather forecasts, and “real-time status updates for door locks.” It will support SwitchBot’s Bluetooth-connected smart devices, which the Hub 2 bridges to Matter, making them controllable via major smart home platforms from the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung. The listing says the Hub 3 supports voice control through both Alexa and Google Assistant. SwitchBot hasn’t officially announced the new hub, and it’s not clear when it might launch.SwitchBot has a large stable of smart home products, including a universal Matter smart home remote and retrofit devices like a curtain-dragging device, tiny button-pressing robot, and stick-on device for turning boring old deadbolt locks smart. In January, the company showed off an inventive modular robotic smart home platform.",
