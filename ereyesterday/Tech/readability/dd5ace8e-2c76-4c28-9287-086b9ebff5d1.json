  "description": "X users can no longer send encrypted messages on the platform. The company said in an update that it's \"pausing\" the feature \"while we work on making some improvements.\" Users will still be able to view previously-sent encrypted chats, but won't be able to send any new ones. Up to now, encrypted DMs have been available only on messages between verified users who are mutual or who have previously accepted DMs from each other. Screenshots of the feature from X's help center labeled it as \"early access.\" (Notably, there were a number of other important caveats to X's encryption, even when it was working, including the fact that encryption was never available for group chats, multimedia messages or metadata .) It's unclear when the feature will be available again or if the \"pause\" has anything to do with \"XChat,\" the company's yet-to-be-launched chat platform. X employees have been dropping hints about XChat, which will reportedly feature encrypted direct messages, for some time. Screenshots from leakers suggest XChat could have additional security features like PIN-protected chats. Officially, though, X hasn't revealed much about XChat or what's going on with the current version of encrypted DMs. X's in-app inbox was one of the features that experienced numerous issues last week after a site-wide outage — possibly due to a fire at an Oregon facility used by the company — caused days of technical problems for the service. Updates on the company's developer platform page indicate some of those issues have yet to be resolved. X didn't respond to a request for comment.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-is-pausing-encrypted-dms-215750222.html?src=rss",
