Read Full Bio  on June 8, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Credit: IGN IGN’s two-day mega event was pure nerdy chaos in the best way possible. Following up on Summer Games Fest, IGN Live served up a packed slate of exclusives and fan-favorite reveals. From a first-look clip at Marvel’s Ironheart to a brand-new trailer for Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3, and a celebration marking 10 years of Critical Role, the event delivered something for every corner of the fandom multiverse.First clip of Ironheart The first exclusive clip from Ironheart kicks off with a classic clash of egos, as brilliant teen inventor Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) is reluctantly roped into teaming up with Parker Robbins, a.k.a. The Hood (Anthony Ramos), who offers her a way to build her soon-to-be iconic suit. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3 Trailer IGN Live dropped an exclusive first look at Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3, teasing the crew’s high-stakes return following their showdown with the Gorn.According to the official synopsis, the new season promises fresh alien encounters, a formidable new villain, and a genre-blending mix of faith, duty, romance, comedy, and mysteryNyaight of the Living Cat Anime Exclusive Clip Can you resist the urge to pet a cat? That’s the twistedly cute dilemma at the heart of Nyaight of the Living Cat, an upcoming Crunchyroll anime where a mysterious virus turns anyone who rubs up against a feline into one themselves.IGN Live premiered an exclusive two-minute clip from the series, showcasing three survivors desperately fleeing a fluffy swarm of dangerously adorable cats, with some unexpectedly “deadly” consequences. Mashable Top Stories It's ridiculous, it's charming, and it’s probably going to haunt every cat lover’s dreams.Critical Role 10th anniversary Critical Role marked its 10-year milestone at IGN Live with a warm, often hilarious panel moderated by Amelia Emberwing featuring much of the beloved cast, including Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, Travis Willingham, and more.The real bombshell, though, was the glimpse into the future. Fans got a sneak peek at Mighty Nein, Critical Role’s next animated series, which promises a very different energy from The Legend of Vox Machina—think strangers trying to vibe, with mixed results. On top of that, they teased upcoming video game projects with the first one dropping later this year.Revival exclusive clip In SyFy's upcoming original series, Revival, the dearly departed of a quiet Wyoming town rise again. However, they aren’t bloodthirsty zombies; they just want to pick up where they left off. Of course, things don’t go quite that smoothly.Wynonna Earp’s Melanie Scrofano stars as a local cop and mom caught in the middle of the eerie resurgence, trying to keep the peace as the town descends into supernatural chaos. Oh, and WWE’s own CM Punk shows up, because why not?If you're into campy murder mysteries with a spooky twist, or still mourning the end of iZombie, this one should be firmly on your radar.Clair Obscure Expedition 33 documentary first look It’s easy to see why Expedition 33 has taken the gaming world by storm in the short time since its release. Sandfall Interactive’s stylish, turn-based RPG — equal parts French elegance and Japanese inspiration — has quickly become one of our favorite titles of the year, and for good reason.To thank the fans who helped turn Expedition 33 into a breakout hit, Sandfall gave us a sneak peek at the first 10 minutes of its upcoming behind-the-scenes documentaryDisclosure: IGN Entertainment is a subsidiary of ZiffDavis Inc., which is the parent company of Mashable.
