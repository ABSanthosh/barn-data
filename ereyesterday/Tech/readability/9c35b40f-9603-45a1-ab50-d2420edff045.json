First of all: what a world. Second: It was actually well-received by people online. AJ, whose real last name is Befumo, defeated QT Marshall in his match with an assist from Big Justice, who, in typical wrestling match fashion, snuck into the ring to deliver a textbook spear to help his dad secure the W. In case you didn't know, AJ was a pro wrestler back in the day so the match was quite well done. Mashable Top Stories The internet loved the Costco guys bringing the boom and the Rizzler, well, doing what it is the Rizzler does. And there were lots of jokes, of course.
