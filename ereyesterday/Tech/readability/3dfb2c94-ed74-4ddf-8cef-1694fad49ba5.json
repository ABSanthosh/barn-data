  "text": "Dive into the world of Artificial Intelligence with this easy to learn all-in-one tool and watch your creativity explode. If you’re waiting for the AI craze to just fade out and go away, we have bad news for you. If you’re ready to accept AI as an incredibly useful technology that is only going to get smarter and more prevalent with every passing day, we have great news for you: StackSocial is selling a lifetime Advanced Business Plan subscription to the powerful and intuitive 1min.AI platform for just $80, which is a massive 85% discount. However, there are even cheaper options: the Pro Plan is only $30 (87% off), and the Business Plan is available for $50 (86% off). 1min.AI is more than just an artificial intelligence app — it’s several AI models combined into one robust platform, pulling the best results and smart technology from all the leading AI models into one source to assist you with everything from scheduling, problem-solving and decision-making, to dazzling creative projects that you can use to advertise your small business or individual sales and services. See at StackSocial AI In One Bundle If you’re currently trying to navigate the rapidly changing world of AI, you may find yourself with numerous subscriptions to models like OpenAI, Meta, Stability.ai, Google, and others. Those add up quickly, and you don’t need AI to tell you that this could drain your wallet faster than you realize. The beauty of 1min.AI is that it gives you access to all of those models and many more, including Leonardo.AI, cohere, and Midjourney. You can replace all of those monthly auto-billing subscriptions with a single payment of $80 that gives you lifetime access to 1min.AI’s top-tier service, the Advanced Business Plan. All of the updates to the app and news from the 1min.AI newsletter and Public Roadmap are included in the price, and there are no recurring costs or upsells. Supercharge Your Business 1min.AI is like adding an entire staff to your small business without having to pay out salaries or benefits. Once you dive into 1min.AI and discover how easy it is to pick up and master even if you’ve never used AI before, soon you’ll be using it as a personal assistant and scheduler, keyword researcher and SEO assistant, author for ads and content for Facebook, LinkedIn, and other online platforms, image generator and editor, and PDF summarizer and translator. There’s already more it can do, and every day it gets more intelligent and useful. The Advanced Business Plan gives you 2 million credits per month and the opportunity to generate up to 450,000 more every month for free, along with the entire suite of 1min.AI’s features, plus unlimited prompts, storage, and brand voice. Your lifetime subscription can have up to 10 members who can share and collaborate, which you can manage as admin. Everything is included in the StackSocial price of just $80, 85% lower than the list price of $540. See at StackSocial",
