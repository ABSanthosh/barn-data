  "text": "Since 2016, Damien Leone’s Terrifier series has evolved from standalone shorts into growing franchise with a passionate fanbase that helps it rake in plenty of money. The folks who love Terrifier absolutely love it, and with the third movie now in theaters, you may be wondering what’s next for Art the Clown and whoever’s unlucky to wind up in his path. Beyond an eventual fourth movie, the answer is…video games, actually? IGN reports that Bullfighter Neon developer Relevo and publisher Selecta Play are teaming on a retro beat-em-up game for the franchise cleverly titled Terrifier: The ARTcade Game. Players take on the role of the serial killer clown who learns movie studios are trying to bring his ultraviolent killings to the silver screen. He’s not too happy about that, so he takes it upon himself to invade the movie sets grab a variety of melee weapons, and does what he does best: murder a bunch of “policemen, firewomen, camera operators, stunt performers, makeup artists, and even unsuspecting civilians.” As the trailer shows, the Terrifier game’s setup might sound familiar to anyone who played other mid-tier tie-in games like the Scott Pilgrim one for the 2010 movie. Along with the standard single-player mode and sidescroller brawler setup, there’s four-player local co-op and different game modes for them to play with and against each other. When others join in on the gruesome fun, they’ll take on the roles of supporting players from the franchise like the Little Pale Girl and Victoria Heyes. And if that weren’t enough, players will be able to pull off some ultraviolent finishers on enemies that’ll surely make for some good couch co-op fun as players try to top each other. Sound fun to you? Good news, Terrifier: The ARTcade Game will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025. Want more io9 news?
