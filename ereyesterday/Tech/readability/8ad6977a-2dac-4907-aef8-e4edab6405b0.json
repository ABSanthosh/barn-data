  "text": "It's the end of a (free) era: Southwest Airlines will begin charging for checked bags at the end of May.Amid sinking profits, the budget airline announced in a press release Tuesday that it's ending its long-standing policy of allowing passengers to check two bags for free, restricting the perk to its elite members starting May 28. The carrier also announced it's introducing a basic economy fare, which doesn't include many of the perks Southwest customers have enjoyed until now: TAX SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.Customers who purchase Basic fares on or after May 28 won't be able to pick their seat or request extra legroom. The carrier announced last year that it would end its open seating policy and instead offer premium seating options with more legroom.Customers now earn fewer Rapid Rewards points on the cheaper Wanna Get Away and Wanna Get Away Plus fares. Flight credits issued for Basic fare tickets purchased on or after May 28 will expire after six months. Flight credits for pricier fares will expire after a year.However, you can now buy Southwest tickets on Expedia, which started offering the airline's fares last month.While travelers had mixed opinions about assigned seating, the checked bag charges are likely to be met with frustration across the board as fliers clamor for cheaper airline tickets. Why is Southwest changing its policy?In a word: profitability.The airline's profits dropped by 46% in early 2024, although it touted record revenue by the end of the year. According to Southwest CEO Bob Jordan, the airline is rolling out its new policy as it continues to rebuild.  \"We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future customer needs, attract new customer segments we don't compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our shareholders expect,\" Jordan said in Tuesday's press release. Charging for checked bags offers an additional revenue stream for the airline. It follows the playbook of bigger airlines, which typically offer cheaper tickets to customers willing to forgo any perks or amenities. What can you do to avoid checked bag fees?If you don't want to pay to check a bag the next time you fly, you still have some options.Southwest Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred Members and customers who book Business Select fares can still check two bags for free. A-List Members and other \"select\" customers will enjoy one free checked bag. Rapids Rewards Credit Card members will receive a statement credit for one checked bag.  If you aren't loyal to Southwest, other airline credit cards may also reward cardholders with perks like free checked bags. The Delta SkyMiles Gold American Express Card, for example, offers cardholders their first checked bag free on Delta flights.Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers. Enrollment may be required for select American Express benefits and offers. Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.And if all else fails, consider packing lighter to fit your travel wardrobe in a carry-on.\"Use compression cubes and vacuum bags to save space,\" said Mariana Mendoza of Vibe Adventures travel agency. \"Choose a suitcase with compression straps and expandable compartments to help you fit more into your carry-on.\"",
