These scaleups include the likes of Spotify, Revolut, Adyen, and Vinted. However, European software businesses that reach the ‚Ç¨100 million ARR threshold take 15 years on average to get there. That‚Äôs five years longer than their US peers, the report found. Europe also lags in birthing software giants. While 5‚Äì10% of US firms reaching ‚Ç¨100 million in ARR subsequently scale to ‚Ç¨1 billion, fewer than 3% of their European peers reach that milestone. The report highlighted some of the reasons for this stalled growth: fragmented markets, conservative corporate norms, and a slower flow of late-stage capital relative to early-stage investment.

Sign up now!Despite the hurdles, the report‚Äôs authors are confident that all the ingredients for Europe‚Äôs success in software are now in place. ‚ÄúEurope already holds the essentials to create the world‚Äôs next generation of software champions: deep talent pools, vibrant founder networks, and a rapidly maturing capital base,‚Äù said Ruben Schaubroeck, senior partner at McKinsey. While Europe lost out to Silicon Valley firms like Google and Microsoft in the early internet era, emerging technologies like AI may offer a new opening for the region‚Äôs tech startups. Geopolitical shifts could also drive governments to invest in local tech ecosystems and rethink digital sovereignty, said the report. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no denying that European tech has faced structural barriers, but we‚Äôre at a genuine inflection point,‚Äù Phill Robinson, CEO and co-founder at Boardwave, told TNW. ‚ÄúNew technology arenas, geopolitics, and an evolving operating environment are creating a unique opportunity for Europe to boost innovation.‚Äù Now Europe must turn that potential into profits, the report argues. To that end, it suggests five key interventions to boost Europe‚Äôs software ecosystem: Expand late-stage funding Encourage experienced founders to start new companies Make it easier for sales and marketing teams to work across borders and help startups grow faster Encourage more large firms in Europe to buy software from European startups by offering government support or financial incentives Strengthen public-private partnerships to de-risk new technologies Scaling up European tech The McKinsey/Boardwave report comes hot on the heels of the EU‚Äôs landmark Startup and Scaleup Strategy, launched last week. The plan set out several reforms designed to remove barriers to growth for the bloc‚Äôs early-stage companies. ‚ÄúIf implemented boldly, and most importantly quickly, it can help Europe move from fragmented success stories to systemic, continent-wide scale; otherwise, we risk being left behind,‚Äù said Robinson, commenting on the new strategy. The EU‚Äôs proposal includes provisions for a long-awaited ‚Äú28th regime,‚Äù which would allow companies to operate under a single set of rules across the 27 member states. It is intended to reduce headaches around taxes, employment rules, and insolvency. Robinson said he believes the EU‚Äôs new strategy will strengthen Europe‚Äôs software ecosystem by making it easier to operate across borders. ‚ÄúWe need to act as one innovation ecosystem, not 27 different ones,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes this Europe‚Äôs moonshot moment. If we connect and act now, we can lead. And not just in Europe, but globally.‚Äù",
