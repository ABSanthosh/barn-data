Credit: Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs are gunning for a three-peat at the Super Bowl, this time facing off against the Philadelphia Eagles. But before any cleats hit the field, there’s the all-important pregame fashion spectacle. Saquon Barkley, as always, delivered — effortlessly sleek, the man does not miss.Kelce, on the other hand? He showed up in a 70's-inspired look that can only be described as a choice. The internet, predictably, had thoughts — some heralding the fit as vintage excellence, others questioning whether he lost a bet. Either way, the man knows how to keep us talking.
