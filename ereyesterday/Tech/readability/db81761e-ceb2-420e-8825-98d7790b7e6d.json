  "description": "No need to pass the aux anymore because Spotify is bringing its Jam feature to cars with Android Auto and Google built-in. As revealed during Google I/O, Spotify Jam will be available through any compatible car's infotainment system. It's a minor upgrade, but one that saves the driver from having to manually launch a Spotify Jam session through their smartphone that's connected to the car. Instead, the Spotify Jam can get started from the car's central display and will give your passengers a QR code to scan if they want to contribute to the playlist. Spotify revealed its Jam feature in September 2023 and it's been a hit because it allows friends to smoothly share and discover new music. The natural next step is to introduce it to Android Auto since road trips and collaborative playlists pair together like peanut butter and jelly.Â  Spotify Jam will be available in the coming months on Android Auto and its more than 500 compatible car models, later being introduced to the dozen or so car brands that have Google built-in. Beyond that, Google is also planning on introducing streaming video and browser apps as part of its Android Auto ecosystem.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/youll-soon-be-able-to-start-a-spotify-jam-directly-in-your-car-200002411.html?src=rss",
