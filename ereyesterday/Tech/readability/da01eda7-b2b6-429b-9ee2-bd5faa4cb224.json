I've also added some contextual notes you should know before diving into these options.Due to gestures vaguely, everything going on right now with WordPress, I thought I'd put together a list of alternative CMSs that better fit the criteria someone might have for their website. The modern CMS landscape is super broad, with the very definition of \"Content Management System\" being stretched. Some see it as a full-package website platform, and some see it as just UI for their content stored elsewhere.The criteria for this list are \"Can it be downloaded, dropped onto a server, and you'll have a website?\" This eliminates API and git-based CMSs, which I enjoy using; however, wiring a daisy chain of tools is just not viable for many.Ghost: The best open source blog \u0026 newsletter platformBeautiful, modern publishing with email newsletters and paid subscriptions built-in.

The uptime is good, the price is very reasonable, and Jannis provides a personal touch with support. In addition, this sidesteps Ghost's own hosting option (Ghost Pro), which I would be wary of due to past experiences with other customers.Kirby is the CMS that adapts to youKirby is the content management system that adapts to any project. Made for developers, designers, creators and clients.Kirby CMSI have not used Kirby in client work, but I hear only good things. It's file-based, which seems super appealing to someone like myself who gets cold sweats when opening a database.IndiekitThe little server that connects your website to the independent web.Get StartedIndiekit seems like an interesting option; it's also file-based but needs a database to manage existing content.Craft CMSCraft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.Craft CMSIt's a bit more of a commercial option with Craft CMS, but it does offer a free option for solo creators.

A fork of WordPress 4.9, it retains the WordPress classic editor as the default option.ClassicPressClassicPress appears to be a direct fork of WordPress but at version 6.2.3. It seems perfect for anyone looking for \"the good old days.\" However, it uses the official WordPress plugin API, so it's not a 100% clean break if that's what you're going for. Thanks to Pelle Wessman for this suggestion.Statamic is a powerful, highly scalable CMS built on Laravel.The open source, flat-first, Laravel + Git powered CMS designed for building easy to manage websites.StatamicI've had several people suggest Statamic. It does look pretty good, plus they have a free solo plan (similar to Craft CMS). I think if the cofounder hadn't brazenly endorsed a horrendously damaging politician, I'd have tried it.I was going to suggest Perch and Buckets on this list, but public activity seems low for both. The Perch website even has SSL certificate issues, which isn't a good sign. Check them out if you're interested, but you have been warned.Honourable mentionLifting AnchorHelp on how to use AnchorAnchor CMSMany years ago, I contributed to Anchor, a humble PHP-based CMS that grew a little community around itself. Sadly, the creator, Charlotte, passed away in 2020, and the remaining core team couldn't keep the project going while juggling other responsibilities. I think of it fondly and wish we could give it the time it deserves. The theming and custom types aspects were wonderfully simple; heck, I even made a whole site dedicated to themes and sites built with it:Welcome - Anchor ThemesThemes and sites built for \u003ca href=‚Äúhttps://anchorcms.com‚Äù\u003eAnchor\u003c/a\u003e, obviouslyAnchor ThemesDavid DarnesI'll try to keep this list up to date if I recall any others I've used in the past.
