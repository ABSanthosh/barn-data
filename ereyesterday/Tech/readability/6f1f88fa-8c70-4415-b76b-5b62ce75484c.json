To help, Google and YouTube are giving more than $3 million in funding to improve access to technology and support continuity of learning for affected students, teachers, schools and districts.This includes a contribution to the Greater Los Angeles Education Foundation to provide more than 3,000 Chromebooks, helping impacted students stay connected to their education. And this fall, we’re launching a back-to-school matching campaign through DonorsChoose.org to ensure teachers in wildfire-affected schools have the essential resources and supplies to rebuild their classrooms.This is all part of Google, YouTube and Google.org’s $15 million in funding to organizations providing relief in greater Los Angeles. Rebuilding will be a long-term effort. We’re proud to help greater Los Angeles students continue their education and support the community's recovery as a whole.",
