  "text": "November and December mark some of the best months for purchasing a VPN. The Black Friday NordVPN offer bolsters our claim, as the VPN is now 74% and costs only $2.99 a month. Adding to its generosity are the 3 free months for all 2-year and 1-year plans. We cannot stress the importance of this VPN deal. NordVPN’s at its cheapest, with a total of SIX discounted plans, all coming with 3 extra months. You’re not too late; these discounts are still active, so act quickly before they vanish. All NordVPN Black Friday Discounts: Get Yours Now! There’s plenty to cover but we’ll be quick. NordVPN offers three 2-year plans where the Basic one is the star of the show. All three are discounted by 74% but the Basic one costs only $2.99 a month or $80.73 for the first 27 months. Save 74% on NordVPN’s 2-Year Plans This is one of the best Black Friday VPN deals in 2024. © NordVPN The Plus plan is the best value, whose 27-month variant costs $105.03 upfront or $3.89/mo. We deem this one extremely valuable thanks to Threat Protection Pro and NordPass. The Ultimate plan at $159.03 for the first 27 months gives you everything. You’ll get NordLocker as well, plus identity protection to further enhance your privacy. The Ultimate plan packs 1 TB of NordLocker to encrypt your data and prevent its loss. NordVPN Black Friday offers also cover 1-year plans with 3 extra months, starting at $4.59/mo. © NordVPN The Ultimate plan has the largest 67% discount while the Plus plan, consequently the most popular one, is 63% off. The latter is now $5.49/mo, while the Ultimate costs $7.49/mo. All plans are safe to test without losing money, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee. Why Is It the Most Popular VPN? With the Black Friday deal going live earlier than ever, NordVPN saw a surge in new users who still enjoy its plentiful features. It packs over 6,500 servers in 111+ countries, all offering fast 10 Gbps ports. There’s also NordLynx, a proprietary protocol for security and stability. NordVPN fares well in every aspect. From AES-256-bit encryption and a kill switch to advanced features like malware protection, secure file sharing, and a Double VPN for two encryption layers. The provider is famous for its ironclad privacy. This is a result of a no-log policy, multiple third-party audits, and RAM-only servers. To make things more exciting, NordVPN is fully capable of unblocking Netflix, it works for torrenting, and offers apps for all devices, with 10 simultaneous connections in all plans. Beware that this is just the tip of the iceberg. NordVPN offers way more, and at this price, it’s hard to come close to its value. Pick the Basic one to save the most, and if you can spend a speck more, the Plus plan will keep you coming for more. It’s hard to grow tired of these rule-bending features.
