  "text": "Instagram has a new feature that curates custom Reels feeds for you and your friends. Blend, an invite-only option within individual or group chats, refreshes daily and suggests content based on participants' tastes. Spotify has a similar Blend feature that creates shared playlists—also updated daily—based on both listeners' tastes. Note that Instagram Blend, which is a mobile-only feature, is not yet available to all users, even if the icon appears in your chats. How to use Instagram BlendTo start a blend, you'll need to invite users via your individual or group chats. From Messages on the mobile app, open the one-on-one or group chat you want to create a blend with and tap the new Blend icon. Everyone in the chat will receive an invite—if at least one person accepts, a blend will be created, but an individual's suggested reels will be added only if they accept.Once a blend is created, you can view it by tapping the Blend icon at the top of the chat, where you can then comment on or react to it. You can delete a reel that has been suggested for you by tapping the three horizontal dots and selecting Remove from your blends, though this will remove it from any blends you are part of. If you want to leave a blend, open it and tap the Settings icon \u003e Leave this blend. What do you think so far? According to Instagram's explainer page, you can also curate suggestions by indicating whether you are interested or not interested (tap the three horizontal dots on the reel) to get more or less of similar content. Sensitive content will be filtered based on the member with the strictest settings.",
