Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in select countries are getting access to this new feature. Remember that all generated videos include a visible watermark to show they are AI-generated and an invisible SynthID digital watermark. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Basic explainer Google made Gemini even cooler. Now, people can turn their photos into short videos with sound. Just upload a picture and tell Gemini what kind of video you want. It's like magic, and it's available for some subscribers now. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: We launched our state-of-the-art video generation model Veo 3 in May — and last week, we expanded access to Google AI Pro subscribers in over 150 countries. Now, with a new photo-to-video capability in Gemini, you can now transform your favorite photos into dynamic eight-second video clips with sound.The explosion of creativity from users has been truly remarkable, with over 40 million Veo 3 videos generated across the Gemini app and Flow over the last seven weeks. From reimagining fairy tales through the eyes of a modern influencer, to ASMR videos exploring what it would sound like to cut through a piece of cooling lava, your imagination is the limit when you create videos with Gemini. Photo-to-video brings your images to lifeTo turn your photos into videos, select ‘Videos’ from the tool menu in the prompt box and upload a photo. Then, describe the scene and any audio instructions, and watch as your still image transforms into a dynamic video. You can get creative by animating everyday objects, bringing your drawings and paintings to life or adding movement to nature scenes. Once your video is complete, tap the share button or download it to share with friends and family.The photo-to-video capability is starting to roll out today to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in select countries around the world. Try it out at gemini.google.com. These same capabilities are also available in Flow, Google’s AI filmmaking tool.Our ongoing commitment to safetyWhen you use our video generation tools, we want you to feel confident in the results.
