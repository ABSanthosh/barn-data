It takes the guesswork out of gift-giving. Ahead of Valentine’s Day, you can glance over your partner’s shoulder to see what kinds of products the algorithms are serving them ads for, watch influencers demonstrate the trendiest items, or just search for what’s hot. Here’s what to get your lover for Valentine’s Day, based on what's going viral. #1: Personalized jewelryThe first thing I've been getting a lot of videos about lately is personalized jewelry. Granted, a lot of these videos are coming from manufacturers or boutiques themselves, but I'm only seeing them because they're getting enough positive feedback to go viral, landing them on my FYP. Generally speaking, heart-shaped jewelry is a no-no and expensive jewelry can be dicy depending on the stage your relationship is at, but personalized jewelry is always a winner. It's more sentimental and meaningful—but it doesn't actually have to be super spendy. An engraved sterling silver bracelet can be as low as around $14 on Amazon and can feature a name, a special date, geographical coordinates, or something special to you and your person. Two years ago, my boyfriend got me this initial necklace from Tiffany ($210) and I haven't taken it off. You can also create a custom combination using Kendra Scott's Color Bar, which is especially popular among college-aged and younger people, but works for anyone. (This is what I got as my birthday present last week, for instance.) #2: Permanent jewelryAnother idea that is popping up all over—but is a little serious—is permanent jewelry. These are typically small bracelets that are welded onto the wearer (so, like, easy enough to snap if you really had to, but let's hope you never do). On social media, couples post about going to get them together, though I caution you should both do it or else it's a little weird and possessive, in my opinion. It used to be that \"permanent jewelry\" meant spending thousands on some Cartier, but these days, it can be as low as a few hundred, depending on where you live. Shops offering the service have popped up all over the country, so Google your city name and \"permanent jewelry,\" but only if you think your partner will really like it. Alternatively, you can buy DIY kits that come with two bracelets and everything you need to attach them for around $50. #3: A mini fridgeThis was big last year but is still big this year, too. (I just added one to my cart after months of pressure from my algorithm.) Mini fridges are popular for storing drinks, yes, but also for keeping skincare items chilled, so whether your sweetie likes to crack open a cold one or apply 11 layers of goop to their face (or both at the same time), there are a few avenues to success here. A classic Insignia mini fridge in black ($99.99, Best Buy)The Iceblue skincare fridge with a lighted mirror on the front ($39.99, Amazon)#4: Stanley tumblers (and other, non-Stanley tumblers)Stanley tumblers (and their various competitors) have remained popular for years now and are an appropriate gift for any holiday. People love these things, so it's a slam-dunk as far as gifts are concerned. Put flowers or smaller presents inside to seal the deal and aim to pick up the Valentine's-themed Stanley ($45) for style points, since that one is trending.#5: Customized anythingReturning to my original point, custom gifts are always best, especially on more romantic holidays. Spend some time on TikTok or Reels and you'll see customizable goods from air fresheners to pajamas. A few ideas:A blanket with a photo on it ($18.99)An illuminated photo plaque ($12.99)A t-shirt with photos arranged to look like band merch, which is very popular ($12.99)These are a few things that are popular on the app right now, sure, but everyone is unique so you can't just order up a little fridge for your sweetie if it's not something they actually want. If you're OK with a little light cyber-stalking (and you're sure that the person you're buying for wouldn't be creeped out), try going to their Instagram and hitting their \"following tab.\" You'll see not only the accounts they follow, which can point you toward hyper-curated interests and the hashtags they track. Look through the accounts and hashtags, where videos and posts they've liked will populate automatically for you (because the algorithm is sick). If you see, \"Liked by [their username]\" under a post, that can give you a good idea of what they really like but maybe haven't thought to ask for. Again, proceed with caution: If the person you're buying a gift for might find that technique invasive—such as someone you just started dating—don't use it! But if you're really struggling with gift ideas and you know the person well enough, give it a shot. Lindsey Ellefson Features Editor Lindsey Ellefson is Lifehacker’s Features Editor.
