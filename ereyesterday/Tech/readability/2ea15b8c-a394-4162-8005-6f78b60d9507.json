TNW Conference brings together Europe’s sharpest minds, boldest startups, and game-changing tech leaders at Amsterdam’s NDSM on June 19 and 20. It’s two days packed with big ideas, fierce debates, and innovations that could shape the future. We’ve combed through the packed schedule and picked seven sessions you absolutely can’t miss — the ones set to challenge the status quo and get everyone talking. 1.Where’s Iron Man? Why tech belongs in defence — Purple Stage, Thursday 16:25 – 16:55 Capital is pouring into defence tech right now. Startups are raising big rounds, securing major contracts, and giving the legacy military contractors or “primes” a run for their money.  The 💜 of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!At TNW Conference, four defence tech heavyweights will come together to discuss the rise of the sector, its potential to shape future warfare, and the role of startups.  The session will feature insights from Jyoti Hirani-Driver, COO at NATO’s DIANA accelerator, Giuseppe Lacerenza, partner at Amsterdam-based defence-focused fund Keen Venture Partners, and Dr Benjamin Wolba, co-founder of the European Defence Tech Hub. Last but not least is Marc Wietfeld, CEO of ARX Robotics, a German startup building autonomous land vehicles. 2. Gods of industry: The battle for deep tech dominance — Purple Stage, Friday 10:30 – 11:00  Next up, we’re looking at another battle. This one is being fought over deep tech — the science and engineering breakthroughs shaping everything from health to transportation. Leading the conversation will be two tech titans: Peter Wennink, former CEO of chip giant ASML, and Young Sohn, managing partner at deep tech VC Walden Catalyst.  Wennink and Sohn will explore the seismic forces reshaping the next decade of deep tech innovation. Expect sharp takes on geopolitics, supply chain strains, the limits of Moore’s Law, and the rise of AI-native hardware. 3. Solving your burnout with psychedelics: Exploring the future of storytelling, AI, and mental health — Purple Stage, Thursday 15:30 – 15:50 Our next session takes a more introspective turn. Emmy-nominated storyteller, futurist, and presenter Jason Silva will take us not to the deal books of VCs or the frontiers of tech but to the intersection of AI art and psychedelic therapies.      Silva, the host of National Geographic’s hit TV show Brain Games, will show how  AI-generated psychedelic films can lead you on an adventure to the inner depths of your consciousness.  This session will be a fast‑paced mix of philosophy, live performance, and vivid media that invites you to embrace AI as a partner in healing, play, and reimagining yourself. Hold on tight — this promises to be one hell of a trip!   4. Quantum race: Can Europe secure leadership in quantum? — Green Stage, Thursday 11:30 – 11:55 From psychedelics, we’re now entering the equally bizarre realm of quantum mechanics. It’s a world where matter can exist in multiple states at once, particles can be entangled across vast distances, and the rules of classical physics go right out the window. Quantum computing, which looks to exploit these strange phenomena to make potentially world-changing calculations, is fast becoming one of the most competitive frontiers in tech. Startups and governments around the world are scrambling for pole position. But the big question is: can Europe take the lead? In this session, Jan Goetz, co-founder and CEO of Munich-based quantum scaleup IQM, joins Tom Henriksson, general partner at VC firm OpenOcean, to tackle that very question. They’ll explore the breakthroughs Europe needs in quantum hardware, networks, and infrastructure — and what it’ll take to stay in the race as global competition heats up. 5. DEI or Die: Why startups can’t afford to opt out — Purple Stage, Friday 15:00 – 15:30  Whether you’re building a deep tech powerhouse or trying to crack quantum code, most industry experts agree that every tech startup ought to foster a diverse workforce. But those efforts — coined under the umbrella term Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) — have been faltering as of late. Just this year, several major tech firms, including Meta and Amazon, rolled back their DEI programs amid a broader shift in the West to more conservative politics.  Against this concerning backdrop, a group of tech insiders and DEI champions will debate why startups should continue to pursue inclusive strategies and what that looks like in today’s world.  This session will feature Matthijs Welle, CEO of Dutch hospitality unicorn Mews; Raashi Sikka, chief diversity, inclusion, accessibility, and social impact officer at Ubisoft; Constantijn Van Oranje, special envoy at TechLeap;and Ingrid Tappin, CEO and founder of Diverse Leaders in Tech.  6. Are we there yet? Launching the EU’s space ambitions — Purple Stage, Friday 16:35 – 16:55 Speaking of representation in tech, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe — the first Black woman to travel on a commercial space flight — will also be gracing the stage at TNW this year. Bowe will discuss developments in Europe. With the EU reclaiming sovereign access to space last year, the continent’s spacetech scene is buzzing with renewed ambition. Harnessing this momentum, could we be on the brink of a European space renaissance? This session will explore cutting-edge innovations, bold projects, and the key challenges shaping the future of Europe’s spacetech ecosystem.  7. A drink with an F-bomb killer — VIP Lounge, Friday 11:15 – 11:45 Finally, we’re heading to Hollywood with British film director turned tech founder Scott Mann.   Mann is the mastermind behind several action flicks, including Heist, Final Score, and Tournament. He’s also the founder of Flawless, a startup pioneering photo-realistic AI edits for films — which includes removing F-bombs from scenes without having to reshoot them.   Mann will share behind-the-scenes Hollywood stories, insights on building cutting-edge startups, and his vision for AI’s future in entertainment — all over a drink. So whether it’s psychedelic trips, space travel, quantum computing or the future of deep tech as we know it, these sessions promise to ignite your curiosity, challenge your perspective, and showcase the bold ideas shaping tomorrow.
