  "description": "Meta is deleting links to Pixelfed, a decentralized, open-source Instagram competitor, labeling them as \"spam\" on Facebook and removing them immediately. 404 Media reports: Pixelfed is an open-source, community funded and decentralized image sharing platform that runs on Activity Pub, which is the same technology that supports Mastodon and other federated services. Pixelfed.social is the largest Pixelfed server, which was launched in 2018 but has gained renewed attention over the last week. Bluesky user AJ Sadauskas originally posted that links to Pixelfed were being deleted by Meta; 404 Media then also tried to post a link to Pixelfed on Facebook. It was immediately deleted. Pixelfed has seen a surge in user signups in recent days, after Meta announced it is ending fact-checking and removing restrictions on speech across its platforms. Daniel Supernault, the creator of Pixelfed, published a \"declaration of fundamental rights and principles for ethical digital platforms, ensuring privacy, dignity, and fairness in online spaces.\" The open source charter contains sections titled \"right to privacy,\" \"freedom from surveillance,\" \"safeguards against hate speech,\" \"strong protections for vulnerable communities,\" and \"data portability and user agency.\" \"Pixelfed is a lot of things, but one thing it is not, is an opportunity for VC or others to ruin the vibe. I've turned down VC funding and will not inject advertising of any form into the project,\" Supernault wrote on Mastodon. \"Pixelfed is for the people, period.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
