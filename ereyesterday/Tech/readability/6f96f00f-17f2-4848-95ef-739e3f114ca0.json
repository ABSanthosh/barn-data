With NordVPN, you can also block ads and malware, ensuring total protection across all devices. Things like this sound opulent – but they aren’t! NordVPN has launched a spring sale that allows you to save up to 77% and spend as little as $3.09/mo on 27 months of VPN-powered protection. The provider offers four plans, all packed with cutting-edge features, modern technology, and thousands of worldwide servers. If you’re considering buying a VPN, now is a good time to act — this sale is temporary! See offer at NordVPN Protect Your Digital Footprint With NordVPN NordVPN comes with state-of-the-art 256-bit encryption. It’s one of the most impressive Double VPN providers, as well. Thanks to this feature, it encrypts your connection twice, making you untraceable online. NordVPN offers another perk — an automatic kill switch. It acts when the VPN connection breaks, shutting down your internet connection to prevent data leaks. In-built IP/DNS leak protection is here, plus RAM servers. The VPN takes advantage of obfuscation, which lets you overcome censorship and make the VPN work in China. Furthermore, its no-log policy audited by multiple cybersecurity firms guarantees rock-solid privacy. This, paired with Perfect Forward Secrecy and in-house DNS servers, shields you from the negative influence of data brokers and advertisers. Best of all, NordVPN can block ads and malware with Threat Protection Pro. With this feature, you’re virtually getting a 2-in-1 bundle. A VPN plus full-on malware protection on all platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Android — on 10 devices simultaneously. Save Big on the 2-Year Plans (Up to 77%) NordVPN recently launched a new campaign in which it discounted its 24-month plans by 72% to 77% and introduced 3 extra months. Each plan saw a massive price nosedive, so the current lineup is: Basic at $3.09/mo, 72% off Plus at $3.99/mo, 73% off Complete at $4.99/mo, 72% off Prime at $6.99/mo, 77% off The Basic plan gets you only NordVPN, which is by no means bad — however, it doesn’t block ads and malware. We recommend the Plus plan, which includes Threat Protection Pro and NordPass. © NordVPN What about Complete? You’ll get everything from Plus, with NordLocker’s 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage. Lastly, the Prime plan, which is a whopping 77% off, includes NordProtect to sweeten up this springtime deal.
