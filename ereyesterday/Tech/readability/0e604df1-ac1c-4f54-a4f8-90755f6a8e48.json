  "text": "Marvel's fighting game legacy is reborn in 'Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls,' coming next year. PlayStation’s State of Play livestream brought exciting news for fans of Marvel’s fighting games, with a surprising twist. Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls—arriving in 2026 for PC and PS5—is coming not from Capcom, developer of so many past Marvel games in the genre, but instead from a different Japanese company, Arc System Works (Guilty Gear, BlazBlue). Also of note, the game is a 4v4 tag-team fighter, and features some snazzy tokusatsu-inspired designs for its large roster of familiar characters. The announcement trailer touting the collaboration between PlayStation Studios, Arc System Works, and Marvel Games gives you some eye candy to go with those details: PlayStation’s official blog offers a few more details beyond that incredibly fun and high-energy teaser video: ”Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters,” explained game director and lead battle designer Kazuto Sekine. “But for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game. We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together—creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience.” Those characters, the teaser and the blog post confirm, include Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes). They will each feature “a bespoke set of Normal, Special, and Unique attacks inspired by their abilities and powers in Marvel lore,” with special consideration given to the game’s format as a specifically 4v4 tag-team fighter. Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls arrives next year. Will you be checking out based on this first extended glimpse? Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
