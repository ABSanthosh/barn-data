  "description": "Google's annual I/O developer conference is coming on May 20, and for the first time, there's two major events you'll want to watch to stay on top of all the updates the company's making to its software platforms. I/O 2025 kicks off on May 20, and a week earlier on May 13, there's also The Android Show: I/O Edition, a dedicated showcase for the Android ecosystem. The Android Show: I/O Edition airs on May 13 at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Android is developed partially in the open, so there's already some indication of what could be coming with Android 16. So far, that's a visual redesign of some of the operating system's core features, like the notification shade, a take on Apple's Live Activities for tracking ongoing events and possibly a Samsung DeX-like \"Desktop Mode\" for Android phones. I/O 2025 starts on May 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM PT with Google's keynote, typically a series of updates on Android, Search, Google Workspace and Gemini. It's worth noting: Google typically doesn't set aside separate time for Android announcements. The company said there will be some Android news at I/O, but the safe bet is that Gemini will be the star. We expect Google to share Gemini updates, along with Android XR news and maybe further demonstrations of experimental projects like Project Astra. Google's I/O keynote will be available to watch on Google's YouTube channel and right here once the livestream is up on May 20 at 1PM ET.Â  The Android Show: I/O Edition will air on Google's Android YouTube channel on May 13 at 1PM ET, and since it appears to be pre-recorded, we've already embedded it above.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/how-to-watch-google-io-2025-and-the-android-show-213327054.html?src=rss",
