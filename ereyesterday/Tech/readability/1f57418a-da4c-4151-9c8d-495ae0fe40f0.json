Reviews ethics statement The next-gen Switch console has many physical changes, but that doesn't mean you'll have to get rid of all your gear for the original Switch. Nintendo detailed the highly anticipated Switch 2 on Wednesday. We still have to wait a few more months before we can actually get our hands on it -- June 5, to be precise -- but that gives us plenty of time to make sure we have all the extra accessories we'll need. On the upside, many of the accessories for the original Nintendo Switch will work with the Switch 2, but some important ones won't.Controllers From the January reveal trailer, a Joy-Con comparison between the Switch 1 (left) and Switch 2. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNETJoy-ConThe Switch 2 will come with its own set of updated Joy-Cons, but you can still use the original ones. They won't attach physically to the Switch 2, as the new Joy-Cons are larger and attach magnetically, but you can pair the original Joy-Cons wirelessly. That way, you can still play with your family and friends without buying extras.Pro Controller Sarah Tew/CNETNintendo's excellent Pro Controller also got an upgrade for the Switch 2, but as with the Joy-Cons, the original Pro Controller will work fine with the Switch 2. It will pair wirelessly with the console and can be charged via a USB cable from the Switch 2 dock. The new Pro will have some decent upgrades, like enlarged buttons and triggers, GameCube-esque ergonomics, and programmable back paddles, but it will also cost $80, so if you don't feel you need to upgrade, you won't have to.Other Nintendo controllersNintendo also clarified that all the wireless versions of the NES, SNES, N64 and Sega Genesis controllers will work wirelessly with the Switch 2. However, it also said that not every game would be compatible, but we don't know yet which games those would be. It's probably safe to assume all games supporting those controllers (also compatible with the Switch 2) would work, but we'll update this once we know more. Third-party controllersThis is the big question mark at the moment. We have not been able to confirm anything from either Nintendo or other controller manufacturers if third-party controllers will work with the Switch 2. I assume that since the original Pro Controller will work with the Switch 2, at the very least, officially licensed third-party controllers will work, but as of publish time, we have not had any confirmation about support for third-party controllers on the Switch 2. One vendor I spoke with confirmed it is currently in talks with Nintendo about compatibility but couldn't share any details. MicroSD cardsOne of the biggest (and most welcome) upgrades to the Switch 2 is an 8x increase in internal storage from 32GB to 256GB. That means a microSD is no longer an immediate must-have accessory. That's also good because not every microSD card that worked with the original Switch will work with the Switch 2.Nintendo specified that only microSD Express cards will work with Switch 2. You can still view screenshots and videos from your non-Express microSD cards, but you won't be able to save or load games or save data to them. You can tell if your microSD card is Express because it will have a little EX printed on it.  NintendoBluetooth headphonesThe original Nintendo Switch infamously did not have Bluetooth capabilities, so you had to plug in headphones or buy an adapter. Nintendo remedied this with updated Switch versions and kept that functionality for the Switch 2. That means all your favorite Bluetooth headphones should work just fine with your new Switch 2.Docks Nintendo/Screenshot by CNETThe Switch 2 dock is also getting a big upgrade. It's larger with rounded corners and now supports 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, a welcome upgrade for a modern game console. That being said, for households with multiple Switch consoles and TVs, you may not want to buy extra Switch 2 docks to use around your home. However, Nintendo confirmed that the original Switch Dock is incompatible with the Switch 2, which also means it's likely the original Switch will not work in the Switch 2 Dock. Third-party docksSeveral docks not made by Nintendo work just fine with the first-generation Switch, so there's no reason to expect they would not be compatible with the Switch 2 as long as they provide adequate power. However, once again, we've not had any confirmation, so we can't say for sure. Chargers, cables and adaptersChargersThe first-generation Switch was notoriously fickle with non-Nintendo chargers, particularly when docked, and the Switch 2 looks likely to continue that trend. The Switch 2 has a different power input from the original Switch so that the original Switch charger won't work for TV mode with the Switch 2. You can still charge the Switch 2 with it by plugging it in directly, but that's it. We also don't know anything about third-party chargers for the Switch 2 yet. There were several that worked perfectly fine with the original Switch, but we don't yet know the power draw of the Switch 2, so we can't say for sure which chargers will work. Hopefully, we'll find out more closer to launch, but for right now, the only charger that we know will work for TV mode with the Switch 2 is the charger that comes with it. CablesThe Switch 2 most likely supports HDMI 2.1, which means the HDMI cable that came with the original Switch won't work. Nintendo has confirmed as much, though, as with most other accessories, it hasn't given specifics as to whether third-party HDMI cables will work or not. We'll have to wait to find out. The Switch 2 will have an HDMI cable, so at least there's that. AdaptersNintendo has confirmed that the only adapter that works with the Switch 2 is the GameCube Controller adapter. This lets you connect a wired GameCube controller to the Switch Dock, and Nintendo says it can be used in TV mode while connected to a Switch 2 Dock. We don't know anything else about any other adapters at this time. Nintendo did give us quite a lot of information about the Switch 2 today, including the price, most of the key upgrades, and the launch date, but as you can see, there's still a lot we don't know. We'll continue to update this list and our other coverage of the Nintendo Switch 2 as we learn more.",

That being said, for households with multiple Switch consoles and TVs, you may not want to buy extra Switch 2 docks to use around your home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Nintendo confirmed that the original Switch Dock is incompatible with the Switch 2, which also means it\u0026#39;s likely the original Switch will not work in the Switch 2 Dock. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThird-party docks\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral docks not made by Nintendo work just fine with the first-generation Switch, so there\u0026#39;s no reason to expect they would not be compatible with the Switch 2 as long as they provide adequate power. However, once again, we\u0026#39;ve not had any confirmation, so we can\u0026#39;t say for sure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChargers, cables and adapters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eChargers\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first-generation Switch was notoriously fickle with non-Nintendo chargers, particularly when docked, and the Switch 2 looks likely to continue that trend. The Switch 2 has a different power input from the original Switch so that the original Switch charger won\u0026#39;t work for TV mode with the Switch 2. You can still charge the Switch 2 with it by plugging it in directly, but that\u0026#39;s it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also don\u0026#39;t know anything about third-party chargers for the Switch 2 yet. There were several that worked perfectly fine with the original Switch, but we don\u0026#39;t yet know the power draw of the Switch 2, so we can\u0026#39;t say for sure which chargers will work. Hopefully, we\u0026#39;ll find out more closer to launch, but for right now, the only charger that we know will work for TV mode with the Switch 2 is the charger that comes with it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCables\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Switch 2 most likely supports HDMI 2.1, which means the HDMI cable that came with the original Switch won\u0026#39;t work. Nintendo has confirmed as much, though, as with most other accessories, it hasn\u0026#39;t given specifics as to whether third-party HDMI cables will work or not. We\u0026#39;ll have to wait to find out. The Switch 2 will have an HDMI cable, so at least there\u0026#39;s that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAdapters\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNintendo has confirmed that the only adapter that works with the Switch 2 is the GameCube Controller adapter. This lets you connect a wired GameCube controller to the Switch Dock, and Nintendo says it can be used in TV mode while connected to a Switch 2 Dock. We don\u0026#39;t know anything else about any other adapters at this time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNintendo did give us quite a lot of information about the Switch 2 today, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-priced-at-450-coming-june-5/\" target=\"_self\"\u003ethe price\u003c/a\u003e, most of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/switch-2-specs-vs-switch-1-specs-how-nintendos-consoles-compare/\" target=\"_self\"\u003ekey upgrades\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news-live/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-updates/\" target=\"_self\"\u003elaunch date\u003c/a\u003e, but as you can see, there\u0026#39;s still a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/nintendo-switch-2-what-we-didnt-get-during-nintendo-direct-2025/\" target=\"_self\"\u003elot we don\u0026#39;t know\u003c/a\u003e.
