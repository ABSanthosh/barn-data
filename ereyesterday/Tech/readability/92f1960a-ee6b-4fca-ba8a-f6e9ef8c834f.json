  "description": "Google Fiber has confirmed that it has started construction in Las Vegas and Clark County, with its fiber internet service expected to be available \"later this year.\" The Verge reports: On Wednesday, Google also confirmed that it's piloting simplified, \"lifestyle-based\" plans in Alabama and Tennesee, which were first spotted last month. The new $70 / month Core 1 Gig, $100 / month Home 3 Gig, and $150 / month Edge 8 Gig plans replace the 1 Gig, 2 Gig, 5 Gig, and 8 Gig plans that GFiber widely offers. These new plans are also launching in all of the locations where GFiber is currently available in Arizona and North Carolina, GFiber spokesperson Sunny Gettinger tells The Verge. They're coming to most of GFiber's remaining cities within the next month, too. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
