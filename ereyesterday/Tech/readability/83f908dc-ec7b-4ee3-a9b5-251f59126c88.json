  "text": "See today's mail from within the app instead of buried in your inbox. Credit: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com I'm a big fan of the USPS' \"Informed Delivery\" option. When you enroll, the USPS will send you daily emails that show all mail and packages you're set to receive that day. (The mail scans arrive in grayscale, address-side only.) If you like to be surprised every time you open your mailbox, it's not the service for you. But for the rest of us, it's a helpful way to keep an eye on the day's incoming mail. Now, the USPS is expanding the feature, working on a dedicated Informed Delivery app. The app will send you push notifications whenever you have new mail and packages on the way, and will let you share the status of packages with other people. If you sent a friend a package, for example, you could pass along the tracking information from within the app.It seems to be a similar experience as the traditional emailed Informed Delivery, only presented in an app UI. (Though the push notifications are a nice touch, especially since more often than not, my daily Informed Delivery emails get lost in my Gmail inbox.)The thing is, you won't find this Informed Delivery app in your iPhone or Android's app stores, as the USPS is still working on it. But if you're intrigued by the app, there is a way to test it out early—assuming the beta isn't full by the time you sign up. What do you think so far? How to enroll in the USPS Informed Delivery app betaAt this time, the iPhone beta is full. However, you can check on the status from the app's TestFlight page. If the beta ever has an open spot, you'll see \"View in App Store\" instead of \"This beta is full.\"If you use an Android, you can still try out the app prior to launch. On your Android device, follow this link, sign in with your Google Account (if you aren't signed in already), then choose \"Accept Invite\" or \"Joining this group.\" Tap \"Join group\" on the following page, which will take you to a new screen with a link to download the Informed Delivery app. Tap the link, then install the app when prompted.
