  "description": "There are a bunch of deals on consoles and video games for Black Friday. But even if you buy physical copies, current-gen consoles require that games be fully installed onto internal storage to minimize loading times. If you have a lot of games, you may want to have extra storage space. As such, Xbox Series X/S owners may wish to consider picking up Seagate's storage expansion card. The 2TB variant is on sale at the moment. It has dropped to a near-record low of $200 for Black Friday. That's 46 percent off the regular price. Seagate's version is one of our picks for the best Xbox Series X/S accessories. The 2TB version should give you ample space — at least until you start filling it up with all of the huge Call of Duty games that have started hitting Game Pass. Let's face it, proprietary storage stinks, but the choice for Series X/S owners looking for more space is largely between Seagate's Storage Expansion Card and WD's Black C50. It's possible to store Series X/S games on a regular external drive, but you'll need to move them to internal storage or an expansion card anyway to actually play them. If you don't want to deal with shifting large files around and waiting for transfers to complete, or you don't want to delete and download games more than is necessary, an expansion card is the way to go. Check out all of the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals here.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/xbox-black-friday-deal-get-the-seagate-2tb-expansion-card-for-200-180119041.html?src=rss",
