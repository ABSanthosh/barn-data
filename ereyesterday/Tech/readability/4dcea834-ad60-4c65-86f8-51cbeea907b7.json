  "text": "The Masters of the Universe movie has found someone for Nicholas Galitzine to beat up: the Hollywood Reporter has word that Jared Leto has signed up to play legendary He-Man baddie Skeletor in Travis Knight’s long-in-the-making take on the beloved animated series/toy advertisement. Leto joins a host of villainous casting announcements for the film to fill out not just Skeletor himself, but a veritable host of the dark sorcerer’s cronies, too. Alongside the previously announced Alison Brie as Evil-Lyn, Skeletor’s second-in-command, Sam C. Wilson will play Trap Jaw, the cyborg warrior with a fearsome bite; Hafthor Bjornsson will play Goat Man, a beastly subordinate of, well, Beast Man; and Kojo Attach will play Tri-Klops, the multi-eyed spymaster who uses his different visions to snoop on the Masters of the Universe for Skeletor. It’s a major boost to the villainous side of Knight’s take on the world of Eternia, which has already set Riverdale‘s Camilla Mendes and Idris Elba as two of Prince Adam’s closest allies, Teela and Man-at-Arms, respectively. But now we’re perhaps more intrigued about what absurd method approach Leto will bring to playing a guy with a skull for a head than anything else Masters of the Universe might throw at us before its June 5, 2026 release date.
