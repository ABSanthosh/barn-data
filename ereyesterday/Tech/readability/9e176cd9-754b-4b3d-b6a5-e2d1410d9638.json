  "text": "Even before we first saw a trailer or learned about its cast, expectations for James Gunn’s Superman movie were sky-high. As the starting point for a new slate of DC projects, and the first solo movie for the superhero in over a decade, everyone knows there’s a lot of pressure here. To help celebrate Superman Day—the character debuted April 18, 1938 in Action Comics #1—and to build up hype, Warner Bros. released a featurette for the upcoming film. If you’re invested in the movie’s production, the video is worth looking at, but its bigger point is to show how much the cast and producer Peter Safran believe in Gunn. Rachel Brosnahan, Lois Lane herself, saying “In James Gunn we trust!” at the end couldn’t be any clearer and is already a sentiment in some spaces. Just about everyone’s coming into Superman with excitement or some curiosity about Gunn’s aims. For its stars, this movie gave them the opportunity to work with a filmmaker who they’ve teamed with previously or whose output they just enjoy: both Nathan Fillion (Guy Gardner) and Nicholas Hoult (Lex Luthor) praised Gunn’s writing and the “heart” found in his earlier movies. Others signed on because they’re fans of Superman himself and dig whatever Gunn’s got cooking now or in the future. Fillion, Edi Gathegi (Mr. Terrific), and Frank Grillo (Rick Flag Sr.) talk up its potential greatness, with Grillo proudly predicting it will be a “game changer.” We’ll see if Superman achieves that status when it hits theaters on July 11.
