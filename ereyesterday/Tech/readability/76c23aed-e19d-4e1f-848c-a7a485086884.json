  "description": "According to the Washington Post (paywalled), the Trump administration plans to eliminate the Energy Star program -- a long-standing EPA initiative that has saved Americans over $500 billion in energy costs since 1992. \"The organization states that the average American saves about $450 per year on energy bills by choosing appliances that have been Energy Star-certified,\" adds Engadget. From the report: The EPA hasn't said when this would go into effect and when consumers would stop seeing Energy Star certifications on home appliances. It's technically illegal for a presidential administration to end this program without Congress, but the same goes for many of Trump's pronouncements and executive orders. \"Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration's promise to reduce household energy costs,\" Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN. \"For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That's a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
