Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: OneAir Travel deals can be hit or miss as prices jump around and deals disappear before you can check your schedule. The OneAir Elite Lifetime Subscription is designed to do the heavy lifting for you. A members-only deal-alert service, it tracks flight prices using AI, scans for mistake fares, and alerts you when there’s a significant drop—and currently, it's on StackSocial for $99.99 (originally $790), but apply the promo code FLY30 and you can get it for just $70. The sale runs until March 30.OneAir’s coverage is broad, spanning 60+ countries and multiple fare classes, including premium economy and business. That’s useful if you’re flexible with your routes and don’t mind hopping on an unexpected deal. It even includes hidden city fares, which can sometimes cut costs significantly. The biggest advantage here is that OneAir does the searching for you, so that you’re not spending hours checking flights manually. However, travelers with strict schedules or those who only fly specific airlines may not always get the most value. Some of the best deals require booking fast, so it works best for those ready to jump on an opportunity.At $70 for lifetime access, it’s cheaper than most annual flight deal subscriptions, and if you book even one discounted flight using its alerts, it could pay for itself in one trip. That said, it won’t magically make every flight cheaper—deals depend on availability and timing. If you like tracking flights yourself or only travel occasionally, free services like Google Flights or Skyscanner alerts might be enough. But if you want to save money without the hassle, this could be a solid tool to have. Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.
