  "text": "The tech giant opens a retro restaurant in Hollywood with charging stations. Musk says more could open in other cities. Eat Here and Get Recharged: Tesla Opens a Drive-in Diner Tesla has launched a retro-inspired drive-in diner that doubles as an electric vehicle charging station.The electric-vehicle company, known more for self-driving cars and its headline-making CEO Elon Musk, announced its drive-in diner at located at 7001 West Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood, California, is open for business. The place also serves as an electric vehicle charging station with 80 V4 Supercharger stalls, \"making it the largest urban Supercharging station in the world,\" according to the diner's website. But while you wait, you can nosh on a cup of Waygu beef chili with the fam from the diner or the comfort of your vehicle (maybe save the chili for in-restaurant dining to avoid any nasty spills). You don't have to drive a Tesla to eat there -- the charger stalls are open to all NACS-compatible EVs -- but you do need your Tesla touchscreen to order ahead and see what's playing next on one of the two 66-foot LED megascreens the two-story diner sports.The diner touts a \"retro-futuristic\" menu, with a typical array of diner-inspired food, although at a premium price. Tech reporter Sawyer Merritt shared the menu prices, which include $13 for a hot dog and $15 for fried chicken and waffles. The diner is open 24 hours, offering breakfast options including breakfast tacos for $9 and avocado toast for $11.Musk said in a post on X that if the first foray proves a success, more diners could be coming to other cities around the world. CNET first reported in 2021 on Tesla's application for a patent for the Tesla name for use on goods and services, which included restaurants.
