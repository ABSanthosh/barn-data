  "description": "Cybersecurity researchers have flagged three malicious npm packages that target the macOS version of AI-powered code-editing tool Cursor, reports The Hacker News: \"Disguised as developer tools offering 'the cheapest Cursor API,' these packages steal user credentials, fetch an encrypted payload from threat actor-controlled infrastructure, overwrite Cursor's main.js file, and disable auto-updates to maintain persistence,\" Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko said. All three packages continue to be available for download from the npm registry. \"Aiide-cur\" was first published on February 14, 2025... In total, the three packages have been downloaded over 3,200 times to date.... The findings point to an emerging trend where threat actors are using rogue npm packages as a way to introduce malicious modifications to other legitimate libraries or software already installed on developer systems... \"By operating inside a legitimate parent process — an IDE or shared library — the malicious logic inherits the application's trust, maintains persistence even after the offending package is removed, and automatically gains whatever privileges that software holds, from API tokens and signing keys to outbound network access,\" Socket told The Hacker News. \"This campaign highlights a growing supply chain threat, with threat actors increasingly using malicious patches to compromise trusted local software,\" Boychenko said. The npm packages \"restart the application so that the patched code takes effect,\" letting the threat actor \"execute arbitrary code within the context of the platform.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
