  "description": "Amazon's Zoox said it has issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis after a crash in Las Vegas last month. CNBC reports: The recall surrounds a defect with the vehicle's automated driving system that could cause it to inaccurately predict the movement of another car, increasing \"the risk of a crash,\" according to a report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on May 1. Zoox submitted the recall after an April 8 incident in Las Vegas in which an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle, the NHTSA report states. There were no injuries in the crash and only minor damage occurred to both vehicles. \"After analysis and rigorous testing, Zoox identified the root cause,\" the company said in a blog post. \"We issued a software update that was implemented across all Zoox vehicles. All Zoox vehicles on the road today, including our purpose-built robotaxi and test fleet, have the updated software.\" Zoox paused all driverless vehicle operations while it reviewed the incident. It has since resumed operations after rolling out the software update. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
