Assassins' cabal The Order and someone named X will be causing trouble. Dr. Stone: Science Future (cour 2)As this story starts to wind down, things get more dangerous for Senku and the team as they venture through the Americas. Whether he succeeds in trying to rebuild civilization remains to be seen, because gathering the necessary resources from those overseeing them will prove to be challenging. When the show returns July 10 to Crunchyroll, watch to see if science conquers certification.   Motoo Nakanishi/Futabasha/Kijin Gentosho Project The second cour for Sword of the Demon Hunter: Kijin Gentoushou will hit HiDive sometime this summer, after its initial debut this past spring.
