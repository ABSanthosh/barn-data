  "description": "In what was probably an inevitable conclusion, X has announced that it will allow AI to author Community Notes. With a pilot program beginning today, the social network is releasing developer tools to create AI Note Writers. These tools will be limited to penning replies in a test mode and will need approval before their notes can be released into the wild. The first AI Note Writers will be accepted later this month, which is when the AI-composed notes will start appearing to users. \"Not only does this have the potential to accelerate the speed and scale of Community Notes, rating feedback from the community can help develop AI agents that deliver increasingly accurate, less biased, and broadly helpful information — a powerful feedback loop,\" the post announcing this feature said. Sounds great. Assuming it works. The AI Note Writers will be assessed by \"an open-source, automated note evaluator\" that assesses whether the composition is on-topic and whether it would be seen as harassment or abuse. The evaluator's decisions are based \"on historical input from Community Notes contributors.\" Despite the announcement's insistence of \"humans still in charge,\" it seems the only human editorial eye comes from the ratings on notes. Once the AI-written notes are active, they will be labeled as such as a transparency measure. AI will only be allowed to offer notes on posts that have requested a Community Note at the start, but the company is positioning AI Note Writers as having a larger future role in this fact-checking system.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-will-let-ai-write-community-notes-220130039.html?src=rss",
