  "description": "\"Every single one of the top ten box office hits of 2024 was a sequel, a remake... or a prequel,\" writes The Hollywood Reporter. Here's the list of 2024's top-grossing films published by the movie blog SlashFilm: 10. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice 9. Venom: The Last Dance 8. Kung Fu Panda 4 7. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 6. Wicked 5. Dune: Part Two 4. Moana 2 3. Despicable Me 4 2. Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine 1. Inside Out 2 2024 was the year Godzilla celebrated its 70th year as a franchise — but it wasn't the only long-running franchise. \"When the Marvel Cinematic Universe went R-rated with Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine... it was literally more successful than any other R-rated movie in history,\" SlashFilm points out, while Venom: The Last Dance was the year's 9th highest-earner. (But several other big superhero movies flopped and \"the misses outweighed the hits this year, while DC sat it out entirely as the world waits for Superman to usher in James Gunn's new DC Universe.\") They also marvel that Wicked earned $572 million after opening on the same day as Ridley Scott's Gladiator II.... But in the end SlashFilm describes 2024 as \"a banner year for animation,\" with computer-animated movies filling four of the top ten spots (Kung Fu Panda 4, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4, and Inside Out 2). And another interesting trend? Though the world flocked to Tim Burton's first sequel to Beetlejuice after 36 years, Warner Bros. was, \"at one point, pushing for Beetlejuice 2 to go directly to streaming on Max.\" And Disney original had the same idea for Moana 2, leading SlashFilm to conclude that 2024's box office \"should be the death of the big direct-to-streaming movie.\" SlashFilm notes that Disney also sent several Pixar originals to Disney+ between 2020 and 2022, which \"did immeasurable damage to the brand, something that even CEO Bob Iger has acknowledged.\" And then after a theatrical debut Pixar's Inside Out 2 became \"the eighth biggest movie ever at the box office, with $1.698 billion to its name\" — and the highest-grossing animated film ever made. And Dune: Part Two? Denis Villeneuve accomplished nothing shy of a miracle with 2021's \"Dune,\" an adaptation of Frank Herbert's cherished sci-fi novel that was faithful to the material, massive in scale, but still felt like an auteur film... The only downside? 2021 was a terrible time to release a movie, particularly a Warner Bros. movie, as all of the studio's films were going to HBO Max the same day they hit theaters. Yet, \"Dune\" made $400 million in its original run, which was enough to justify a sequel. Evidently, the audience for this franchise grew exponentially in the years before \"Dune: Part Two\" hit theaters in early March... All told, Villeneuve's sweeping, epic sequel pulled in $714.4 million worldwide, all while garnering tons of acclaim once again. Also, not for nothing, Villeneuve got it made for less than $200 million... Without \"Dune: Part Two\" making what it made, the box office might have been in truly dire shape. As a relatively dead April and very weak May followed, this overperformance helped keep theaters afloat until greener pastures arrived in the back half of the year. The Spice must flow, as it were. The Hollywood Reporter offers another take on the significance of 2024: Total domestic box office revenue appears to be heading toward around $8 billion, down from 2023's exhilarating post-COVID turnaround of $9 billion, but the National Association of Theatre Owners prefers to accentuate the positive, attributing the dip to a shortage of product due to the labor strikes and taking encouragement from the renewal of the movie habit... Interestingly, or thankfully, the cinematic universes of Marvel, DC, and Star Wars failed to expand: except for Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, not one of the huge hits came from a comic book franchise or a galaxy far, far away. The article then complains about people using their phones during the movie for texting, talking, and photographing the movie itself. (Though it applauds a PSA against the practice in which Deadpool and Wolverine \"delivered the message in laudably blunt terms.\") And on Wikipedia, Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine and Dune: Part Two were the eighth and 23rd most popular articles of 2024.
