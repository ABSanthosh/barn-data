  "text": "Apple outlines upcoming child safety improvements a new white paper. Credit: Gabby Jones / Bloomberg via Getty Images Apple is upgrading its app safety offerings later this year, including new age assurance policies intended to wade into the online child protection debate.According to a recently published white paper, the company plans to expand its Child Account settings, App Store Age Ranges, and provide avenues for app developers to set more comprehensive age-restriction settings for minor users. \"Protecting kids — whether they’re young children, preteens, or teenagers — from online threats requires constant vigilance and effort. The digital world is increasingly complex and the risks to families are ever-changing, including the proliferation of age-inappropriate content and excessive time on social media and other platforms,\" writes Apple. \"For years, Apple has supported specialized Apple accounts for kids — called Child Accounts — that enable parents to manage the many parental controls we offer, and help provide an age-appropriate experience for children under the age of 13. These accounts are the bedrock of all the child safety tools that we offer today.\"Age range for developers Launching later this year, Apple's new privacy-driven Declared Range API allows developers to request an approximate age range for Child Account users, approved by parents, that can then be used to better tailor app experiences and set access limits for age-restricted apps. Minor users would be prompted with a \"share age range\" notification, similar to pop-ups for App Tracking or Location Services, and can be turned off at any time. Developers can still choose to have their apps require government identification, but ID will not be required to use the App Store at large.The policy represents a significant stance taken by Apple amid a flurry of industry debate around \"age assurance\" or verification. Politicians and tech leaders have offered mixed ideas about the most effective, and appropriate, way to verify the ages of young users across social media platforms and other digital spaces, including app marketplaces. Many, like Meta, argue that app marketplaces should be held responsible for connecting minors to platforms that host age-restricted or harmful content. State legislatures, backed by tech companies, have proposed various age verification laws — their effectiveness is widely debated. Mashable Light Speed Politicians have introduced legislation tackling the issue from the lenses of digital privacy, as well, while others have suggested outright bans on minors accessing certain online spaces. The Kids Online Safety Act, proposed in 2023, would require online platforms to enable the strongest privacy settings for all underage users, and place a \"duty of care\" on social media companies, specifically. Apple, conversely, is arguing for a policy that places the burden on app developers, not marketplaces, and minimizes data collection. \"Some apps may find it appropriate or even legally required to use age verification, which confirms user age with a high level of certainty — often through collecting a user’s sensitive personal information (like a government issued ID) — to keep kids away from inappropriate content. But most apps don’t. That’s why the right place to address the dangers of age-restricted content online is the limited set of websites and apps that host that kind of content.\" Managing youth accounts and app access Apple's updates will also incorporate age ranges into a more streamlined Child Account set-up process, as well, making it easier for parents to determine child safety settings for required users (those 13 and younger), as well as voluntarily-included accounts for device owners under the age of 18. During device set up, parents and guardians can choose from pre-selected safety settings categorized by age range or use default child settings— this makes it possible for young users to set up devices on their own, with the aid of Apple's oversight. Parents can still adjust and customize settings at a later date.To accommodate these new settings, Apple's age ranges will get more specific, with new thresholds for apps including:4+ years old9+ years old13+ years old16+ years old18+ years oldAlong these same lines, Apple will also expand its content visibility restrictions for youth accounts, preventing apps outside of selected age ratings from appearing in devices' Today, Games, and Apps tabs, and editorial stories and collections.
