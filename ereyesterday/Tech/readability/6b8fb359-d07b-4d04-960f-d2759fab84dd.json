  "text": "Over the past few years, Yellowjackets has become one of the most surprising and talked about shows out there. The Showtime mystery, about a group of friends who crashed and survived in the wilderness as children, had a massive breakout first season followed by a solid, but slightly less revered second season. Now, in a new interview, one of the show’s co-creators, Ashley Lyle, promises season three will deliver on things fans have been asking about a while. “This season is really when we start bringing those pieces together,” Lyle told Vanity Fair. “It is very satisfying to have elements of this season that were planned from the very beginning. I cannot get into specifics, I wish I could, but there are a couple of big things in this season that were in the very initial pitches before we even took it out to networks, that we’ve finally got the chance to execute and to play out. The satisfaction of having something in your brains for that long and finally having it come to pass is very exciting.” Obviously Lyle is careful about not getting into specifics. The biggest mysteries though, especially ones that would’ve been part of this show’s DNA, are about what happened in the woods. Questions like who sided with who? How did they survive? What belief systems were adopted? Who was the leader and who was sacrificed? Season two answered some of that but many questions are still on the table. Apparently that will change in season three. “We are going to learn more about what happened in the wilderness that they are so afraid of coming out,” Lyle said. “We hope it will be both satisfying and at times unexpected. And I think that we have found ourselves—let me think of how to say this. [Pause] The stakes are pretty high in the present-day storyline, perhaps in a way that they did not feel in season two, and that was really exciting for us to delve into.” Of course, the subtext in that answer is any answers provided in the show will just raise more questions. But, again, Lyle cops to at least one hard, true fact about season three: “There are at least two very big questions with very clear answers,” she said. Hey, we’ll take two. Especially if it’s regarding the society and beliefs that developed in the woods. Everyone just thought the secret was cannibalism and, well, season two blew that out of the water by tackling it directly. We are anxiously awaiting more mysteries, more suspects, and finally some answers. Read more from Lyle over at Vanity Fair and check out some exclusive images taken for the publication. The images, which pair the actors playing the same character in both timelines, have been specifically crafted to tease things about this season. A season which, Lyle says, will feature some figurative, and literal, overlap. Starring Melanie Lynskey, Christina Ricci, Tawny Cypress, Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Sophie Thatcher, Courtney Eaton, Lauren Ambrose, and more, Yellowjackets season three will return in early 2025.
