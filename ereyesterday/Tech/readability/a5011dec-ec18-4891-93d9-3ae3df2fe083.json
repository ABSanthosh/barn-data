  "text": "Amazon Prime Day has unleashed some rip-roaring deals on Eureka’s robot vacuum lineup, and I’ve rounded up the six best bargains that’ll leave your floors flea-free and your dirty deeds done cheap. From carpet-shredding suction beasts to mop-marauding multitaskers, there’s something here to suit every home, and every budget. Prime Day runs from July 8 to July 14, so if you’ve been putting off a cleaning upgrade, now’s your chance to snag a must-own dust owner. And if you want even more Eureka intel, swing by our full hands-on look at the Eureka E10s over at Mashable.J15 Pro Ultra: The carpet conqueror Credit: Eureka I’ll admit, 16,200 Pa suction sounds like overkill until you see it in action on my shag-pile rug. The J15 Pro Ultra doesn’t just hoover; it hunts, chops through pet hair with its active anti-tangle cutter, and leverages mop extension tech to terminate any secret dust bunnies hiding in corners. The all-in-one base station washes, dries and even cleans its own tray in an aspirational act of self-care! Down from AU$2,099 to AU$1,299 (a whopping 38% off), this is literally the lowest price of the year. Grab yours while it lasts. E20 Plus: Twice the bite, half the price Credit: Eureka Meet the E20 Plus, Eureka’s answer to “Miniature butler with none of the small man syndrome snark.” With 8,000 Pa of double-strength suction (that’s twice the E10s’ grunt) and a rubber roller brush that laughs in the face of pet fur, this little ripper is perfect for keeping carpets and hard floors gleaming. This bagless beauty even auto-lifts its mop over rugs, so you won’t end up with soggy surprises. One-touch emptying and multi-cyclonic action mean maintenance is near-zero, and DuoDetect AI™ navigation stops it getting wedged under the couch at midnight. Yours for AU$599 (down from AU$1,299) at a whopping 54% off. I wouldn’t let this bargain scoot past me. Rapidwash 630: Splish, splash, no double pass Credit: Eureka If you’ve ever wished your vacuum could also wring out a mop, the Rapidwash 630 is your fairy god-machine. This two-in-one marvel vacuums and washes in a single pass, and its high-temp self-cleaning roll means you’re not wrestling mildew after every session. Got low-lying furniture? The 170 degree lie-flat reach scoots under without drama. And Smart Auto Mode throttles power to match the mess, so you’re never over-working your bot or your bill. Normally AU$799, now AU$449 (an insane 44% off). Hot damn, talk about cleaning up! Rapidwash: Budget Clean Machine Credit: Eureka Want the Rapidwash experience without the sticker shock? The original Rapidwash (sans “630”) is a savvy alternative, still vacuum-and-wash in one go but at half the price. You lose a smidge of tech pizzazz compared to its bigger and bolder sibling, but you still get a stellar wet-dry combo for AU$299 (that’s 50% off its usual AU$599). If thrift meets thoroughness is your vibe, this one’s calling your name. J15 Ultra: Stellar Performance, Wallet-Friendly Credit: Eureka Think the J15 Pro Ultra sounds like a bit much? The J15 Ultra is its more affordable sibling, and honestly, it still punches well above its price tag. You’re getting top-tier suction, that same magical anti-tangle brush that makes pet hair vanish, and one of the highest-rated robot vacs on Amazon for everyday cleaning. It’s a great option if you want something powerful and intelligent but don’t feel the need to go full luxe. The self-cleaning base is a real bonus too, handling the mess so you don’t have to. At AU$1,099 (down from AU$1,699), it’s a solid 35% saving. If you want serious cleaning power without spending the big bucks, this one’s a no-brainer. NEY100 Spot Cleaner: Pet-Proof Power Credit: Eureka The NEY100 Spot Cleaner might be small in stature, but it hits way above its weight class when it comes to everyday messes. Whether it’s muddy paw prints, an overenthusiastic spaghetti spill or something less polite from your furry housemate, this little unit is built to blast out stains without making a whole production of it. It's lightweight enough to whip out on a whim and strong enough to deal with the sort of grime you'd usually give up on. It’s also great for anyone tight on space, with a compact design that can live in the laundry or a cupboard. And with the price now down to just AU$139 from AU$269, you’re looking at a 48% discount that makes clean-up duty a lot more bearable. Mashable Deals --Prime Day is the perfect excuse to outsource your chores to a machine. Whether you’ve got shag rugs, slick tiles or a fur-factory at home, these Eureka deals from July 8 to 14 are too good to ignore. Happy cleaning, and even happier savings!",
