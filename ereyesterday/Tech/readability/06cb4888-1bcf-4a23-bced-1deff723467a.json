It spun out Donut Labs as a subsidiary in 2024 to apply that same concept to all manner of electric vehicles — from e-scooters and drones to electric cars and semi-trucks.   The 21-inch version for cars delivers 630kW of power and 4,300Nm of torque — numbers typically seen in hypercars — yet weighs just 40kg. Donut claims it offers the highest torque and power density of any EV motor on the market.  The company says it has overcome the long-standing Achilles’ heel of in-wheel motors: unsprung mass —  the weight of components not supported by the suspension, which can impair handling and ride comfort. Past attempts to put the motor in the wheel compromised these qualities, but Donut says its design is light enough that the impact is negligible. Beyond motors, Donut is also developing batteries, software, and computer connectivity as part of its plans to become a one-stop shop for EV manufacturers. It’s also targeting a broad range of applications outside the traditional auto industry, including aerospace, defence, and robotics.   Yet, scaling across land, sea, and air vehicles — while also building batteries, software, and full-stack EV systems — is a hefty task even for deep-pocketed firms. Let’s see if Donut Lab has what it takes to pull off its ambitious plans.",
