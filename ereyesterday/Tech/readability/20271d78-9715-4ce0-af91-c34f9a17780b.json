  "description": "The daughter of a Seattle woman who died during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave has filed the first wrongful death lawsuit directly linking fossil fuel companies to an individual's climate-related death. Misti Leon is suing seven oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, claiming they caused her mother Juliana Leon's death from hyperthermia on June 28, 2021, when temperatures reached 108 degrees Fahrenheit. The lawsuit alleges the companies created a \"fossil fuel-dependent economy\" that resulted in \"more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.\" Attribution science research determined the 2021 heatwave would have been \"virtually impossible\" without human-made climate change and was at least 150 times rarer without warming. The case seeks damages and funding for a public education campaign about fossil fuels' role in planetary heating. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
