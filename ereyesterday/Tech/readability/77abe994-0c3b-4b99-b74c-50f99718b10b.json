  "description": "YouTube has clarified its rules about repetitious content and your favorite reaction video channel won't be impacted. Earlier this month, the platform said it would be changing its rules for monetization in an effort to address AI-generated materials, but didn't include many specifics, which led many to sound the alarm that reaction videos might get swept up in the new rules. The company has now provided a few tweaks and more clear delineations in its guidelines about channel monetization policies. For starters, the rule is being renamed to the inauthentic content policy. \"This type of content has always been ineligible for monetization under our existing policies, where creators are rewarded for original and authentic content,\" a note appended to the support page states. \"There is no change to our reused content policy which reviews content like commentary, clips, compilations and reaction videos.\" YouTube provided a few examples of material that it would deem to be mass-produced or overly repetitive, and thus ineligible to be monetized. Inauthentic content includes video \"that exclusively features readings of other materials you did not originally create, like text from websites or news feeds\" or \"image slideshows or scrolling text with minimal or no narrative, commentary, or educational value.\" The company also shared examples of reused content. YouTube said those beloved reaction channels, as well as videos that contain clips for analysis, review or commentary, are unaffected by the new rules. The no-nos for reused content rules might include \"Content uploaded many times by other creators\" or \"Content downloaded or copied from another online source without any substantive modifications.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/never-fear-reaction-videos-are-still-allowed-under-youtubes-new-inauthentic-content-policy-222401009.html?src=rss",
