  "description": "When a volcano erupted in 1980 about 70 miles from Portland, \"lava incinerated anything living for miles around,\" remembers an announcement from the University of California at Riverside. But \"As an experiment, scientists later dropped gophers onto parts of the scorched mountain for only 24 hours. \"The benefits from that single day were undeniable — and still visible 40 years later.\" Once the blistering blast of ash and debris cooled, scientists theorized that, by digging up beneficial bacteria and fungi, gophers might be able to help regenerate lost plant and animal life on the mountain. Two years after the eruption, they tested this theory. \"They're often considered pests, but we thought they would take old soil, move it to the surface, and that would be where recovery would occur,\" said UC Riverside microbiologist Michael Allen. They were right. But the scientists did not expect the benefits of this experiment would still be visible in the soil today, in 2024. A paper out this week in the journal Frontiers in Microbiomes details an enduring change in the communities of fungi and bacteria where gophers had been, versus nearby land where they were never introduced. \"In the 1980s, we were just testing the short-term reaction,\" said Allen. \"Who would have predicted you could toss a gopher in for a day and see a residual effect 40 years later?\" In 1983, Allen and Utah State University's James McMahon helicoptered to an area where the lava had turned the land into collapsing slabs of porous pumice. At that time, there were only about a dozen plants that had learned to live on these slabs. A few seeds had been dropped by birds, but the resulting seedlings struggled. After scientists dropped a few local gophers on two pumice plots for a day, the land exploded again with new life. Six years post-experiment, there were 40,000 plants thriving on the gopher plots. The untouched land remained mostly barren. All this was possible because of what isn't always visible to the naked eye. Mycorrhizal fungi penetrate into plant root cells to exchange nutrients and resources. They can help protect plants from pathogens in the soil, and critically, by providing nutrients in barren places, they help plants establish themselves and survive. Mycorrhizal fungi also helped an old-growth forest survive, accoridng to the researchers — even after volcano ash had caused them to drop their needles... Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
