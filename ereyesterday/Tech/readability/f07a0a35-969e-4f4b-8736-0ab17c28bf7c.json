When she's not writing, she likes to dote over her cat, sip black coffee and try out new horror movies. Rebellions, betrayals, deadly pentathlons and forks used as murder weapons filled season 2 of Squid Game -- the latest entry in Netflix's hit dystopian thriller series. A third and final season is on the way, and it just got its first full trailer at Tudum 2025.Season 3 will continue the story revolving around prize money and fatal children's games. It'll also follow the showdown between Lee Jung-jae's protagonist Gi-hun and Lee Byung-hun's Front Man, the overseer of the games who disguised himself as a player and tricked Gi-hun during season 2. Returning viewers will learn what comes after the second season's cliff-hanger ending and post-credit scene teasing double the killer animatronic dolls. Lee Jung-jae and Lee Byung-hun both appeared onstage to unveil the new trailer during the Tudum fan event, which is currently streaming live on Netflix. Season 3 will debut on June 27, six months after season 2.The new trailer follows an earlier season 3 teaser trailer, which offered glimpses of what's to come in the South Korean show's grand finale.
