  "text": "TikTok ban: What to know Credit: Photo by Osmancan Gurdogan/Anadolu via Getty Images UPDATE: Jan. 19, 2025, 12:44 p.m. CST On Sunday, January 19, president-elect Donald Trump announced his intentions to sign an executive order on Inauguration Day to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban until parent-company ByteDance can find a suitable U.S. buyer. In response, TikTok announced plans that it was \"in the process\" of restoring service to U.S users. TikTok, an app used by a third of American adults, is about to be banned in the U.S. — despite legal battles, political maneuvers, and an incoming administration that seems particularly friendly. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday, Jan. 17, to uphold a law that would ban the app for the 170 million people who use the app in the U.S. The ruling lines up with decisions other courts have made and sets up the ban to go into effect on Sunday, Jan. 19. On Wednesday, Jan. 15, Reuters reported that TikTok will shut its app for U.S. users on Sunday. Anonymous sources told Reuters that it would mean that anyone in the U.S. who opens the app will see a pop-up message that will take them to a website with information about the ban. If the ban gets reversed, TikTok sources told Reuters that it would be able to restore service \"in a relatively short time.\"That said, a White House official told ABC News on Thursday evening that President Joe Biden reportedly won't enforce the ban, punting that decision to President-elect Donald Trump. Just because Biden won't enforce the ban doesn't mean the ban won't exist — TikTok still doesn't have legal authority to continue operating in the country as of Sunday.It's unclear what Trump will do, but he's certainly cozying up to the app. TikTok CEO Shou Chew might be a guest at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, signaling mutual support between the tech CEO and the upcoming administration. When will the TikTok ban go into effect?The TikTok ban will go into effect on Jan. 19, one day before Trump takes office. However, reports suggest Biden won't enforce the ban, so it'll be up to Trump to make the final call. Just because Biden won't enforce the ban doesn't mean the ban won't exist — TikTok still doesn't have legal authority to continue operating in the country as of Sunday.\"Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,\" a White House official told ABC News. Mashable Light Speed Is there any way to stop the TikTok ban before the 19th?TikTok has tried almost everything — taking it to court multiple times, encouraging lawmakers, fluttering their eyelashes at Donald Trump — but they've run out of ways to stop the TikTok ban before the 19th. With Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the app will be banned on Jan. 19. If TikTok is banned, can I keep it on my phone?Yes, you can keep TikTok on your phone after the ban goes into effect, but you won't be able to update it. App stores like Apple and Google and internet hosting companies could be penalized by the government if they distribute or update the app under the current law that was upheld by the Supreme Court, even if the Biden administration has stated that it won't enforce the ban. After all, continuing to operate without official authorization is a risk TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, probably won't take. And, as Reuters reported, you'll likely see a pop-up window when you attempt to open the app that will direct you to a website with more information about the ban. What are creators doing?TikTok creators are encouraging their followers and fans to follow them on other platforms. However, as Meta becomes increasingly hostile to protected groups, they aren't all asking their followers to join them on Instagram or Facebook. Instead, some creators are using the Chinese app RedNote, aka Xiaohongshu. Is there any way to bring TikTok back after the 19th? Yes, but those avenues are complicated and will take time.On Sunday, January 19, president-elect Donald Trump announced his intentions to sign an executive order on Inauguration Day to delay the enforcement of the TikTok ban until parent-company ByteDance can find a suitable U.S. buyer.In response, TikTok announced plans that it was \"in the process\" of restoring service to U.S users.Where does Trump stand on TikTok?The president-elect has changed his opinion on TikTok and is currently supportive of the app. In 2024, he announced, \"I'm gonna save TikTok\" on the campaign trail.How can I download my favorite TikTok videos? Simply add a Chrome extension to download your favorite TikTok videos. Videos take up a lot of space, so you may want to use an external hard drive. We wrote a more thorough breakdown of how to download your favorite TikTok videos if you'd like to know what to do step by step.Are there TikTok alternatives? While nothing can replace the TikTok algorithm experience, several platforms offer a similar short-form video experience. From YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and the actual Chinese version of TikTok (Xiaohongshu aka RedNote) we've gathered a list for you linked here.We will continue to update this story as more information surfaces.
