  "description": "It may not be Black Friday yet, but the holiday shopping blitz is already well underway with some significant discounts on games and gaming devices. Steam is in the middle of its Autumn Sale that runs until December 4 and includes a discount on the LCD Steam Deck. No, it’s not the OLED Steam Deck, but Steam is offering the 512GB Steam Deck with a 25 percent discount that brings the price down to $336.75. Steam’s sale also offered the smaller 64GB LCD model with a 15 percent discount for less than $300 but they’ve already run out of stock. This may be the best time to pick up a Steam Deck since last summer. In June, Steam knocked down the price of the 64GB variant to just under $300 and the 512GB version for under $400. The 64 and 512GB models are discontinued and won’t be available once Steam runs out of stock. The 256GB LCD model is sticking around for a little while longer for those gamers who can’t afford the fancier versions. If you’re going to buy a Steam Deck, you’ll need some games to play on it. Steam Autumn Sale also includes some sweet deals on games like Baldur’s Gate 3 for $47.99 and Total War: Warhammer III for $23.99 and early access to Supergiant’s Hades II for $26.99. Steam also has some cool discounts on older games that you’ve been meaning to play like Double Fine’s Psychonauts 2 and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey for $6 each, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for $4 and Cities Skylines for $3.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steams-autumn-sale-sees-deep-discounts-on-lcd-steam-decks-and-select-games-202918983.html?src=rss",
