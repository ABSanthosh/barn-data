  "text": "Apple Intelligence allegedly misled BBC News readers and BBC News isn't happy about it. Tweet may have been deleted In a story reported by BBC News itself, the outlet accused Apple's suite of AI features (which includes the ability to summarize news headlines in push notifications) of writing and sending out a blatantly false push notification to users. In this case, the push notification read that Luigi Mangione, recently arrested in connection with the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself. That headline is false, and no such event has occurred at the time of publication. \"Luigi Mangione shoots himself; Syrian mother hopes Assad pays the price; South Korea police raid Yoon Suk Yeol's office,\" the notification read in full. Apple Intelligence appears to have rounded up three separate news stories into one summary notification. Interestingly, only the Mangione one is incorrect; the others are accurate representations of the news stories they are referencing. Mashable Light Speed BBC News has complained to Apple about this, but Apple has yet to comment on it. Apple Intelligence was introduced to iPhones and other Apple devices earlier this year, with the feature set being greatly expanded with the launch of iOS 18.2 earlier this week. If Apple is going to keep trying with AI, it might be prudent to clean up some of these issues before lawyers get involved.Mashable has reached out to Apple for comment and will update if we hear back.",
