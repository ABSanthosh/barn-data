  "text": "Ever since she first debuted as a superheroic variant of Gwen Stacy in 2014, Spider-Gwen has become a semi-staple of Spider-Man media. If she’s not swinging on her own with Miles or Peter, she’s caught up in her own situations. While the original Gwen is being revived and turned into Gwenpool in a few months, the wallcrawling Stacy is getting another solo comic that help keep her in the orbit of other Spider-heroes. So in All-New Spider-Gwen: The Ghost Spider from returning writer and artist duo Stephanie Phillips and Paolo Villanelli, Gwen continues to be a full-time resident of Earth-616. Like her fellow Spiders before her, she’s in her “brand new” era: a new costume, a new place to live, and she’s even looking to start up a new rock band. Those plans of hers get thrown into disarray when she’s got new threats to tangle with, at least one of which Phillips teased “might be her own fault.” © David Marquez/Marvel Comics Previous Spider-Gwen runs explored how she made the most of her new lease on life, either in 616 or her home dimension of Earth-65, and the same’s true with this All-New series. Philips said the book’s core theme is about “possibility. […] She’s finally in a place where she can build something new—new allies, new purpose, and maybe even a new sense of self.” Of course, with Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse possibly hitting theaters in June 2027, it also doesn’t hurt to have Gwen headlining a new comic and maybe being a key part of whatever the next major Spider-book crossover is whenever that hits in the next few years. All-New Spider-Gwen: The Ghost Spider begins on August 20 following the end of the current Spider-Gwen: The Ghost Spider run wrapping with Issue 15 on July 2. [via Collider] Want more io9 news?
