With that process now closed to submissions, we are publishing our response in which we outline how targeted, pro-growth and pro-innovation reforms to the copyright framework will facilitate the UK’s ambition to become a leader for AI investment and innovation, while respecting the rights of content creators.For AI companies of all sizes to flourish, we hope for reforms that provide legal clarity, support technological advancement, and foster collaboration between AI developers and rights holders to the benefit of the UK. We look forward to continuing this discussion.",
