  "text": "CapCut simplifies video editing and creation, making it ideal for social media influencers on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other platforms. Sadly, the US CapCut ban prevents all American residents from using their favorite video editor. Following the bombastic TikTok ban in the USA, CapCut stopped providing its services to this country as a result of its failure to comply with the government’s requests. Since January 19th, 2025, neither TikTok nor CapCut are functional in the United States. But what if we told you you could STILL use CapCut in the USA and keep making videos? The workaround is incredibly simple and involves a VPN, whose IP-modifying abilities allow you to access CapCut in the US as if you were somewhere else. Stay tuned for more information; we’ll explain everything. How Can a VPN Unblock CapCut in the US? CapCut stopped providing services to people in this country. The whole “conundrum” is about blocking users with a US IP address. As a result, the solution is to use a VPN to mask your original IP and replace it with a new one located in another country. A VPN such as NordVPN is capable of doing this safely and efficiently. NordVPN offers servers in 118+ countries, so it’s easy to swap your IP address and bypass the CapCut ban in the USA. Once connected to a VPN server, the old IP is masked so that CapCut can’t see your original whereabouts and impose the ban. Unblock CapCut with NordVPN NordVPN is frequently used by people in the USA. It’s fast, offers unlimited bandwidth, and comes with a no-logging policy. This means it’s ideal for privacy, which is an important factor not just for CapCut but also for unblocking TikTok in the US. As it has a 30-day refund policy, it’s practically risk-free. This means you can get it, enjoy CapCut in America, and snatch a refund in 30 days if you don’t want to pay. Alternatively, keep using it and unblock other content, or simply enjoy the encryption and privacy you’ll get. How to Bypass the US CapCut Ban: An Easy-to-Follow Guide Glad you asked. We’ll use NordVPN to overcome the CapCut ban in the US. This trick works on all devices because NordVPN offers native clients for Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and Linux. Follow the steps below for more information: Subscribe to NordVPN. Use this link to get a 70% discount on its biennial plans. Alternatively, click any of the buttons in this article to do the same. Install NordVPN on your device – you can use it on up to TEN devices at a time. Launch NordVPN and then sign in with your email and password. Connect to a server abroad – do NOT use the US ones. We opted for the UK instead. Visit CapCut, sign in, and enjoy the video editor as you normally would. © Gizmodo.com CapCut Works But With No Templates – What to Do? Some people reported that CapCut works in the USA but with one huge issue. The lack of templates. That’s a rather strange problem but if this happens, it still means you’re affected by the CapCut US ban. Either way, the solution is the same because you still can’t use the software properly. As you know, templates are vital for what CapCut is trying to achieve. Once again, set up NordVPN on your device, connect to a server outside the USA, and launch the application again. You should now be able to see all your templates and use them to create videos without limits. Access CapCut in the US With NordVPN What’s the Deal With CapCut and the US? For those who don’t know CapCut and TikTok were banned in the United States pretty much simultaneously. There’s a strong connection between the two apps – their founder ByteDance. ByteDance is a Chinese company accused by the US government of alleged spying attempts. To prevent ByteDance from covertly spying on US residents, President Biden has signed a new PAFCA Bill, which essentially protects people from spying through apps. Additionally, the US government requested ByteDance to sell off ownership by January 19th, 2025, which the latter blatantly refused. As the ban took effect as a result, both CapCut and TikTok were promptly removed from the App Store. © CapCut (Error message in the USA) Up-and-coming President Donald Trump vowed to “work” with ByteDance to reinstate TikTok and CapCut in the USA. However, we don’t know when and IF that will be the case. If you’re a social media creator, CapCut and TikTok are a must-have, which is why it’s best to use NordVPN until further notice. Otherwise, you’ll be left without access to these vital tools and rid yourself of potential revenue. Is Unblocking CapCut in the USA Legal? The US internet space is one of the least censored in the world. This means VPNs are legal here and you and use them as long as your activities aren’t illicit. Accessing CapCut in the USA and overcoming the ban is legal as well since no law explicitly states otherwise. If you’ve read the previous section, you know the whole “panic” among the US authorities has to do with notorious Chinese spying. At least on paper, the US is trying to shield its citizens from China whose apps allegedly collect their private information. That said, you’re free to use NordVPN to sidestep the US CapCut ban. If you don’t see CapCut as a threat to your privacy, good. You’re free to make and edit your videos as you see fit, without the fear of ending up like Robespierre. Closing Thoughts Should you wait for Mister Trump to work things out with ByteDance and bring back beloved TikTok and CapCut in the USA? We wouldn’t trust politicians too much. Biden is not yet out of office, so right now, we’re looking at shallow promises. It’s best to use NordVPN, whose three-dollar-a-month plan won’t cost a fortune. Once the VPN is set up on your devices, simply connect to a server overseas and use CapCut in the US without interruptions. In the process, you’ll also be able to use TikTok for added fun! Don’t forget that this fix is risk-free and you don’t have to pay a cent if you don’t want to. Get a refund in 30 days and say “Goodbye!” to NordVPN in that case. It can’t be simpler.
