(Made possible \"by the Enron mining division, which has been sourcing the proprietary Enronium ore...\") Enron's new 28-year-old CEO Connor Gaydos insists they're \"making the world a better place, one egg at a time.\" The Houston Chronicle delves into the details: Supposedly a micro-nuclear reactor capable of powering a home for up to 10 years, the Enron Egg would be a significant leap forward for both energy technology and humanity's understanding of nuclear physics — if, of course, such a thing were actually feasible. \"With our current understanding of physics, this will never be possible,\" said Derek Haas, an associate professor and nuclear and radiation engineering researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. \"We can make a nuclear reactor go critical at about the size of the egg that I saw on the pictures. But we can't capture that energy and turn it into useful electric heat, and shield the radiation that comes off of the reactor.\" [Haas adds later that nuclear reactors require federal licenses to operate, which take two to nine years to procure and \"typically require several hundred pages of documentation to be allowed to build it, and then another thousand pages of safety documents to be allowed to turn it on.\"] The outlandish claims Enron has made in the weeks since its brand revival have left many to speculate that the move is part of some large-scale joke similar to Birds Aren't Real — a gag conspiracy movement that Connor Gaydos, Enron's 28-year-old CEO, published a book on alongside co-author and movement founder Peter McIndoe. In an exclusive interview with the Houston Chronicle, Gaydos asked that people look past the limitations — be they in the form of regulations or physics — and embrace the impossible.... Several since-deleted blurbs — both on the company's website and on social media — have alluded to Enron potentially expanding into the world of cryptocurrency. Gaydos said he hasn't ruled it out, but the company currently does not have any plans in the works to debut an Enron-themed coin. \"I think in a lot of ways, everything feels like a crypto scam now, but thankfully, we are a completely real company,\" Gaydos said. When announcing the Egg, Gaydos stressed Enron was now revolutionizing not just the power industry, but also two others — the freedom industry, and the independence industry. And Gaydos reminded his audience that their home micro-nuclear was \"safe for the whole family.\" \"Preorder now,\" adds the Egg's web page at Enron.com. \"Sign up for our email newsletter and be the first to know when we launch...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
