  "text": "The Formula 1 2025 season starts on March 14th. This day marks the beginning of the Australian Grand Prix, which lasts until March 16th. The good news is that you can watch the F1 Australian GP on several free channels. However, there’s also this “premium” group of platforms, which many people worldwide use. Unfortunately, they’re pretty expensive and usually not worth it for those looking to stream just a few Grand Prix races a year. Nevertheless, we’ll focus on 100% free channels for watching the Australian Grand Prix here, but also discuss some of the premium platforms you can use if you want. Free Channels for Streaming 2025 F1 Australian GP According to the official Formula 1 website, you can broadcast the race on multiple channels, which include: 10Play (Australia) – our #1 recommended choice because it broadcasts the event in Full HD and English. ORF (Austria) – Full HD footage with German commentary RTBF (Belgium) – Entire race in Full HD with Belgian commentary SRF (Switzerland) – Free channel for streaming with Swiss commentary These channels are completely free and most of them don’t even require an account. 10Play, which is the best option, does require an account but it’s free to make. Once you sign up, you can watch anything you want on it. 10Play works exclusively in Australia and because of that, broadcasts the event with English commentary and in Full HD. The rest of the free channels for the 2025 Australian GP live streaming provide German, Belgian, and Swiss commentary respectively. It’s also great to know that you can watch F1 live anywhere only on the other four channels, as 10Play live-streams only this race. But if you’re interested only in this specific race, this should be your go-to option. How to See the Australian GP for Free? If you’re outside Australia, you’ll have a hard time accessing 10Play. 10Play, like the rest of Australian TV channels, works only in this country, leaving people abroad with a geo-restriction message. Avid racing fans who also enjoy MotoGP races live with the trick we’ll explain have noticed that a VPN can comfortably unblock this free TV channel. Namely, they used NordVPN as the most popular VPN with servers in Australia. NordVPN is a premium VPN service with nearly 200 Australian servers, unlimited bandwidth, and top-speed for streaming and other activities. Watch F1 Australian GP With NordVPN Those who use it love its compatibility on all devices. This, in turn, allows people to watch the 2025 Australian Grand Prix on a free channel even on the fly. The whole process is about obtaining an Australian IP address. This makes 10Play see the user as if he’s actually in Australia, which allows access to the free channel. However, there’s another incentive — a 30-day money-back guarantee. Thanks to it, NordVPN is fully refundable in 30 days, and since the event lasts from the 14th to the 16th of March, there’s enough time to be reimbursed. Are Paid Channels for Watching F1 Races Worth It? It all depends on how much you love this motorsport. However, most people would agree that these channels/services are way too expensive. We’ll list some of them below and comment on their prices: USA: F1 TV Pro, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, ESPN+ Australia: Kayo Sports, Fox Sports UK: Sky Sports F1 These are familiar names and perhaps, because of that, they tend to cost a lot. A good example is Hulu + Live TV, which is priced at a whopping $81.99/mo. Multiply this by 12 months and you get a ludicrous annual price. F1 TV Pro costs $84.99/year, which isn’t too much but again, you can watch the 2025 F1 Australian Grand Prix on a free channel and spend nothing. Keep in mind that even premium platforms are region-locked, so you can’t watch ESPN Plus anywhere unless you use a VPN, for example. So, are these channels worth their asking prices? We’ll let you answer that. Formula 1 Australian GP 2025 Schedule Unsure when to tune in to 10Play and watch the event?
