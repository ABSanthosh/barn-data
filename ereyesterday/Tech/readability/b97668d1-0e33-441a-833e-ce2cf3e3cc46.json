Whether it’s lifting, packing, or navigating tight spaces in a warehouse, this robot is ready to take on the world. And by “the world,” we mean retail, manufacturing, logistics, and pretty much any industry that involves repetitive tasks humans would rather avoid.   Rather than plotting world domination, Humanoid’s founder Artem Sokolov envisions a future “where humans and machines work side by side, not in competition, but in harmony.” “This societal shift will address social issues such as workforce shortages and ageing population while giving people more freedom to focus on more creative and meaningful work,” says Sokolov, a serial entrepreneur and investor who founded Humanoid last year.  “The strongest argument in favour of humanoids is that the world is already designed for humans.” This means humanoids – unlike robot dogs or wheeled robots — could move about our world with ease.  Humanoid is still in the early stages of developing its robot, and it better hurry up. The space is getting increasingly crowded.   Tesla’s Optimus is set to go on sale as early as this year, while Boston Dynamics’ Atlas continues to backflip its way into our dreams (or nightmares?), and China’s Unitree bots are perfecting their dance routines. These robots are poised to take over the jobs we don’t want to do — and maybe a few we do. So whether you’re excited or nervously side-eyeing your toaster, one thing’s certain: the future is looking decidedly humanoid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a new outfit. If the robots are going to out-dress me, I might as well go down in style.",
