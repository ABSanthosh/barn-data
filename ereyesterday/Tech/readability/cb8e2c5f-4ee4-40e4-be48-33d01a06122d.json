When snapping detailed high-definition pictures, capturing Full HD-quality movies or downloading gigantic programs, you can easily find yourself out of space. SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDXC memory card is the perfect solution for increasing space at a low price: Now available on Amazon at only $19—a reduction of 23% from its original price of $25—this memory card is a great value if you want to add capacity to your device. See at Amazon 71,000 HD Photos This microSD card features a generous 256GB of storage that can contain about 71,000 high-quality photos or more than 20 hours of Full HD video. It’s perfect for photographers, videographers, gamers and if you require additional capacity for media files, apps and other documents. The card is UHS-I compliant with a maximum read speed of 150MB/s for quick access to your files and quick transfer from device to device. From transferring videos off your smartphone or large files onto your laptop, the speed eliminates downtime and improves productivity. In addition to its superior read speed, the card is rated Class 10 and U1 as a video performer. This guarantees a write speed of not less than 10MB/s which is perfect for smooth recording of Full HD videos uninterrupted or lagged. For Android users, A1 certification also optimizes app performance to the extent that there is quicker boot-up and smoother functioning when apps are installed directly to the card. This is particularly beneficial for low internal storage devices as it makes it possible for you to use resource-hungry apps without compromising on performance. The SanDisk Ultra microSDXC card is built with durability in mind: It is resistant to water, shock, extreme temperatures (-13°F to 185°F), X-rays, and magnets. Whether you’re traveling in harsh conditions or accidentally drop your device, this SanDisk card on sale at Amazon is designed to withstand everyday wear and tear. One stand-out feature is the included SD adapter to expand compatibility to full-size SD device slots such as laptops and cameras. This is handy in facilitating easy sharing of files between different devices without extra cables or adapters. If you’re using DSLR cameras or action cams, you will find use for the adapter in integrating smoothly into your workflow. SanDisk also provides Android users with access to its Memory Zone application. The available-for-download application simplifies the management of files by allowing you to organize, navigate and back up your device’s files. It even has the functionality to automatically shift files from internal storage on your phone to memory card to free up space. At a cost of merely $19—a tiny fraction of adding internal storage in many devices—the SanDisk 256GB microSDXC card is a great investment with better performance than ever at a very attractive price point. Don’t miss this opportunity before the rising tariffs! See at Amazon",
