  "text": "Dec 13, 2024 [[read-time]] min read The Google Career Certificates Fund is expanding access to professional training for high-growth fields, driving economic opportunity and building a more equitable workforce. Learn how we're supporting thousands of graduates through new training providers and AI solutions. In 2022 we launched the Google Career Certificates Fund to help more Americans earn Google Career Certificates and gain the digital skills they need to qualify for high-growth jobs. The $100 million fund is designed to help drive over $1 billion of wage gains for 20,000 Americans, and today we’re sharing an update on our progress.Sharing early results, by the numbersSo far, the Google Career Certificates Fund has enabled Social Finance to help more than 6,000 individuals.1Caleel King, a former fast food shift lead who became a Technical Consultant at Intact Technologies after completing Merit America's IT Support program, is a testament to this effort. As Caleel says, “There are so many opportunities I have access to now that I didn’t have before.”To evaluate the impact we’re working with MDRC to study the program’s effects on wages, economic mobility and future workforce development financing. Overall, more than 70% of Google Career Certificate graduates report a positive career outcome — such as a new job, raise or promotion — within six months of completion.2Expanding access to Google Career CertificatesWith support from Google.org, Social Finance is working with Merit America, Year Up United and new providers Per Scholas, San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP), Ada Developers Academy and UnidosUS to serve diverse communities and drive positive career outcomes.To further reduce financial barriers, Per Scholas and Ada Developers Academy are piloting a Zero Percent Loan program supported by the Google Career Certificates Fund. This helps learners cover living expenses during their training, allowing them to focus on skill development without upfront costs, ultimately increasing enrollment and graduation rates. Tori Haynes’ story highlights the importance of financial support in career transitions. Once a security guard and DJ, Tori faced financial barriers to pursuing a career in IT. Leveraging Per Scholas's zero-interest loan program, she was able to complete her training and now thrives as an IT Support Specialist.San Diego Workforce Partnership is offering Google Career Certificates alongside courses from UC San Diego Extended Studies, while UnidosUS serves as a referral partner, helping to connect Latino community members with these valuable training opportunities.Supporting pathways to jobsWe're deepening our support of AI-powered solutions to career transitions, including a $5 million Google.org grant to Social Finance to enhance the job search process for program participants.This grant enables Social Finance to partner with AdeptID and develop AI talent matching solutions with Merit America, Year Up United and Per Scholas. This cutting edge approach to connecting graduates with open roles will not only increase efficiency, but get candidates in new roles and on their way, faster.We’re looking forward to the years ahead.
