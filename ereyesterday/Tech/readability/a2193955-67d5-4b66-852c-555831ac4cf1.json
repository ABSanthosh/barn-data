  "text": "“It’s almost 10 years ago that we started this journey,” Charlie Cox points out in one of two short videos Marvel just shared ahead of Daredevil: Born Again‘s arrival on Disney+. That sounds completely incorrect until you fact-check its star and realize that yes, Daredevil premiered on Netflix in April 2015. The confusing passage of time is a conundrum best tackled by certain other Marvel heroes; meanwhile, Daredevil‘s cast and crew are more than ready to get back into some street-level action First up, here’s a quick look at how Born Again approached both honoring and expanding the world established in the Netflix show. “We love the original Daredevil show, and it’s been a real source of inspiration for Daredevil: Born Again,” executive producer Brad Winderbaum explains. Cox’s co-star Vincent D’Onofrio—the villainous Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin—says he relishes the chance to revisit what sounds like a very fun character to play, and we learn that Born Again is also bringing back another key part of the original show: its Emmy-nominated stunt coordinator from seasons one and two, Philip Silvera… meaning, the person who choreographed a certain now-legendary hallway fight. “It’s hard to come to terms with your violent nature.” The cast and creative team behind #DaredevilBornAgain discuss starting the journey again.

She doesn’t actually have to be exactly like or similar [to how she was].” \"I was wondering if we could have a little chat?\" The cast of #DaredevilBornAgain discuss returning to their characters.
