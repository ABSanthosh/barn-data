Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Apple, Amazon, Samsung Cyber Monday is long gone, but great deals on tech products are sticking around. If you’ve been patiently holding off on your holiday shopping, there are still deals for you to get. Across Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and more, some of my favorite tech gadgets are seeing price cuts. Granted, some of these are designed to fool you with fake markups, which is why it’s important to track an item’s price history before going in on something that looks too good to be true. Fortunately, I’ve already done all of the work for you. For the next couple of days, keep checking in here for the best deals on laptops, TVs, Apple devices, tablets, video games, and more. Prices are accurate as of the time of writing, but you can expect them to fluctuate and inventory to sell out, so you may not want to hesitate if you see a sale that grabs you. Scroll to the bottom of the post for live updates.The Best Cyber Monday laptop deals that are still active If you’re like my in-laws, there’s a good chance you’re reading this list on a laptop that needs replacing. It’s a good thing that laptops are no stranger to post-Cyber Monday deals, across PC and Mac alike.Apple MacBook Air 13-inch with M3 Chip: $1,199 at Amazon (was $1,299). This is Apple’s most recent MacBook Air, complete with the M3 chip. At time of writing, stock is currently limited to the 512GB models, which come with a base 16GB of RAM and can be upgraded to 24GB of RAM.Apple MacBook Air 13-inch with M2 Chip: $949 at Amazon (was $999). If you’re OK going with a slightly older model, the M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is just a little cheaper than the M3 model right now, even if the discount isn't as large.Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro Chip: $2,299 at Amazon (was $2,499). This is a great middleground for the MacBook Pro, with the M4 Pro chip, up to 48GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 16-inch screen.Apple MacBook Air 13-inch with M1 Chip: $599 at Walmart (was $699). Apple’s oldest M-series MacBook Air is still a strong workhorse, with an M1 chip, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, although the smaller discount here might not make the compromise worth it.Dell Alienware m16 R2 Gaming Laptop with Intel Core Ultra 9 chip: $1,450 at Dell (was $1,700). Here's one for the gamers. This 16-inch gaming laptop from Dell packs a lot for the price, with up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, up to 64GB of memory, up to 2TB of storage, and a 16-inch QHD+ display.Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 laptop with Ryzen 9 chip: $1,200 at Best Buy (was $1,600). Another gaming laptop, this 14-inch model is a bit smaller, but manages to pack an AMD Ryzen 8 8945HS CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and 2,880 x 1,800 display with a 120Hz refresh rate.Acer Aspire Go 14 Laptop: $280 at Acer (was $350). This ultra-budget laptop is a good cheap pick, and should be good for people whose work depends mostly on the cloud. It comes with an AMD Ryzen 3 7320U CPU, 128GB of storage, 8GB of memory, a 14-inch screen, and Windows 11 in S Mode. Note that S Mode laptops can only use apps from the Microsoft Store by default, although this can be changed later.The Best Cyber Monday tablet deals that you can still get Not everyone needs a whole laptop. Tablets are just as valuable to plenty of techies out there, if not more so. Here are my favorite post-Cyber Monday tablet deals that are currently live.Apple 11-Inch iPad Air with M2 Chip: $824 at Amazon (was $899). If you're OK going for an older model of Apple Silicon, you can still get an M-series iPad on sale thanks to this deal from Amazon, which cuts a bit off an M2 iPad Air. At time of writing, the deal applies to the 512GB model. RAM is 8GB.Apple 10.2-Inch 9th Generation iPad: $200 at Best Buy (was $330). If you’re just looking for a cheap, basic tablet, you can’t do much better than the 9th Generation iPad, which is still going strong with the respectable A13 Bionic chip three years later. It won’t support Apple Intelligence, but if you’re still not sold on AI, you'll still get 3GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage.Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+: $800 at Best Buy (was $1,000). A premium Android tablet from Samsung, this rectangle boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, 12GB of memory, 256GB of storage, a 12-inch 2,800 x 1,752 AMOLED screen, and comes with a stylus.Microsoft Surface Pro 13-Inch: $900 at Best Buy (was $1,200). This pick blurs the line between a tablet and a laptop, coming equipped with Windows 11, which gives it a full desktop ecosystem of apps to explore. Plus, this particular model also has a few Copilot+ goodies thrown in. Storage is 512GB and RAM is 16GB.The Best Cyber Monday deals on phones you can still snag If you're still using an old phone, it could still be a great time to upgrade. Bigger deals are often limited to contracts with various mobile carriers, but there are still options to get a new phone outright.Google Pixel 8a 128GB (Unlocked): $490 at Amazon (was $499). The Google Pixel 8a is almost as good as the Pixel 8, with a 6.1-inch display, up to 256GB of storage, and a 64 megapixel camera (which is arguably still weaker than the 8's despite its higher number, due to other factors like light sensing).Google Pixel 8 Pro 128GB (Unlocked): $718 at Amazon (was $999). Amazon's Pixel 8 Pro deal is one of the few pro phone deals still running, although it only applies to the 128GB and 512GB models.The Best Cyber Monday Earbud Deals that are still running Let's say you just got a new phone for Cyber Monday. Good for you! But you're probably going to want some earbuds to go with it, right?Apple AirPods Pro 2: $170 at Amazon (was $249). Apple's best earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday, coming with noise cancellation, USB-C charging, conversation awareness, and a speaker in the case so you can find it more easily.Apple AirPods 4: $119 at Amazon (was $129). Apple's best non-pro AirPods are also on sale, with USB-C charging, spatial audio, a promised 30 hours of battery life (with the charging case), and voice isolation.Beats Studio Buds: $80 at Amazon (was $150). Beats is technically an Apple brand now, and these buds offer a cheaper way to get noise cancelling than the AirPods. They also have a different shape that some may prefer. This deal applies to the black, red, and white versions of the product.Google Pixel Buds A-Series: $72 at Amazon (was $99). This deal on white Pixel Buds A-Series is a good way to get reliable earbuds from a major brand, with a promised 24 hours of listening with the charging case.Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II: $219 at Amazon (was $279). Bose's redesigned earbuds feature include noise cancellation, a touch-based interface, and a Bose \"fit kit.\"Bose QuietComfort Earbuds: $129 at Bose (was $179). Bose's older QuietComfort earbuds feature a design built for comfort, multipoint connectivity, and active noise cancelling.Sony WF10000XM5 Earbuds: $230 at Best Buy (was $300). Sony's WF1000XM5 earbuds aim to bring the same noise cancelling excellence and audio quality of the famed headphones by the same name to a smaller, in-ear form factor.The Best Cyber Monday headphone deals you can still get If you're not an earbuds person, you can still get a great deal on more traditional headphones, too.Apple AirPods Max: $459 at Amazon (was $549). Apple's full over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max, offer many of the same benefits of AirPods in a more traditional form factor, including active noise cancelling and personalized spatial audio.Beats Studio Pro: $199 at Amazon (was $350). The most affordable Apple headphones, the Beats Studio Pro have personalized spatial audio and active noise cancellation, plus come in a number of fashionable colors.Sony WH-1000XM4: $198 at Amazon (was $348). These are Sony's last-generation noise cancelling headphones, but they are still a fan favorite, with conversation detection, a mic for onboard calls, Alexa control, and three color options.Sony WH-1000XM5: $298 at Amazon (was $400). Sony's current generation of noise cancelling headphones upgrades to four beam-forming microphones for better calling, plus promise an up to 30-hour battery life.Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones: $199 at Amazon (was $349). Bose's over-ear headphones offer the company's well-known noise cancelling in a more traditional form factor, promise a 24-hour battery life, and come in a number of colors.Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones: $349 at Amazon (was $429). Bose's premium over-ear headphones add on spatial audio to the max, plus update the Bluetooth codec and improve the onboard processor.The Best Cyber Monday TV deals that are still active I almost never buy a TV outside of a sales event, and you shouldn't either. Keep an eye on these TV deals.LG 77-inch B3 OLED TV: $1,497 at Amazon (was $2,297). OLED is still my favorite display tech out there, and if I can get on my soapbox for a moment, it's the only one that really compares to CRTs. LG makes some of the best OLED TVs around, and this big-screen model has a 4K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. There are four HDMI 2.1 inputs.Hisense 100-inch U7 QLED Google TV: $1,798 at Walmart (was $2,998). This massive, 100-inch TV from Hisense won't have quite the contrast levels as an OLED, but wow, that's a lot of screen space. It can display in up to 4K and has HDMI 2.1 inputs supporting a 144Hz refresh rate, making it decent for gaming, too.Amazon 65-inch Fire TV Omni Series: $370 at Amazon (was $450). Amazon's Fire TVs are a great way to get a lot of screen on a budget. This 4K QLED smart display has a 60Hz refresh rate, supports hands-free Alexa control, comes in up to 75-inches, and has various HDR options (starting at HDR10 and HLG).Roku 55-inch Plus Series QLED 4K Smart TV: $430 at Best Buy (was $500). Roku is one of Amazon's biggest rivals in the budget TV category. Available in up to 75 inches, this TV is 4K, supports Dolby Vision at a lower price point than Amazon's option, has a 60Hz refresh rate, and comes with Roku's snappy operating system built in.TCL 55-inch Class Q6-Series 4K Smart Google TV: $300 at Best Buy (was $450). If you're not big on Amazon's or Roku's operating systems, then a TCL TV is a good bet. This model comes in up to 98 inches, has a 4K QLED panel, support Dolby Vision, and a 60Hz native refresh rate.The Best Cyber Monday Video Game Deals you can still get Cyber Monday and beyond is a classic season for buying the latest video games (and video game accessories). Here are some of the best deals I've found so far.PlayStation VR2: $349 at Amazon (was $550). Right now, you can get Sony's second VR headset for $250 off its launch price, complete with a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. PC owners can also use this headset to play their SteamVR games.PS5 Slim Digital Edition Fortnite Bundle: $375 at Amazon (was $450). This digital edition of Sony's PlayStation 5 console has a slimmer build than launch models and eschews a disc drive, but comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a few Fortnite cosmetics.Amazon Fire TV 4K Max with Xbox Core Wireless Controller and 1 Month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: $80 at Amazon (was $142). This bundle will snag you Amazon's best streaming stick plus an Xbox controller and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, turning it into a full-on cloud gaming console.Xbox Core Wireless Gaming Controller: $45 at Amazon (was $65). Almost no video game accessory is as versatile as the basic Xbox controller, which can work across a slew of devices and has a standard layout that most games recognize immediately.PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller: $54 at Amazon (was $75). PS5 controllers can be a bit more finicky to connect to other devices than Xbox controllers, but have improved greatly in this regard over the years, and come with plenty of extra haptics that might justify their higher price tag to some gamers.8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller: $50 at Amazon (was $69). This is a reliable third-party alternative to the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, with both Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connectivity, plus motion controls, back paddles, macro compatibility, and durable Hall Effect sticks.Sonic x Shadow Generations for Xbox/PlayStation/Switch: $30 at Best Buy (was $50). Sonic’s latest release, this remaster of Sonic Generations also comes with a highly regarded, brand-new campaign featuring his edgy counterpart, Shadow the Hedgehog.Dragon's Dogma 2 for Xbox/PlayStation: $46 at Amazon (was $70). One of my personal favorite games of this year, this sequel to the cult classic from the Xbox 360-era sees players navigating a brutal fantasy world that doesn't pull any punches.Elden Ring for Xbox/PlayStation 4: $44 at Amazon (was $60). Another dark fantasy epic, this spiritual successor to the Dark Souls series features a narrative penned by George R.R. Martin. Stock is going fast, with the PlayStation version sold out at time of writing.Metaphor ReFantazio for PlayStation: $50 at Amazon (was $70). This brand-new series from the Persona team keeps many of the same element fans of those games have become accustomed to, while also introducing light real-time combat and a fantasy world dealing with political turmoil. At time of writing, only the PS5 version has a discount.Live Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech dealsKeep checking this section for live updates on the best and newest deals throughout the shopping holiday. The Best Cyber Monday Deals You Can Still Shop Now Deals are selected by our commerce team LiveThe Best Cyber Monday Deals Tue, December 3, 2024 at 4:49pm ET A 100-inch QLED TV is a statement. They are massive, and will likely need to be installed by a professional, but they will impress anyone who walks into your living room. The Hisense U76 QLED Google Smart TV was announced this year during CES 2024. Surprisingly, Walmart has it for $1,798 (originally $2,998), the lowest price since its January announcement. It has a native 144Hz resolution, Dolby Vision, and of course, local dimming to make the contrast and colors pop. If you're looking for a more budget option, the 43-inch TCL Q51BG, which came out this year, is $178 (originally $278). Tue, December 3, 2024 at 4:27pm ET For those waiting for a good deal on an Xbox console, Walmart has the 1TB Digital Edition Xbox with an extra controller (two total) for $489.98 (originally $599.99). At the time of this writing, no other major reputable retailer has this bundle, and the regular Digital Edition Xbox goes for the same price. So why not get the extra controller? Tue, December 3, 2024 at 4:12pm ET The Samsung HW-Q60CC came out in 2023 as a mid-range option with a seven-band graphic EQ so you can customize the sound just how you like it. It does well overall for general use, but its ability to handle dialogue jumps out as one of its strengths. It is Bluetooth-compatible with your phone and other devices, and it can get very loud without sacrificing quality. You can get it for $199 (originally $379). Tue, December 3, 2024 at 3:48pm ET If you're looking for a new pair of headphones, Walmart has a good selection to choose from right now. For those looking for the best ANC, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are $349 (originally $429), a great deal at the moment.The Sony WH-1000XM5, another great option, are down to $289 (originally $399.99).The Sennheiser Momentum 4 strikes a good balance between audio and ANC for a slightly cheaper price of $249 (originally $349.95). Tue, December 3, 2024 at 3:22pm ET You want a serious blender, one that's professional grade—a blender for a grown up, who has their damn life together. Now is the time for you to purchase a Vitamix E310 Explorian. Maybe you waffled on the $80 off for Black Friday deal, but don't fret: It's even less expensive today. This is a $379.95 blender that is on sale on Amazon for $254.99, post-Cyber Monday. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 2:40pm ET Athletes and runners take note: The Garmin Forerunner 165 is $199.99 (regular price $249.99). If you're really serious about your running, consider upgrading to the Forerunner 265/265s instead for $349.99, or splurge on the Forerunner 965 for $499. Both are $100 off their usual price.) Tue, December 3, 2024 at 2:25pm ET There are also bumper plates on sale from various retailers, and especially these basic 45-pound bumpers from GIKPAL. Bumpers are great for Olympic lifts, but also for deadlifts or anything else where you'd like to protect your floor and your ears a bit. These are now $139.99 for a pair, normally $179. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 1:27pm ET Looking for a budget treadmill instead? Try this Sunny option for $349.99, down from $789.98. It's been on sale in recent months, but usually in the $600-$700 range—not for anywhere near this good a price. There's no screen or anything particularly fancy, but there is a built-in speaker. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 1:26pm ET If you're interested in a Peloton treadmill, the Peloton Tread is $2,695 right now, down from $2,995. The machine is small and quiet, but the screen is 24\", so it's perfect for an immersive at-home workout. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 1:11pm ET Speedo's Teamster backpack, normally $90, is on sale for Cyber Monday—but the price depends on the color you choose. Here's a tasteful forest green for $68, or a lively \"Cheetah orange pop\" for $32. This bag is beloved by swimmers for its wet-and-dry separation, sturdy construction, and pockets for everything. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 12:58pm ET Peloton has gotten into the habit of offering sweet deals on its bikes on all the major shopping holidays, so of course there's a nice Cyber Monday sale going. The basic model Bike is $1,295 (down from $1,445) and the fancier Bike+ is $1,995 (normally $2,495). Of the two, the Bike+ is the better sale compared to historical price data, but ultimately you should choose based on which fits your needs better. We have a guide here to help you decide between the Bike and the Bike+. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 12:48pm ET The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are $299.70 (originally $429) and are the best headphones in 2024 for active noise cancelation. These headphones launched in the fall of 2023 with many reviewers praising their overall quality, but earning complaints for their pricing, at almost half a grand. At their current discounted price, there is no better value for your money if you value top-tier ANC, audio, and comfort. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 12:38pm ET 65-inch Hisense Class U8 Series Mini-LED ULED 4K UHD Google Smart TV is $897.99 (originally $1,499.99), the lowest price it has been. You'll get 4K resolution with local dimming, which creates deeper darks and richer colors for a more dramatic contrast (it'll look close to an OLED). This TV came out this spring and is one of the best midrange TVs with a powerful image quality available, according to PCMag's review. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 12:16pm ET The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless stand out as one of the absolute best gaming headsets out there with a combination of great features, comfort, and quality. They’re normally a whopping $350—but you can get them for more than half off right now thanks to a Cyber Monday discount at eBay on a certified refurbished pair.  Now, don’t shy away at the thought of grabbing a refurbished product. When a product gets the eBay Certified Refurbished label, the site is standing behind it, which means they're confident it’ll work and look like new. And eBay backs it with a two-year warranty — something a brand-new pair of these headphones doesn’t even get in the United States. So with this refurbished pair, you get a huge price drop from $350 down to $209, and then, with coupon code “SHOPCYBER20,” you get another 20% off that, bringing the total down to $167.20.  Tue, December 3, 2024 at 11:14am ET A great duffel bag is still on sale after Cyber Monday, and if you didn't snag one last time it was discounted, take another look, because this is one of the best (and most affordable!) gym bags out there. The Adidas Defender comes in different sizes, like the Small, which is on sale for just $31.50 in black today. Prices vary by color, but you can also get the Medium for $31.42 in black, or the Large for $45.69 in blue, to name a few. These prices aren't quite as good as the original Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale, but they're still well below list price. Tue, December 3, 2024 at 10:47am ET Hate when your hot coffee goes cold? Enter Ember, and its \"smart mug,\" marked down to $109.99 from $149.95 Unlike your dumb mug, Ember's cup can keep your drink at a stable temperature of your choosing, ranging between 120˚F and 145˚F. You set the temperature in the Ember app, pour yourself a cup of joe, and sip at your own leisure: Every time you take a drink, your coffee, tea, hot chocolate, what have you, will be the same temperature as the first sip. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 4:44pm ET The Yale Assure Lock 2 is one of the best smart locks of 2024 and it's $119 instead of $173.76 right now. This is the Bluetooth version with the touchscreen (as opposed to physical buttons) and with a physical key option. You can always buy the Yale Wi-Fi Smart Module separately later if you don't want to get the wifi version right now (it lets you control it remotely through wifi). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 3:19pm ET This cordless Milwaukee leaf blower is $199 (originally $438) and comes with two chargers, which is all you can ask for in a cordless leaf blower. The first battery lasts 30 minutes at 3/4 power and the second one lasts 20 minutes at the same setting. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 2:43pm ET The Lenovo Yoga 7 14-inch 2-in-1 with Ryzen 7 chip is $675 at Lenovo (was $1,025). This convertible Windows laptop can flip around to turn into a tablet, and it comes with a respectable AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS chip, a whopping 1TB of storage, 16GB of memory, a 14-inch touchscreen, and even a stylus. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 2:27pm ET The Fitbit Inspire 3 came out in 2023 to an \"excellent\" review from PCMag for its touch screen with the \"always-on\" option, the longest battery life at its time of eight days, a thinner design than its predecessor, SpO2 sensor for overnight readings (which Apple Watches don't have anymore), and a useful Find Phone feature. If you have a hard time reading small print, maybe skip this one due to its smaller size. You can get it for $69.95 (originally $99.95), the lowest price it has ever been. Keep in mind that you will need a Fitbit Premium subscription to have access to all of the Fitbit features. The plans start at $9.99 per month. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 2:16pm ET The second-gen AirPods Pro are especially great, albeit a bit expensive. When they drop in price like they have for Cyber Monday, it's a fantastic opportunity to buy them. Currently, Amazon has AirPods Pro 2 available for 38% off, dropping them to $154 from $249. That's a sizable deal, but it's not quite as much of a price drop as Amazon implies. These AirPods tend to hover around $199 on Amazon, sometimes dipping below that price. Plus, this sale has lasted throughout most of the Black Friday season. (Remember when Black Friday was just one day?) Still, once this shopping holiday is over, these AirPods will likely jump back up to that $200 range, so this is possibly your last chance to grab them while they're this cheap. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 1:26pm ET A massage gun is a great tool for whenever you feel like you'd enjoy being punched repeatedly, but therapeutically. Some of the big brands have models on sale right now. The Hypervolt Go is $99 right now (normally $129) and it's available in both white and black. And the triangular Theragun Mini, normally $199, is now $149 or $159 depending on your color preference. Desert rose and black are the more inexpensive ones at the moment. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 12:56pm ET Hydrow makes rowing machines with a Peloton-like screen that delivers classes on a subscription basis. Their top two models are on sale this Black Friday season: the Hydrow Pro is $1,745 (21% off the usual price of $2,195) and the Hydrow Wave is $1,440 (15% off the usual price of $1,695). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 12:23pm ET QLED TVs are cheaper than OLEDs but still offer good quality, and if you're looking to snatch a 55-incher (there are other sizes available too) for a great price, consider the Hisense Mini LED 4K UHD Google TV, currently going for $349.99 (originally $549.99). If you prefer a TCL, the 65-inch QM8-Series is $999.99 (originally $1,499.99), offering a better refresh rate and motion rate. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 11:48am ET Those looking to improve on their TV's weaker audio can get the JBL Bar 5.0 MultiBeam for $169.99 (originally $399.99), a steep discount. As CNET explains in their review, the MultiBeam is a compact soundbar with excellent sound quality and multiple streaming features, offering great flexibility. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 11:16am ET The Sony ULT Field 7 is a powerful, rugged portable speaker designed for parties. If you want a small speaker with a rumbling bass and an input for both a karaoke mic and a guitar, this Sony speaker can do that and more. (Read amore in PCMag's review.) Right now, you can get it for its lowest price ever: $349.99 (originally $499.99). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 10:48am ET If you're an Android user, two of your best options for headphones are at their lowest prices ever. For those looking for the best active noise canceling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are $329 (originally $429), a great deal at the moment. If you value the best audio quality, then the Sony WH1000XM5 for $299.99 (originally $399.99) are a great mix of performance and price. And if you're looking for a good deal on reliable, well-rounded earbuds, the Jabra Elite 10 are $149.99 (originally $249.99). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 10:30am ET Everyone needs fast storage and a solid state drive (SSD) provides just that. You can get internal SSDs for your laptop or PC to reduce boot up times, or you could pick a good external SSD for high-speed backups. Either way, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are great times to find good deals on SSDs. The Samsung 990 PRO is a high-performance SSD and it's one of the best ones you can buy right now. The 2TB variant is discounted this Black Friday and it sits at the sweet spot for internal SSDs where you get a good amount of storage for not too much money. There are two versions of this Samsung 990 PRO—one with a heatsink and one without. Ideally, you should get the one with the heatsink ($149.99, down from $264.99) for improved cooling and longer life, but if you are among those whose case can't fit an SSD with a heatsink or if you live in colder climates, then you can get the one without it ($159.99, down from $249.99). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 10:16am ET The Mammotion Yuka 1500 is a great robot lawnmower. It has exceptional RTK positioning, the ultra rugged wheels are unbothered by uneven terrain, and it has multi-zone management so you can share your mower with your neighbors. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it's discounted 20%, which brings the price down to $1,648 (originally $2,048). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 10:00am ET The Samsung Bespoke stick vacuum is 28% off right now, bringing its price down to $499.99 (originally $799.99). The vacuum comes with a stand that turns it into a modern sculpture, so there's no hiding it away. But that's OK, because that base is also a self-emptying dock. It turns out that once you have a self-emptying dock for your vacuum, you will realize how insulting it is that we've been touching all that debris and dust when we manually empty our vacuums. Mon, December 2, 2024 at 9:47am ET For those shopping around for a new TV, Samsung's new 55-inch The Frame from 2024 has a great deal: It's on sale for $897.99 (originally $1,497.99) after a 40% discount, the lowest price it has been according to price tracking tools. The 75-inch The Frame is also 43% off, currently $1,697.99 (originally $2,997.99). Mon, December 2, 2024 at 9:43am ET Apple makes some of the best laptops for the general public, and the MacBook Air series has consistently been one of its most popular. The 16 GB RAM version of the M2 MacBook Air is on sale or $799 for Cyber Monday (originally $999) on Amazon, the lowest price it has been according to price-tracking tools. It's available in space gray, midnight, silver, and starlight colors. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 4:44pm ET A Solo Stove Yukon is 20% off for Black Friday, bringing the price of the fire pit down to $399.99 (from $499.99). The quality of a Solo Stove is immediately noticeable. There is dramatically less smoke from the moment you light the fire. Getting the fire lit is far easier too: The build is comprised of multiple layers that are easy to empty and clean so there's never ash in the way, and there's more airflow under the wood when you light it. Plus, it's super warm and perfect for sitting around with friends and family, making it the kind of deal that's worth it, since you'll use it all the time. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 4:36pm ET Tile trackers come in many forms, and a bunch of them are on sale during Black Friday. If you need a little extra help keeping track of your things, this sale is a good time to stock up. Tile trackers come in a few varieties, designed for different types of objects, and they all pair to a phone app. Using Bluetooth, you can locate your items geographically, but you can also have the tracker play a chime so you can follow the noise. Some of the Tiles are down to as low as $19.99, so check out all the sales at the link. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 4:28pm ET The Hearth Display is a family management tool that primarily functions as a shared digital calendar and to-do lists. It's a fancy tool—a 27-inch tablet that hangs on your wall—meant to replace your whiteboard calendar, chore charts, grocery lists, and more. The list price of a Hearth Display is $699, but if you're considering buying one, now is the cheapest time of the year to do it. During their Black Friday sale, a Hearth Display is currently $499. A 30% discount might be the nudge you need to buy a Hearth, but keep in mind that there's also a subscription, so you might want to apply the $200 you save to a Family Membership. A Hearth Display subscription costs $9 per month or $86 annually (paying upfront with the annual plan is 20% cheaper), and while you can use a Hearth without a subscription, it would be limited to its basic calendar functionality. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 4:11pm ET If you’re in the market for a compact speaker with excellent sound quality, the Sonos Era 100 is worth a look—especially now that it’s down to $199 on Amazon (from $249). It features dual-band Wi-Fi 6 for reliable streaming and Bluetooth 5.0 (this slightly older Bluetooth version might be a letdown for some), along with Apple AirPlay 2 support. That said, out of the plenty of streaming options this speaker gives you, including Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Tidal, and more, Google Cast isn't one of them. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 3:50pm ET Peloton has gotten into the habit of offering sweet deals on its bikes on all the major shopping holidays, so of course there's a nice Black Friday sale going. The basic model Bike is $1,295 (down from $1,445) and the fancier Bike+ is $1,995 (normally $2,495). Of the two, the Bike+ is the better sale compared to historical price data, but ultimately you should choose based on which fits your needs better. Here's a guide to help you decide between the Bike and the Bike+. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 3:26pm ET If you have been through the ringer searching for the perfect garden hose (one that is lightweight, that won’t split or burst, that is long enough, that is sturdy enough to last more than one season), here it is from Giraffe Tools—and it's on sale for Black Friday, down to $133.69 from $190.99. These are heavy, durable plastic reels that you wall mount within a few feet of your garden hose spigot. Installation is easy and the reel swivels from side to side so you can take the hose anywhere across the yard. The hose itself is incredibly lightweight and comes in varying lengths. The included handle is fine, but you can change it out if you prefer a different one.  Fri, November 29, 2024 at 3:08pm ET If you've had your eye on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses (no pun intended), then now's the perfect time to pick them up—for just $239.20, since Amazon has the glasses discounted for Black Friday by up to 20% off. In addition, you'll get a $90 digital credit for your next Amazon purchase. Just use the code WAYFARER90 when checking out. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 2:43pm ET The Amazon Fire TV 4K Max bundle with an Xbox Core wireless controller and one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is just $80 at Amazon instead of $142. This bundle will snag you Amazon's best streaming stick plus an Xbox controller and one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, turning it into a full-on cloud gaming device. It's not exactly a console in the traditional sense, but it'll get the job done, and is much more affordable (at least until the subscription fees start adding up). Fri, November 29, 2024 at 2:10pm ET The Nintendo Switch OLED with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is $275 at Target, down from $350. If you don't yet have a Nintendo Switch, this is the deal to get, giving you the console's upgraded version, plus one of its most popular games, for less than $300. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 1:38pm ET The PS5 Slim Digital Edition Fortnite Bundle is $375 at Amazon, down from $450. This digital edition of Sony's PlayStation 5 console has a slimmer build than launch models and eschews a disc drive, but comes with a DualSense controller, 1,000 V-Bucks, and a few Fortnite cosmetics. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 1:07pm ET Vibes High Fidelity Concert Ear Plugs protect you from tinnitus and hearing loss, but still let you clearly hear the band you came for. They're 25% off for Black Friday. The product was featured on Shark Tank, where the judges were impressed with Vibes' ability to reduce outside sounds by 22db while still allowing the wearer to hear what's going on around them at a reasonable level of fidelity. The mushy, muffle-everything ear plugs you've used before just block sound; these plugs filter it. They're precise enough that you can hear conversations while they're in, comfortable enough to wear all night, and nearly invisible, so no one will know you're using them. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 12:21pm ET Bissell has a lot of great deals for Black Friday, including the Little Green Machine, which is down to $81.49 from $123.59. This tiny machine with powerful suction enables you to spray cleaning solution on your soft surfaces, then scrub and vacuum it back out, resulting in immediately cleaner couches, carpets, and more. It has a tank to keep dirty water separate so you don't have to worry about dumping it too often and it's portable enough that you can haul it all over the house and even out to the car. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 11:45am ET For Black Friday, you can get the O-Cedar RinseClean spin mop for $59.39 instead of $69.97 and take advantage of all of its cool features, from its ability to spin excess water from your mop head to its separate clean and dirty water compartments, plus the secret mop stand hidden in the handle. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 11:20am ET The Yamaha FGDP-50 finger drum pad is versatile—and it's 20% off for Black Friday, bringing its price down to $239.99 (originally $299.99). The FGDP-50 is a portable, cordless, digital rhythm box that lets you play drums anywhere, in any style, with no other equipment. It's simple enough that anyone could pick it up and bang out a rhythm on any of the 58 preset drum kits instantly, but on a deeper level, it's real instrument, with an intuitively arranged set of responsive drum pads that allow for subtle percussion. You can program or import your own drum sounds, connect it to your computer or other gear, and use it to record and play \"real\" music. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 10:56am ET Now is a great time to purchase a Vitamix E310 Explorian, a high-quality blender that is $80 off for Black Friday, down from $379.95 to $299. The E310 has a 48-ounce container, 10 variable speeds, a pulse feature, and a radial cooling fan. You can even use it to make soup without a stove; the heat from the friction of its laser-cut, aircraft-grade stainless steel blades is all you need for a steaming bowl of minestrone in minutes. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 10:29am ET The Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) is now available for $53.99, down from $89.99, and comes in black, blue, green, purple, and white. It packs a 10,000mAh battery capacity, offering 27W wired charging through a USB-C port and 15W wireless charging for iPhones (12 series and up). And with Wireless PowerIQ (Anker's proprietary fast-charging tech) and the Qi2 standard, it claims to charge the latest iPhones more efficiently. The magnetic hold of this power bank is said to be strong enough to keep your phone securely in place, whether you’re charging it vertically or horizontally. That said, the wireless charging area lacks padding, which could be a concern if you’re particular about avoiding scratches. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 10:16am ET The Marshall Emberton II speaker, available in black and brass, black and steel, and cream, is a great choice for anyone who loves the iconic Marshall rock aesthetic—and it’s now $99.99 (down from $169.99) for Black Friday. For a speaker this size, the Emberton II offers impressive sound performance, driven by dual 10W amps and passive radiators. Its unique setup has the left channel firing through the front grille and the right through the back, which isn’t true stereo but still creates a room-filling sound. It’s great for mid-sized spaces and even some larger rooms, though it might fall short for outdoor gatherings or backyard parties. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 9:55am ET The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (12th Gen, 2024) is now $129.99 for Black Friday, down from $159.99—its lowest price yet, according to price-tracking tools. It’s a nice upgrade from the basic Kindle, featuring a larger 7-inch screen, three color options, an adjustable warm-and-cool front light, and a waterproof build (IPX8 rated). It comes with 16GB of storage, which is more than enough for eBooks but might feel a bit tight if you’re big on audiobooks (for which you'll need Bluetooth headphones since this model has no headphone jack). Fri, November 29, 2024 at 9:48am ET With all the tech you're stocking up on during Black Friday, you want to know you'll always be able to use it—even in a blackout or while you're camping or otherwise on the go. The Jackery 1000 is a honkin' huge battery that's half of on Amazon for Black Friday, down to $600. It boasts an output of 1,500W (enough to keep your refrigerator or air conditioner running in an emergency) and it weighs less than 24 pounds (small enough to tote around during non-emergencies, like camping trips). No matter the circumstances, make sure all your electronics are functioning when you need them. Fri, November 29, 2024 at 9:35am ET Whether you want to upgrade your old iPad or finally get one now that the Apple tablet is in its 10th generation of existence, Amazon’s current sale on the 10th Generation iPad is perfect, combining an instant 20% discount and a $29.01 coupon to bring the price down to just $250. Considering that the tablet was $449 when it launched, this new deal price gives it a huge bump in value. The bad news is that inventory is low—it's been fluctuating throughout Black Friday—but it's not sold out as of this writing.

When a product gets the eBay Certified Refurbished label, the site is standing behind it, which means they\u0026#39;re confident it’ll work and look like new.

So with this refurbished pair, you get a huge price drop from $350 down to $209, and then, with coupon code “SHOPCYBER20,” you get another 20% off that, bringing the total down to $167.20. \u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003c/div\u003e\n                                            \n                                            \u003cdiv x-show=\"0 || showAll\"\u003e\n                            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                \n\n                                \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTue, December 3, 2024 at 11:14am ET\u003c/span\u003e\n                            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n                            \u003cp\u003eA great duffel bag is still on sale after Cyber Monday, and if you didn\u0026#39;t snag one last time it was discounted, take another look, because this is one of the best (and most affordable!) gym bags out there.

That said, the wireless charging area lacks padding, which could be a concern if you’re particular about avoiding scratches.\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003c/div\u003e\n                                            \u003cdiv x-show=\"0 || showAll\"\u003e\n                            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                \n\n                                \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFri, November 29, 2024 at 10:16am ET\u003c/span\u003e\n                            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n                            \u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/a5bv0k?pageview_type=Standard\u0026amp;template=blog-update\u0026amp;module=content-body\u0026amp;element=offer\u0026amp;item=text-link\u0026amp;element_label=Marshall%20Emberton%20II\u0026amp;short_url=a5bv0k\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ftech%2Fextended-cyber-week-sale-best-tech-deals-2024\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"open in a new window\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eMarshall Emberton II\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e speaker, available in black and brass, black and steel, and cream, is a great choice for anyone who loves the iconic Marshall rock aesthetic—and it’s now $99.99 (down from $169.99) for Black Friday. For a speaker this size, the Emberton II offers impressive sound performance, driven by dual 10W amps and passive radiators. Its unique setup has the left channel firing through the front grille and the right through the back, which isn’t true stereo but still creates a room-filling sound.
