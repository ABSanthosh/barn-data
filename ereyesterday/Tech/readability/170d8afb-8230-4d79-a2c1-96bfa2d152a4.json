  "description": "Buried in the blog posts and videos that accompanied Google's The Android Show: I/O Edition announcements was a nugget of Nothing news: The Nothing Phone 3 is going to be expensive. In an Android marketing video showcasing the company's phones, Nothing CEO Carl Pei shared that the new phone will cost around £800 when it launches this summer. That new cost is thanks to Nothing's decision to go \"all-in\" on the new device by including \"premium materials, major performance upgrades and software that really levels things up,\" according to Pei. The Nothing Phone 2 launched at £580 in the UK and $600 in the US, so selling the Phone 3 at £800 is a noticeable price jump. Assuming Nothing follows through on the premium upgrades it's promising, though, maybe it'll make sense that the Phone 3 costs as much as a Pixel 9 or iPhone 16. Nothing made its name on affordable phones that have unique, premium designs. For example, the company launched the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro in March 2025, the budget and mid-range counterparts to the Phone 3. Both phones use mid-range chips and camera sensors, but feature a futuristic design and clever AI features that you'd expect out of a much more expensive device. Switching to trying to compete with Apple and Samsung in terms of price suggests Nothing is confident, at the very least. We'll have to wait until this summer when the Phone 3 is actually released to see if that confidence is justified.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/carl-pei-teases-the-all-in-nothing-phone-3-with-a-flagship-price-213023983.html?src=rss",
