  "text": "Mar 27, 2025 [[read-time]] min read From dude ranches to distant shores, here’s what’s trending for summer travel. Since many of us are beginning our summer travel prep, we decided to take a look at Google Flights and Search trends for insights — and inspiration — for these upcoming adventures. Here’s a look at what we found:Beach-bound getawaysThe top-trending destinations on Google Flights for summer 2025 include several popular vacation spots — especially coastal and island locations. Islands like Puerto Rico, Curacao and St. Lucia are trending, and outside of the Caribbean, people are seeking the sun and the sea in places like Rio de Janeiro, Maui and Nantucket.Given this coastal curiosity, it’s no surprise that “island vacation outfits” are also currently trending on Search — as are “wide leg linen pants.” (And if you want more inspiration for what to wear, check out our latest fashion trends.)Outdoor adventuresDestinations with easy access to the great outdoors, like Billings, Montana, Juneau, Alaska and Bangor, Maine are trending in the U.S. And along those same lines, “cabins” are the top-trending type of lodging for romantic getaways, and “dude ranch” is the top-trending type of vacation for families in the U.S. this year.For shorter weekend getaways, outdoor destinations like upstate New York, Joshua Tree National Park and Sedona, Arizona are also trending on Search.Super-sized suitcasesFinally, there's one longer term trend we noticed this year: It looks like people are trying to pack a bit more into every trip — literally. Historically, searches for “carry on bags” surpassed “checked bags.” But in recent years, “checked bags” have been searched more than ever. In fact, \"vacuum bags” and “compression packing cubes” are top-trending searches for “best ____ for travel”! Now just be sure to leave a little extra room for a souvenir or two (or three)!",
