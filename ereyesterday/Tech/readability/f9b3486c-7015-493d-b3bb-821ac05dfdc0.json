What is the best overall DIY home security system? No matter where you're located, you'll want to protect your house and family sufficiently. So it isn't a surprise that many turn to home security system. However, most home systems have flaws, such as the setup process being too daunting or being riddled with expensive subscriptions. For setup, the traditional option is to get a professionally installed security system. However, professional installation has high equipment costs and hefty installation fees. If you want home security on a budget, the DIY route to installing a security system might be the way to go.Home security systems bring peace of mind to you and your family. DIY home security systems are better than ever today, bringing exceptional modularity to your home. They let you add motion sensors, outdoor cameras, full-on alarm systems and more. You'll have to make many choices, and each will have to be suitable for your personal needs, but we're here to help you.The CNET team has a wealth of experience, with hundreds of hours spent testing the best DIY home security systems over the past seven years. After all that research and testing, our pick for the top DIY home security system is the reliable, affordable and expandable eight-piece, second-gen Ring Alarm Kit. Its many features will ensure that your home feels secure. That said, this kit might not be the best for you, and the right system for you will depend on your individual needs. If you live in an apartment, don't worry; we reviewed DIY home security systems specifically designed for apartments. We also provide options for those who already have a variety of smart home technology, along with tips on what to consider while shopping.. If you want to start a little smaller, check out our lists of the best indoor security cameras and outdoor security cameras, as well as our rundown on the cheapest home cameras. See below to learn more about the best DIY home security systems for you.Read more: How to Turn Your Old iPhone or Android Into a Home Security Camera for FreeA quick note about DIY: In this context, DIY means that you pick out products yourself and install them yourself, handling both the physical hardware and setup via an app. DIY systems are often wireless and may use quick installation options like adhesive. That’s not guaranteed for every system, although it’s true of many of our picks below. You won’t have to arrange for a professional to visit your home or give you a quote to take advantage of these systems, and they won’t lock you into any contract. Although the subscriptions aren't required, they do add some useful features.Best DIY home security systems of 2025This eight-piece Ring Alarm system offers an excellent kit for smaller homes at a reasonable price, with a reliable platform that can easily connect to any Amazon Echo or Alexa devices you may have (if you choose a subscription). The kit includes a base station, a keypad for arming/disarming, four contact sensors for guarding various entry points, a motion detector and a range extender if your Wi-Fi network doesn’t quite reach the outskirts of your home where you’d like to place sensors.Ring’s app offers a simple setup process that first-timers shouldn’t have much difficulty with. If you’d like to add other devices over time, Ring products like a Ring video doorbell or a Ring security camera will happily work with your app and may connect to the hub as well. Other smart home devices may not be as compatible -- parent company Amazon prefers to keep Ring within its own ecosystem of products, so integrations with platforms like Google Assistant aren’t possible.Finally, the Ring Protect plan offers a few extras at its lowest tier, but things get much more interesting at the $20 per month Pro plan, which adds home monitoring -- making your DIY one a professionally monitored system -- that can be a valuable add-on for those who want professional responses during emergencies. The Ring Alarm Pro is similar to our top Ring Alarm pick but with a few key differences. It’s more expensive, and the primary reason is its included Eero Wi-Fi 6 router. For some people, that’s great: Wi-Fi 6 is the latest router standard that many people still haven’t upgraded to, and you don’t have to worry about choosing a new router separately. For others who have a preferred router brand or already have a Wi-Fi 6 router, the Pro package presents a problem, because some features won’t work without this particular router.Otherwise, the Pro system includes a keypad, four contact sensors and a motion sensor as well as an alarm range extender (although the kit doesn’t include alarm sensors so you’ll need to buy these separately). Again, it’s a great package for Alexa users and those who are interested in adding more Ring or Amazon products down the road. SimpliSafe was one of the first DIY home security systems to hit the market and is a reasonable alternative to ADT and other professional alarm company firms. That's due in large part to its affordable cost and wide variety of accessories in comparison to most security systems. SimpliSafe makes a variety of different starter kits that usually start at around $320, and you can often get them for less through discounts. SimpliSafe's impressive array of accessories such as indoor and outdoor security cameras, key fob, additional motion sensors, smoke detectors, glass break sensors and siren, and its solid performance for the price makes it an easy choice. A subscription plan is necessary to get all features, and those start at around $10 per month for self-monitoring. Arlo, the maker of one of our favorite outdoor security cameras, introduced its home security system in 2022 and it immediately stood out for its All-in-One sensors. While most home security sensors serve a single purpose such as motion or sound detection, the Arlo All-in-One sensors are capable of eight different detection functions. The sensors can detect motion and sounds such as smoke or CO alarms, plus changes in ambient light or temperature. That's great if you have a small place like an apartment, dorm or bedroom and want quick sensor placement that can do a little of everything, anywhere.If you want to go bigger, it's easy to customize the system by adding Arlo cams or doorbells that will also work with the hub. You don't need an Arlo Secure plan for basic features, but if you branch out we suggest it to get extras like video storage. The Abode Smart Security kit is slightly smaller than our other picks, providing a hub, one mini door/window sensor, a motion sensor and a key fob. You can easily purchase separate sensor packs to expand it, and even its slimmed-down kit offers serious advantages. Notably, it’s one of the few DIY systems that works well with Apple’s Home app and Siri. That’s only the beginning of Abode’s smart home integration, which also supports numerous products from Sonos, Bose, Yale, Schlage, Philips Hue, Ecobee and many more. That makes it the perfect fit for someone who already has a family of (random) smart devices to link up.Abode’s standard subscription plan includes video storage and enables much of that smart home integration, so we highly suggest considering it. The much more expensive Pro plan gives you professional home monitoring but not many other notable additions.DIY home security systems compared Best DIY home security systemsRing Alarm (2nd-gen)Ring Alarm ProSimpliSafe (8-piece set)Arlo Home SecurityAbode Smart System price $250$300$320$200$280Monitoring price $20/month$20/month$32/month$25$229 (annual plan only) or $19/monthStarter equipment Door/window sensors, motion detectors, a keypad, a siren and optional professional monitoring subscriptionsEero Wi-Fi 6 mesh router, door/window sensors, motion detectors, a keypad, a siren and optional professional monitoring subscriptions1 base station, 1 keypad, 1 motion sensor, 3 entry sensors1 keypad control panel, 2 All-in-One sensors1 base station, two mini door/window sensors, 1 glass break sensor, 1 motion sensor, 1 key fobContract required?

Since you're here, you've probably already decided to go the DIY route, so here are some more parameters to consider when shopping around for home security systems.Equipment and installation Do you just need to keep watch over your entryways? A good video doorbell for your front door and an outdoor camera covering the back may be all you need; easy to install and monitor yourself. If you want to keep closer tabs on your home inside and out with 24/7 monitoring and quick access to emergency response services, you'll want a more robust system. Most DIY (and professional brands too) offer home security bundles with most, if not all, of the equipment you'd need to get started and the ability to add single devices as needed.Smart home compatibilityMost home security devices are compatible with Alexa and Google Home smart hubs, but if you prefer Apple HomeKit or another smart home ecosystem, you may have to do a bit more shopping and comparing to find a system compatible with your existing smart home devices. Don't fret over compatibility too much, as Matter will make it easier to connect previously incompatible devices.Costs, upfront and ongoing We listed \"cost\" last here for a reason. A complete home security system will likely cost you at least a couple of hundred bucks, so be prepared for that. There's the potential to spend lots more on equipment, or a lot less; you can find cameras for under $30.Find your budget range and compare systems in that range across brands. For a home security kit, most starter bundles fall in the same range. If you're comfortable with self-monitoring, DIY systems may not come with any ongoing costs. Monthly subscriptions (without a contract) for cloud storage, enhanced features and possibly even professional monitoring are typically an option with DIY systems, often for lower monthly fees than professional services. Show more Hands-on testing is core to our evaluations of any home security products. In short, when it comes to home security systems, we pay special attention to the user experience, the promised features, reliability and overall value, along with a few other elements. We do the testing in a real home environment over at least a full week. If you want to read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security systems and services. Show more The above systems weren't the only DIY options we explored. Here are other competitive security systems we took a look at, and why they didn't quite make our list.Cove: Cove’s standard lineup is fine, but its generic quality struggled to compete with our picks. If you can’t really find what you’re looking for on our list, stop by Cove to check how its kits fit.Lorex: Lorex is an excellent home security option for those who prefer sticking with local storage. It is a bit expensive compared to other DIY systems and may require working with its somewhat clunky recorder.Frontpoint: Frontpoint has a strong array of kits, but like ADT, its massive home monitoring fees (starting at $50) are too difficult to recommend.Kangaroo: Kangaroo has budget-friendly systems but struggles with design quality. If you want to save as much money as possible, you may want to give it a try.Wyze: Wyze offers a great starter home kit, but its current security flaws keep it off our list for now. Show more How do I choose the best DIY home security system? There are a few considerations to take into account when choosing the right DIY home security system. Cost is one of the main factors when choosing a home security setup, both upfront for equipment and potential ongoing subscription fees for monitoring or storage. A starter system may only begin at $100, especially if you find it on sale. Others can set you back $200 to $300 or more, and the price could inflate even higher with each sensor, camera or alarm you add. Adding another layer of complication to the equation: Many of these systems see significant discounts throughout the year.Speaking of adding devices, be sure to factor in the number of areas, such as doors and windows, you'll want to place a camera or sensor when choosing a DIY security kit. Some DIY security systems may come with a base and one or two sensors while others, like the Ring Alarm Pro, come with four sensors, a motion sensor and a range extender. Higher-priced DIY security systems are likely to come with more devices, plus lots of useful features and compatibility with other smart home devices, which is something else you'll want to consider when choosing a DIY home security system. Review our factors guide above to learn more.Finally, you'll want to consider local versus subscription storage and monitoring options. A DIY Ring system, for example, could offer several monitoring and data storage options for an added monthly cost that isn't available with other devices. On the other hand, if you'd rather monitor your home security system and handle data storage yourself, many devices allow you to do so at no extra cost. Show more Is it better to have professional home security service over a DIY version? A DIY home security system certainly has its advantages, like lower pricing and simple self-installation, but professional security has its perks. DIY systems are typically easy to install and set up. You won't have to worry about setup if your system is installed by an experienced technician. Professional systems are generally more expensive than DIY but may come with lower upfront costs. It's possible to get free or discounted equipment and free installation with a professional system but keep in mind that you may also have to sign a one- or two-year contract.Signing a contract is unfortunate, but the level of monitoring, support and warranties may be worth it. While DIY systems often come with warranties, monitoring options and technical support on their own, professional services are likely going to deliver a more hassle-free experience if you're willing to pay for it.  Show more How much do DIY home security systems cost? A DIY security system can cost $60 to $400 or more depending on the brand and model you buy and where you purchase it. For a higher cost example, SimpliSafe's 10-piece DIY home security system lists for $504 on its website. Those prices can go much higher if you opt for all the bells and whistles the service offers.Like with any addition or upgrade to your home, you'll want to evaluate the costs, and what you get for the money when choosing a DIY security system for your home. It's easy for the cost of a DIY system to add up, but keep in mind that choosing a cheaper system that doesn't meet your needs may not be worth your while either. Show more",

similar to our top Ring Alarm pick but with a few key differences. It’s more expensive, and the primary reason is its included Eero Wi-Fi 6 router. For some people, that’s great: Wi-Fi 6 is the latest router standard that many people still haven’t upgraded to, and you don’t have to worry about choosing a new router separately. For others who have a preferred router brand or already have a Wi-Fi 6 router, the Pro package presents a problem, because some features won’t work without this particular router.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, the Pro system includes a keypad, four contact sensors and a motion sensor as well as an alarm range extender (although the kit doesn’t include alarm sensors so you’ll need to buy these separately).

A starter system may only begin at $100, especially if you find it on sale. Others can set you back $200 to $300 or more, and the price could inflate even higher with each sensor, camera or alarm you add. Adding another layer of complication to the equation: Many of these systems see significant discounts throughout the year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of adding devices, be sure to factor in the number of areas, such as doors and windows, you\u0026#39;ll want to place a camera or sensor when choosing a DIY security kit. Some DIY security systems may come with a base and one or two sensors while others, like the Ring Alarm Pro, come with four sensors, a motion sensor and a range extender. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHigher-priced DIY security systems are likely to come with more devices, plus lots of useful features and compatibility with other smart home devices, which is something else you\u0026#39;ll want to consider when choosing a DIY home security system. Review our factors guide above to learn more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, you\u0026#39;ll want to consider local versus subscription storage and monitoring options. A DIY Ring system, for example, could offer several monitoring and data storage options for an added monthly cost that isn\u0026#39;t available with other devices. On the other hand, if you\u0026#39;d rather monitor your home security system and handle data storage yourself, many devices allow you to do so at no extra cost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-a1292ae9-1956-4cff-a21b-d7aa4c2f7277\" data-location=\"LIST\" pagelayout=\"FAQ Markup + BL Precap\" imagegroup=\"{\u0026#34;imageData\u0026#34;:{},\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;float\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lightbox\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotCrop\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageDoNotResize\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageWatermark\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;imageParallax\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageCrop\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imageEnlarge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eIs it better to have professional home security service over a DIY version?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eA DIY home security system certainly has its advantages, like lower pricing and simple self-installation, but \u003ca target=\"_self\" data-id=\"41a788e4-76dd-42fd-b0e5-9f51c9e265b4\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/security/diy-home-security-vs-professionally-installed-systems-which-is-best-for-you/\"\u003eprofessional security has its perks\u003c/a\u003e.
