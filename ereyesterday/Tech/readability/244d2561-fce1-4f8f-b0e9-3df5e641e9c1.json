Not a great fit for someone between who wants to do something temporary between jobs, supplemental around their existing full time job or who need a stable level of income.The work is very different by client but not terribly difficult. However, no matter how senior you are there is a pretty low ceiling on what our clients are willing to pay.

Make an Impact on Climate! Looking for Data Stores and Full-Stack Engineers (Remote, US)At Insight M, we combine innovative aerospace systems with advanced data science. Unlike traditional aerospace companies, we sell information, not hardware - we operate our sensors cost-effectively at a continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problems.First on our list: spotting hard-to-monitor emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018, Insight M has removed methane emissions equal to over 250 million tonnes of CO2e through our work. To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to over 60 million cars being removed from the roads or shutting down about one hundred and sixty 350 MW coal-fired power plants for a year.

We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models [2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like RF-DETR [3] and Supervision [4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog [5] and YouTube channel [6].We have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy \u0026 we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders \u0026 problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)We're currently hiring for full-stack engineers to help build our product, field engineers that work directly with our customers to solve their business needs with computer vision, and several technical roles on the sales team.We raised our Series B round at the end of last year, led by GV. With this round, we will continue building the open source tools, platform, and community so developers and enterprises can deploy computer vision applications to production.
