Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! At Google Arts \u0026 Culture, engineers and artists in residence collaborate on AI projects to help you connect with culture in engaging, educational and playful ways. Here are some of their newest experiments to try.HotspotsGoogle Arts \u0026 Culture has been digitizing art collections in ultra-high resolution for many years thanks to Art Camera, a custom-built camera that can capture “gigapixel” images made up of more than one billion pixels, revealing the details that can be invisible to the naked eye.Making the most of Gemini's analytical capabilities, our new Hotspots feature identifies key points of interest directly on the image of a cultural artifact and reveals them via interactive dots overlaid on the image. Simply tap on a hotspot to reveal hidden details and fascinating trivia about that specific part of the artwork. Go deeper into artwork and artifacts with interactive Hotspots. Sparky and Learning LightGet playful with Sparky, an experiment by Google Arts \u0026 Culture Lab artist in residence Lex Fefegha that lets you combine everyday objects into wacky creations with the help of Google AI. For instance, you can combine objects to make a new gadget to eat your favorite food, dream up a new instrument to make music or work on a new vehicle for travel. Based on your inputs, you’ll be presented with your inventor alter ego, connecting you to inventors whose ideas changed our daily lives.In Learning Light, an experiment by Google Arts \u0026 Culture Lab artist in residence Jack Wild, you can explore the basics of stage lighting with your assistant Luxbot, powered by Gemini. It's an interactive lighting studio to introduce to the subject of lighting design and theory. Learn and get creative with Sparky and Learning Light. PodcastsWith our experimental Podcasts feature, Gemini AI generates insightful audio episodes about selected cultural artifacts. You can learn about how the mighty brown bear, technically a carnivore, actually gets about 90% of its diet from plants. Or, follow ancient Chinese pottery's journey across Eurasia via audio. It's a new way to transform your commute or relaxation time into cultural exploration. Press play on culture with new AI podcasts. Head to Google Arts \u0026 Culture to explore these new experiments and many more.",
