  "text": "But Russia presumably gets no taxes on illegal crypto mining, and power outages can be costly for everyone in a region. So next year, Russia will ban crypto mining in 10 regions for six years and place seasonal restrictions that would disrupt some crypto mining operations during the coldest winter months in regions like Irkutsk, CoinTelegraph reported. Illegal mining is still reportedly thriving in Irkutsk, though, despite the government's attempts to shut down secret farms. To deter any illegal crypto mining disrupting power grids last year, authorities seized hundreds of crypto mining rigs in Irkutsk, Crypto News reported. In July, Russian president Vladimir Putin linked blackouts to illegal crypto mines, warning that crypto mining currently consumes \"almost 1.5 percent of Russia’s total electricity consumption,\" but \"the figure continues to go up,\" the Moscow Times reported. And in September, Reuters reported that illegal mines were literally going underground to avoid detection as Russia's crackdown continues. Even though illegal mines are seemingly common in parts of Siberia and increasingly operating out of the public eye, finding an illegal mine hidden on state land controlled by an electrical utility was probably surprising to officials. The power provider was not named in the announcement, and there are several in the region, so it's not currently clear which one made the controversial decision to lease state land to an illegal mining operation.",
