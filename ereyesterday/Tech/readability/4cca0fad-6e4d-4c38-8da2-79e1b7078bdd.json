  "text": "The slate of animation coming to France‚Äôs annual Annecy Festival, running June 8-15, has been announced. And with it comes a lot of exciting presentations from global studios big and small celebrating the timelessness and reach of the medium around the world. Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Animation, DreamWorks, and Sony Animation are among the larger studios making a splash at the festival, including anticipated projects from Star Wars, Stranger Things, Marvel, and DC. None other than Bugs Bunny himself, drawn in classic 2D by Warner Bros.‚Äô Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, presented the Annecy trailer this year. The delightful short ad was directed by Grant Orchard (Hey Duggee) with executive producer Ben Bocquelet (The Amazing World of Gumball) with Eric Bauza voicing WB‚Äôs iconic character. It‚Äôs got us really excited for the annual international event and hopeful for more of the Looney Tunes‚Äô presence during the ceremonies. Here are some of the titles we‚Äôre most excited to see and learn more about. Star Wars: Visions Fans of the anthology series will get an early peek at season three, which arrives in October and is led by Japanese animation houses. The specific short getting an Annecy spotlight, ‚ÄúBlack,‚Äù is directed by Shinya Ohira and centers ‚Äúa psychedelic battle between past and present, light and dark, and life and death plays out in the haunted psyche of an Imperial trooper who is on the cusp of defeat.‚Äù Pixar Animation Studios Spotlight Pixar CCO Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up, Inside Out, Soul) will be presenting a showcase of the studio‚Äôs upcoming slate including Elio, Hoppers, and Toy Story 5.¬†The festival will also celebrate 30 years of Toy Story with new behind-the-scenes look at the CG animated film that started it all. Walt Disney Animation Studios‚Äô Zootopia 2 Walt Disney Animation Studios‚Äô CCO and award winning director-writer Jared Bush (Encanto, Zootopia, Moana) will appear at Annecy for the first time to give a sneak peek at Zootopia 2. Marvel Animation ‚Äì Eyes of Wakanda Marvel Animation will host a special ‚Äúmaking-of session‚Äù that will double as an exclusive premiere screening of the first episodes of its Black Panther universe series Eyes of Wakanda. ‚ÄúThe story follows the adventures of brave Wakandan warriors throughout history. In this globe-trotting adventure, the heroes must carry out dangerous missions to retrieve Vibranium artifacts from the enemies of Wakanda. They are the Hatut Zaraze and this is their story.‚Äù The series hits Disney+ in August. A Legendary Encounter: Icons of Animation Celebrate The Simpsons The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, executive producer and showrunner Matt Selman, and animator David Silverman are set to be honored at the festival for the longest-running animated show‚Äôs achievements in the arts. A panel will ‚Äúoffer a rare insight into the groundbreaking legacy of The Simpsons in animation,‚Äù among other events that will take attendees behind the scenes of modern pop culture‚Äôs first family of animation. WB Animation‚Äôs Bat-Fam ¬© WB Animation The creators behind Merry Little Batman including director Mike Roth will lift the lid on the caped crusader and son‚Äôs continuing adventures with Bat-Fam. Creating Creativity: Celebrating 25 Years of Cartoon Network Studios A conversation between creators of Cartoon Network‚Äôs most formative animation shows during its first 25 years, including Gendy Tartakovsky (Dexter‚Äôs Laboratory), Craig McCracken (The Powerpuff Girls), Pendleton Ward (Adventure Time), Rebecca Sugar (Steven Universe), J.G. Quintel (Regular Show), and¬† Adam Muto (Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake). Netflix Animation‚Äôs Stranger Things and In Your Dreams Stranger Things: Tales from ‚Äô85 showrunner Eric Robles will be on hand to give the world a first look at the animated show in the universe of Stranger Things. The streaming platform will also give a peek at¬† brother and sister adventure feature fantasy film In Your Dreams,¬†which centers around the siblings going dream-hopping to find the sandman. Animal Farm Andy Serkis‚Äô adaptation of¬† George Orwell‚Äôs ever-so timely Animal Farm¬†will make its debut at Annecy as an official selection screening event. The film is directed by Serkis, written by Nick Stoller, produced by Aniventure and Imaginarium with CG production by Cinesite. Naruto x Oasis ¬© Annecy Festival This looks unhinged as beloved anime Naruto sees a collab with Oasis ‚Äúcelebrating manga culture with an animated film inspired by the openings, taking the audience into an epic adventure alongside the Oasis mascots. This project pays tribute to the aesthetic and narrative codes of anime, captivating manga fans.‚Äù Sony Animation The all-animal animated sports feature Goat from Tyree Dillihay and co-director Adam Rosette will be featured at the festival. No word on any Spider-Verse action, however. DreamWorks The Bad Guys 2 will make its debut at the festival. We‚Äôre hoping there will be some sort of update on The Wild Robot 2, which we‚Äôre eagerly anticipating. For more information about Annecy 2025 visit the festival‚Äôs official site here.
