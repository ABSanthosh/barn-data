  "text": "Star Wars’ return to theaters in 1999 with Phantom Menace introduced audiences to Jake Lloyd, who played the young Anakin Skywalker. While Hayden Christensen would play the character in later appearnaces, Lloyd eventually faded from the public eye. That changed when last March, he and his mother Lisa revealed he’d been in rehab for nearly a year after suffering a psychotic break and was diagoned with paranoid schizophrenia. Since then, Lloyd has “accepted taking on continued treatment, and therapy, and my meds,” he said in a recent interview with Clayton Sandell. Having recently completed his 18-month rehab stint, the actor said he’s been able to recognize his schizophrenia diagnosis. For years, Lloyd had anosognosia, a neurological condition that made him unknowingly deny his symptoms. Hitting such a low point has allowed “good things” to happen, he continued, such as “honestly taking part in treatment, my meds, and living with my diagnosis.” Prior to last year, the general assumption was the harsh criticism Lloyd received after Phantom’s release contributed to his breakdown, similar to how backlash against Jar Jar Binks back then nearly drove Ahmed Best to suicide. At the time, his mother refuted those claims, and revealed her son’s paternal side had a history of schizophrenia. For her and the rest of his family, Lloyd’s improvement is a “big relief. He’s getting so much better than he was,” added Lisa Lloyd. “We’re all just thrilled that he’s doing as well as he is, and that he’s working really hard at it.” Overall, Lloyd says he’s feeling “pretty good” nowadays, and said he was greatly appreciative of the fan support he’s received over the past year. Public appearances are currently off the table, but it sounds like he still holds affection for Star Wars: he told Sandell he’s recently watched Ahsoka and put time into Star Wars: The Old Republic and the original Force Unleashed, and is looking to play the sequel. And while he hasn’t watched any of the recent movies, he said he’s “holding out for May the Fourth with my mom.” Sandell’s full story with Jake Lloyd can be read here. Want more io9 news?
