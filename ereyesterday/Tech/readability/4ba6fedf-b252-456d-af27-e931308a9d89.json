It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! The perfect job for gamers? Road traffic sounds, such as emergency vehicles and other warning signals, are transmitted via microphones to the teledriver’s headphones. This operator could technically be sitting on the other side of the world. Most will be nearby at one of Vay’s teledriving centres. As it expands, Vay is looking for more teledrivers to whisk empty cars around Sin City. According to a recent job listing on the company website, here’s how you could land the gig:     You like to drive (and consider yourself a safe and responsible driver). Safety first, second, and third! You are happy working late shifts (afternoons and evenings) as this is what we need for this role. You have a US driving license, clean driving record, and at least two years of driving experience with Uber, Lyft, taxi or similar. You can pass a drug test (including THC). You’re into gaming (or at least super familiar with technology). You are organised and well-structured. You are resilient and have a troubleshooting mindset. You have Google Workplace knowledge (e.g., G-Docs, Sheets, and/or Slides). You are interested in autonomous driving and mobility. If you get the job, you’ll have to pass through Vay’s Remote Driving Academy. The boot camp prepares remote drivers for professional teledriving on public streets and trains them in defensive driving techniques.    Vay bills teledriving as a midway point between conventional cars and autonomous vehicles, which are proving much more difficult to implement than first thought. The company is also making its first foray into remote-controlled trucking.   For drivers, sitting in an office behind a screen is perhaps more comfortable — and definitely safer — than sitting behind the wheel of an actual car or truck.  For customers, it could be a cheaper and more convenient alternative to traditional car-sharing. Vay says the service costs half as much as an Uber. Customers in Vegas pay $0.30 per minute when driving and $0.03 per minute for stopovers. There’s no minimum length or distance and rentals are available for up to 12 hours. For operators of short-term car rental or sharing services, Var claims it can double the amount of time vehicles are in use, boosting revenues.    Vay is the only company ever to have tested a driverless vehicle on public roads in both Europe and the US. Las Vegas was the first city to green-light commercial operations, and Vay hopes to use it as a springboard into the wider US market. Vay also has big plans for Europe — starting with its home country. The company is currently in discussions with German authorities about a domestic rollout.",
