Oscar-nominated actor and Elmo confidante Andrew Garfield has finally gone on a \"date\" with Amanda Dimoldenberg, the creator and host of the 10-year-old YouTube chat show, Chicken Shop Date. And, yes, they are very cute together.Garfield and Dimoldenberg have generated a fair amount of buzz thanks to a couple of flirty exchanges they shared (they initially met when Dimoldenberg was covering the red carpet at the GQ \"Men of the Year 2022\" event and shared another moment at the 2023 Golden Globes). So, when it became known that Garfield would appear on Chicken Shop Date — where Dimoldenberg queries celebrities in the manner of an often flirty, sometimes awkward date — the shipping reached next level. The actual date, which dropped on Friday, was quite flirty and giggly, with the stoic Dimoldenberg appearing to fall victim to Garfield's intense stares, gentle teasing, and, at one point, hand holding.
