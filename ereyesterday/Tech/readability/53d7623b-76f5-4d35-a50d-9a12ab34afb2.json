  "text": "Is it already time for another Samsung Unpacked event? You bet your ass it is. Samsung has announced it’ll be hosting an event next month on July 9 for what’ll presumably be its latest Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold foldable Android phones. Unlike previous years, when Samsung announced new foldable phones in Paris and Seoul, this go-around will be in Brooklyn, New York (my hometown!) starting at 10:00 a.m. ET / 7 a.m. PT. Gizmodo will be at the event live, but there will also be a live stream on Samsung’s YouTube channel and Samsung’s website. © Samsung Samsung’s not sharing any details today, except for the teaser image above and video below, and this one-liner it emailed us: “With AI leading the way, Galaxy devices are evolving from reactionary smartphones to anticipatory smart companions – transforming how we communicate, create, and connect.” It’s not much to go on, but it hints at more agentic AI applications that take actions on your behalf—you know, the stuff that Apple promised with its contextually aware, AI-powered Siri that it failed to deliver and reportedly won’t ship until next year. Samsung's doing another Unpacked event on July 9. Expect foldables. New Z Flip and Z Foldable. The teaser says \"Ultra Unfolds.\" If this video is any hint, the phones are gonna be thiiinnnnn pic.twitter.com/FhkfyLGEqD — Ray Wong (@raywongy) June 23, 2025 Ultra Versions of the Z Flip and Z Fold? Just because Samsung isn’t spoiling its new foldables early doesn’t mean we don’t already know stuff about them. This being the internet, many of the important details have already leaked. At the end of the teaser video, the words “ultra unfolds” flash. This is most likely a nod to the “Ultra” branding that already exists for Samsung’s main Galaxy S-series phones, with the name suggesting the best of everything the company can throw at it. The best foldable screen(s), the best hinge, the best cameras, the best performance, the best battery life—hopefully it lives up to the Ultra name. Samsung also not-so-subtly teased as much with a post on its U.S. newsroom page earlier this month. For years, Samsung has listened to users asking for bigger screens, better cameras and new ways to connect and create. The demand is clear — an Ultra-experience that goes beyond a simple list of upgraded features in a smaller and more portable form factor. … With industry-leading hardware, cutting-edge performance and seamless AI integration optimized for the foldable format, it’s what users have come to expect from Galaxy Ultra. And when it unfolds, it transforms– into a more immersive entertainment hub, a spacious workspace, or a multitasking powerhouse, now enhanced by powerful Galaxy AI features designed specifically for the foldable fo Samsung’s either skipping what would be the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 for the Galaxy Z Flip Ultra and Z Fold Ultra, respectively, or an even more premium-tier Galaxy Z Ultra foldable will be announced alongside the annual refreshes. Leaked images suggest Samsung’s foldables will be thinner than the current Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. Samsung’s own teaser video also shows two seemingly super-slim halves coming apart. For the new Z Flip, the cover screen could expand edge to edge, similar to the ones on Motorola’s new Razr flip-style foldables. More pixels are always appreciated on the cover screen, and it means apps should be able to run without needing to open the Z Flip. As for the new Z Fold, leaked CAD files show the book-style foldable could be as thin as 9mm when closed and 4.54mm when unfolded. That would be seriously skinny and make the Z Fold as thick as regular non-folding phones when closed. Either way, we’ll know more in a few weeks. Stay tuned!",
