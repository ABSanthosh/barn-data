One new leak makes that seem almost certain.Chinese manufacturer Inno3D appears to have leaked its iChill X3 version of the rumored RTX 5090 GPU, courtesy of VideoCardz. The leak, which amounts to some product art that presumably exists for a future online shop webpage, doesn't tell us much. However, the packaging seems to confirm that the 5090 will come with 32GB of GDDR7 memory, twice the capacity of the rumored 5080 graphics card. Mashable Light Speed In layman's terms, that means it should be really fast and capable of doing a lot, whether it's in the realm of gaming, bitcoin farming, or artificial intelligence applications. It will also likely be expensive, as these things tend to be. Unfortunately, this leak doesn't tell us much else, such as pricing or a specific release date.But we likely won't have to wait much longer to find out. Nvidia is hosting the big keynote address to kick off CES on Monday.",
