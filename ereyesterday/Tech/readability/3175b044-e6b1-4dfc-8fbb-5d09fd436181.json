The agency announced on Saturday that it will use its @NTSB_Newsroom account to share ”news conferences or other investigative information.“The NTSB later said, “Reporters should email mediarelations@ntsb.gov for all other inquiries,” claiming that it was meant to “better manage the volume of” emails about the two incidents n. “The NTSB media relations team has always used Twitter/X to inform the media and public on the time and location of media briefings. We cannot respond to every email asking for the details of media briefings,” the NTSB said, without explaining the process behind the decision or why an agency would rely solely on one privately owned social media platform.At the same time, the US Department of Defense is also removing major outlets, like NBC News, The New York Times, NPR, and Politico, from their dedicated workstations in the Pentagon, according to a report from NBC. Instead, the DoD will impose an “annual media rotation program” that will replace the outlets with conservative-leaning ones, like One America News Network, the New York Post, and Breitbart. It also includes HuffPost even though it doesn’t have a Pentagon correspondent, NBC notes.The Trump administration is targeting media networks in other ways, too, as the Federal Communications Commission ordered investigations into NPR and PBS over their financial sponsors.",
