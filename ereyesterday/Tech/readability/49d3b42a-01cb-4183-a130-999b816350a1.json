  "description": "We're officially getting more of the Cult of the Lamb comic expansion. Following last year's miniseries, which built on the game's existing lore and injected some real emotional depth, writer Alex Paknadel and artist Troy Little are returning to the story of the Lamb and their followers in a one-shot 48-page issue that's due out in the fall from Oni Press. Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1 will be available on October 29 for $8, with covers by Troy Little and Peach Momoko, alongside a foil variant for $10. Schism Special picks up after the emotional events at the end of the first story arc. Per Oni Press: In the aftermath of their first and closest follower’s sacrifice, Lamb continues the bloody quest to defeat the Bishops of the Old Faith, but they lack the conviction to tend their growing flock back at the cult. More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins… I genuinely can't wait to dive back into this story (even though it broke my heart a little) after being pleasantly surprised by how good the comics turned out to be. They've done a great job so far of honoring the game's tone, serving up both cuteness and brutality, and at this point, I'll pretty much take all the Cult of the Lamb content I can get.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/the-cult-of-the-lamb-comic-is-coming-back-with-the-schism-special-this-fall-211027564.html?src=rss",
