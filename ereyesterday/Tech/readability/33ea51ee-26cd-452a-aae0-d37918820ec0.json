  "text": "Razer has unveiled the Pro Click V2 and the Pro Click V2 Vertical Edition -- two PC mice with ergonomics in mind, complete with expected Razer Chroma RGB LEDs in tow. The latter mouse, revealed Thursday, is Razer's first vertical mouse and is priced to go head to head with the likes of Logitech's vertical mouse offerings like the Lift and MX Vertical. As with almost any new tech product in 2025, the new Pro Click V2 mice will also ship with artificial intelligence features in the form of Razer's AI Prompt Master, a productivity feature that will give you easier access to services like Microsoft Copilot. Both mice are available starting Thursday for $100 for the V2, and $120 for the V2 vertical mouse. Razer is going for a 'do it all' mouse with the Pro Click V2The Pro Click V2 and Pro Click V2 Vertical editions are shaped to fit your hand's natural resting positions, making it more comfortable and easier to use for long periods of time. The Pro Click V2 is designed at a 30-degree angle and the Pro Click V2 Vertical is tilted at 71.7 degrees, which Razer says is the natural angle of a handshake. These are \"productivity meets gaming\" mice, so you can also expect a host of Razer features that you'd find on its gaming mice offerings. That said, the updated mice do feel more gaming-forward than their predecessors. Both include the Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensors for ultra precision, and the mice should be able to track easily on glass. The mechanical buttons are said to be up to six times more durable than the industry average and should be able to take 60 million clicks in their lifecycles.  The new ergonomic mice will ease stress on your wrist while working and gaming.  RazerBoth mice received the RGB treatment, with multi-zone lighting that can be customized further with Razer's Synapse software. There, you can also adjust DPI setting defaults and more.Lastly, both mice should last a long time on a single charge: the Pro Click V2 offers up 3.5 months of battery life while the Vertical Edition can reach up to six months before needing to be charged again. Both mice can be charged via USB-C, and a 5-minute charge can give you two to three days of battery power when you're in a pinch.For more, don't miss how tariffs are boosting the secondhand tech product market.",
