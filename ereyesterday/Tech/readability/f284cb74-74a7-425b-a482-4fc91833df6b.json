  "description": "Sony The Sony CES 2025 keynote will begin soon and you can watch it, and follow our coverage live, right here. The Afeela electric vehicle dominated Sony's 2023 and 2024 CES press conferences and it appears that trend will continue this year, with an appearance at the Sony event (and a followup press conference) already confirmed. This represents a change for Sony, a CES mainstay company, as it’s better known for its decades in the consumer electronics space with its Walkman portables and Trinitron TVs of old along with next-gen PlayStation consoles and Alpha cameras. What to expect at Sony's CES 2025 press conference The Afeela is the first product from Sony Honda Mobility, a joint venture between the Japanese electronics and transportation giants. After a surprise rollout at CES 2023, the Sony CES presser teed up additional details on the EV's LiDAR-heavy sensor array and AI-enhanced cabin tech (the latter coming with an assist from Microsoft) at CES 2024. If the car's previously announced scheduling waypoints — preorders in 2025 ahead of 2026 availability — remain intact, we're hoping to hear which of the Afeela's concept car niceties will actually make the cut once it enters the streets of the real world.  Of course, it won't be all Afeela all the time in Vegas. Expect Sony to spend time talking up its imaging, gaming or maybe even its movie studio division. And with any luck, we'll get more info on the company's XR headset, which was shown off at the 2024 show, only to never be seen again. CES 2025 would be the perfect place to show off a meaty update of a possible competitor to the Apple Vision Pro.  Watch the Sony CES 2025 livestream You can watch the Sony CES press conference as it happens below. The feed will start Monday, January 6 at 8:00PM ET.  The separate Afeela press conference will take place on Tuesday, January 7 at 4:30PM PT, and will be streamed on YouTube as well.  Follow real-time CES updates on our liveblog This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sony-ces-2025-keynote-watch-sony-unveil-its-latest-gadgets-live-here-212207568.html?src=rss",

We're about 5 minutes away from Sony kicking it off. I recognize it's late on the east coast, so bear with us.

We expect Sony to talk about the same car it's talked about at CES for the last few years, and maybe surprise us with news from across its very diverse product portfolio that spans gaming, audio and home entertainment. Stick around, it'll be absolutely riveting, I'm sure.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 7:36 PM ESTA preview of Gemini in Google Home productsIn case you missed it, Google also shared how it plans to integrate Gemini AI into its smart home platform, which encompasses devices like the Nest Audio, Nest Hub and Nest Cameras. Specifically, Gemini will be woven into the Assistant for those devices, so that speaking with the digital helper will feel more natural. Our reporter Amy Skorheim got a preview of what this will look like at Google's booth today, and here's her quick takeaway:\"Possibly the most impressive trick I saw was the case of the missing cookies. The rep asked the Nest Hub the question, \"Hey Google, what happened to the cookies on the counter?\" Pulling footage from a connected Nest Cam, the Hub displayed a dog walking into a kitchen, swiping a cookie and scampering off. The Assistant meanwhile narrated the context of the video saying, \"A dog jumped on the counter and looked at the cookies on December 12th at 1:29PM.\" Of course, this was a pre-recorded clip, as there was sadly no dog in the demonstration kitchen.\"Read more about Gemini AI on the Google Assistant in smart home products in our full story.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 7:16 PM ESTDungeons \u0026 Dragons: The Tyrant's Eye pinball by Stern (Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget)Stern Pinball has been a mainstay of CES for years, as well as multiple other conventions across the industry, bringing a new themed machine each year. For CES 2025, the Engadget team was stoked to learn that the company's offering was a loving tribute to Dungeons and Dragons to celebrate the franchise's 50th birthday. This machine in particular focuses on Dungeons \u0026 Dragons: The Tyrant's Eye, and Nathan Ingraham explains what caught his eye:\"The thing that caught my eye was the fact that you can pick a character and level them up over time, provided you use Stern's Insider Connected app. That app already lets you create a profile and keep track of achievements, games in your area, your top scores and other features (you \"log in\" by scanning a QR code from the app). But with Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, you can actually improve your character over time and save your progress through the game's many modes. When you first start, you choose a character and location, and those choices will affect the goals you need to achieve. Stern specifically say that its new \"PinSave\" system will let you save character experience points, inventory items and game campaign progress across multiple games.\"Read more about the Dungeons and Dragon Stern Pinball machine in our full story.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 6:59 PM ESTRoborock's latest robot vacuum can pick up your dirty socksWe were already intrigued by the description of Roborock's CES 2025 offering, but seeing the video that Karissa Bell took really adds to the experience. The Saros Z70 robovac has a built-in arm that folds out and picks up items on your floor, and can even put them away. Will this save domestic relationships and keep people happy? Based on what Karissa saw, the robot arm at least seems to work, so you will just have to work on communication.Karissa adds:\"Before you can use it, you will have to activate the arm through the Roborock app, where you can also set what kind of objects it can interact with and where they should be placed. While not quite Rosey the Robot, Saros Z70 has the potential to make tidying up a lot easier. And it's not just a prototype — Roborock is planning to make it available for purchase this year.\"Read more about the Roborock Saros Z70 robovac in our full story.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 6:41 PM ESTwill.i.am continues to haunt CES LG's xboom Grab is the most compact option in the new lineup. (Billy Steele for Engadget)It wouldn't be CES without celebrity-endorsed launches, and those of us who have covered this event for awhile are all too familiar with will.i.am's efforts to develop a successful tech product. Who can forget the PULS bracelet, which launched as smartwatch and wearable fever was just taking off? Anyway, will.i.am continues to make his presence known here at the conference, but this time via a collaboration with LG. In fact, right before CES 2025 began, the company appointed the musician as its \"Experiential Architect,\" working together on the xboom line of audio products.This week, Billy Steele got to check out the LG xboom in person, which includes a trio of speakers. The Grab is the smallest of these, and here's what Billy thought:\"I was pleasantly surprised by how much bass the xboom Grab mustered during my demo, with punchy highs and solid mids holding the details. That low-end tone seemed slightly muffled to me, but I only got a quick listen, so a full review would confirm if that's actually the case. The other surprising thing is how loud the xboom Grab can be. At only 50 percent volume, the compact unit produced an almost uncomfortable level of sound for the room.\"Read more about the LG xboom speakers in our hands-on.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 6:26 PM ESTBy the way, there were things we saw at CES Unveiled last night that we might have wanted to try but avoided due to hygiene and personal comfort reasons. For example, a mass of people crowded around the booth of a company called Kirin, with a product called Salt Spoon that was supposed to use electricity to deliver the flavor of umami. It had disposable versions of its spoon ready for people to use, and though I waited in line multiple times to try it out, I never got to taste it. Based on what I heard from various people at the booth though, the salty flavor did seem to come through. I plan on hunting down Kirin this week to get myself some salty spoon time.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 6:08 PM ESTWhile CES has been raging on, there has been some interesting news happening outside of Las Vegas too. For instance, Apple has announced that it plans to release an update \"in the coming weeks\" that will make it clearer that notification summaries are generated by AI. In case of future incidents where Apple Intelligence has misrepresented an alert by a news organization's app, for example, people will be able to see more easily that it was Apple Intelligence (as opposed to, say, the BBC) that crafts the sentences in those summaries.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 5:56 PM ESTNow that Samsung is wrapped, next up on our list of notable press conferences today is Sony, which is taking place at 5PM PT (aka in about 2 hours, if I've done my math right). Of course, there are other companies with events in between, like Zeekr. CES is a great place to learn of companies you might not have heard of before.Mon, January 6, 2025 at 5:47 PM ESTA slide with the words Galaxy Unpacked in the middle and the date \"Jan. 22 2025\" below it.

The Assistant meanwhile narrated the context of the video saying, \u0026#34;A dog jumped on the counter and looked at the cookies on December 12th at 1:29PM.\u0026#34; Of course, this was a pre-recorded clip, as there was sadly no dog in the demonstration kitchen.\u0026#34;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-ai-smarts-are-coming-to-google-home-to-make-the-assistant-a-better-conversationalist-213644481.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read more about Gemini AI on the Google Assistant in smart home products in our full story.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\"\u003eRead more about Gemini AI on the Google Assistant in smart home products in our full story.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-id=\"d49fd0fb-7da7-4b65-bb60-9fd2c7f60490\" id=\"d49fd0fb-7da7-4b65-bb60-9fd2c7f60490\" data-lmt=\"{\u0026#34;utc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:16:25 GMT\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;iso\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-01-07T00:16:25.000Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;format\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Mon, January 6, 2025 at 7:16 PM EST\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:1736208985000}\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/d9062d00-62b4-11ee-bfac-9b7023d6699f\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ctime data-timestamp=\"1736208985000\"\u003eMon, January 6, 2025 at 7:16 PM EST\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons: The Tyrant\u0026#39;s Eye pinball by Stern\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0ZDwCFrGzxbBfT0wbR45wg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/e4a04400-cbf1-11ef-80eb-68d53b990d7f\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Dragons: The Tyrant\u0026#39;s Eye pinball by Stern\u003cspan\u003e (Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eStern Pinball has been a mainstay of CES for years, as well as multiple other conventions across the industry, bringing a new themed machine each year. For CES 2025, the Engadget team was stoked to learn that the company\u0026#39;s offering was a loving tribute to Dungeons and Dragons to celebrate the franchise\u0026#39;s 50th birthday.

But with Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, you can actually improve your character over time and save your progress through the game\u0026#39;s many modes. When you first start, you choose a character and location, and those choices will affect the goals you need to achieve. Stern specifically say that its new \u0026#34;PinSave\u0026#34; system will let you save character experience points, inventory items and game campaign progress across multiple games.\u0026#34;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sterns-latest-pinball-machine-is-a-loving-tribute-to-dungeons--dragons-131053243.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read more about the Dungeons and Dragon Stern Pinball machine in our full story.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\"\u003eRead more about the Dungeons and Dragon Stern Pinball machine in our full story.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli data-id=\"9a060c67-ed6d-4ae8-b6d1-64cb57903945\" id=\"9a060c67-ed6d-4ae8-b6d1-64cb57903945\" data-lmt=\"{\u0026#34;utc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Mon, 06 Jan 2025 23:59:46 GMT\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;iso\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-01-06T23:59:46.000Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;format\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Mon, January 6, 2025 at 6:59 PM EST\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:1736207986000}\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-10/d9062d00-62b4-11ee-bfac-9b7023d6699f\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ctime data-timestamp=\"1736207986000\"\u003eMon, January 6, 2025 at 6:59 PM EST\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRoborock\u0026#39;s latest robot vacuum can pick up your dirty socks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were already intrigued by the description of Roborock\u0026#39;s CES 2025 offering, but seeing the video that Karissa Bell took really adds to the experience. The Saros Z70 robovac has a built-in arm that folds out and picks up items on your floor, and can even put them away. Will this save domestic relationships and keep people happy? Based on what Karissa saw, the robot arm at least seems to work, so you will just have to work on communication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKarissa adds:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026#34;Before you can use it, you will have to activate the arm through the Roborock app, where you can also set what kind of objects it can interact with and where they should be placed.
