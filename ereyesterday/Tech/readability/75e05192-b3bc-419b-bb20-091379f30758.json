Credit: Courtesy Google Google Family Link is getting a design upgrade. The control panel, which is available as an app, offers parents a way to supervise their children's activity on Android devices. But keeping track of screen time, settings, and permissions could be confusing, especially for parents whose children have multiple devices, like a phone, tablet, and laptop. Google announced Tuesday in a blog post that Family Link will now provide streamlined access to settings in a single \"screen time\" tab. Mashable Top Stories The tab brings together Family Link's screen-time management options and tools, including time limits. Parents can now also use the tab to control the \"downtime\" and \"school time\" settings, which curtail usage during certain time periods. The existing Control tab has been updated so that parents can access, in one place, account data management, approval of app downloads, and blocking of websites. Google is also launching the \"school time\" setting on Android phones and tablets next week, after introducing it on the Samsung Galaxy Watch for Kids and Fitbit ACE LTE last year. This year, according to the blog post, parents will be able to use Family Link to approve contacts for the Galaxy Watch for Kids. Rebecca Ruiz is a Senior Reporter at Mashable.
