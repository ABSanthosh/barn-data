  "text": "NFL RedZone appeared to be having issues during Sunday's Week 9 slate of games. Users online reported choppy, blurry, or nearly unwatchable streams. And it might not be just a streaming issue or something wrong with a certain provider. My RedZone was freezing and buffering, even though it is through my cable provider. (Yes, I am a millennial with cable). Here is a sampling of some of the posts about RedZone. Mashable Top Stories Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted It's not quite clear what may be going wrong. Users online described all their other channels working correctly — and it's the same for me. All of my other channels are working well, while the RedZone channel is choppy, buffering, and impossible to watch.There was a spike in reports of issues with NFL Network on Down Detector around 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, which is when the first slate of games kicked off. (There's no page to report RedZone so that might be the closest proxy.) Credit: Screenshot: Down Detector My own RedZone was going in and out, so if yours isn't working it might be worth retrying it. We'll update if any information surfaces on why folks might be having issues. Mashable has reached out to the NFL's media team and will update if we get a response.",
