  "text": "You can never describe today’s internet space as private. Yet, NordVPN is one of the few companies that wants to counter this argument. The good news is, you don’t have to pay extra to enjoy this excellent VPN. With its 73% discount and 3 extra months, NordVPN can be yours for as low as three monthly quids. You could say it’s one coffee a month. So, are you ready to give up that one coffee each month for online privacy? If you nodded your head, you’re in for a luxury treatment! Secure Your Privacy With NordVPN Your Privacy Begins With NordVPN Government surveillance and tracking are a thing of the present and future. While you can never 100% get rid of them, you can mitigate most of their effects with a VPN. NordVPN is one of the best choices in this aspect. It uses 256-bit GCM encryption to fully encrypt your traffic. A Double VPN is a feature offered in every plan. It doubles this encryption to make you untraceable by your internet provider or government bodies. NordVPN solidifies its security and privacy with several essential features: a kill switch, DNS leak protection, RAM-only servers, NordLynx (an in-house VPN protocol), and a multiple-times certified no-logging policy. By storing no logs of your internet history, NordVPN has no clue about your whereabouts. By extension, it can’t provide your data to third-party companies and authorities. This is a key privacy feature that NordVPN users emphasize. However, NordVPN also provides public WiFi protection, letting you travel in peace. Wherever you are, you can rely on NordVPN’s 7,400+ global servers to browse, stream, download torrents, and play games in privacy. Save 73% and Get Free Months of Subscription NordVPN’s exclusive sale introduces us to four massively discounted biennial plans. Despite the tiered approach, all plans are suitable for privacy, security, streaming, and much more. For the best savings, there’s the Basic plan. At 73% off with 3 extra months, you’ll spend only $3.09/mo or $83.43 for the first 27 months. NordVPN’s best-value deal is Plus, which also includes Threat Protection Pro and NordPass at only $3.99/mo. Other plans, such as Complete and Prime, include NordLocker (encrypted cloud storage) and NordProtect (identity theft protection). NordVPN’s gigantic sale offers a bit of everything for everyone. But even if the Basic plan is your pick of the litter, you won’t regret it. Don’t forget that the sale comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee for newcomers. Therefore, you risk nothing by subscribing and testing it out. Treat your privacy with respect and make this Easter the most exciting yet. Get Started With NordVPN",
