  "text": "A year after its sequel arrived, the original Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is coming to modern gaming. The definitive, “Master Crafted Edition” of the third-person shooter comes of port developer SneakyBox. Producer Vaidas Mikelskas described the update as a “thoughtful restoration […] a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players.” Along with graphical updates and a modern UI and control scheme, this new Space Marine provides a visual update to the Orks to make them more in line with their current visual identity in the franchise canon, and “over 100” new voice lines. Originally developed by Relic Entertainment, the first Space Marine released in 2011 to generally positive reviews. It had two planned sequels, but those fell apart when the game’s publisher THQ closed down. Sega subsequently gained its publishing rights upon acquiring Relic two years later, and re-released the game on PC back in 2021. Later that year, Saber Interactive revealed it would develop the sequel for publisher Focus Entertainment, which released to pretty strong reviews in 2024 and has its own followup in the works. Rights for the first Warhammer 40K: Space Marine remain with Sega, which currently hasn’t announced a PlayStation 5 version of the Master Crafted Edition. So if you’re interested, you’ll have to buy it on PC or Xbox Series X|S, or play via Xbox Game Pass, on June 10. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
