Some languages use familiar syntax, welcome minimum code commands for heavy-duty work, and are open-source with a helpful developer community that guides users in making the most of it. Others are complicated due to complex syntax, how the code is structured and organised, and not-so-seamless onboarding experiences. 5 hot roles hiring right now Test Engineer High Tech – Netherlands based only, Capgemini, Eindhoven Software Developer (C++), Artisans, Zwolle Senior Software Developer C#, Infarma-Pharmagest, Anagni Développeur .NET C# H/F, CONSORT GROUP, Nantes Python Developer, Alliander, Arnhem You’d be forgiven for thinking that languages which are difficult to learn are better compensated. As we’ll see, that’s not always the case. C++ Though C is regarded as a minimalist and somewhat straightforward language, C++ is considered the opposite. C++ is challenging to learn, and this is down to its multi-paradigm structure and tricky syntax. Although it is commonly known to be especially difficult for beginners, programmers who have never worked with low-level languages before also find it difficult to learn. In return for its complexity, this language offers unparalleled performance, and can power applications like real-time simulation engines, financial trading systems, and AAA video games. C++ salaries as disclosed in Stack Overflow’s annual survey, aren’t especially thrilling. The average annual compensation, including salary, bonuses and perks (before taxes and deductions), was $64,444 for C++ developers. Yet, through the House of Talent Job Board, you’ll see C++ salaries reaching highs of almost a quarter of a million in the US. Keep in mind that, if you decide to upskill, you’ll need to allow for a significant time investment to really learn the language. Whitespace You don’t need to be in any way technical to understand why learning Whitespace is so challenging. The language uses whitespace characters — specifically spaces, tabs, and line breaks, as its sole syntax elements. This means the source code of programmes written in Whitespace is invisible. Originally created 21 years ago by Chris Morris and Edwin Brady at the University of Durham, Whitespace is more an intellectual challenge than a practical tool. Enjoyable dinner party or interview fodder for sure, but not one to bank your professional development or next career move on. Cow Cow is another esoteric language designed as a cerebral challenge. With 12 commands, all of which are variations of the word “moo”, and a contrived syntax, it’s extremely difficult for most programming purposes. Again, it has limited practical application and isn’t used to build usable software, but its absurdist structure does create a talking point — or moo-ment — about language design and constraints. Easiest programming languages to learn Javascript An essential language for web development, JavaScript powers front-ends and modern web applications. It has an accessible syntax, immediate visual feedback, and an extensive library of documentation. And considering 84% of Stack Overflow’s 48,019 respondents said technical documentation was the top online resource to learn code from (83.9% of respondents), Javascript’s large library is very helpful. Survey respondents also used Stack Overflow (80.3%, of course), written tutorials (68.4%), blogs (61.4%), how-to-videos (54.2%), and video-based e-courses (49.9%). Additionally, JavaScript has long been the most popular programming language in the Slack Overflow survey, with the exception of 2013 and 2014, when SQL topped the charts. The average annual salaries for JavaScript developers in 2024 is $63,694 and the language works hand-in-hand with HTML and CSS. Python Python’s syntax closely resembles natural English, and its philosophy emphasises code readability, which makes it an accessible language for beginners. Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and back-end web dev all love it, and its expansive libraries and frameworks make it versatile for a wide range of applications. Experienced developers find it the perfect tool for automating repetitive tasks. It’s one of the four main languages deployed at Google, and is also used at Intel, IBM, Netflix, Facebook, and Spotify. For those strategically upskilling, Python is a smart move. Those who are proficient can expect an annual salary of $67,723, according to the same survey. Ruby Similarly, Ruby is known for its simple syntax and is also used for building web applications in plain English. Its main framework, Ruby on Rails, simplifies web development by handling many repetitive tasks involved in building websites, such as setting up web pages and databases. Because of this, Ruby is often used by startups and small businesses, though just 4.7% of Slack Overflow respondents said they completed extensive development work in Ruby over the last year, compared to Node.js (40.8%), and React (39.5%). That said, Ruby commanded the fifth spot when it comes to the top-paying technologies, with an annual average compensation of $90,221, after Erlang ($100,636), Elixir ($96,000), Clojure ($95,541), and Nim ($94,924). For complete beginners, Ruby is the perfect introduction to building real projects, without getting bogged down in complicated code, and it pays well. Win-win.
