Livestream Brentford vs. Man United in Canada Livestream Brentford vs. Man United in Australia Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN Brentford will be looking to maintain its push for European qualification for the first time in its history on Sunday as it takes on a Man United team that may yet see its season end on a high, despite disappointing in the English Premier League. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game as it happens, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are.Thomas Frank's Bees are on a run of four games undefeated and hitting form at the right time. A win here would put them firmly in the mix for a place in next season's UEFA Conference League.Manchester United, meanwhile, come into this match riding high after an impressive 3-0 victory over Athletic Club in the first leg of their UEFA Europa League semifinal on Thursday. All that effort in Spain, along with the upcoming second leg next week, is likely to prompt manager Ruben Amorim to rotate his squad and draw on his reserves for this less critical fixture.Brentford take on Manchester United on Sunday, May 4, at the Community Stadium in west London, with kickoff set for 2 p.m. BST local time. That makes it a 9 a.m. ET or 6 a.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 11 p.m. AEDT kickoff in Australia.  Bruno Fernandes put in a captain's performance against Athletic Club on Thursday as his two goals helped Man United to a commanding 3-0 away win in Bilbao.  Juanma/UEFA/Getty ImagesHow to watch Brentford vs. Man United in the US without cableSunday's Brentford vs. Man United game will be broadcast on NBC and can also be streamed via Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.  Peacock/CNET Peacock offers two Premium plans, and after the recent price increases, the ad-supported Premium plan costs $8 a month and the ad-free Premium Plus plan is $14 a month. How to watch the Premier League 2024-25 season from anywhere with a VPNIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the Premier League action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN usage to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial. James Martin/CNET Price $13 per month, $100 for the first 15 months (then $117 per year) or $140 for the first 28 months (then $150 per year)Latest Tests No DNS leaks detected, 18% speed loss in 2025 testsNetwork 3,000 plus servers in 105 countriesJurisdiction British Virgin Islands ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. 61% off with 2yr plan (+4 free months)Can I livestream Brentford vs. Man United in the UK?Sunday's early afternoon kickoff at the Community Stadium has not been selected for broadcast by a UK network. That also means that if you're in the UK traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home, thanks to geoblocking. There's one option to get around this. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.Livestream Brentford vs. Man United in CanadaIf you want to stream this EPL game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo Canada. Once again, the service has exclusive rights to every Premier League match this season. Fubo Fubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season, with exclusive streaming rights to every match. It costs CA$30 a month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually. Livestream Brentford vs. Man United in AustraliaFootball fans down under can watch EPL matches live on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League match of the 2024-25 season live in Australia. Optus With exclusive rights to stream all EPL matches live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans.If you're already an Optus network customer, you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 a month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25. Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming EPL matches may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave. Other Services \u0026 Software",

First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don\u0026#39;t have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you\u0026#39;ll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you\u0026#39;re using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network\u0026#39;s sports app, you\u0026#39;ll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV.
