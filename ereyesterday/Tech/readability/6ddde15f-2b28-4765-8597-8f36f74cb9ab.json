A Minecraft Movie is getting Block Party Edition screenings that encourage audiences to talk and sing along with the film, Warner Bros. said in a press release on Monday. Fans have already been singing along and shouting out lines, a la The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and now the special screenings are encouraging the interaction. The special screenings begin May 2 -- they'll last past that date, but showings will vary by location, a Warner Bros. representative told CNET.\"You know the moments. You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it's time to get loose, laugh out loud and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan,\" Warner Bros. said.A Minecraft Movie, based on the wildly popular video game, has been a massive success for Warner Bros, despite being critically panned. The film has already brought in $816 million in a theater environment in which ticket sales are declining, year over year. The Block Party Edition seems to be a bid to get repeat ticket sales from fans. Unfortunately for theater employees, they've been met with rowdy popcorn-throwers, screaming fans and obnoxious audiences, at least in videos posted online. In some instances, authorities were called to kick out moviegoers, and in another instance, a live chicken was brought into a screening. Despite the headaches from some moviegoers, A Minecraft Movie has been a reprieve for movie theaters. In 2025, movies like Snow White and Mickey 17 have been box office disappointments. Considering movie theaters make a good portion of their revenues via concession sales, at least all that thrown popcorn is turning into cash.",
