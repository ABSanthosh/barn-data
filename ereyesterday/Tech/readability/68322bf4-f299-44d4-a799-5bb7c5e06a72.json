  "text": "During the 2010s, Blumhouse’s The Purge series came out a reliable clip, and even had a TV show. It seemed to have wound down with 2021’s The Forever Purge, but since then, creator James DeMonaco has decided there’s at least one more story to tell in that universe. While doing press for his new horror movie The Home, DeMonaco told Bloody Disgusting he and his wife wrote a script together that’s now in the hands of Blumhouse boss Jason Blum. He didn’t give the whole game away, but teased it would bring back “someone who I love and I think the audience loves,” likely referencing Frank Grillo’s Leo Barnes, the Punisher-esque lead of The Purge: Anarchy and its direct follow up, Election Year, but was nowhere to be found in Forever. And as far as new material goes, DeMonaco added the script introduces “some really amazing women. We’ve had some great women in the past, but real warrior women come forth here in a way that we haven’t really explored on Purge night.” Of the whole script, he called it “cool and fun, and I hope they like it. We’re hoping next year would be great to shoot, maybe the end of this year if timing works out. But now it’s with the powers that be, so we’ll see what happens.” If a sixth Purge gets the green light, it’ll be coming at the right time. There’s a lot going on in America for it to satirize, and Blumhouse could use a potential pick-me-up after its last few movies this year came out to more muted reactions than expected. But the real question is, is it possible for this movie to come out before GTA 6? Want more io9 news?
