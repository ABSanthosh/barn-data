  "text": "AI is transforming the way we work — from boosting productivity and creativity to delivering real business transformation and impact. And at Google Cloud, we’re bringing the best of Google AI to people, organizations and businesses across the globe.Today, there are over four million developers building with the power of Gemini, our most advanced AI model family. This rapid adoption of Gemini, Imagen (our groundbreaking image generation model), and Veo (our industry-leading video generation model) has resulted in a 20x increase in Vertex AI usage in the past year alone. And within Google Workspace, over two billion AI assists are provided monthly to business users, reshaping how work gets done.We’re continuing to push what Google AI can do, making it more powerful, easier to use and more affordable. This week at Google Cloud Next 25, we shared exciting updates about how we’re doing just that: From introducing the most powerful chip we’ve ever built, to providing support for even more generative media models, to helping organizations create and manage AI agents, to changing how teams work with new capabilities in Google Workspace and Google Agentspace. We also shared over 500 examples of how organizations are using Google AI and seeing real impact.Here are some of the highlights of what we announced:- Ironwood, our 7th-generation TPU built for inference, will be available later this year. Compared to the prior generation, Ironwood offers five times more peak compute capacity and six times the high-bandwidth memory capacity.- With the addition of Lyria to Vertex AI, we are now the only platform with generative media models for video, image, speech and music.- New updates and tools for Gemini in Workspace bring even more helpful AI capabilities into tools people use every day — Docs, Sheets, Meet, Chat and more.- Updates to Agentspace make it easier for customers to discover, create and adopt AI agents. We're also growing the AI Agent Marketplace, a dedicated section within Google Cloud Marketplace where customers can easily browse and purchase AI agents from partners. .- And we unveiled more tools to build helpful agents including Agent Development Kit (ADK), an open-source framework for building agents while maintaining control over agent behavior; and Agent2Agent (A2A), new open protocol that gives your agents a common language to collaborate no matter what framework or vendor they are built on.- Gemini 2.5 Flash, our workhorse model with low latency and cost efficiency, will soon be available in Vertex AI.- Google Unified Security brings our best-in-class security products for threat intelligence, security operations, cloud security and secure enterprise browsing into a new, single AI-powered security solution.- With Cloud Wide Area Network (Cloud WAN), we’re making our high-speed, low-latency network — the same one that connects billions of users to services like Gmail, Photos and Search — available to organizations around the world.",
