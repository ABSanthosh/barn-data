  "text": "Mar 31, 2025 [[read-time]] min read These organizations will receive the final $10 million from Google.org’s $75 million AI Opportunity Fund to provide American nonprofits with AI skills. The Tech:NYC Foundation's Demo Day event Nonprofits are at the forefront of finding solutions to challenges in their communities. But to do this at scale, they need access to the latest technology, like AI. A 2024 Google.org report revealed a significant gap: Many nonprofits lack the AI training needed to effectively use this promising technology. While a majority believe generative AI could benefit their communities, adoption is still in its early stages.To help employees at American nonprofits adopt AI skills, Google.org is announcing $10 million of support to Project Evident, the Tech:NYC Foundation and local community foundations in cities across the U.S. These organizations will provide tailored technical assistance, in-person working sessions, webinars and peer learning opportunities on AI adoption and implementation to nonprofits at no cost.Google.org funding recipients report that AI helps them achieve their goals in one-third of the time at nearly half the cost. For example, Erika's Lighthouse accelerated content and curriculum development with Gemini by generating ideas for program names, concepts and themes, which freed up their team's time to further their nonprofit mission.Today’s grant is part of Google.org’s $75 million AI Opportunity Fund. The fund provides support to best-in-class workforce development and education organizations with the goal of training more than one million Americans on AI skills. We’re looking forward to continued collaboration with industries, governments and communities to help everyone access essential AI skills.",
