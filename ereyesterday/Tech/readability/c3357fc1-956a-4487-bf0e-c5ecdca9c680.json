  "text": "Nearly two years ago, Disney shuttered Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, its very pricey, large-scale immersive experience. For those who still have an interest in the now-ended hotel, they can put that—and some money—towards an upcoming documentary about the attraction’s last days. Game historian and designer Carly Kocurek recently launched a Kickstarter for Halcyon Daze, which promises to cover “the ambitious launch, spectacular run, and crushing closure” of Galactic Starcruiser. Directed by Carrie Coaplen, the documentary will include testimonials from artists, cast, and crew that worked on the experience, and its dedicated sect of fans. Disney put a lot of weight behind Galactic Starcruiser at the time, even going so far as to make it Star Wars canon and a key location for several in-universe events, including the start of the New Republic and to the point it’s potentially where Ben Solo was conceived. (No, really.) Ticket prices ranging from $4,800 to over $6,000 made it a hard sell for anyone but the truly devoted and well-off, and it died after 19 months. Despite its short life, Halcyon’s description noted the “stark contrast between the Starcruiser as a ridiculous and ridiculously expensive failure and as a beloved community. This is an effort to document and understand that tension.” If that sounds fun to you, go ahead and donate right here—at time of writing, the Halycon Daze campaign is at $19,121. The crew is working on an rough cut to submit to film festivals in the fall, and just needs help “with this last, crucial stage.” Want more io9 news?
