  "text": "Google now lets you manage Nest Cam IQ indoor and outdoor cameras — which were both released in 2017 — through a public preview in the Google Home app, meaning that you can now technically manage all Nest cams from as early as 2015 from the Home app instead of the Nest app.Google has been slowly making it possible to bring Nest cams into Home over the past year and change. When you transfer your Nest Cam IQ cameras over to Home, you’ll be able to “review video history in event and timeline views, access camera settings, and more without switching between the Nest and Google Home apps,” Google says. From Home, Google also lets you view live streams from cameras in your favorites tab and set up automations.You can join the public preview from inside the Home app or at home.google.com. “If you’re already enrolled in Public Preview, you’ll see prompts in both the Nest app and in the Google Home app under the Favorites Tab with instructions when you’re able to transfer your Nest Cam from the Nest app to the Google Home app,” Google says. Access will start to roll out this week. And if you want to reverse transfer your Nest Cam IQ indoor and outdoor cameras back to the Nest app, you’ll be able to do that, according to Google.Google also now lets you manage any Nest Hub Max devices from the Home app if you’re enrolled in the public preview. However, unlike with the Nest Cam IQ cameras, if you bring Nest Hub Max devices into the Home app, you can’t transfer them back to the Nest app.Google already let you transfer the Nest Cam Indoor (wired, first-gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (wired, first-gen), and the Nest Hello / Nest Doorbell (wired, first-gen) to the Home app. The company says it will “continue to support the Nest app” and that “there is no change to the Nest app experience today.” Now, the only things that work in the Nest app but not the Home app are the Nest Protect smoke detector and the Nest x Yale door lock.",
