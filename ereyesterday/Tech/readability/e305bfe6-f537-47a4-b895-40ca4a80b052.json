  "text": "Terrifier 3 was an instant hit at the box office—just the latest success for the low-budget, gleefully gory horror franchise, which has (presumably) at least one more film on the way. But Terrifier series distributor Cineverse is also looking for the next gruesome breakout, and it’s turning to a 1980s franchise that’s ripe for a revival, particularly since like Terrifier 3, it revolves around a psychotic Santa Claus: Silent Night, Deadly Night. Deadline had the scoop on the Silent Night, Deadly Night reboot, reporting that it will be written and directed by Mike P. Nelson. Nelson is no stranger to franchise revivals; he directed the 2021 Wrong Turn reboot, an entertaining entry in a franchise that had otherwise run out of steam. He also wrote and directed the intersecting “No Wake” and “Ambrosia” segments of V/H/S/85, which means he’s responsible for one of the V/H/S series’ most startling twists—no small feat. The new Silent Night, Deadly Night will have the executive producers of the 1984 original aboard for added authenticity; Terrifier 3‘s Brad Miska, who had a big role in bringing Damien Leone’s creation to wide audiences, is also among the executive producers. According to the trade, Silent Night, Deadly Night is aiming for a 2025 theatrical release. A November-December run would make seasonal sense—though Halloween timing would also work: Terrifier 3, featuring Art the Clown’s own holly jolly misadventures, hit screens in mid-October. The original Silent Night, Deadly Night is about a kid named Billy who witnesses his parents’ murder at the hands of a Santa suit-clad killer, then grows up to become… a Santa suit-clad killer. It spawned several sequels (part two is to blame for the infamous “Garbage day!” meme), though later series entries are more of the “in name only” variety. In the ’80s, a slasher film featuring Santa Claus as a murderous maniac was seen as outrageously shocking, and the film was quite controversial. That’s not likely to happen this time around, especially in a post-Terrifier 3 world. There’s no word on shape Nelson’s version might take—hopefully he keeps the nightmare-inducing grandfather character in the story—but Deadline’s quote from him more than conveys his excitement. “The opportunity to work with producers involved with the original Silent Night, Deadly Night and to partner with the Terrifier 3 team is an honor,” he told the trade. “I’ll never forget walking into the video store at the mini mall when I was five and seeing that poster for the original film. I was in awe and started imagining what horrifying things would happen. To be a part of the film’s legacy many years later is insane! I’m looking forward to getting production underway, and unleashing my new take on this compelling story. Billy is back!” Want more io9 news?
