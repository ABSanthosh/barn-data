Credit: Zain bin Awais Prime Day 2025 is over, and I don't know about you, but I'm kind of exhausted. Lifehacker spent every moment of this years super-sized, two-days-longer sale hunting down the best discounts, deals, and bargains on the products we've actually bought ourselves, reviewed and loved, or had on our wishlists waiting for a price drop. And now it's over, at least until Prime Big Deal Days in October.Or is it? Though Prime Day officially ended yesterday, not all the deals did. Here are 17 items we previously recommended that you can still pick up at a discount. But act fast—these sales could end at any moment.A phone-shaped e-reader with a cult followingI've been personally obsessed with the Boox Palma e-reader for about two years now. It has the form factor of a phone, the screen of a Kindle, and an open Android operating system that lets you download any reading apps you want to, so you aren't tied to buying books from whichever retailer sold you the device. Carrying it with me alongside my iPhone has helped me read way more and doomscroll way less. This thing basically never goes on sale, so the current $30 discount is a relative bargain. The OLED Nintendo Switch for $100 off, because who needs a Switch 2?OK, I mean, I obviously need a Switch 2 (because Mario Kart World!), but I'm not getting one for a long while, considering I didn't even buy the original Switch until 2021. Given the vast back catalogue of first-party and indie games, you could definitely keep playing the Switch OLED (the updated model with the larger, better screen) for years to come—and at $100 off, it's a full $200 cheaper than its successor. You can also opt to get a bundle that comes with Mario Kart 8 for $25 more, which is pretty good considering you're probably buying Mario Kart 8 anyway. (This is a Woot! offer, but given Amazon owns Woot!, I still think it counts as a Prime Day deal.) I've had a Meta Quest 2 for a few years, and I can best describe it as the coolest gadget I never use—gaming in VR is super fun and immersive, but the headset too heavy, the video quality is a bit fuzzy, and it makes my eyes hurt if I play for longer than 15 minutes. Lots of these problems would probably be solved by the Meta Quest 3S, which is lighter, has better video quality, and is supposed to be more comfortable overall. Lifehacker's Stephen Johnson says it's a smarter buy than the pricier Meta Quest 3, especially at $50 off. The Microsoft Surface Pro combination laptop and tabletOur tech reviewer David Nield gave this two-in-one device a glowing 4.5/5 review earlier this year, praising its features, suburb build, and battery life. All the more reasons to grab one at its lowest price yet—it's $100 off, which will take you a long way toward getting a keyboard and stylus to go with it. A MacBook Air that will last you for yearsApple may be doing too good a job with the MacBook Air lineup. I'm still rocking an M1 from 2020 and it works basically like new. I can only imagine how long I'd be able to use the new M4 MacBook Air, which now comes with 16GB of RAM standard. (Probably a lot longer than I care to contemplate in 2025.) Right now, you can get one for $150 off, making it one of our tech editor Michelle Ehrhardt's top Prime Day picks. The AirPods Pro, because...they're the AirPods Pro, but 40% offI probably don't have to tell you that Apple AirPods Pro are a great buy if you've got an iPhone or are otherwise in the Apple ecosystem. They regularly feature on \"best wireless headphones\" lists, including ours, and now you can spend a lot less to get them—they're 40% off, one of the biggest discounts I've seen on an Apple product. Or the AirPods 4, if you aren't made of moneyIn addition to Apple's most crazy expensive AirPods, Amazon has a great discount on the latest non-AirPods 4, bringing them down to $89. Granted, that's for the version without automatic noise cancellation (ANC), but it's still a great price. (AirPods tend to hold their value a long time, and rarely go on a massive sale.) I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and paid $30 more, which is incidentally what the ANC version costs now. Instead, I got to enjoy my kid going \"Oh, just the regular ones? Thanks, I guess.\" (Just kidding, she was still mostly enthused.) Or the Sony WF-1000XM5s, one of the best AirPods Pro alternativesLook, maybe you don't want any AirPods at all. I get it! (I'm a Beats Fit Pro man myself.) Well, maybe consider Sony's beloved AirPods Pro competitor, the catchily named WF-1000XM5s. At $199, they're $100 off, and everyone pretty much agrees they're better than the Apple earbuds (except maybe the people who have convinced themselves that you have to buy the Apple earbuds). A sub-$200 5G smartphone with a ton of featuresToday's flagship smartphones are so advanced, I'd wager most people never touch the lion's share of their features and capabilities. Instead of stretching out the cost of a $1,000 Samsung over the course of a few years, you might find you're just as happy with a budget pick—and the Motorola Moto G Power 5G has a shocking number of features for a device that costs just $175 (unlocked!), including a decent camera, a capable processor, and a battery that'll last you 12 hours. Here's your chance to get off the upgrade train and just...have a phone. An iPad you won't be terrified to give your kidI used to be a \"limited screen time\" kind of parent, but then we had a pandemic, and now my life is a constant battle against YouTube, Roblox, and poor emotional regulation skills (and not just my own). If you too have a young child prone to, say, throwing their tablet at the ground when a game of Grow a Garden goes south, you should make sure they're tossing an iPad that doesn't cost $800. Which is to say, it's a good time to pick up the entry-level 11-inch iPad, since you can get one for 20% off. A ridiculously giant, easy-on-the-eyes e-ink notebookIf you dig the capabilities of an e-ink notebook like the Viwoods AiPaper but are looking for one with an absolutely massive screen, I really dig the Boox Note Max, with a 13.3-inch display to rival your laptop's screen (read my review). It offers a comfortable, paper-like writing experience, a smooth stylus, and a crystal clear e-ink screen. Like the AiPaper, it has Google Play store support, but without making you jump through the hoops that other device does to get it working. It's definitely pricey, retailing for nearly $700, but you can save $60 during Prime Day. Ten percent might not seem like a huge discount, but as I noted above, re: the Palma, 2, Boox devices basically never go on sale, so it's a great time to buy. What do you think so far? AirTags are great for keeping track of stuff—I've got one in my car so I always remember where I parked, one attached to both sets of my car keys, and one for my Beats Fit Pro case, because I misplace it several times a day. I need a few more, so I'm getting some on a Prime Day discount: A pack of four is $65, down from $100, making them just $16 or so each—a bargain price for the peace of mind of knowing I'll never have to ask my wife if she's seem my earbuds again. A big 4K TV for way less than you'd thinkLast Prime Day I made it my mission to get a new TV that a) was at least 50 inches and b) cost less than $250. I grabbed a model from Insignia—Best Buy's in-house brand, which is also sold at Amazon for some reason—that satisfied both requirements, and I've been pretty happy with it. If only I'd waited! This year I could've spent about $70 less and gotten all of that and 4K resolution! Alas: I'll have to leave this $170, 50-inch, LED 4K Insignia set with Alexa integration for someone else to enjoy. (If you wanted to go bigger, a few larger sizes are discounted too.) A possibly life-changing karaoke machineI know—how can a karaoke machine change your life? Well, our own Stephen Johnson says the Ikarao Break X2 smart karaoke machine changed his, and who am I to question his lived experience? It does seem pretty cool, with an Android touchscreen tablet, two wireless microphones, audio output of up to 300W, and an input jack for an electric guitar so it works as a practice amp. And it's $120 off! A cheap price to change your life. A possibly life-changing GoPro Hero 12 cameraWait, Steve also says this GoPro Hero 12 camera is his favorite tech gadget ever, and that getting one just might change your life. Which is it, Steve? The camera? The karaoke machine? What if you take a GoPro of yourself using the karaoke machine? Anyway, the camera does sound pretty awesome, and it's $80 off. A pro-level milk frotherI've written a bunch about my coffee obsession for Lifehacker, and highlighted the products and gadgets that fuel my caffeine habit, and yet somehow I've never acquired a milk frother I like. The little wand I got from IKEA is basically a novelty, and the add-on attached to the Nespresso I found on the street (thank you, Park Slope, Brooklyn stoop giveaway culture!) doesn't exactly make the airiest milk clouds. So I'm sorely tempted by the Dreo All-in-1 BaristaMaker milk frother, another Allie recommendation (she gave it a glowing review). Smart leak sensors that can help you stave off disasterLast year while I was on a camping trip with my son I got a fun text from my wife, all about how our boiler decided to start shooting water everywhere. One $700 repair later, we decided to invest in some leak sensors so in the future, we'll be alerted as soon as the water starts flowing in the basement (and hopefully before the steam starts shooting out of the radiators upstairs). Our smart home reviewer Amanda recommends this three-pack of sensors from Aqara, which work with a companion app so you can keep tabs on your biggest asset's water issues from afar for 35% off. Looking for something else? Retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Home Depot have Prime Day competition sales that are especially useful if you don’t have Amazon Prime.Walmart’s Prime Day competition sale begins at midnight on July 8 and will include deals up to 50% off. It’s an especially good option if you have Walmart+. Best Buy’s Prime Day competition sale, “Black Friday in July,” runs through Sunday, July 13 and has some of the best tech sales online. It’s an especially good option if you’re a My Best Buy “Plus” or “Total” member Add to Cart Newsletter Shop smarter, save more money Daniel Oropeza Get all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.
