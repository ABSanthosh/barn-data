Bullet points This article, \"4 Ways Google Data Centers Transform Communities for the Better,\" highlights Google's community investments. Google supports schools, small businesses, and entrepreneurs through funding and training programs. Data centers create jobs and boost local economies, turning towns into innovation hubs. Google improves local infrastructure like power grids and water facilities for everyone. Data centers power AI innovations, from cancer screening to climate solutions, benefiting all. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Data centers power the digital services billions of people rely on every day, including Google Cloud, Search, Gmail, Maps and Gemini. They are engines of innovation, driving breakthroughs that transform lives and tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges. While Google is helping foster a new era of technological progress, we are equally committed to ensuring that our neighbors in data center communities benefit. Google data centers are essential parts of local communities, fostering economic growth, technological advancement and efficient infrastructure — and we’re committed to supporting the communities we call home. Supporting schools, small businesses and local entrepreneursAs part of our commitment to growing alongside our communities, we fund programs for teacher training in underinvested communities, and through our Skilled Trades and Readiness (STAR) Program, we help provide opportunities for our neighbors to expand their talents. In Nebraska, we support local entrepreneurs, invest in STEM programs in schools, and provide meals to families struggling with food insecurity. And our philanthropic arm is investing $10 million to help community nonprofits adopt generative AI in their operations. Karine Sokpoh is the founder and CEO of Midlands African Chamber (MAC) in Omaha, Nebraska. With our support, MAC empowers, connects and champions business communities in Nebraska and the Midwest. Pia Quiroz is an area security manager at our data centers in Latin America. Through Google, she has participated in programs at local schools, helped plant trees for an urban forest in Santiago, Chile, and led activities for the improvement of housing for the elderly. Rachel Huang is a corporate account manager at Junyi Academy. Our investment helped Junyi train teachers to incorporate e-learning in their classrooms and to personalize learning experiences for students. Agrotheek employees explore a cultivated field outside our Middenmeer data center in the Netherlands. Agrotheek created this learning field on our land to demonstrate new innovations to farmers. Aurora Rodriguez, a 2024 graduate from the Skilled Trades and Readiness (STAR) Program in Construction in Northern Virginia, has leveraged her experience to secure more project management opportunities at her job. She is now inspired to pursue a four-year degree to further her career. Creating a positive economic impactWhen Google puts down roots, we work directly with our neighbors, bringing thousands of construction and tech-driven jobs to the community. Outside of our owned facilities, Google’s presence boosts local businesses and supports job seekers. Take Lenoir, North Carolina – once a furniture manufacturing town. In 2007, Google invested $1.2 billion to build a data center just a mile outside of town, creating over a thousand jobs to date. Since then, the region has become a hub for innovation, attracting data centers from leading companies. Improving local infrastructureWhen we build our data centers, we often support improvements to vital local systems, like power grids and water treatment facilities — improving access for everyone. For example, in Hamina, Finland, we transformed an abandoned paper mill into a data center powered by an offsite heat recovery facility, which provides 80% of heat demand for the local community, helping warm homes and businesses in this historic port city. Elsewhere, we have donated land to build learning fields for farmers in the Netherlands, and to restore grasslands in Tennessee, enriching the ecological diversity of these regions. Our data center in Hamina, Finland repurposed an old paper mill. The tanks shown in this picture were originally used in the paper-making process. Delivering AI innovations for everyoneGoogle’s data centers are the backbone of essential private, public and nonprofit services. They power AI models that are transforming lives every day – from breakthroughs in cancer screening and life-saving drug development to tackling important climate challenges. Local communities can take pride in knowing that some of the world’s most impactful AI advancements are delivered out of their hometowns, helping create a better future for everyone.It’s a privilege to be a part of this exciting revolution. We invite you to discover more about how data centers empower our communities and help solve some of our world’s most pressing issues. Related stories",
