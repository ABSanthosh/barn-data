Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann I’ve gotten to try a handful of different air fryers at this point, and although the convection heating mechanism is the same, there’s still a somewhat overwhelming variety available. When the market is flush, brands try to tempt buyers with new designs. I’ve found that’s where cooks can lose themselves. In my experience, simple is usually best. I’ve been using the Instant Vortex 6-quart basket model for about two years, and it’s the one I keep coming back to. Why this air fryer is special The Instant Vortex 6-quart has a simple basket design with two parts: the basket drawer, and the rest of the unit, which includes the heating element, fan, and touch display. In fact, what makes this air fryer special is how well it does the job while being completely basic. There’s no vertical configuration, no double heating zone, and no rotisserie feature. Just a basket, and it gets to work.Mine is actually the older generation of the same model. The newer generation (linked above) has a sleeker look and displays both the time and temperature at once (this older one blinks between the two), but the functional parts are the same, and you can get the gist of the overall size and design here. The basket is wide and has plenty of depth. It functions just like a drawer that you slide in and out of the machine by grabbing the handle (which is massive and I think a bit extreme but that’s a trend with most air fryers), and giving it a good yank. The basket secures back into the appliance with a satisfying clack.  Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann There is a simple grate that fits into the bottom. My next comment borders on extreme air fryer-nerdom, but the grate is great. It’s mostly like any other air fryer grate, but the key difference is the center wire-pull. It’s thin, sits in a depression, and flips around so you can clean both sides. Who cares, you say? You’ll be thinking of me if you buy an air fryer that has a fixed pull. Food gets caught in it weirdly, and oils can get trapped underneath. It’s the small things. The display is digital with several touch-screen buttons to select the function (fan speed), and a control knob you can rotate to select your temperature and time. It’s an infinity control dial, which I’ve abused with aggressive spinning and it still works fine. This display is perfect for the type of person who unpacks an appliance and immediately throws out the instruction manual. You plug in the machine, the choices light up, and you press buttons. I believe anyone could air fry correctly on their first try with this Instant Vortex.The pros and cons of the Instant Vortex 6-quartThe prosSimple to useEasy to move aroundEasy to cleanThe Instant Vortex 6-quart boasts simple operation without losing control. It’s not that an air fryer can’t get more simple—some air fryers have preset controls or dials with temperature and fan settings, but the rub is that you have to work within their settings. The Instant Vortex pretty much lets you call the shots, but without muddying the waters with too many unnecessary options, buttons, and presets. Once you press start, you can count on consistent, even browning, and quick results. That's on account of how wide the heating coil is. You can see in the picture that the diameter is wide enough to cover most of the basket. Pardon the cooking stains. Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann I’m currently living the Brooklyn apartment life, and it features extremely limited counter space. My Instant Vortex lives on my fridge—which is a good six inches over my head. Oddly, it’s really easy to move around. I can grab the machine over my head and walk over to the counter when I need it a few times a week. Equally, I have no problem putting it back up there. I attribute this not to my rippling lats, but to its squat, boxy shape and lightweight interior engine. Furthermore, the weight feels evenly distributed because the fan and heating element are centered in the top of the unit.That brings us to the less glamorous side of cooking: cleaning. “Love” is too strong a word, but I do not hate cleaning the Vortex. (I have hated cleaning other air fryers.) Once you lift out the grate, cleaning the basket takes no time. It’s wide open. Even if you have big hands or limited dexterity, it’s five wide, flat, easy to access panels. A soapy sponge and warm water takes care of that easily. For the grate, I recommend a soapy bristle brush. Both of these parts are also dishwasher-safe, if you have one of those treasures. The consA bit largeOne-thing-at-a-time cooking sessionsLike most appliance cons, these rather depend on you. That said, the Instant Vortex does have a large footprint, which is why I have to store it off the counter. To avoid any problems, make sure you measure the space you want it to live in. According to the product listing on Amazon, the dimensions are 12.36\"D x 14.92\"W x 12.83\"H. Account for a few inches of space behind the unit for ventilation during use. The drawback of such a simple design is that you can only cook one thing at a time in this type of basket-style air fryer. Sure, you could drop curly fries and shoe strings in together because they are about the same thickness and air fry at the same settings. However, if you’re air-frying multiple parts of a meal, like a pork tenderloin and phyllo wrapped crispy vegetables, you’ll have to cook one, wait, and then cook the other item and wait again before you eat. You might even have to clean the unit between cooking sessions depending on what you made first. Is this air fryer for you?If you want your air fryer to just do the job and do it right, this is the best air fryer for you. It’s easy to use for a first-timer and for the instruction-manual averse. The big, wide basket is excellent for baking pies, cakes, or even casseroles. Likewise, the size of the basket is great if you cook multiple portions in one shot. I can perfectly fit four big turkey burgers into it, and I can roast four large red peppers in there at once. This may not be a good fit if you need an air fryer to cook multiple parts of a meal (requiring different temperatures or timings) in one session. Consider something like the Ninja DoubleStack XL for that. If your primary concern is efficiency, even browning, and maximum crisping, well then, you’ve found your match.",
