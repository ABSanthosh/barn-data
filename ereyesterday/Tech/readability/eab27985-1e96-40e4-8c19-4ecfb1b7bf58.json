  "text": "Mark Zuckerberg doesn‚Äôt just want Meta to lead in the field of artificial intelligence. He wants to build the AI that leads you. In a memo to employees viewed by Gizmodo on June 30, the Meta CEO announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, a major reorganization of the company‚Äôs AI efforts under a single, ambitious goal: delivering personal superintelligence to everyone. Forget chatbots. Zuckerberg‚Äôs vision is much grander. He is betting that within a few years, AI will not just be answering your questions or writing your emails. It will be managing your schedule, anticipating your needs, running your home, helping you make decisions, and maybe even guiding your career. Call it Life-as-a-Service, powered by Meta. ‚ÄúAs the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight,‚Äù Zuckerberg wrote. ‚ÄúThis will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way.‚Äù Zuckerberg memo to employees, per a source, lays out vision for the \"Superintelligence\" division and new hires he says meta is \"uniquely positioned\" for the moment the sales pitch is, essentially, \"we the have money, compute and scale that most of our competitors do not\" pic.twitter.com/QQqYeynhCj ‚Äî rat king üêÄ (@MikeIsaac) June 30, 2025 The move is seen as a direct challenge to competitors. ‚ÄúThe launch of Meta Superintelligence labs isn‚Äôt just an announcement; it‚Äôs a statement: Meta won‚Äôt settle for second place in AI,‚Äù commented Alon Yamin, cofounder and CEO of the plagiarism detection platform Copyleaks. He added, ‚ÄúMeta and Mark clearly see this as a make or break moment for AI leadership.‚Äù Bloomberg reported on the memo earlier Monday. A Meta spokesperson has since confirmed its contents to Gizmodo. To make this happen, Zuckerberg is assembling a kind of AI Avengers team. The new hires represent a major talent coup: Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI and one of the most connected operators in the AI supply chain, joins as Meta‚Äôs new Chief AI Officer. Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub and an elite AI investor, is coming on board to run AI products and applied research. Shengjia Zhao, one of the co-creators of GPT-4, recently left OpenAI to join Meta‚Äôs new lab. These are power hires, people with reputations for building fast and thinking years ahead of the market. Zuckerberg says more big names are on the way. Meta already has a strong foundation with Llama, its open source family of large language models. The latest versions are now powering Meta AI, which the company claims reaches over 1 billion monthly users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. But that was just phase one. Zuckerberg now wants to build a new generation of models capable of what insiders call frontier performance. In simple terms, this means AI that can reason, plan, adapt, and act with little to no human instruction. If successful, this would not just make Meta competitive with OpenAI or Google DeepMind; it would make Meta the home of the world‚Äôs first truly general purpose personal intelligence. This is the kind of AI that doesn‚Äôt just answer your questions. It runs your life. Meta isn‚Äôt starting from scratch. Through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company already knows more about you than most of your friends do. It has spent the last 15 years quietly building a behavioral map of billions of people, tracking who you talk to, what you look at, what you say, and what you buy. That treasure trove of intimate data is now fuel for the next phase: an AI that not only serves you but knows you deeply enough to run your life better than you can. In tech speak, Zuckerberg‚Äôs vision is for ‚Äúagentic AI,‚Äù or AI that can take actions on your behalf. Imagine an always on, infinitely capable, personalized intelligence that lives on your phone, in your glasses, and across all your devices. You don‚Äôt schedule meetings, it does. You don‚Äôt organize your travel, it has already booked it. You don‚Äôt wonder what job to apply for, it is already editing your r√©sum√© and simulating the interview. You don‚Äôt ask what to wear, it saw your calendar and laid out your outfit. Meta is uniquely positioned to deliver this mass market personal AI brain. Unlike smaller labs, it has a global user base of billions, access to more behavioral data than almost any company on Earth, and massive computing infrastructure. And with Zuckerberg‚Äôs controlling shares, there are no shareholders to slow things down. But this also raises urgent questions. Who controls this intelligence? What will it prioritize? What happens when a machine knows your desires better than you do, and that machine works for a corporation? Zuckerberg believes Meta can be trusted to build and deliver superintelligence to the masses. But the next chapter in AI will not be about clever apps or productivity hacks. It will be a battle over who gets to program the brain that programs you.",
