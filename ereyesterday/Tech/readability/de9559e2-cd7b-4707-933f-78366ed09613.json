  "text": "Time zones are the bane of the remote worker's existence, especially if your team is international. You can try to keep track of who lives where and what time it is in which place, but my brain isn't wired for that and I know I'm not alone.There is a free and open source application (There is the app's name—I'm not just telling you that an app exists) by developer Dena Sohrabi that makes it easy to keep track of what time it is where your collaborators live. You can add time zones, then add a custom picture and name. This makes it very easy to see what time it is for the people on your team. There are plenty of apps out there for tracking time zones, yes, but There stands out because of its emphasis on people over places.To get started, just launch the application, click the menu bar icon, and click the Add button. From here you can add a name, a location, and optionally an image. You can manually add an image, if you want, or you can just type a X/Twitter or Telegram username and the image will auto-populate. Credit: Justin Pot Repeat this process for everyone that you work with regularly and you will have a handy reference for what time it is everywhere your team works. Things like daylight saving time will be accounted for, which is particularly useful if you work with people in places that don't do daylight saving time or live in a hemisphere that switches in the opposite direction as you (like I said: timezones are confusing).There doesn't offer much in the way of settings. You can decide whether people are shown in ascending or descending order; you can also set the app to open when your Mac starts up. There's not much else offered, and there doesn't need to be. The only thing I'd add, personally, is a desktop widget, which the developer notes she might add later.",
