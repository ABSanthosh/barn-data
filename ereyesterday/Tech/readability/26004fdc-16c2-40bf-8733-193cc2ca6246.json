  "text": "The new Disney+ show aims for Amblin vibes, which makes this '80s sci-fi jam the perfect song choice. Skeleton Crew, the latest Star Wars series to hit Disney+, premiered earlier this week and immediately set itself apart in the galaxy far, far away by boldly embracing Amblin-style vibes. Its set of brand-new characters includes the mysterious, Force-sensitive Jod Na Nawood (Jude Law)—and a group of adventurers whose average age skews younger than the usual Star Wars cast members. Keeping that retro ’80s feel alive is this new music video featuring a song previously heard in a Skeleton Crew trailer: synth-pop banger “Major Tom (Coming Home).” The song’s original artist, Peter Schilling, found chart success in 1983 with both the English and German versions of the track (that was a big thing in the ’80s; remember Nena’s “99 Luftballoons”?). But Skeleton Crew ups the Star Wars quotient by translating it into… Huttese? Yep. Huttese. You can now sing along to “Youngee Wim (Bunky Dunko)” like a ragtag space pirate even if you don’t speak Huttese, because this video contains all the lyrics on-screen. Star Wars karaoke, anyone? Star Wars: Skeleton Crew premiered its first two episodes Monday night, and it’ll have a weekly drop of the remaining six installments on Disney+. Lucasfilm describes the show as “the journey of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy. Finding their way home—and meeting unlikely allies and enemies—will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.” That plot makes the use of “Major Tom (Coming Home),” a song about a homesick astronaut who may or may not be lost in space, thematically appropriate—in any language. Skeleton Crew stars Jude Law, Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Kyriana Kratter, Robert Timothy Smith, Tunde Adebimpe, Kerry Condon, and Nick Frost. Want more io9 news?
