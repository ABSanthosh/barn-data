  "description": "As first reported by 9to5Mac, PS5 users now have a direct way to buy games in the PlayStation store with Apple Pay. When you purchase a game on your PS5 with Apple Pay, you'll be shown a QR code that you can scan with your iPhone or iPad to complete the transaction from there. Previously, PS5 users had to go through the console's browser or the PlayStation App on iOS to buy games with Apple Pay. The latest update is a simple quality of life upgrade for PS5 owners since most already have a credit card tied to their PlayStation account. However, Apple Card owners can more easily take advantage of their 2 percent cash back on Apple Pay purchases when buying PS5 games. Besides using a traditional card on file, Apple Pay joins PayPal as an alternative payment method. The Apple Pay compatibility on the PS5 was made possible through an iOS 18 update that allows users to buy things on third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox with a unique QR code. This change lays the groundwork for more Apple Pay implementation with other browsers and devices, including support for the PS4 in a later software update, as indicated by 9to5Mac.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/your-ps5-now-natively-accepts-apple-pay-193606732.html?src=rss",
