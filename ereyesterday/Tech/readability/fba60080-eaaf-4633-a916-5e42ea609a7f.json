  "text": "It was only a few days ago the first real trailer for the Lilo \u0026 Stitch remake came out, and it looks… like these remakes do? This is apparently the one Disney’s putting its weight behind this year, which means it’s time to brag about some metrics! According to Disney, the Lilo \u0026 Stitch trailer has garnered 158 million views within 24 hours. It’s the second-biggest trailer for its enterprise of live-action remakes to date, coming behind the 224.6 million views for the Lion King remake’s teaser trailer. (That teaser, which dropped in November 2018, was the second-biggest trailer drop ever at the time.) Lilo also did quite well on social media, taking the top trending spot on Twitter, YouTube, and China’s Douyin platform. Disney gave partial credit to Stitch popping up at the Super Bowl in a short teaser, which itself had 173.1 million views in 24 hours, and stands as the studio’s most-viewed digital spot. Disney’s no stranger to bragging about how well its trailers have done—just like we’re no stranger to reporting on them—but it is a bit strange to see it brag about Lilo \u0026 Stitch’s teaser getting second place. It also highlights how much the remakes have lost their potency: looking great was the general saving grace of Lion King, but such views are not apparent in what we’ve seen from Lilo. If folks aren’t gonna tune in for Snow White‘s CG dwarfs, they might not tune in for a CG alien pretending to be a CG dog. As always, the best and worst thing to happen to this remake may be it gets younger generations to watch the original animated version and see how the two differ. The Lilo \u0026 Stitch remake hits theaters on May 23. Want more io9 news?
