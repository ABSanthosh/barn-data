We look forward to engaging constructively and laying out how our services benefit UK consumers and also businesses, as well as the trade-offs inherent in any new regulations.People across the UK trust Google Search to help them find what they need. Search also helps millions of British businesses to grow and reach customers in innovative ways. Google’s products, including Search, helped to provide an estimated £118 billion in economic activity in 2023 in the UK, supporting over a million businesses across the country. Google Search and Ads are also helping UK businesses to export over £20 billion worth of goods and services across the world.Digital services like Search will power new economic development in the UK. Indeed, the CMA itself recognises that “Search is vital for economic growth”. We welcome the recognition of the importance of digital technologies to power growth, and the need to align regulatory decisions with the Government’s growth mission.A pro-innovation, evidence-based regime will help UK consumers and businesses by expanding options, reducing prices, and opening new markets. The alternative of overly prescriptive digital competition rules would end up stifling choice and opportunity for consumers and businesses.We will do our best to advocate for new rules that benefit every business and let people in the UK benefit from helpful, cutting-edge services.",
