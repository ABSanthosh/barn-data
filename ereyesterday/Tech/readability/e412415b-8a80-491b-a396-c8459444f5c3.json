  "text": "Prime Video plans to bring both The Boys and Gen V back for their respective new seasons sometime in 2025. The Boys got a dose of college-age heroics with Gen V, which focuses on a group of Supes in training attending the prestigious Godolkin University. While the main show is coming to a close, the spinoff is going back to class, and it’s bringing some new students along for the ride. Per Deadline, actors Keeya King (Yellowjackets), Julia Knope (In the Dark), Tait Fletcher (The Mandalorian), Stephen Kalyn (Warrior Strong), Stacey McGunnigle (This Hour Has 22 Minutes), Wyatt Dorian (Eerie Hall), and Georgie Murphy (Accused) will have recurring roles during Gen V’s sophomore outing. What roles will they have to play in the show’s story, and who will they be at Godolkin? Prime Video’s not saying yet, but season one stars Derek Luh and Maddie Phillips revealed production on the new season wrapped earlier this week. This past March, production paused following the death of Chance Perdomo, who played Andre. In May, Prime Video said his role wouldn’t be recast, and plotlines for the season were subsequently rewritten. Fellow season one stars Jaz Sinclar, Lizzie Broadway, London Thor, Asa Germann will reprise their roles from the previous season. Both Gen V and The Boys are expected to come back to Prime Video sometime in 2025. The streamer’s also got other spinoffs cooked up: at SDCC, it revealed Jensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy and Aya Cash’s Stormfront are set to headline Vought Rising, a prequel series set in the 1950s about the birth of the titular Corporation and its rise to creating superheroes. That’ll also joined by a show set in Mexico and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Andor’s Diego Luna. After that, who knows—maybe a movie? Want more io9 news?
