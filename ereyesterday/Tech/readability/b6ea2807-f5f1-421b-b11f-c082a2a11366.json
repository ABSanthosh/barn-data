  "description": "Vimeo, the business-focused video sharing and hosting platform, is bringing back its Apple TV app after ending support for all of its TV apps in 2023. While the company hasn't been trying to be a YouTube competitor for a while, TV apps were always more convenient than Vimeo's proposed solution of casting video from a smartphone or tablet. The rebuilt Vimeo Apple TV app lets you access Vimeo's curated library of Staff Picks, your personal library of uploaded videos and anything you've saved to your watchlist to watch later. Vimeo also says the app supports \"enhanced playback with chapters, speed controls, and multi-language options.\" The app is available to download and try now, provided your Apple TV is running tvOS 18 or later and you have a Free Vimeo account. Vimeo originally pivoted away from being a direct YouTube competitor in 2017, several years before it dropped support for its apps. Since then the company has styled itself as more of a enterprise service, providing a way for businesses and professional creatives to host and sell videos, and even build their own streaming services. Spinning up a new TV app doesn't necessarily mean Vimeo is changing strategies, but if you've got some student films hanging out in an old Vimeo account, you now have a much easier way to watch them at home.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/it-only-took-two-years-for-vimeo-to-realize-deleting-all-of-its-tv-apps-was-dumb-212724092.html?src=rss",
