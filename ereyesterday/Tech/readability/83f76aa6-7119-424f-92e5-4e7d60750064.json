Credit: Casetify, Glossier, Kimoli, Stanley / Mashable Composite Trends among teen girls are an ever-changing hellscape. Even millennials — people who are not that old, thank you very much — can have trouble navigating the world that's ruled by TikTok trends and whatever else high-school-aged girls can't seem to stop raving about. Funneling those trends into a gift that she’ll like and use for longer than a month seems nearly impossible. But you know who does get teenage girls? Other teenage girls. We asked our families, polled our staff, and scoured the internet to find out exactly what teenage girls actually want. The same items popping up over and over again each year is a constant reminder that, though the VSCO girl lifestyle meme may have ended in 2019, a few overarching concepts remain alive and well. Gen Z girls are loyal to a defined handful of brands and have very specific aesthetic goals. They don't just want workout gear, they want Lululemon yoga pants. They don't just want skincare products, they want serums from The Ordinary. They don't just want a reusable water bottle, they want the (weirdly specific) Stanley Quencher H2.0 tumbler. You get it. To make it easier for you to shop for a teen girl — when you're not a teen girl yourself (we get it, it's hard) — we've rounded up the very best gifts for the demographic in this easy-to-browse gift guide that's in the process of being updated for 2024. Cowboy boot photo stand Best for the collector of cute things This cowboy-boot-shaped photo stand is an Urban Outfitters exclusive and is sure to please lovers of the Wild West aesthetic (trust me, it's more popular right now among teen girls than you think). The trinket is made from glossy, brightly painted ceramic and will complement any desk setup. She'll love using it to prop up Polaroids of her friends and fam! The Hatch Restore alarm clock Best for problem sleepers Late-night cram sessions and sleepovers are a recipe for a funky sleep schedule. Many teens on TikTok are turning to one feature-packed alarm clock to get their Zzzs on track (well-rested girlies are happy girlies, after all). The Hatch Restore simulates a real sunrise by playing comfy wake-up sounds and increasing its warm glow gradually. SPONSORED Alienware gaming monitor Best for girls who game This is the kind of gift every teen gamer would love to get, but definitely won't splurge on for themselves. The 32-inch QD-OLED monitor features a 4K resolution with a coveted curved design that creates a more immersive experience that's particularly suited to gaming. Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Best for the active girlie Whether she regularly works out or just lives in comfy clothes, a teenage girl's wardrobe isn't complete without Lululemon accessories. One of the most iconic ones is this Belt Bag, which she's likely seen all her fave TikTokers sporting on their Hot Girl Walks around the city. The bag isn't all good looks though — it's also water-resistant; has spacious, zippered compartments; and easily allows you to wear it over your hips or \"crossbody\" style. The Shark FlexStyle Best premium Dyson AirWrap dupe Shark's barrel-style hot air tool produces low-damage luscious locks just like the Dyson AirWrap does — but for less than half the price. The FlexStyle acts as hair dryer, hair dryer brush, and curling iron in one through its included twist-off attachments, plus a diffuser. We're bigggg fans of this AirWrap dupe over here, and the teen girl in your life will no doubt be one, too. The Ordinary's Most-Loved Set Best skincare routine restock Shitty makeup wipes shouldn't be the extent of any adolescent skincare regimen. The Ordinary is well-regarded by experts, beloved by Gen Z, and — best of all —affordable. Buy her this set of minis (including Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and the Caffeine Solution) to try out The Ordinary's approach to skincare before buying their full-sized products. A Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler Best for girls on their hydration game Ask a teen girl whether she's heard of the Stanley Quencher H2.0 water bottle, and she'll probably start screaming (in a good way). Gen Z's obsession with this viral-on-TikTok bottle is understandable — after all, it comes in a vast assortment of VSCO-worthy colors, keeps drinks cold for up to two days (!!), and is portable enough to take to class or dance practice. The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) Best for literally any teenager ever These AirPods are a true upgrade from their 2nd Gen predecessors, what with features like Personalized Spatial Audio (that adjusts to the movement of your head), a MagSafe-friendly charging case, and up to six hours of runtime on a single charge. Whether she's into music or podcasts, this gift absolutely can't miss. An Etsy gift card Best for girls who'd rather pick their own gift Gifting decor that an artsy teenager *wants* to show off can be risky. With an Etsy gift card, she can peruse the collections of millions of sellers — either finding a dreamy, handmade rug or buying the supplies to make her own. Nike Dunk Lows Best for the street style fans When it comes to activewear paired with streetwear, arguably no brand is more iconic than Nike. There seems to be a resurrection of Nike everything these days, and these Dunk Low sneaks are no exception. Their low-profile design and monochrome theme will ensure she can pair them with any outfit — and turn some heads in the process. An engraved bracelet Best personalized gift This Bespoke Plate Adjustable Bracelet in gold (which you can engrave with her name or a message and throw some heart symbols in there while you're at it) is both affordable as far as personalized jewelry goes and also made to last a lifetime. Give the teen in your life a gift she'll never forget — and wear everywhere. An easy-care indoor plant Best for nature appreciators Plants are the hippest little decor pieces nowadays — and some of the best company, too. Even the drabbest bedrooms can be brightened up with a Money Tree plant, which not only adds some serious greenery to any space but is also said to bring good fortune for its owner. A win-win in our books. A Bluetooth record player Best for girls getting into vinyl The wall of records in every Urban Outfitters proves it: Even modern teenagers agree that Spotify (or Apple Music, whatever) can't always compete with vinyl. If she's looking to get into record collecting, the Victrola Vintage Record Player is a good starting point. It has the retro vibe that she's probably looking for, but can still act as a Bluetooth speaker. The OLED Nintendo Switch Best for the gamer Named for its ability to switch from TV to mobile play, the Nintendo Switch is a nice middle ground if she's not into bigger consoles. Classics like Mario Kart turn boring days into parties, and \"Stardew Valley\" is a must for dreary days at home. Even if she already has one, the newest OLED version will be a much-appreciated upgrade. A pair of roller skates Best for girls dreaming of the '70s The roller skating revival has proven to be more than a 2020 peak-of-quarantine phase. Roller Derby's quad skates have the ankle stability and chunky toestop that beginners need but are also lightweight enough to practice footwork. They're intentionally retro-inspired and will make the teen girl in your life swoon. Wired headphones Best for simplistic \"It girls\" Following in the footsteps of iconic Chill Girls™ like Jenna Ortega (AKA the most recent Wednesday Addams), some Gen Z members are reverting to wired headphones. Shunning Bluetooth is essentially a diss to all things mainstream, and we'll admit that wired headphones are a lot harder to lose. A pair of Levi's 501s Best closet staple The Levi's 501 will never die. Every sensible fashionista needs a pair of ol' reliables, which can be paired with just about any look in any season. Psst... they also last forever. The classic jeans now come in multiple different cuts and rises, but the OG fit is a safe bet. A durable, attention-grabbing phone case Best for fire mirror selfies A new phone case is a good gift for someone who just got a new phone and a better gift for someone who's bored of their old phone. Casetify, an \"it\" brand with a feverish Instagram presence, has a pattern for every taste, including collabs with tons of small artists. This particular Strawberry Checkers design is oh-so-cute yet also quite durable. A pearl phone charm Best for elevating those mirror selfies even further If you're already eyeing the Casetify phone case included in our gift guide, this phone charm from the same brand is an ideal add-on to your cart. Phone charms are all the rage in the Gen Z community right now, and this one provides some Y2K bling — complete with pearls, funky beads, and gems. The Instax Mini 12 Best for the devoted moment capturer High school is the most photographable period ever. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is the perfect portable pal for capturing (and immediately printing) her favorite moments. The successor to the Mini 11 brings cool features like fully automatic exposure for bright backgrounds and \"close-up mode.\" A deck of Tarot cards Best for aspiring witches Tarot cards are an essential tool for the modern mystic, and this beginner's deck may be the push she needs to dive into the hobby she's been eyeing. The Feminine Tarot Card Deck has beautiful and glossy golden edges, features only female figures (major win), and comes with a 200-page guidebook. A Kindle e-reader Best for the bookworm For someone with a massive reading list, a glare-free e-reader could be more valuable than a tablet. Even if her love for flipping real pages won't ever die (same), the convenience of millions of titles without the weight is hard to argue with. The 2022 Kindle with 16 GB in it is basically palm-sized, lasts for weeks on one charge, and is cheaper than models like the Paperwhite. A bubble tea kit Best for the boba shop regular Help her make bubble tea at home when a real boba date isn't in the cards. This kit from Locca includes loose-leaf flavors like matcha and Earl Grey lavender, special straws, and enough tapioca pearls to make over 20 drinks. A portable speaker Best for the music fanatic Let's not act like the speaker on an iPhone cuts it. The Marshall Kilburn II utilizes its multi-directional sound to create booming waves of music and dynamic range that will do Phoebe Bridgers justice. The compact speaker is very portable and plays for 20+ hours on one charge. A weighted blanket Best for soft blanket hoarders Weighted blankets have gained popularity for their ability to reduce anxiety with the snuggly, hug-like sensation known as Deep Touch Pressure Simulation. An affordable fan-favorite, the Luna is composed of layers of glass beads — yet somehow still feels like a cloud. An ice roller Best for skincare gurus If the teen girl in your life is on TikTok (hint — she is), she has definitely seen this ice roller on her FYP. Praised for its ability to reduce puffiness, promote lymph circulation, tighten skin, and provide a much-needed face massage, this handy tool is perfect to use any time of day. A heart-shaped ice cube tray Best for beverage enjoyers Ice cube tray TikTok is a real thing, and it's impossible to deny the allure of cutesy, heart-shaped ice molds that instantly elevate a drink. Treat her to this silicone set of three ice molds — transforming her mocktail-making routine forever. We're Not Really Strangers card game Best for the young philosophers Warning: Feelings may arise after playing this game. We're Not Really Strangers is putting a new spin on game night — what with its mission of empowering meaningful human connections via conversation prompts meant to open hearts and foster empathy. This is perfect for her next slumber party or to play after a family dinner. Funky candles Best for amateur interior decorators Funky candles are quite hot right now and hyped up by teen girls everywhere for their ability to spice up any room setting. This set of two bubble-shaped candles at Amazon is made of high-quality soy wax and is guaranteed to fill a space with subtle, floral aromas. A wicker picnic basket Best for cottagecore girls If the teen girl you're shopping for can be described as having a \"cottagecore\" aesthetic (think simple living, an obsession with owning a farmhouse in the country, an alarming number of sundresses in her closet, and a knack for making DIY sourdough), this wicker picnic basket is sure to please her. After all, it's ideal for dreamy, relaxed lunches with friends somewhere on a field. Glossier You perfume Best for unofficial Glossier cult members Anything from the skincare and makeup brand Glossier is fair game as far as gifts for teen girls go. If you want to treat her to a long-lasting fragrance that bears warm, floral notes overlaid with hints of peppercorn, Glossier's signature fragrance is the way to go. Get it in 50 ml or 100 ml options for good measure. A rib knit beanie Best for those who like staying warm Winter is fast approaching, which means that — for those thinking pragmatically — a warm beanie hat might be a wonderful, timely gift for a teen girl. This one from the brand Carhartt comes in many attractive colors, will protect her from those nasty winter winds, and make her feel badass in the meantime. Bluetooth-compatible smart lightstrip Best for girls who appreciate \"the vibes\" If she's a budding TikToker who wants a cool room backdrop for her videos or simply appreciates \"ambiance,\" these LED lights won't disappoint. They are compatible with Alexa, can sync with music, are Bluetooth-paired, and can be adjusted for color/intensity. What's not to love? Book of the Month subscription Best for Goodreads account owners Book of the Month is the reigning king of book subscription boxes — sending you a book (of your choosing) every month and, in this way, encouraging long-term reading habits. If you plan on pampering her with this gift (which will literally keep on giving until the subscription's cancellation), the first month's book will cost ya only $5 and $16.99/month from then on. A printed canvas bag Best for girls with a lot to carry If the teen girl you're browsing this gift guide for always has a ton of stuff with her (lipgloss, purse, latest read, phone, etc.), simplify her life with a gorg tote bag that she can carry throughout the day with ease. Bags from the Amazon brand Kimoli come printed with trendy inspirational quotes like \"Choose Kindness\" or \"I Hope You Feel Beautiful Today.\" With this purchase, she will. Little Words Project bracelet Best for sentimental types Little Words Project does wearable affirmations like no other brand — encouraging girls everywhere to be kind, embrace community, and give back through the Pinterest-worthy phrases featured on each of its bracelets. This particular one says \"Be A Light\" and is perfect to give to the light in your own life. A matcha starter pack Best for matcha girlies If the teen girl in your life is a huge Emma Chamberlain fan (ask her about this well-known social media star), as well as a matcha enthusiast, this matcha-making kit from Emma's coffee brand is a godsend gift. It comes with a mason jar, a straw pack, and matcha powder in four scrumptious flavor options. A Madhappy mental health journal Best for those with a journaling habit The Madhappy Journal is making its rounds in pop culture right now, thanks to its mission of promoting rich self-discovery through journal prompts. Daily templates will help the girl in your life make sense of the jumble of thoughts and feelings in her head; plus, this journal is vibrant, pleasant-to-the-touch, and has creamy, thick pages perfect for some deep reflection. A disco ball planter Best for disco lovers with a green thumb Remember that money tree plant we recommended earlier in the gift guide? Yeah, this disco ball planter is another must-have for all girls who appreciate greenery (and also the disco ball aesthetic everyone on TikTok raves about). She'll be able to hang it in her room via a sturdy chain or macrame hanger, and, when the light hits right, this planter will emit glimmers on her walls! An Echo Dot smart speaker Best for those tired of Siri If the teen girl you know and love wants an everyday helper that's a little more versatile than Siri, treat her to a 2022 5th Gen Echo Dot — which she can use to find ingredients for her favorite cookie recipes, call all her friends, play some Jeopardy!, or set morning reminders before school. The possibilities are endless with Amazon's Echo Dot: Let her experience them first-hand. A pair of Barbiecore Crocs Best for real-life Barbies If she still can't stop talking about Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie and now greets all her friends with \"Hey, Barbie!\", you might as well get her these Crocs before she buys them herself. The Crocs x Barbie collab is everything and more; this purchase includes eight Barbie-movie-themed Jibbitz charms, 2.9-inch platform shoes, and that iconic comfort only Crocs can provide. The latest Apple Watch Best for owners of Apple everything Apple's latest Series 9 watch has everything a teenage girl could want: A display that can be operated without ever touching the screen (what century are we living in again?), faster-than-ever responses from Siri, and powerful insights that will help her track both her physical and mental health. Plus, how could she ever resist an Apple Watch with a pink aluminum case and light pink sport band? It's the year of the Barbie, after all. A light-up cowboy hat Best for concert-goers Once upon a time, every teenage girl's celeb crush Harry Styles wore a cowboy hat on stage, and, since then, teen girls everywhere have been pulling up to his concerts sporting light-up cowboy hats. It's their world (we're just living in it). If the teen girl you're shopping for doesn't have one of these bling, campy hats yet, this is going to make her endlessly grateful. A satin pillowcase set Best for all the sleepyheads All teen girls relate to the singular struggle of waking up after a good night's sleep with a frizzy 'do and tangles in their hair. Luckily, this satin pillowcase set from Kitsch will resolve all such issues. Made from 600-thread-count satin fabric, it's made to leave your hair shiny, prevent breakage, and also keep your skin hydrated! It's fine time to pamper her with all of these benefits. A cardholder and keychain combo Best for new drivers If she just got her license and wants to flaunt that ID/car keys combo to everyone and anyone, this Vera Bradley Zip ID Case wallet is the way to go. It seems like this brand and product never go out of style in high schools all over the country. The wallet is lightweight, comes in many girly, sophisticated patterns, and allows you to keep all your valuables close at all times!

Her ever-growing experience in these categories comes in clutch when making recommendations on how to spend your money during shopping holidays like Black Friday, which Leah has been covering for Mashable since 2017.The robot vacuum beat in particular has cemented itself as Leah's main ~thing~ across the past few years. Since 2019, her expertise has been perpetually bolstered by the meticulous eye she keeps on robot vacuum deals and new releases, but more importantly, her hands-on experience with more than 25 robot vacuums tested in her own home.
