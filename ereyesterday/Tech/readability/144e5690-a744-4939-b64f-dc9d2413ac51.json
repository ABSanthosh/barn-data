Following weeks of rumors that the hugely popular battle royale shooter Fortnite would be doing an entire season of content themed around a galaxy far, far away, it may soon be official. On Wednesday, the official Fortnite account on X (formerly Twitter) revealed the game would be making a special announcement at the Star Wars Celebration in Japan on Saturday, April 19. While the Star Wars-centric season wasn't confirmed in the post, it did tease \"what's coming next to Fortnite.\" Screenshot by CNETThere's no specific time for when this Star Wars-Fortnite announcement will be made on Saturday, so if you're interested in checking it out, stay tuned to the official Star Wars YouTube page, where all the Celebration livestreams are typically hosted.Disney, LucasFilm and Fortnite creator Epic Games didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\"With all the recent map area takeovers, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic and LucasFilm teamed up to do the same for Star Wars,\"CNET Senior Reporter David Lumb said about the situation. \"Since there aren't any big Star Wars shows or films coming out that this could help promote, aside from the second season of the excellent (but not very Fortnite-friendly) political thriller Andor, I expect it's just good old crossover fun for fans of both -- and thankfully something more fun than adding a few skins to the game.\"Is Fortnite Chapter 6, Season 3 based on Star Wars?While this announcement seems to make things official, a Star Wars season of Fortnite has been rumored for a while now, based on claims from some of the game's more trustworthy leakers. On March 26, FNBRIntel claimed on X that Chapter 6, Season 3 of Fortnite would be entirely Star Wars-centric and feature \"New POIs based on the series, new mythics \u0026 skins, and the storyline should connect to it in some way.\" Other leaked info claims this new content will be focused around the original trilogy of movies, so sorry to be the bearer of bad news for all the Clone Wars fanatics and Reylo stans out there.If you're not familiar with Fortnite, then try bonding with the 10-year-olds in you life a bit more, as they have much to share on the subject. But what you need to know most is that a typical \"season\" can last a few months. It might seem strange for a game like Fortnite, well-known for featuring almost every IP ever created, to focus on one property for that long, so leaks have also indicated that Chapter 6, Season 3 will only last for about a month, running from May 2 to June 8.Disney, LucasFilm and Epic Games have a history of working together, with Star Wars content and characters prominently featured in the game throughout the years. Most notably -- and befuddlingly -- a major canon story development key to the 2019 movie, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, played out exclusively in Fortnite.Are any other Star Wars games coming to Star Wars Celebration?As the name makes clear, Star Wars Celebration is a celebration of all things Star Wars, so you can bet your bottom credits that there will be more video game news than just a Fortnite collaboration. Earlier this week, Electronic Arts announced that Star Wars: Zero Company, a new turn-based strategy game from Respawn Entertainment and Bit Reactor, would be shown off at Celebration on April 19. Respawn is the studio best known for creating the Titanfall shooter series and its battle royale spinoff, Apex Legends, as well as the acclaimed Star Wars: Jedi series. Bit Reactor is an upstart developer committed to strategy games featuring veteran talents that previously worked on the XCOM and Civilization franchises.",
