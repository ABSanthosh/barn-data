  "text": "What’s scarier than meeting your partner’s parents? If the trailer for The Parenting is anything to go by, it’s that while in a possibly haunted house. Max released the first trailer for its upcoming horror-comedy directed by Craig Johnson, which sees millennial couple Rohan (Nik Dodani) and Josh (Brandon Flynn) host a weekend getaway with their respective families. Problem is, they’re doing this at a rented country house that starts having weird stuff going on around it and one another. Eventually, the pairings realize something freaky’s going on and have to survive the rest of the weekend with a demon that’s using Brian Cox’s body to knock them all off. You can imagine the rest of The Parenting from there, and to the trailer’s credit, it looks like it’ll be fairly fun. Maybe not as delightfully gory as something like The Monkey or the head trip of It’s What’s Inside, but it’s got a good cast and there seem to be some decent gags sprinkled throughout. If you’ve been missing Brian Cox play a grumpy old man on Succession and want to see that again while he’s also nude and posesssed, then this is the movie for you. Also starring Vivian Bang, Dean Norris, Edie Falco, Parker Posey, and Lisa Kudrow, The Parenting hits Max on Thursday, March 13. Want more io9 news?
