  "text": "The Kevin Williamson-directed sequel will be released February 27, 2026. Details regarding Scream 7 are starting to trickle out as the horror franchise detours back into a story with its original remaining stars. As original film scribe Kevin Williamson takes the helm of a Scream film for the first time, he’s bringing it all together with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) as they encounter ghosts of friends and ghostfaces past, including David Arquette, Scott Foley, and Matthew Lillard. Some of the Scream reboot core cast also remains, with Mason Gooding and Jasmine Savoy reprising their roles as the Meeks twins  But now there’s the development that the film will jump ahead in time for a “really cool reason” as shared by the film’s writer Guy Busick to ComicBook.com. Busick continued to elaborate why the movie has become a Sidney-centered story, making the series’ original final girl once again the lead. “I don’t want to give anything away about the reason [Scream 7] had to be a Sidney movie because there’s a really cool reason,” Busick told ComicBook. “In all these movies, you have to ask, ‘Why now? What is the thing Scream is commenting on now?’ Scream is always in a conversation with the audience about the state of movies, the state of horror movies and in particular, franchises.” He shared that her participation was tantamount to the new installment’s themes. “We went to Neve Campbell and said, ‘This is why. This is why Sidney now.’ Neve was like, ‘Oh, I get that.’ I pitched Kevin [Williamson] this first, too. He got it and then I pitched the studio.” He added that the new movie will not be set in New York, as the previous film was. It will also feature a time jump. “I don’t want to be the one to spoil where it is,” Busick said; he also was vague on the time shift, but for seemingly less spoiler-y reasons. “It’s an unspecified amount of time [after Scream VI]. I might get contradicted by other people, but in my mind, more than two years. I would say at least two years. It could be two years, but I would say two years plus.” Many are rightfully mad that Melissa Barrera was controversially pushed out of leading the franchise’s rebirth, and the repercussions of that might affect the interest with this particular sequel. It remains to be seen if bringing back so many past characters will be enough to compensate for perhaps wrongfully abandoning the Carpenter sisters storyline. In the meantime we’ll be wondering if it’s back to Woodsboro we go! Scream 7 will hit theaters February 27, 2026. Want more io9 news?
