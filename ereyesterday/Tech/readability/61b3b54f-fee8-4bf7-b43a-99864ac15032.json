Best Massage Guns for 2025: Personal Trainer Tested Which is the best massage gun overall? Best massage guns of 2025 Best massage guns compared How we test massage guns Other massage guns we tested Factors to consider when buying a massage gun Massage gun tips How to use a massage gun Best massage guns FAQ Can you use a massage gun while pregnant? What features make for a good massage gun? Best Memorial Day Deals CNET’s team of shopping experts have explored thousands of deals on everything from mattresses and TVs to everyday essentials and outdoor fun so you can shop the best Memorial Day deals in one place. See now Which is the best massage gun overall? TheraGun/CNETMy favorite massage gun overall was the Theragun Elite. As a fitness expert, I’m familiar with the functions of massage guns and have tested them for many years. I found the Theragun Elite to be easy enough to use for both beginners and experienced fitness enthusiasts. The screen on the handle is simple to follow, so the massage gun speed and battery life are clear. The amplitude -- the ability to get deep into your muscles -- is on the higher side for a massage gun. Therabody is a well-respected brand with a wide range of recovery products, so you know you're getting a top-notch massage gun. If you're not a fan of the loud percussion noise that's normally associated with massage guns, you may prefer one of the quieter options on this list, such as the Ekrin Athletics Bantam.Best massage guns of 2025 Pros Easy to use for experienced and inexperienced users It has carrying case for safe storage OLED screen makes it easy to read settings Can be controlled through Therabody app Cons Expensive at $400 120-minute battery life could be longer On the louder side at 65-68 decibels Why we like it: I liked the Theragun Elite the most because it’s a powerful, easy-to-use massage gun with a comfortable handle. It provides 40 pounds of pressure and has five built-in speeds, ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It also has an amplitude of 16 millimeters, which gets deeper into the muscles. The Elite has five attachments: a dampener, standard ball, wedge, thumb and cone. It also lets you access preset guided routines from the Therabody app (available for iPhone and Android) in case you need help getting started with your massage gun. Once turned on, I liked that the Elite has a screen that indicates its current speed setting and remaining battery. It's a powerful massager, falling between the Theragun Pro Gen 5 and the Theragun Prime. Who it’s best for: The Elite is more user-friendly than some of the other massage guns, thanks to the simplicity of its features, while having more power than the Prime. Both beginners and athletes will get good use from the Elite to break down knots and eliminate sore muscles. Physical therapists who use massage guns in their practice may find this massage gun to be a good option to have on hand for their patients.Who shouldn’t buy it: My one gripe with the Elite is that it's supposed to be one of Theragun's quieter massage gun models, but I still thought it was on the louder side, especially as you amp up the power. This might deter you from this model if you want a massage gun that is quieter. It also has a shorter battery life (120 minutes) than the other guns on this list and isn’t ideal to carry with you when you’re traveling since it isn’t compact. If you want to be able to carry your massage gun everywhere, then I would recommend one that is smaller, like the Theragun Mini or Ekrin Athletics Bantam.Editors' note: The Theragun Elite has since been discontinued, and this page will be updated as we re-test massage guns. Pros Long battery life of 8 hours Quieter than most massage guns at 35-55 decibels The handle is angled for extra comfort Has a carrying case Cons Expensive May be a bit big for travel Why we like it: I liked the Ekrin Athletics B37S Percussion Massager because of its eight-hour battery life. It has the longest battery life of all the massage guns on this list. The B37S has five adjustable speeds ranging from 1,400 to 3,200 percussions per minute. This includes up to 56 pounds of deep percussive force, which tackles those hard-to-reach knots. It also has four head attachments to choose from. This massage gun is sturdy and less bulky than other massage guns, and it has various features. The power button, found at the top of the handle, controls the speed and is easy to maneuver. Even at the lowest speed setting, the B37S felt powerful.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is best for people who don't want to recharge their device regularly. The B37S is on par with elite massage guns like Theragun and Hypervolt, but it beats both brands when it comes to battery life. The handle is angled and long enough that someone with bigger hands can comfortably hold it in their hand. It also comes with a sleek case for easy storageWho shouldn’t buy it: If you want a compact massage gun, the B37S is not the best choice. Even with a carrying case, this massage gun still takes up enough room that you’re better off with a smaller alternative.  Pros Long battery life of 6 hours Has a travel case Powerful and lightweight at 1.1 pounds Cons Power and speed are controlled by the same button What we like about it: I liked the Ekrin Athletics Bantam as a mini massage gun option. It's sleek, slim, lightweight, compact (the size of an iPhone) and comfortable to hold. It also has a six-hour battery life, which is long for most massage guns, let alone a mini. The Bantam comes with a travel case and four head attachments. You have more options than with its competitor, the Theragun Mini second generation, which only has three. The Bantam has three speeds ranging from 2,000 to 3,200 percussions per minute and provides 10 mm of amplitude and up to 35 pounds of pressure.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is best for someone looking for a mini massage gun that can be carried in a gym bag or purse. It can also be a good option for someone who doesn't want to fully commit to a full-size massage gun but still wants a solid option that provides plenty of muscle relief. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a full-size massage gun, you’re better off with one of the larger massage guns on the list. If you’re picky about the style of the handle of the massage gun and prefer something that sits more snugly in the hand, then the Theragun Mini 2nd generation is a better fit because it has an ergonomic handle.  Pros Smaller and lighter at 0.45 kg Powerful for a small massage gun with 12 mm of amplitude Can be used for travel or on the go Cons Battery life is still hard to determine Could use a better travel case What we like about it: The second-gen Theragun Mini packs a powerful punch. It's the improved Mini in the Theragun collection and it's a solid upgrade from the original. The second-gen Theragun Mini is quieter than the original Mini, 20% smaller and 30% lighter. This time around you get three attachments with your Mini instead of just the one that the original had. This massage gun has three speeds ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It has 12 mm of amplitude, which is deep for a mini massage gun. By comparison, the Bantam massage gun only has 10 mm of amplitude. The Theragun Mini second generation maintains the same solid ergonomic handle that the originaMini has to make up for its compact shape. The Mini's power button also controls the speed and uses lights to indicate the speed level. Another plus is that it's Bluetooth-enabled, so you can connect it to the Therabody app.Who it’s best for: The Theragun Mini is ideal if you want a mini massage gun that can easily fit into a gym bag or carry-on. The massage gun also comes with a soft case to protect it while you’re on-the-go. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a mini massage gun with more attachments, then opt for the Ekrin Bantam instead of the Theragun Mini.   Pros Most powerful massage gun on list 20% quieter than previous model Lighter than older version Has customizable and preset programs Cons Expensive May be intimidating for average person Upgrades are not drastic compared to last version The fifth generation of the Theragun Pro has an upgraded design compared to the previous model. It's 20% quieter, smaller and slightly lighter than the original (2.76 pounds vs. 2.91 pounds). Therabody kept the important features of its predecessor: an adjustable head angle, five speeds, a 150-minute battery life, 16 mm of amplitude and 60 pounds of pressure. New upgrades include customizable speed ranges and visually guided built-in routines through the OLED screen: Sleep, Warm Up, Recovery and Theragun Break. Other additions include a new attachment, the Micropoint, intended to increase stimulation. It also has a Bluetooth connection, so it's easy to manage from the Therabody app.Once turned on, it's noticeable that it's significantly quieter than the previous version. It's still powerful even at the lowest speed. Therabody kept the rotating arm, which makes it easy to target hard-to-reach areas.The downside to the newest Pro is that it's still the most expensive massage gun on this list. This may not be the best option for everyone since you can get a similar experience with a less expensive device. Athletes and others who are physically active all day would benefit the most from this full-featured massage gun. Pros Quiet motor for a standard-size massage gun LED display makes for easy-to-read settings 8 massage head options Inexpensive at $60 Has a carrying case Cons It has to be set at the last two settings to really feel power Plastic design makes it seem less durable What we like about it: For a heavy-duty massage gun, the Lifepro's Sonic Handheld Percussion Massage Gun is on the quieter side. The battery lasts three to six hours and consists of five speeds, ranging from 1,200 to 2,800 percussions per minute. The Sonic also has the most massage head attachments (eight) of all the massage guns on this list. It’s affordable at only $60 if you're looking to spend under $100 on a massage gun.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is good for beginners because it is less intimidating than other heavy-duty massage guns. The battery is long-lasting, and it offers plenty of amplitude to get deep into sore muscles. The LED panel on the Sonic shows all the speeds and remaining battery life listed in one place, so it's easy to read. If you're new to percussive therapy, this is a good option that gives you the full experience without breaking the bank.Who shouldn’t get it: This massage gun is on the bigger side, so it's not suitable for traveling. If you want a more portable massage gun, consider one of the mini options instead. An issue I had with the Sonic was that I had to set it at the highest setting to feel the power of the massage gun. This is less common with heavy-duty massage guns, like the Theragun, because you can still feel the intensity at the lowest setting. Another aspect that could be improved on the Sonic is the design of the body of the gun. It's made up of plastic, which makes it seem less durable.  Pros Affordable at $70 Quiet for a big massage gun at 45 decibels Good alternative to Theragun Pro 5th gen You can change the massage head angle to hit hard-to-reach areas Decent 4-hour battery life Cons Not as stylish as the high-end massage guns Plastic design makes it seem cheap What we like about it: The Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun may not look as sophisticated as the other massage guns on this list, but it is still effective. The R4 Pro has a rotating head that can be adjusted to five positions by pressing a large button on the side of the massage head. This feature reminded me of the Theragun Pro, which functions similarly. Being able to change the angle of the massage gun is key because you can target hard-to-reach areas. It has 10 mm of amplitude, so it doesn't penetrate as deeply as the Theragun Pro, but it still gets the job done. The R4 Pro has four speeds and comes with six attachments: L ball head, M ball head, fork, bullet, flat and air-cushioned head. Who it’s best for: If you want a massage gun that isn't expensive but has the features of a high-end one (minus the app function), the Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun is a solid pick. After all, $70 is reasonable compared to spending hundreds of dollars on a massage gun with similar features. The massage gun has an easy-to-read panel that indicates the current speeds and battery level. The battery life on this massage gun is decent, lasting up to four hours. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a heavy-duty massage gun that’s well-made, then this one may fall short. The plastic material makes it seem cheaper compared to a Theragun or even an Ekrin option. It’s also bulkier compared to other massage guns because of the curved arm. If you’d like the option to carry the massage gun in a gym bag or carry-on, it’s too big to be considered portable, even with the carrying case.Best massage guns compared Massage GunWeightAmplitudeSpeed SettingsBattery LifeNoiseHSA/FSA EligibleWarrantyTrial PeriodPrice Theragun Elite 2.2 pounds16mm5 speeds120 mins65-68 decibelsYes1 year30 days$400Lifepro's Sonic Handheld Percussion Massage Gun 3.9 pounds12mm5 speeds3-6 hoursN/AYesLifetime30 days$60Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun 2.2 pounds10mm4 speeds2 hours45 decibelsYes1 year1 year $70Ekrin Athletics B37S Percussion Massager 2.2 pounds12mm5 speeds8 hours35-55 decibelsYesLifetime30 days$200Ekrin Athletics Bantam 1.1 pounds 10mm3 speeds6 hoursN/AYesLifetime30 days$130Theragun Mini (2nd Generation) 0.45 kg12mm3 speeds120 mins60.5 decibelsYes1 year30 days$160Theragun Pro (5th Generation) 2.2 pounds16mm5 speeds150 mins20% quieterYes1 year30 days$530 Design: Although massage guns have a standard shape, we looked at the designs and materials that make up each massage gun. Even if they look similar, the knobs, buttons and screens can vary per product.Amplitude: The amplitude or the depth of the massage is the key to owning a solid massage gun. The higher the amplitude, the deeper the massage gun can target your muscles. We looked at the amplitude and observed how the massage gun felt in use. Additionally, we consider the speed settings on each of these massage guns.Noise: Massage guns are known for their loud vibrations, so we observed the level of noise generated by each massage gun. Although you can't eliminate the noise created by the massage gun, we took into account the size and decibels. Features: We looked at any unique features the massage guns offered such as apps, screen display, attachments available, travel carrying cases and more. Certain features can appeal to both the average user and professionals like physical therapists who may use massage guns in their practice.Hypervolt 2 Pro: The Hypervolt 2's successor was louder and heavier than I would've liked, but it has five speeds and is a good option if you find the speeds on the Hypervolt 2 aren't enough.Hypervolt Go 2: Hypervolt's travel-size massage gun fell short when it came to power. It also didn't come with a travel case. It's a good option if you prefer something quieter than the Theragun Mini.Theragun Prime: This Theragun version seems too expensive for its simplicity. But if you're loyal to Theragun and prefer a simple massage gun, the Prime is your best bet. Theragun Pro (4th gen): This version didn't make the list because the fifth generation stepped things up a notch, and it's quieter.Vybe Pro Percussion: Compared to the other massage guns on this list, the design of the Vybe Pro looks less sophisticated, and its buttons feel easy to break. I also found the arm too long, which adds to its weight.Lifepro DynaMini: This mini lacked power unless you cranked it up to the two highest settings. It would have also benefited from a nonslip rubber coating on the handle, because the whole massage gun is made up of heavy metal. Renpho Mini: This pocket-size massage gun is an affordable option if you aren't looking for a fancy design. It's made of plastic, which makes me question its durability if it were to fall. Budget: Think about how much you're willing to invest in a massage gun because a good one can cost anywhere from $100 to $600.Intensity: Determine if you're looking for a heavy-duty version or if you'd be happy with a less intense massage gun. Percussion or vibration therapy: Some massage guns offer either vibration or percussion therapy. Put simply, vibration therapy sends vibrations and constantly touches the surface of the skin, whereas percussive therapy uses pressure to get deeper into the muscle and glides on and off of the skin. The latter tends to be the preferred option of many. Frequency: Ask yourself how often you'll be using the massage gun. If it's frequent, you'll want to consider a massage gun with a decent battery life. Traveling: Determine if you're planning on taking it while traveling or on the go. There are smaller massage guns on the market that are suitable for these purposes, and some massage guns include carrying cases.If you're new to massage guns there are some things to keep in mind so you're getting the most out of them. We spoke with sports chiropractor and Hyperice ambassador Julia Morgan for advice on the best massage gun practices.Choosing the right massage gun: There are different types of massage guns on the market, so it's helpful to know if you want something heavy-duty because you're very active or if you don't need the massage gun with all the bells and whistles because you're only going to use it occasionally. Setting a budget for yourself is important, too, because some massage guns can go upwards of $100.Know what specs to look at: When choosing a massage gun, there are a couple of features you want to look at: The amplitude and stall force. \"Stall force simply means how much pressure the motor of the massage gun can withstand before the motor 'stalls' with us,\" explains Morgan. Amplitude refers to how deep into the region it can go. You'll typically see amplitude in the range of 8mm, 12mm or 16mm as the deepest. Usually, heavy-duty massage guns have the highest amplitude compared to mini massage guns.Know the attachments: Most massage guns will come with a few different attachments that you can switch up depending on the area you're targeting. For example, the common attachments may include a standard ball which is good for large and small muscle groups, a bullet which is meant to target legs and back muscles, a forked head which is intended to target the spine, shoulders and neck, and a flat head which offers a gentler massage on the larger muscles.How often to use: Massage guns are safe to use regularly as long as there are no health concerns to address first. Morgan says, \"Those with thin skin, who have underlying musculoskeletal or vascular conditions, or who are pregnant, should consult their doctor before use.\" Although massage guns are safe to use daily to soothe sore muscles or as part of a warm-up, it's important to ensure you're not experiencing chronic pain. \"If you're using it every day on a pain that is not going away or getting better after two or three days, it may require another intervention,\" warns Morgan.Start slow: It may be tempting to put your massage gun in the highest setting, but the key is to start slow. \"Gently glide the massage gun over the area, not holding for too long in one position,\" Morgan says. Use the massage gun in different directions and work on that area for about a few minutes, and take a break as needed.There are different ways to use a massage gun whether you're an athlete or are simply looking for some muscle relief. These are some effective ways to use a massage gun:Use it before bed: Some people find using a massage gun before bed to be soothing. \"A massage gun when used on a low setting can be super relaxing due to the increased blood flow and decreased perception of pain it results in,\" Morgan says. Don't forget your upper body: Because many people have jobs that require them to sit, the upper body usually ends up tense. \"I think everyone can use a little love on their upper trapezius, quads and glutes a few times a week,\" Morgan says. She says spending about two minutes per body part at the beginning or end of your day can help bring awareness, decrease pain perception and improve the range of motion in the area.Use before or after workout: Crank up a massage gun for a few minutes to soothe your sore muscles after a workout or beforehand as part of your warm-up routine. How do massage guns work? Massage guns work by sending fast and powerful pulsating strokes that penetrate deep into muscle tissues. They increase muscle stimulation, reduce soft tissue pain and improve blood circulation, speed up recovery and improve your physical performance. Show more What are massage guns for? Massage guns typically use percussive therapy, which has been found to help with recovery after a workout and relieving muscle aches, soreness and pain. Some people like to use a massage gun to warm up and promote circulation to a specific area before their workout. Show more Where should you use a massage gun? You can use a massage gun on big muscle groups like your quads, hamstrings, glutes, back muscles and even your neck, hips and calves. You want to avoid using a massage gun on any injured areas, bones or joints. Remember that harder and faster isn't always better. Derrickson advises, \"Start on the lowest setting and find your tolerance and what you need in the moment.\" He says you should never be forceful with a massage gun, adding, \"You don't want constant pressure on one area the entire time, instead let it glide over the muscles.\" Show more Who should use a massage gun? Typically it's OK for anyone to use a massage gun. If you have a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, it may interfere with the circuitry. Show more Can you use a massage gun while pregnant? If you're pregnant, you should avoid using a massage gun or get clearance first from your doctor. Show more Is it OK to use a massage gun every day? Massage guns are safe to use every day, as long as you use the proper technique, but you don't want to overdo it since it can reduce the benefits of the therapy. Grant Radermacher, a sports chiropractor, says, \"Start with a small region of soft tissue and work with it for a maximum of 2 minutes.\" Anything longer than two minutes or static work can irritate the region, and/or create an adverse reaction of restricted blood flow due to compression.  Show more What features make for a good massage gun? When you're looking for the best massage gun for your needs, you'll want to make sure it can change speeds and intensity to adjust to the different muscle groups. Having several attachments may also be helpful for working different muscle groups. Show more",

As a fitness expert, I’m familiar with the functions of massage guns and have tested them for many years. I found the Theragun Elite to be easy enough to use for both beginners and experienced fitness enthusiasts. The screen on the handle is simple to follow, so the massage gun speed and battery life are clear. The amplitude -- the ability to get deep into your muscles -- is on the higher side for a massage gun.

It provides 40 pounds of pressure and has five built-in speeds, ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It also has an amplitude of 16 millimeters, which gets deeper into the muscles. The Elite has five attachments: a dampener, standard ball, wedge, thumb and cone. It also lets you access preset guided routines from the Therabody app (available for iPhone and Android) in case you need help getting started with your massage gun. Once turned on, I liked that the Elite has a screen that indicates its current speed setting and remaining battery. It\u0026#39;s a powerful massager, falling between the Theragun Pro Gen 5 and the Theragun Prime. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho it’s best for: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Elite is more user-friendly than some of the other massage guns, thanks to the simplicity of its features, while having more power than the Prime. Both beginners and athletes will get good use from the Elite to break down knots and eliminate sore muscles. Physical therapists who use massage guns in their practice may find this massage gun to be a good option to have on hand for their patients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho shouldn’t buy it: \u003c/strong\u003eMy one gripe with the Elite is that it\u0026#39;s supposed to be one of Theragun\u0026#39;s quieter massage gun models, but I still thought it was on the louder side, especially as you amp up the power. This might deter you from this model if you want a massage gun that is quieter. It also has a shorter battery life (120 minutes) than the other guns on this list and isn’t ideal to carry with you when you’re traveling since it isn’t compact. If you want to be able to carry your massage gun everywhere, then I would recommend one that is smaller, like the Theragun Mini or Ekrin Athletics Bantam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditors\u0026#39; note: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Theragun Elite has since been discontinued, and this page will be updated as we re-test massage guns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"2556bbe9-24cd-4c9d-8f0b-45674d70b0f3\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-2556bbe9-24cd-4c9d-8f0b-45674d70b0f3\" data-techprodid=\"27da1f53-f8fb-46f1-b744-cc0eb6faf18c\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003ch4\u003ePros\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Long battery life of 8 hours\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Quieter than most massage guns at 35-55 decibels\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  The handle is angled for extra comfort\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Has a carrying case\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003ch4\u003eCons\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Expensive\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  May be a bit big for travel\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we like it:\u003c/strong\u003e I liked\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethe Ekrin Athletics B37S Percussion Massager because of its eight-hour battery life.

It\u0026#39;s the improved Mini in the Theragun collection and it\u0026#39;s a solid upgrade from the original. The second-gen Theragun Mini is quieter than the original Mini, 20% smaller and 30% lighter. This time around you get three attachments with your Mini instead of just the one that the original had. This massage gun has three speeds ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It has 12 mm of amplitude, which is deep for a mini massage gun.

The battery lasts three to six hours and consists of five speeds, ranging from 1,200 to 2,800 percussions per minute. The Sonic also has the most massage head attachments (eight) of all the massage guns on this list. It’s affordable at only $60 if you\u0026#39;re looking to spend under $100 on a massage gun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho it’s best for: \u003c/strong\u003eThis massage gun is good for beginners because it is less intimidating than other heavy-duty massage guns. The battery is long-lasting, and it offers plenty of amplitude to get deep into sore muscles. The LED panel on the Sonic shows all the speeds and remaining battery life listed in one place, so it\u0026#39;s easy to read. If you\u0026#39;re new to percussive therapy, this is a good option that gives you the full experience without breaking the bank.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho shouldn’t get it: \u003c/strong\u003eThis massage gun is on the bigger side, so it\u0026#39;s not suitable for traveling. If you want a more portable massage gun, consider one of the mini options instead. An issue I had with the Sonic was that I had to set it at the highest setting to feel the power of the massage gun. This is less common with heavy-duty massage guns, like the Theragun, because you can still feel the intensity at the lowest setting. Another aspect that could be improved on the Sonic is the design of the body of the gun. It\u0026#39;s made up of plastic, which makes it seem less durable. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"f5e6e28e-ac93-4a12-8e04-6f03ffb1706c\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-f5e6e28e-ac93-4a12-8e04-6f03ffb1706c\" data-techprodid=\"d20ec231-dab2-4b79-b12f-829928cc929b\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003ch4\u003ePros\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Affordable at $70\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Quiet for a big massage gun at 45 decibels\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Good alternative to Theragun Pro 5th gen\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  You can change the massage head angle to hit hard-to-reach areas\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Decent 4-hour battery life\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003ch4\u003eCons\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Not as stylish as the high-end massage guns\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n                  Plastic design makes it seem cheap\n                \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we like about it: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun may not look as sophisticated as the other massage guns on this list, but it is still effective. The R4 Pro has a rotating head that can be adjusted to five positions by pressing a large button on the side of the massage head. This feature reminded me of the Theragun Pro, which functions similarly. Being able to change the angle of the massage gun is key because you can target hard-to-reach areas. It has 10 mm of amplitude, so it doesn\u0026#39;t penetrate as deeply as the Theragun Pro, but it still gets the job done. The R4 Pro has four speeds and comes with six attachments: L ball head, M ball head, fork, bullet, flat and air-cushioned head. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho it’s best for: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you want a massage gun that isn\u0026#39;t expensive but has the features of a high-end one (minus the app function), the Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun is a solid pick. After all, $70 is reasonable compared to spending hundreds of dollars on a massage gun with similar features. The massage gun has an easy-to-read panel that indicates the current speeds and battery level. The battery life on this massage gun is decent, lasting up to four hours. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho shouldn’t get it: \u003c/strong\u003eIf you want a heavy-duty massage gun that’s well-made, then this one may fall short. The plastic material makes it seem cheaper compared to a Theragun or even an Ekrin option. It’s also bulkier compared to other massage guns because of the curved arm. If you’d like the option to carry the massage gun in a gym bag or carry-on, it’s too big to be considered portable, even with the carrying case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure section=\"table\"\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"fd3cd55a-24ad-4df5-842b-0e49d34689a9\" data-id=\"fd3cd55a-24ad-4df5-842b-0e49d34689a9\"\u003eBest massage guns compared\u003c/h2\u003e  \u003cdiv tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ctable aria-label=\"Best massage guns compared\"\u003e\u003cthead\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eMassage Gun\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eWeight\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eAmplitude\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eSpeed Settings\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eBattery Life\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eNoise\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eHSA/FSA Eligible\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eWarranty\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003eTrial Period\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003ePrice\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/thead\u003e \u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eTheragun Elite\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e2.2 pounds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e16mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e5 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e120 mins\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e65-68 decibels\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1 year\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$400\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eLifepro\u0026#39;s Sonic Handheld Percussion Massage Gun\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e3.9 pounds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e12mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e5 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e3-6 hours\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eN/A\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eLifetime\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$60\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eRenpho R4 Pro Massage Gun\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e2.2 pounds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e10mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e4 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e2 hours\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e45 decibels\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1 year\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1 year \u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$70\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eEkrin Athletics B37S Percussion Massager\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e2.2 pounds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e12mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e5 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e8 hours\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e35-55 decibels\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eLifetime\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$200\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eEkrin Athletics Bantam\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e1.1 pounds \u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e10mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e3 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e6 hours\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eN/A\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eLifetime\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$130\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eTheragun Mini (2nd Generation)\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e0.45 kg\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e12mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e3 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e120 mins\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e60.5 decibels\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1 year\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$160\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003eTheragun Pro (5th Generation)\u003c/th\u003e \u003ctd\u003e2.2 pounds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e16mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e5 speeds\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e150 mins\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e20% quieter\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1 year\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e30 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e$530\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e \u003c/table\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesign:\u003c/strong\u003e Although massage guns have a standard shape, we looked at the designs and materials that make up each massage gun.

Setting a budget for yourself is important, too, because some massage guns can go upwards of $100.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow what specs to look at: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen choosing a massage gun, there are a couple of features you want to look at: The amplitude and stall force. \u0026#34;Stall force simply means how much pressure the motor of the massage gun can withstand before the motor \u0026#39;stalls\u0026#39; with us,\u0026#34; explains Morgan. Amplitude refers to how deep into the region it can go. You\u0026#39;ll typically see amplitude in the range of 8mm, 12mm or 16mm as the deepest. Usually, heavy-duty massage guns have the highest amplitude compared to mini massage guns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow the attachments: \u003c/strong\u003eMost massage guns will come with a few different attachments that you can switch up depending on the area you\u0026#39;re targeting. For example, the common attachments may include a standard ball which is good for large and small muscle groups, a bullet which is meant to target legs and back muscles, a forked head which is intended to target the spine, shoulders and neck, and a flat head which offers a gentler massage on the larger muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often to use: \u003c/strong\u003eMassage guns are safe to use regularly as long as there are no health concerns to address first.
