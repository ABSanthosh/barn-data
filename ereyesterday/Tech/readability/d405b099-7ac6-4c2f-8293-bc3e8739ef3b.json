  "text": "Moana 2 opens in theaters this week just in time for the time honored tradition of Thanksgiving movie going. The sequel follows up the the most-streamed film on Disney+ with a new adventure starring Moana (Auli’i Cravalho)and Maui (Dwayne Johnson). The first film introduced Moana as the next in line to lead the people of Motunui, which in Western media has been interpreted as her being a princess of sorts; in the sequel, her adventures continue as she learns how to be a leader. And yes, that’s very reminiscent to a royal in training, if by royal we mean next chief and wayfinder in the making. Yes, Moana is officially featured as a canon member of the Disney Princess line up for that reason but truly her status is up for interpretation. Moana voice actress Auli’i Cravalho spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the Disney Princess discourse as it relates to her character. “Films are always representative of their times. For today’s day and age, we want to see a young woman being the hero of her own story. So, yeah, she is a princess, but she’s also a hero. I like that those two words are now interchangeable.” It makes a bit more sense that Disney Princesses and Frozen’s Royal Queens (Anna and Elsa do not count as princesses) are separate Disney heroine categories, a classification that is, let’s be real, mostly about selling toys under different banners. Thankfully, Moana’s look will always remain thematically appropriate to her unique story; according to Cravalho, “You probably won’t see Moana in a ballgown. And that’s fine.” Moana 2 addresses the same “princess or not?” question in a very meta way, with Moana claiming she’s not a princess and Maui pointing out a lot of people think she is. And so she will continue to be Disney Princess Moana of Motunui, chief in waiting and wayfinder. Moana 2 opens in theaters this week and Moana is now streaming on Disney+. Want more io9 news?
