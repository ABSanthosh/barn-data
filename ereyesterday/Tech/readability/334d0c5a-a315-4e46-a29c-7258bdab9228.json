Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” developer Rocksteady announced on Monday.After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to a WB Games FAQ. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been previously announced, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release in 2022 before being delayed multiple times. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, we said the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be taking a $200 million loss on the game.",
