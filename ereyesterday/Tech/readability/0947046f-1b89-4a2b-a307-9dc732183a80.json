  "description": "\"Twelve years ago, a baby was born after someone used bitcoin to pay for a frozen egg IVF,\" writes longtime Slashdot reader bobdevine. \"I, for one, welcome...\" Blockworks tells the story of how it all came to be: In February 2012 -- almost two years after Laszlo's pizzas -- a fertility doctor named C. Terence Lee set about a personal and professional quest to onboard his patients to Bitcoin by accepting BTC for his services. He started with a \"Bitcoin accepted here\" sign in his window, and then a Reddit post. \"Jumping in to do my part to support the BTC economy. This may be a historic first?\" Lee wrote in a post on the BitMarket subreddit, titled: \"[WTS][USA] Male Fertility Evaluation.\" Lee was offering a 15-minute consultation to discuss fertility questions and a sperm analysis in exchange for 15 BTC, valued at $70 or so at the time. \"Actual value over $100,\" he wrote. Within three months, he'd found a Bitcoin customer. \"The patient turned out not... so much having a burning desire to know about his fertility, but he was a Bitcoin enthusiast, and he liked the idea of participating in history, in this ritual ceremony of what could be perhaps the world's first Bitcoin medical transaction,\" Lee explained at a 2013 conference in San Jose. \"So we chatted about Bitcoin. He taught me a lot about mining. That's how he acquired bitcoin. And we did a sperm test, and it turned out he had really good sperm ... after it was done he sent me 15 bitcoins... \" Lee changed up his strategy to only quiz his most trusted patients. There was one couple, who, on their fourth attempt at IVF, agreed to pay in bitcoin for a 50% discount, with Lee walking them through exchanging U.S. dollars for bitcoin via CryptoXChange, a now-defunct exchange operating out of Australia. The sperm stuck, leading CNN to reveal, on this day in 2013, \"the world's first Bitcoin baby\" -- a baby bought entirely with bitcoin. Thirty bitcoin to be exact, an amount then worth $500, or $3 million today. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
