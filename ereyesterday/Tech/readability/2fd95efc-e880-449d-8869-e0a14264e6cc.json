  "description": "In the latest blow to what was generally a functional government, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate the independent agency in charge of issuing recalls and protecting US citizens from harmful products. The Office of Management and Budget has suggested the responsibilities of the Consumer Product Safety Commission should be folded into \"a nonexistent division within the Department of Health and Human Services,\" according to a joint letter from lawmakers. And to seemingly start the process, Trump has fired the commission's three Democratic members without cause, The Washington Post reports. Following a meeting with the Department of Government Efficiency, Commissioners Mary Boyle and Richard Trumka Jr. received emails on May 8 informing them they'd been fired. A third commissioner, Alexander Hoehn-Saric wasn't formerly fired, but shared via a statement on May 9 that the Acting Chairman of the commission was \"preventing [him] from executing [his] duties.\"  Commissioners in agencies like the CPSC, FCC or the FTC are appointed by the President, approved by the Senate and normally serve out their term in its entirety. Removing a commissioner requires the President to determine that they've neglected their duty or are credibly accused of wrongdoing. See you in court, Mr. President. pic.twitter.com/cSr114Q6gL— Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. (@TrumkaCPSC) May 9, 2025 That Constitutionally protected standard has not been Trump's concern since he took office. The Democratic members of the FTC say they were illegally fired in a similar fashion back in March, and are now suing the US government. CPSC Commissioner Trumka has announced that he plans to take his case to court, too. The US Supreme Court is considering a case that could determine whether Trump can actually fire members of independent agencies, but until that verdict is reached, we're in limbo. Eliminating the CPSC or at the very least, its Democratic wing, means businesses will receive a lot less scrutiny over the products they sell. Plenty of companies would prefer not to deal with the hassle of recalls and fines. Amazon even proposed in March that the CPSC was too powerful and called the agency \"unconstitutionally constructed.\" Under the Trump administration, those complaints are apparently being heard and acted upon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-plans-to-shut-down-the-consumer-product-safety-commission-214635181.html?src=rss",
