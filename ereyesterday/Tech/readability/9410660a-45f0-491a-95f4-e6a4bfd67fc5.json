Kourtnee covers TV streaming services and home entertainment news and reviews at CNET. She previously worked as an entertainment reporter at Showbiz Cheat Sheet where she wrote about film, television, music, celebrities, and streaming platforms. Expertise Cord-cutting | TV and music streaming services | Netflix | Disney Plus | Max | Anime | Interviews | Entertainment CredentialsThough Kourtnee hasn't won any journalism awards yet, she's been a Netflix streaming subscriber since 2012 and knows the magic of its hidden codes. Pop culture fans of all ages will gather at New York Comic Con, which kicks off on Thursday at the Javits Center. A fresh lineup of guest speakers, merchandise and surprise drops await attendees and cosplayers looking to snap photos with celebrities and immerse themselves in their favorite comics, TV shows, anime and movies. Event organizer ReedPop's Brien McDonald, vice president of content, recently gave CNET a preview of what to expect and some of the most exciting reveals to look forward to. As someone who's deeply involved on the TV and film side of things for NYCC (and a fan himself), McDonald notes that studios like Netflix and Paramount have big things planned. McDonald is personally excited about The Simpsons and Apple TV Plus appearing at the event for the first time. \"Apple TV has staked out a really cool spot in the streaming space where they're bringing prestige, high-quality TV series, and it's not genre. But I think something like Shrinking, or Elsbeth or even something like Ghosts -- it's cool that studios and producers are bringing this to New York Comic Con because it shows that this event is deep into the pop culture now.\" He also acknowledged that panels for genre programming such as Dune: Prophecy and The Penguin \"will blow people's minds.\"If you can't attend in person, you can still catch the panels on the event's Main and Empire stages. Viewers at home can livestream for free via ReedPop's YouTube channel and NYCC's social media accounts. So, what exactly should TV and movie buffs check out? Be on the lookout for everything from animation to celebrations to guest panels and hot new trailers this year. Count on Max, Blumhouse, SpongeBob, Sony, Netflix and a ton of anime.
