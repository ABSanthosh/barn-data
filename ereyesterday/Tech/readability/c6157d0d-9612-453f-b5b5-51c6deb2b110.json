  "text": "Dan Da Dan is quickly becoming a hot topic in the anime community as the dark horse entry for 2024’s anime of the year. While many of the show’s colorful characters have become the latest obsession for plushie and figurine fanatics the world over, one Japanese toy maker has decided to think outside of the box by instead making a replica of protagonist Okarun’s MacGuffins: his golden balls. Earlier today, Japanese entertainment company Furyu Corporation announced a replica would be coming to its storefront next year. In the post on its official X/Twitter account, the Shibuya-based business laid on the charm for the three-dimensional orbs to prospective buyers, saying, “Okarun’s gold ball is reproduced in actual size.” ＼#フリュープライズ新着情報／🟡✨🟡✨🟡✨🟡✨🟡　TVアニメ『#ダンダダン』　 金 の 玉 が 立 体 化🟡✨🟡✨🟡✨🟡✨🟡 オカルンの金の玉を実寸サイズで再現！25年春頃より展開予定✨輝く金の玉をお楽しみに♪ pic.twitter.com/9JT1Rsf00Z — フリュープライズ公式 (@FURYU_prize) November 15, 2024 So, at this point, non-Dan Da Dan fans are probably wondering why a company would sell an anime protagonist’s balls. In the lore of Dan Da Dan, Okarun’s balls are filled with magical energy that can grant its wielder a bunch of power. In short, Okarun’s golden balls are to Dan Da Dan what Dragon Ball Z‘s seven wish-granting species are to the Z-fighters. Don’t just take our word for it. Here’s how Dan Da Dan‘s Turbo Granny explains the spiritual significance of Okarun’s lads. However, you’ll have to do your best to imagine one of Turbo Granny’s voice actors (in English, Barbara Goodson—aka Rita Repulsa from Power Rangers; in Japanese, Mayumi Tanaka—aka Monkey D. Luffy in One Piece) is reciting the monologue: “His balls are covered in a layer of my spiritual energy. They’re five centimeters across and gold and shiny. You’ll know them when you see them. They’re hard to miss. Them balls are chocked full of a powerful life force now. The kind of energy spirits and yokai are attracted to the most. They believe they’ll come back to life if they gather enough items with high life force. That’s why evil spirits attack people, and try to steal life force from them.” Dan Da Dan‘s outro does not depict Okarun’s balls to scale. © Science Saru / Crunchyroll The announcement has already become the account’s most popular post, garnering over 16,000 likes. It’s safe to say that many people want a hand on Okarun’s balls just as severely as baddies do in the anime. Here are some of our favorite comments from Japanese X/Twitter users on the post. “Is it a Christmas tree ornament?” one confused commenter asked. “This is the first time the main character sells his balls,” one person wrote. “It’s funny to think that Okarun’s gold ball has an © carved on it,” wrote another. At the moment, Okarun’s golden orbs don’t have a price tag on them, so folks will have to keep tabs on Furyu’s posting next year to see what it deems a worthy value point for a young man’s balls. Whatever the case, it would make a helluva late Christmas gift for any of your anime-loving friends. Just let us know if they’re of good make and quality. New episodes of Dan Da Dan air every Thursday on Netflix, Hulu, and Crunchyroll. Want more io9 news?
