  "text": "Mar 06, 2025 [[read-time]] min read Applications are now open for a 10-week accelerator program for startups building solutions for the energy sector. Sana Ouji Senior Lead, Strategic Energy Partnerships Today, various startups are using AI to shape the future of energy. They’re building products that enhance grid resiliency, maximize value of existing assets and accelerate analysis and planning tools that keep our system running. To support these AI-focused startups in scaling rapidly and responsibly, we're introducing the Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Energy (applications open today) with cohorts running this year in North America and Europe.This equity-free program offers 10 weeks of intensive mentorship and technical project support to startups integrating AI into their core energy services or products. Selected startups will collaborate with a cohort of exceptional peer founders and engage with leaders across Google and the energy sector. The curriculum will provide founders with access to cutting-edge AI tools and include workshops on tech and infrastructure, UX and product, growth, sales, leadership and more. The program will focus on key themes transforming the energy landscape:Solutions for utilities, grid operators and energy developers: This includes technologies focused on integration and optimization of Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs), interconnection queue enhancements, demand-side load management integration, grid digitization, data access and energy project site analysis.Solutions for residential and commercial end-use customers focused on demand flexibility: This includes technologies focused on advancing demand response, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), load aggregation and emergency grid alerts.Solutions for industrial customers: This includes technologies focused on industrial energy efficiency solutions, battery optimization, carbon-aware infrastructure, summarizing and analysis of utility tariffs and electricity rate modeling and forecasting.You can apply for the North America cohort now and watch this space for an announcement about the application window for the Europe cohort, due to open by summer 2025. The hybrid programming for both cohorts will begin in September and run through November.",
