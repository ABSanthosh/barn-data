  "text": "Artificial intelligence can do some amazing things these days. It can create videos from a phrase, write a cover letter or a thank you note and even help train driverless cars. But \"amazing\" isn't quite the word I'd use to describe the AI features on Samsung's line of 2025 TVs, which are on display at CES 2025.In previous years Samsung used \"AI\" to describe its picture quality processing features, designed to improve color, upscaling detail and HDR performance, and it continues to do so this year. What's new for 2025 are convenience-related AI features, similar to what it already offers in phones. I haven't tested them yet but from what I've seen, I expect the phone-based versions to be more useful.AI to augment your TV watching (and order food)Something called \"Click to Search\" can recognize what's playing on-screen and provide real-time info, including being able to identify people, places or products. In one example Samsung showed, the feature \"identified\" where the scene took place, who the actors were, the outfits they wore and what other TV shows and movies they starred in. At first blush it seems similar to the Circle to Search feature in phones, which CNET's reviewers generally liked, but a lot less useful because it's restricted to what's on TV. I have the same thought about the company's new AI meal planner. Called \"Samsung Food,\" it can replicate recipes from TV shows and let you buy ingredients or order delivery from the TV screen -- two things a phone can do better than a TV.Samsung's TV remote, which I also like a lot for its simplicity and design, will have a dedicated AI button that will lead to shopping, content and discovery recommendations. I'm guessing it will also invoke other AI features down the road, but Samsung didn't confirm that.Remember Bixby? Samsung's voice assistant and answer to Amazon Alexa and Apple's Siri is getting an AI boost in 2025 on TVs with the help of an LLM. The benefit, according to Samsung, is that the assistant can better understand commands chained together, such as changing the channel and raising the volume at the same time.One more throwback feature that's \"new\" for 2025: gesture control. Unlike the miserably failed feature the company launched 13 years ago, which relied on a camera and hand movements, the 2025 version requires you to wear a Galaxy Watch while you gesture at the TV. Use a middle finger, I won't judge.AI Karaoke and Live Translate of closed captionsTwo of Samsung's new TV features seem a lot cooler to me. Because I enjoy a good singalong, I'm interested to try out the new AI Karaoke feature on its TVs. It uses your phone as a mic and automatically removes the vocals from existing songs, leaving your voice and the music. And potentially useful to folks who read different languages, the company is offering an AI Live Translate service on its TVs (like it already does with phones). The TV can instantly translate closed captions on live broadcasts in up to seven languages. My take? None of these new AI features seems worth buying a Samsung over another TV, with the possible exception of subtitle translations (or Karaoke, if you love Karaoke). Of course I'll reserve final judgement on these smart TV features, as well as the new picture quality enhancements, for when we can get these new Samsung TVs in to test later this year.",
