  "text": "Richard Lawler is a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.Getting added to the wrong group chat is a common problem, but what if that group chat is describing an upcoming military strike? That’s what happened to The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to a Signal group chat formed by high-ranking members of the Trump administration to discuss plans for military strikes on Yemen. As a result, he had the details of a bombing attack targeting the Houthis hours before it actually occurred on March 15th, facts later confirmed not only by the attacks going off on schedule but in comments from National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes, who said they are “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”The 18 members of the chat — named “Houthi PC Small group” — appear to have included vice president JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard, all freely chatting with The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief listening in. Goldberg says he’s unsure how he was added or how no one on the thread noticed his presence. Discussions of classified military plans are generally not supposed to take place on consumer messaging apps.Signal’s end-to-end encryption is intended to keep messages secure from snooping by outside parties, but if someone’s device is compromised or if the wrong person is on the other end of the conversation, its security features go out the window. According to national-security lawyers Goldberg consulted, the app isn’t approved for sharing classified information, and the chat never should’ve been established in the first place. By discussing military activity on unapproved devices outside of secure facilities, they created the possibility that one of their devices could be lost or stolen, with all of the information exposed.After explosions were reported in Yemen, the group members exchanged celebratory emoji — a flexed bicep, an American flag, and a fist bump. Goldberg even witnessed Vance saying “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.” Vance’s spokesperson, William Martin, is quoted downplaying the comments, saying that “The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.” Asked about the report and chat during a press conference Monday, Trump said, “I don’t know anything about it. You– you’re telling me about it for the first time.”",
