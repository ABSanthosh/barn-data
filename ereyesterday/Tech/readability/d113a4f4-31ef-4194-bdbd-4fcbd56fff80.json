On the day after Christmas, ChatGPT stopped working for many.OpenAI's flagship chatbot experienced major outages around 2 p.m. ET on Thursday, right as some of its users were theoretically wanting something to do after getting over the Christmas rush.

Credit: Screenshot: OpenAI The outage manifested in different ways depending on how I tried to use ChatGPT. On mobile, the \"send\" button next to the text prompt entry field was simply grayed out and didn't do anything. On desktop, I could send prompts, but they would immediately be returned with an error message. It just goes to show that OpenAI has some kinks to work out before it can attain its grand ambitions.",
