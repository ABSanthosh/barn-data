  "description": "Here's an update from the Wall Street Journal about a \"widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure.\" China was behind it, \"Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting... according to people familiar with the matter...\" The Chinese delegation linked years of intrusions into computer networks at U.S. ports, water utilities, airports and other targets, to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan, the people, who declined to be named, said... U.S. officials went public last year with unusually dire warnings about the uncovered Volt Typhoon effort. They publicly attributed it to Beijing trying to get a foothold in U.S. computer networks so its army could quickly detonate damaging cyberattacks during a future conflict. [American officials at the meeting perceived the remarks as \"intended to scare the U.S. from involving itself if a conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait.\"] The Chinese official's remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan, a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting said... In a statement, the State Department didn't comment on the meeting but said the U.S. had made clear to Beijing it will \"take actions in response to Chinese malicious cyber activity,\" describing the hacking as \"some of the gravest and most persistent threats to U.S. national security....\" A Chinese official would likely only acknowledge the intrusions even in a private setting if instructed to do so by the top levels of Xi's government, said Dakota Cary, a China expert at the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. The tacit admission is significant, he said, because it may reflect a view in Beijing that the likeliest military conflict with the U.S. would be over Taiwan and that a more direct signal about the stakes of involvement needed to be sent to the Trump administration. \"China wants U.S. officials to know that, yes, they do have this capability, and they are willing to use it,\" Cary said. The article notes that top U.S. officials have said America's Defense Department \"will pursue more offensive cyber strikes against China.\" But it adds that the administration \"also plans to dismiss hundreds of cybersecurity workers in sweeping job cuts and last week fired the director of the National Security Agency and his deputy, fanning concerns from some intelligence officials and lawmakers that the government would be weakened in defending against the attacks.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
