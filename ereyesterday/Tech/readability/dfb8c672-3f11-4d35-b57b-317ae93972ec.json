  "description": "Steam announced this week that it will offer a compatibility rating that will designate when a game is supported on the company's operating system. The SteamOS Compatibility assessment is slated to roll out \"in the next few weeks.\" This metric is an extension of the Steam Deck Verified program, and it will award a checkmark to games based on a data subset within that vetting process. In other words, game developers won't have to take any additional steps if they're already completing Steam Deck Verified. On the player end, compatible games will show a blue checkmark when viewed in the Steam Store and Steam Client while running the operating system on a device other than the Steam Deck. The announcement is mostly a future-proofing move. Right now, the Lenovo Legion Go S is the only handheld besides the Steam Deck that's officially running Valve's operating system. But Lenovo was already teasing a second iteration of the hardware at CES this year and Valve clearly has plans for the number of SteamOS platforms to grow. The landscape for handheld gaming could start looking quite different if SteamOS really takes off as a standalone service.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-made-a-steam-deck-verified-program-for-things-that-arent-steam-decks-224535134.html?src=rss",
