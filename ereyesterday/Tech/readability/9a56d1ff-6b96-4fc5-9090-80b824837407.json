  "description": "Netflix said its cheaper, ad-supporter tier now has 94 million monthly active users -- an increase of more than 20 million since its last public tally in November. CNBC reports: The company and its peers have been increasingly leaning on advertising to boost the profitability of their streaming products. Netflix first introduced the ad-supported plan in November 2022. Netflix's ad-supported plan costs $7.99 per month, a steep discount from its least-expensive ad-free plan, at $17.99 per month. Netflix also said its cheapest tier reaches more 18- to 34-year-olds than any U.S. broadcast or cable network. \"When you compare us to our competitors, attention starts higher and ends much higher,\" Netflix president of advertising Amy Reinhard said in a statement. \"Even more impressive, members pay as much attention to mid-roll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
