  "description": "Bluesky, the social network surging in popularity, says it has \"no intention\" of training AI tools on users content. \"The social network made the announcement on the same day that X (formerly Twitter) is implementing its new terms of service that allow the platform to use public posts to train AI,\" notes TechCrunch. From the report: \"A number of artists and creators have made their home on Bluesky, and we hear their concerns with other platforms training on their data,\" Bluesky said in a post on its app. \"We do not use any of your content to train generative AI, and have no intention of doing so.\" The company went on to note that it uses AI internally to help with content moderation and that it also uses the technology in its \"Discover\" algorithmic feed. However, Bluesky says \"none of these are Gen AI systems trained on user content.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
