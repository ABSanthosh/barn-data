  "text": "Finally there are more looks at Disney’s live-action Snow White—courtesy of the stunning music video for “Waiting on a Wish” and its unplugged version, both sung by Rachel Zegler. And it’s a feast for Disney Princess fans as we get glimpses at elements of the story we know from Walt Disney Animation’s first animated feature, Gal Gadot mean mugging as the Evil Queen, the dwarfs, and the prince-to-be (Andrew Burnap), who might not be the type of prince who already has a crown. Here are our favorite gems and Easter eggs from the new visuals. Snow White’s Origin Story © Disney If Batman can get his origin story explored over and over, it’s only fair we get the same for Snow White. This one is particularly exciting as it combines the known fairytale lore of her namesake with her surviving a dangerous winter snow. If you’ve had a baby survive the NICU this is particularly touching to see. And the lyrics from “Waiting on a Wish” really hit: “My father told me long ago, I braved a bitter storm of snow, Is that a girl I’ll ever know again?” Yes, Snow, you can overcome anything. Magic Mirror © Disney Snow White has the Evil Queen so pressed every time the magic mirror says her step-daughter is “the fairest one of all,” we wouldn’t be surprised if Snow’s bad haircut was her idea. The costuming is immaculate and that stained glass crown is a nice touch. Wishing Well © Disney The visuals confirm that “Waiting on a Wish” is this movie’s version of the animated Snow White‘s “I’m Wishing.” It’s a fitting addition and in an earlier trailer we heard Zegler sing the high-note vocal progression from the original animated film, which we hope there’s more of. Prince or Pauper? © Disney The love interest is thankfully not a weird royal lurking about Snow White’s kingdom. Here he is apprehended for what we can imagine might be breaking into the castle in the search of food, since the next frame is Snow White handing him bread. We’re thinking he’s from her kingdom and might later become a prince through his relationship with Snow White. Snow White’s Family Heirloom © Disney In a scene we believe is connected to the passing of Snow White’s mother, the young princess is given a necklace with the reminder to be “fearless, fair, brave, and true”—which is where we suspect the Evil Queen’s comprehension goes out the window. Snow White will always be more fair (as in just) and fair (as in prettier) than her. We already love this new Snow White canon accessory and you can already find it to get those cosplays ready at RockLove, fandom fashion jewelry purveyors. The Seven Dwarfs © Disney Disney is sticking to the original cartoony design for the fairytale folk version of the dwarfs, similar to other magical creatures already seen in Disney’s live-action canon such as the Fairy Godmothers in the Maleficent franchise. Snow White’s Scary Adventures © Disney The frightening as hell trees are back! We’re glad that this sequence and design will bring more horror elements into the film. It reminds us of the old version of the Disneyland ride. Animation Cottage-Core Homage © Disney Who are the Seven Dwarfs’ interior designers? We need to know. But really, it’s so neat to see how the set design was inspired by the animated classic. That’s One Very Unappetizingly Scary Poison Apple © Disney Ew, it looks like the crypt keeper. The poison apple does look perfectly freaky and we imagine it goes right back to looking quite appetizing in a flash. And Gadot truly brings out the ugliness in the the old hag’s grotesque makeup design. What a seamless transformation; we can’t wait to see it continue to unfold. True Love’s Kiss © Disney When does it happen? We like the idea that it’s set up to almost happen before she bites the apple, but they get interrupted or he misses his shot. Maybe she encourages him to not miss next time, but by then it’s too late. This scene might also take place after she wakes up. Wait, who are those two normal people behind them? Huh, interesting. They Did the Thing! © Disney Okay, obviously there’s going to be 1:1 comparison shots but we’re glad our boy Dopey’s diamond eyes made the cut. Snow White of the People © Disney This definitely teases a less reactive princess who just lets things happen to her like in the original animated film. We love that this Snow White’s power is her kindness towards every living being and standing up for them. It’s ambiguous if this is right before she’s told to go to the forest or the end, in which case the finale we know might be quite different. We’ll find out March 21 when Snow White opens in theaters.
