If you buy something through links on our site, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission. One of the greatest things Netflix has ever done is produce the Fear Street trilogy. Pulling inspiration from R.L. Stine's seminal Fear Street novels, director Leigh Janiak's triptych slasher transported horror lovers back to 1994, then 1978, and finally 1666, for a winding tale of witchcraft and sapphic love. Now, the torch has been passed to Matt Palmer (Calibre), as he helms Fear Street: Prom Queen. Can it live up to Janiak's sensational slasher trilogy? This teaser gives us a taste of what to expect and a release date to mark on our calendars. Fear Street: Prom Queen ushers Netflix subscribers back to Shadyside, specifically prom season 1988. There, the popular girls of Shadyside High are practically feral in their fight for the coveted crown. But two things disrupt the John Hughes of it all. First off, a feisty misfit puts her name in for consideration, disrupting the pecking order. And more crucially, other could-be contenders begin to go missing. So, Prom Night should be one hell of a night. The ensemble cast includes India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, Chris Klein, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, and Ariana Greenblatt, plus Lili Taylor and Katherine Waterston. But who will make it to a could-be sequel? We'll find out this spring. Fear Street: Prom Queen releases globally on Netflix May 23. Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.
