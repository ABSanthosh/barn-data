    "description": "Leah Covington, on her way home from the restaurant she runs with her uncle in Oklahoma City, survives a frightening assault. The assailant lands in jail, but Leah’s social life, even months later, has yet to recover. When she finally goes out with her little sister, Kayla, Leah reunites with the muscular, handsome police officer Butch “Cam” Cameron—he was there the night of Leah’s unnerving incident and, for a time, joined her on walks that helped subdue her panic attacks. Seeing each other again, they’re quickly smitten with one another. They spend days with Cam’s family and friends and build on their relationship and deepening feelings. Meanwhile, Leah receives unsigned notes and texts from an unknown phone number containing mostly cryptic messages (“I’ll see you soon”). Leah at first shrugs them off, but Cam, ever the cop, looks into the issue, and it’s not long before the stalker takes things to a physical level. Brown’s straightforward narrative deftly fuses a slowly developing romance with a quietly suspenseful tale. (Leah and Cam don’t rush anything; it takes some time before they share a genuine kiss and declare themselves boyfriend and girlfriend.) Leah is a superlative protagonist supported by a solid, relatable backstory: Uncle Joe took her and Kayla in after their parents died, creating a small but close-knit family. Although Leah and Cam’s mutual fondness brightens the proceedings, genre cliches are profuse throughout, like run-of-the-mill terms of endearment (Cam’s go-to is “sweetheart”) and Cam’s love notes (“You make me want to be a better man”). Still, creepy moments lend a welcome edge, such as Leah hearing a “clanking noise” at her and Kayla’s apartment. The several possibilities for the stalker’s identity boost the story’s tension even further.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/r-christian-bohlen/miracle-at-angels-bend/",
    "description": "The town of Angels Bend, Pennsylvania, is “nestled inside the protective arm of a large arc in the Susquehanna River, having a dense stand of timber on a steep slope directly opposite.” The narrative focuses on four main characters: Hannah, whose dreams of going into missionary work have been stymied by a tragic automobile accident that took the lives of her father and brother (Hannah was at the wheel); Josh, an aspiring musician who’s down on his luck and increasingly estranged from his family; office worker (and volunteer fire fighter) Dave, whose marriage to Ellen is strained by her mental health issues; and Larina, a journalist who’s the object of extramarital temptation for Dave, who’s tormented by both his feelings for her and by his concern for his erratic wife. (“He thought back to his twenties when he could imagine nothing more satisfying than being married. But what did he know about mental illness at age twenty-four?”) These four people find themselves linked both by the looming threat of wildfires and by a mysterious book—author and provenance unrevealed—that feelingly explores aspects of the Jesus story. The small cast of characters find their personal religious faiths challenged and re-affirmed by the tidings of this enigmatic book, even as the events of their lives—with attendant grief, guilt, doubt, and lust—unfold.Bohlen does a very effective job of balancing all four of his main plotlines, never allowing one to dominate the others. He navigates the endemic narrative pitfalls of contemporary Christian fiction—including saccharine piety and unrealistic characters—with a good deal of skill; his people are largely believable, and he more often than not avoids the annoying straw-man caricatures that tend to provide the conflict in Christian fiction. There are lapses, as when readers are told that Hannah’s Psych 101 class describes “existentialism” as a worldview in which “nothing has purpose, nothing has meaning, things happen to you, and you’re just stuck in it, essentially alone and unloved,” adding, for good measure, “Good and evil are pragmatic, not moral. Nothing is fundamentally right or morally wrong.” More surprising are the frequent notes advocating humanistic self-care, such as, “The Lord doesn’t expect you to submit to abuse.” (This assertion is buttressed, as many of the book’s other points are, by a footnote: “Living with manipulative family members who are struggling with mental health or addiction issues is extremely taxing and can lead to severe effects on those around them.”) Bohlen is particularly empathetic when describing the transformative nature of Christian faith; Josh, for instance, feels “something worth holding on to. A soft, eternal Presence—long ago pushed to the basement of his soul.” This is a refreshingly straightforward and reality-focused example of Christian fiction, convincingly depicting everyday people with everyday problems who will be relatable to Bohlen’s audience. Christian readers will doubtless appreciate the author’s portrayal of the many ways the living current of their faith can find its way into their lives just when they need it most.",

    "description": "Aiming, as Mabry explains in her afterword, to explore both our connections with the natural world and chaos theory in operation, this globe-spanning episode starts with a tan-skinned child who lives in Alaska breathing on a puff of dandelion fluff—some of which ends up in a Rufous hummingbird’s nest. Eventually, one of the baby birds grows up and flies away to Central America to pollinate a coral bean flower. One resulting red seed floats over the ocean to a West African beach, where a doodlebug that nibbles on it is later eaten by a hoopoe, and so onward in a chain of natural connections and migrations that ends with a painted lady butterfly settling on the knee of that same, though older, child. Carefully explaining that though these particular encounters are made up, they are rooted in fact, the author pairs nature notes identifying species and locales in slightly smaller type to her measured, simply phrased narrative. Both are set into brightly hued, sharply detailed outdoor scenes that Jones populates with exactly rendered flora and fauna.",

    "description": "In 1976, as the United States celebrated its bicentennial, Morris found herself alone on a hilltop at the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge near Seneca Falls, New York, playing “Mother Eagle” to two bald eaglets. She had been selected to participate in a program to reintroduce bald eagles into the state. Following the ravaging effects on the species by hunting, habitat destruction, and DDT, “restoring the eagle was symbolic of a nation seeking to right a wrong by avowing its commitment to the environment and to the bird who manifested freedom and resilience.\" The bald eagle in the lower 48 states had declined from about 400,000 birds in the 1800s to only 417 nesting pairs by midcentury. As Morris notes, “The 1970s were a time of awakening when environmental threats to water, air, and wildlife became rallying cries across college campuses and in the halls of government.” Although she had fantasized about an opportunity such as this, she found herself emotionally unprepared for it; she shares the fear and uncertainty that plagued her during this time. Following the success of the program, Morris describes the joy she felt when she was honored by the Iroquois during a meeting with the chiefs of the Six Nation Confederacy for her efforts to bring back the bald eagle. Morris goes on to detail events since those two summers on the hilltop, after which her life took a different trajectory: the uncertainty that has continued to haunt her and the circumstances that kept her away for the next 45 years. She closes with a moving account of her return to Montezuma in 2022, finding the eagles firmly established as \"the iconic brand of the refuge.\"",

Maya’s future husband’s younger brother, Rishi, makes her especially uneasy. For one thing, he won’t stop calling Shilpa “Bean.” For another, Maya calls Rishi “sweet”—will Maya ever call Shilpa that again? Shilpa tries to get past these troubles and focus on her main responsibility: upholding the tradition of Joota Chupai, or stealing the groom’s shoes and returning them only when he offers a prize. Shilpa and her cousin plot to steal the shoes, but Rishi is fast and tries to make off with them. In an unexpected twist, Rishi falls and hurts his knee, and Shilpa stops to help him. She soon realizes that Rishi isn’t her rival. Indeed, he turns out to be her newest partner in crime at the wedding—and maybe even her newest brother. Upbeat text and vibrant illustrations combine for a raucous story full of heart, movement, and joy. Although Shilpa’s change in attitude toward Rishi feels abrupt, her fears about losing her sibling and integrating into a new family are both relatable and beautifully explored. The illustrations are particularly inviting, featuring bold colors, intense emotional expression, and laugh-out-loud silliness.",

    "description": "Dylan used to play with Fiona and comfort his little sister when mean kids teased her, but now he flakes out on taking her to the museum, and she spots him meeting up with a mysterious stranger. He argues with their parents and steals money. After Fiona sees him shoving something into his desk, she speaks up. When their parents realize that Dylan’s been using drugs, they explain what’s going on and arrange for him to enter rehab. Notably, this book makes clear that while drug addiction is harmful, those who use drugs aren’t bad people. The story also addresses the important elements of forgiveness and responsibility: Fiona shows a willingness to believe in her brother’s recovery, and Dylan apologizes for and takes ownership of his past mistakes. The recurring image of a large, blue bedroom door separating Fiona from her brother’s downward spiral acts as a symbol for his secrecy and her lack of understanding. Her emotional reactions range from loneliness to fear, gut-deep tension, guilt, worry, doubt, and optimism, with each one clearly portrayed through Fiona’s facial expressions. Dylan’s drug use is never visually depicted; Mom and Dad refer to it as “using drugs” as well as an “illness” and a “sickness.” Fiona and her family present white.",

    "description": "Having just survived a major battle to save humankind inCure(2022), Luna Auber,an inexperienced 20-something werewolf, is settling back into life at home in Camden, New Jersey. She spends her days working at Bizcocheria, a bakery she loves, spending her lunch hours with her newly lycanthropic boyfriend, Javier, and being mentored via Zoom by Birger, a librarian for The Lycanthrope Society (TLS), a group that “believes that humans and shapeshifters were meant to share the planet and allow one another to live in peace and harmony.” Weeks pass without incident until Luna wakes up one morning with torn clothing and no memory of the previous night. Fearful that her werewolf transformations are out of control, she heads to the TLS facilities inSweden to continue training with Birger in person; there, she’s shocked to discover that she has a power that sets her apart from the rest of lycanthropic society.Meanwhile, readers learn of a battle between TLS and an opposing lycanthrope sect, The Righteous Group, via historical accounts of European courts in the 8th century. TLS turns to Luna and her unique abilities in the hope that she’s a prophesized savior destined to unite the groups once again. Metis makes good use of multiple perspectives and timelines to reinvigorate well-known werewolf story traditions; specifically, she highlights her fictional universe’s deliciously bloody past involving power-hungry humans and nonhuman royals and their role in dividing the once-united lycanthropes. Whenever the novel jumps to present-day conflicts and Luna’s point of view, the story stalls a bit, due in part to unsatisfying characterization. The contrast between Luna’s scrappiness and Birger’s sage wisdom is humorous, and her relationship with her adoptive parents is sweet. However, Luna’s emotions feel oversimplified and somewhat disconnected from the plot, leading to a climax that’s somehow both perplexing and predictable.",

    "description": "On a snowy school night, a child narrator is picked up from his mom’s place. Daddy is there with his old, rusty car and telltale frayed black knit cap (“his crown”). The duo hop in the car together and head to Grandma’s house. The slightly somber car ride introduces some familial tension (“Don’t matter what he did or didn’t do. Daddy just got hit hard”), but the child focuses on love. After all, “Daddy always gives good. He always protects your feelings.” In Daddy’s room at Grandma’s, they construct model planes. It’s quiet at first, but soon the room is filled with laughter. Their precious time together comes to an end, but before dropping the child back at his mom’s, Daddy, noticing that the boy doesn’t have a hat, gives him his own cap—a tangible reminder of Daddy’s loving, generous spirit. Boyd beautifully depicts a father-son relationship weathering the difficulty of parental separation. Appropriately vague text immerses readers in the perspective of a child who lacks the full vocabulary to understand the situation. The cold tones outside of Daddy’s room contrast with the warmth inside to create a cozy, loving feeling when they share space together. The textural, photorealistic art style adds a richness to the double-page spreads. Like Boyd and his child in the author photo, Daddy has brown skin, while the child is lighter-skinned.",

    "description": "Boston-based jazz lover and alcoholic Elder Darrow owns a bar—the Esposito—but he’s been slowly losing his passion for the business, and the drinking is starting to catch up with him. When Elder’s best friend, Boston police detective Dan Burton, is gunned down in what appears to be a random liquor store robbery, Elder barely has time to grieve before mobster Mickey Barksdale shows up at the Esposito with a proposition. Mickey, who grew up with Burton, thinks the cop has been murdered, perhaps in a bid to send Mickey a message. He wants Elder, who sometimes assisted Burton with his cases, to take on the role of detective and ask the questions that Mickey can’t ask. Elder refuses—he doesn’t want to believe Burton’s death was anything but bad luck—but when a masked man with a gun shows up at the bar to warn him off the investigation, he knows there’s something bigger going on. More people start to die—or at least disappear—including Elder’s ex-girlfriend, who’s down from Oregon, and the Esposito’s heroin-addicted chef (who happens to be Mickey’s estranged daughter). Elder realizes that if he doesn’t figure out what’s going on, he may be next. But what, really, does he still have to live for? Cass perfectly captures Elder’s cranky incompatibility with a swiftly changing Boston, the city he loves but increasingly fails to recognize. “It was nearly impossible to find an old-style lunch counter in Boston anymore,” he laments. “All I ever needed was a couple of eggs over easy, wheat toast, and a decent cup of coffee. No chatty wait people with nose rings and tattoos, no cream cheese stuffed French toast.” It’s unclear whether this will be the last of Cass’ Elder novels, but it certainly has the feeling of a swan song, a satisfying ending for a man who needs to put a lot of ghosts to bed before he can figure out who he still is.",

    "description": "Only two children have survived attempts to bring viable embryos to the new world: Owl, who yearns to explore much like her aunt Minerva, from whom she was cloned, and sensitive, steady Yarrow, who has “no blood relations.” Upon turning 16, Yarrow starts acting oddly, but the threat of a comet strike takes priority, and he hides what’s happening to him. The narrative following their problems in the year 32,481 alternates with a past timeline in which the original Ambrose and Kodiak learn the truth of their mission. Not only do they have their own heartache and grief, but after being brought together in an attempt to destabilize Earth’s two remaining governments, they’re left to deal with the fact that the fates of all of humanity lie in their hands. Though the storylines eventually wind together, their initial disjointedness delays the book’s full emotional impact. But when it finally lands, it packs the full punch of humanity’s potential ills balanced with hope of the good we might achieve. The realism of the struggles the characters face keeps the story engaging, and returning fans will appreciate the time spent with the original Ambrose and Kodiak. Ambrose and Owl are brown-skinned, and Kodiak and Yarrow are coded white.",

Working the night shift at a Brooklyn hotel helps her manage the chronic insomnia she’s been dealing with ever since a traumatic experience caused her to drop out of grad school. The only escape she’s had through her biggest ups and downs are her favorite vampire books from the Blood Feud series, which she’s reread so often she has entire passages committed to memory. While it’s fun for Tess to playfully subscribe to the long-running theory among online fans that the island where Blood Feud takes place is real, she knows better than to take it too seriously. That all changes when Octavia Yoo, one of the vampires from the island, shows up at the hotel, knowing Tess’ name and begging for her help. Soon, Tess finds herself on the isle, surrounded by vampires and feeling way out of her depth—especially once she learns that Callum, Octavia’s twin and the supposed villain of the series, might actually be the good guy. As Tess spends more time with Callum, every preconceived notion she has about his character is turned on its head. Armed with new knowledge, Tess fights to bring Octavia back to the island where she belongs, even as bigger evils lurk. Meanwhile, who is August Lirio, the pseudonymous author of the Blood Feud books, and how could they have gotten the details so wrong? Stayman-London’s first venture into the paranormal is paired with a dash of comedy for an injection of fun into a normally serious subgenre. That said, the plot does introduce heavier elements, such as the traumatic event in Tess’ past, which creates a disjointed tone at pivotal moments. Also, spending time on a romance for Octavia back in New York detracts from the central story, when each couple could have easily received their own book.",

    "description": "Readers sucked in by curiosity and by Daviz’s animated, retro, Pixar-style illustrations will likely come out the other end of this informational wormhole more confused than ever, but perhaps the book’s confirmation that the subatomic realm really is weird and unintuitive—and what that tells us about how much we have yet to understand about how the physical universe ticks—is worth the trip. Edge attempts to address a huge range of topics, from the Big Bang to Schrödinger’s “zombie” cat, to supernovas, black holes, and dark matter and energy. With such scope, shortcuts are unavoidable; not only does he never get around to defining what quantum actually means, but he also doesn’t explain the differences between “up” quarks and “down” quarks, or how they all got their droll designations. Likewise, he neglects to mention that there are considerably more than three states of matter, and although he does discuss quantum entanglement and spaghettification, his blithe promise to “shed a little light” on how photons can be both particles and waves remains unkept. Dressed in lab coats, human figures diverse of race and gender, and some who use wheelchairs, appear occasionally in the pictures as the free-form quark narrator progresses through both macro and micro universes.",

    "description": "Sixteen-year-old Eirene and her twin, Phoebe, who have light brown skin and curly black hair, live in Zakynthos, a town controlled by Leandros, a descendant of Eros. Women there are manipulated by Leandros’ Desires, magic that seemingly brainwashes them into being under their husbands’ control. After Alexandra, Leandros’ 18-year-old wife, dies suddenly and mysteriously, he decides to marry beautiful Phoebe, wooing her with lavish gifts. When Stavros, the sisters’ cousin and guardian, agrees to the match, Eirene, who has never had “an interest in the beauty of men,” is determined to save her sister from Alexandra’s fate. She makes a deal with Leandros: If she can complete four tasks that he sets, she’ll marry him in her sister’s place. If she fails, he’ll take Phoebe as his wife. Unbeknownst to Eirene, Leandros has a daughter, pale, redheaded Lamia, who’s been hidden from the world. Her left leg never fully healed from an accident and affects her mobility. A connection quickly blossoms between the two girls as Lamia helps Eirene with the increasingly difficult tasks. As they complete each one, Eirene and Lamia grow closer to discovering the mysteries of Leandros and his powers. The compelling plot explores themes of feminism, disability, and abuse in thoughtful ways, while staying true to the setting of ancient Greece. Readers will be intrigued by this Sapphic retelling featuring a strong sense of place.",

    "description": "In 2019, twenty-something Eleanor “Ellie” Stone is staying in her childhood home in suburban New Jersey for the weekend with her younger brother, Josh. She’s there to keep him safe, since he’s a drug addict. They have an argument, and she leaves the house for about an hour; while she’s away, the family home suddenly catches fire, claiming Josh’s life and leaving Ellie grieving. Soon, she reconnects with her past: The trauma of going largely unnoticed by her mother, the hurt of being bullied by her peers, and her infamous nickname, “Firestarter” (which she received after an accident involving a school friend), all come back to haunt her as she struggles emotionally. “There it was: caught in my throat. My chest. In the back of my eyes. All of these places in my body congested with grief, guilt.” A new relationship blossoms with Josh’s best friend, Drew Colins, who might turn out to be too good to be true. But Josh’s girlfriend, Audrey Findley, uncovers more details about the night of the fire each day. Readers soon learn that almost nothing about the incident is as it seems. By allowing certain details of the narrative to fade into the background over time, Bokat gives readers the opportunity to think about these aspects on their own while connecting the dots and assigning importance to other elements of the story. This plot structure develops the story as the main character develops an elusive, ever-shifting sense of justice. Bokat reveals the solution to the mystery bit by bit, like a jigsaw puzzle, leaving the full picture obscured until the final piece is finally in place.",

    "description": "Grandma Patsy adopts a “fluffy white kitten with big blue eyes” from an animal shelter near her Florida home. It’s almost Christmas, so she names the kitten “Noel.” The two become great friends, and Grandma Patsy gives him food, treats, and lots of cuddling—but Noel wants to find other furry companions. He meets his neighbor Mr. Guster’s big yellow dog, Max. Noel wants to play by jumping on Max’s back, but he is quickly rebuffed. Next, Noel meets two Siamese cats named Lucy and Lizzie. They aren’t interested at all and “swatted and hissed at Noel.” Noel keeps trying to find an animal buddy, but neither the Pug nor the “black and white ‘kitty’ hiding under the bushes” seem likely prospects. (“Naughty Noel, no, no, no! That skunk is never going to be your friend!”) When Noel comes to the rescue of an injured hound, things change. Anyone who has had a misbehaving pet will relate to Noel and his antics. Page’s descriptive language adds depth and specificity to the story (Grandma Patsy lives in “a little house with rosy pink shutters, nestled in a grove of palms and mossy oak trees”). Irwin’s illustrations nicely enrich the text, providing visual clues for children—the soft watercolors are filled with details that will keep children engaged.",

    "title": "WISHED",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sarah-ready/wished-ghosted/",
    "description": "This fourth installment of the author’s Ghosted series introduces Anna Benoit, who works as a housekeeper for Max Barone, the owner of a wildly successful jewelry empire in Geneva, Switzerland. For Anna, meeting Max was love at first sight, despite the fact that Max barely seems to register her existence: “Looking at him was like looking at the desolate sweep of an arctic winter the moment before the sun rises for the first time in months. I was struck, pierced, and flayed by the promise of that sunrise.” One day, while cleaning Max’s library, Anna finds a sapphire necklace along with a brittle old note claiming that it grants wishes. On a whim, she wishes that Max loved her and that they were married. When Max walks in on her, however, he accuses her of stealing the necklace, which has mysteriously moved to Anna’s pocket. Though she is immediately fired, Anna somehow wakes up the next morning in Max’s chateau with everyone calling her “Mrs. Barone.” She and Max are the only ones who have both sets of memories—of Anna the housekeeper and of Anna and Max’s happy seven-year marriage. Anna explains the wish she made, and she and Max go about attempting to reverse it—first by wishing on the same necklace again, then by flying to Paris after Max comes up with an alternate theory. As they work together to put everything right, they begin falling for each other for real. But Max has foresworn passion and true love, which means they’ll just have to forget about each other once everything returns to normal—ifthey can undo the wish.Fans of the author’s previous works will likely be delighted to revisit the character of Max, who pointedly did not get his happy ending in Ready’s earlier novel, Fated (2024). Anna proves to be a worthy match for him; her over-the-top romanticism plays nicely against Max’s stoicism. Just when the story seems to tip over into predictable romance tropes (they’re falling for each other despite their differences!), Ready tips the scales and forces readers to reexamine their own preconceived notions of what “should” happen (their plan to reverse the wish will work!). This blend of comforting romantic touchstones with witty dialogue and keen human observations makes for an enchanting read that manages to build genuine tension—both sexual and narrative. Anna is clearly a genuinely good person and easy to root for as a protagonist, although her fixation on Max before she even gets to know him as a person sometimes comes across as a bit childish. But her relentless positivity and wry observations (“Well, there’s a word for optimistic naivety, and that word is tomorrow”) are likely to eventually win over even the most hard-hearted readers. Ready, while crafting a sexy romp that ticks all the romance boxes, also manages to introduce heavier themes that provide a surprising amount of food for thought, including the fantasy of a person vs. the reality, fake happiness vs. real misery, and the ways in which memories shape the present. These elements, supported by smooth writing and briskly paced action, result in a genuine thinking-person’s love story.",

Leah has severe asthma, but each year the government offers 16-year-olds the opportunity to try out for a chance to live in the Floating City on Venus. Only 50 boys and 50 girls may go, however—and they must be healthy. When Rachel is selected, she devises a plan for 17-year-old Leah to go in her place, before the pollution kills her. Leah takes on Rachel’s identity and leaves for Venus. Determined to survive, she adheres to the strict rules and her job assignment. She forms new relationships, becoming especially close to Rose Palmer, who lives on her floor. Falling in love with Rose gives Leah a new sense of purpose, but lying is taking its toll. An accident risks undoing everything the sisters have sacrificed for. This verse novel for reluctant readers is a heartfelt journey of finding oneself that explores the sense of becoming that accompanies discovering a new home. Leah is a sympathetic protagonist, the blossoming romance is endearing, and the conclusion is satisfying and feels genuine. Main characters read white.",

    "description": "Edith was the youngest of three daughters in an ethnically Hungarian Jewish family in a Czechoslovakian town. She trained as a gymnast and made plans beyond high school with her sweetheart, Eric. Edith was 16 in 1944 when all appearances of normalcy were torn away, and Jewish families were crowded onto trains destined for Auschwitz. Her parents were killed on arrival at the camp. Edith and her oldest sister, Magda, labored amid horrific conditions and uncountable deaths. Dreams of reuniting with Eric sustained Edith, but her hope eventually dwindled. Over a year later, they and other prisoners were close to death when American soldiers liberated them. Recovery was a long road: Edith weighed only 70 pounds when she was rescued. Over 15,000 Jews from her hometown were deported; fewer than 100 returned and began rebuilding their lives. Eger focuses primarily on her teen years, with the exception of an epilogue detailing her return to Auschwitz nearly 40 years later, alongside her husband, Béla, whom she met when they both were sent to a TB hospital following the war. Eger’s present-tense stream-of-consciousness narrative allows readers to experience the brutality of the Nazis but also the cooperation and encouragement among the inmates and the events that gave her postwar life meaning.",

    "description": "Twelve-year-old Jax Freeman is an unwilling transplant to Chicago, sent away from his Raleigh, North Carolina, home by his parents after an incident lands him in the juvenile justice system. Just about as soon as he descends from the train, the weirdness starts: Inanimate objects speak to him, a strange old woman tells him his ancestors need him, and a terrifying creature tries to steal his skin. The strangeness keeps building, from the inspirational signs at his grandmother’s house that keep changing their messages to the class in…magic?…at DuSable Middle School. And what’s with the peculiar reactions he gets whenever people learn his surname? Pretty soon Jax is riding a magic train called the Shriek, charged with a mission to heal a feud among the five magical summoning families of Chicago—a mission that killed his great-great-grandfather. Jax spends most of the novel in a state of frustration as he tries to understand this new world, and readers may sympathize as they wait with him for other characters to dole out information. Mbalia has so much fun developing the world’s rules and inhabitants, though, that readers will probably not mind the adventure’s bagginess. Jax has a digressive narrative style that runs to broad comedy, but it’s his fundamental decency that really shines.",

Meena knows this is unfair, but her mother says that’s just the way things have always been since she was a little girl growing up. Meena’s family, the first to emigrate from their village in India, help others who come later. As afternoon rolls around, aunts, uncles, and cousins fill the house with activity. While Meena makes countless cups of chai, the women prepare elaborate meals. The children entertain themselves by watching Bollywood movies and reenacting dance and action scenes. At dinner, tradition dictates that the women eat after the men. Meena knows that this, too, is unfair, and today, she decides to bring about change by sitting down to dinner with her father and the other men. The story mirrors the realities of many immigrant communities, demonstrating how families often gather to prepare and enjoy food and give new arrivals a leg up in a new land. Told in a realistically childlike voice, the narrative also highlights the gender disparity that many children encounter from a very young age. The bright watercolor illustrations are bursting with life. Traditional Indian clothes and food figure prominently as characters chatter and play in a whirlwind of chaos and togetherness.",
