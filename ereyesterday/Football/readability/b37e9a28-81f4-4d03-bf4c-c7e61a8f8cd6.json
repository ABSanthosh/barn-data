  "text": "Rangers captain James Tavernier has been ruled out of Thursday’s Old Firm derby with an injury that will keep him on the sidelines for “a few weeks”. Tavernier will miss the visit of Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic after scan results showed “clear damage” picked up during Rangers’ 2-2 draw with Motherwell. The right-back has created 39 chances for Rangers in the league this season, a total only bettered by team-mate Vaclav Cerny (40) in the Scottish Premiership. It offers Philippe Clement a dilemma in defence, with John Souttar and Neraysho Kasanwirjo also still missing with respective injury issues. Rangers currently find themselves 14 points behind their Old Firm rivals in the Scottish Premiership, with a defeat on Thursday severely denting their title hopes this season. But despite setbacks ahead of kick-off, Clement was hopeful that Leon Balogun would return from his latest injury in time for the encounter at Ibrox. “James has picked up an injury,” the Belgian said. “We took a scan and there is clear damage, and he will be out for a few weeks,” Clement said. “It’s a blow, and we have had a few blows in that way in the last weeks, the last months. There is a small chance Leon Balogun could return. We will see after his individual work.” Clement is looking for a response from his players as his side were booed off at half-time during their draw with Motherwell last time out. But the Rangers boss will have to do something he has never done before in his managerial career, and that is to beat Celtic. Clement is yet to emerge victorious against Celtic in six attempts in all competitions in charge of the club (D2 L4). The only manager to go as long or longer before winning an Old Firm derby (for either side) was William Wilton with the Gers from 1890 to 1893 (first eight). Rangers have also enjoyed just one win in their last 14 meetings with Celtic in all competitions (D4 L9), a 3-0 league victory in May 2023 under Michael Beale. “The last two games we lost goals a little bit out of nothing, not with really clear mistakes or being out of structure, totally not,” he insisted. “In these last two games, every time that they have had a shot on goal, it’s almost a goal. Those are the things that sometimes happen in football, but not two games in a row.”",
