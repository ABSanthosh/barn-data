  "text": "AC Milan made light work of Serie B side Sassuolo as Samuel Chukwueze scored twice in a 6-1 thrashing to reach the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia on Tuesday. The last-16 clash was already over as a contest by the 23rd minute after Chukwueze’s brace, along with goals from Tijjani Reijnders and Rafael Leao handed Milan a 4-0 lead at San Siro. Davide Calabria added their fifth 11 minutes after the interval, though Samuele Mulattieri managed a consolation three minutes later, before Tammy Abraham rounded off the win in the 61st minute. Chukwueze opened the scoring in the 12th minute when a Reijnders ball over the top put him through one-on-one with Giacomo Satalino, and after his first effort hit the upright he tapped in the rebound. Reijnders drilled home from outside the area five minutes later and Chukwueze netted his second in the 21st minute, curling beyond the reach of Satalino after an Abraham lay-off. A no-look pass from Ruben Loftus-Cheek freed Leao to score two minutes later before Christian Pulisic’s lofted cross bounced off the post and Calabria reacted quickest to convert in the second half. Mulattieri’s effort squirmed under Lorenzo Torriani to finally give Sassuolo something to cheer about, but Abraham finished off the rout, tucking his finish around Satalino just past the hour. See you in the quarter-final, Rossoneri! #MilanSassuolo #SempreMilan #CoppaItaliaFrecciarossa pic.twitter.com/oGKpyJqfpt — AC Milan (@acmilan) December 3, 2024 Data Debrief: Rampant Rossoneri Milan’s victory came by an impressive scoreline, though the underlying stats suggest the 6-1 win was somewhat flattering on the home side’s performance. Indeed, the home side accumulated just 1.89 expected goals (xG) from their 15 attempts, but the quality of finishing proved too much for Sassuolo to handle.",
