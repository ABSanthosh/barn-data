Hansi Flick’s side spent the final half an hour at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium with a man less after Fermin Lopez was sent off for a poor challenge on Djibril Sow. Robert Lewandowski handed the visitors an eighth minute lead, sliding in to tuck the ball home off the post after being found by Inigo Martinez’s header. However, Sevilla levelled the contest just a minute later when Saul Niguez beat the offside trap before squaring for Ruben Vargas to finish. Barcelona went on to dominate the rest of the first-half without reward, but restored their lead shortly after the break. On as a substitute for the second 45 minutes, Lopez headed home from inside the box following Pedri’s deft cross into the area. Raphinha then put the game beyond Sevilla nine minutes later, collecting Pau Cubarsi’s pass before shifting the ball onto his right foot and finding the bottom corner. But just five minutes after going further in front, Lopez was handed his marching orders by the referee following a studs-up challenge to cap an eventful 17-minute cameo. Despite that setback, Barcelona netted their fourth of the game when substitute Eric Garcia nodded Raphinha’s inviting free-kick past Orjan Nyland. Data Debrief: Barca come through red mist Flick’s side have found numerous ways to win throughout the season, with their display against Sevilla further proving their credentials for the LaLiga crown after seeing out the victory following Lopez’s red card. Indeed, Lopez became the second Barcelona player in the 21st century to have come on as a substitute (17 minutes in play), score and be sent off in a LaLiga game after Vitor Roque at Mendizorroza in February 2024 (13 minutes in play). But Barcelona were set on their way thanks to Lewandowski’s early opener. He has scored eight goals with his last eight shots on target in his last nine games in all competitions, and is the player who has netted the most goals in the top five European leagues this season in all competitions (31). For the first time ever, Barcelona have now collected points in each of their last nine visits to Sevilla in LaLiga (W6 D3) and for the first time they have beaten Sunday’s opponents in seven consecutive games.",
