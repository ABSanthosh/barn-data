  "text": "Spain head coach Montse Tome praised the impact of Athenea del Castillo in their 2-0 victory over Switzerland at Euro 2025. Second-half goals from Del Castillo and Claudia Pina helped the world champions reach the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 1997. Spain squandered multiple chances in search of an opener, including a missed penalty early on from Mariona Caldentey. However, Del Castillo scored just three minutes and 24 seconds after coming off the bench, finishing past Livia Peng following a backheel assist from Aitana Bonmati. She has now found the net in consecutive Euro appearances, having scored in none of her first six. Pina scored a goal of the tournament contender soon after, before Alexia Putellas also missed from the spot late on. Tome was pleased to see her side overcome a stubborn challenge from Switzerland, but was particularly happy with Del Castillo’s “flair and attacking presence”. Tome told UEFA.com: “It was a high-level match. Switzerland defended well early on while we looked for ways to score, but we managed possession and structure effectively to prevent their counterattacks – they barely had any shots. “The team was solid defensively and, in the second half, we found the breakthrough. “We knew Switzerland would defend well, stay compact and be lifted by their home crowd – and that’s exactly what happened. “The key was patience, especially managing situations with Sydney [Schertenleib] and [Iman] Beney, who are dangerous in open spaces. But our two centre-backs were outstanding and we got the job done. “Athenea brings flair, depth and helps us maintain possession. Near the box, she’s also capable of scoring in tight spaces. “We wanted more width and attacking presence down the right and she delivered with the goal. We’re very happy for her and for how that right side performed.” Bonmatí’s backheel brilliance #WEUROassists || @AmazonUK pic.twitter.com/wBBjJjU4Ok — UEFA Women’s EURO 2025 (@WEURO2025) July 18, 2025 Switzerland midfielder Smilla Vallotto started in all four of the host country’s matches in her first major international tournament. The 21-year-old was proud of her team’s performance and hopes it inspired the younger generation. Vallotto said: “We stood up to Spain pretty well for 65 or 70 minutes, so it’s bad to concede two. We tried our best, which is most important. “The fans were crazy – they were still cheering us on even though we lost. I hope the tournament pushes more people to start playing football – both young girls and boys. “The main goal of this tournament was to motivate people to come to women’s football, so we’re pretty happy.”",
