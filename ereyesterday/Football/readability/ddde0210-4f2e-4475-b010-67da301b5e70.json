  "text": "David Moyes is excited for Everton’s “new beginning” but is also relishing the chance to be in charge of their final Premier League game at Goodison Park against Southampton. Moyes’ side ended a run of three without a win in the top-flight with their 3-1 victory over Fulham last time out, moving them to 13th in the table. Everton will be moving to their new Bramley-Moore Dock stadium from next season, but the men’s team will be bidding farewell to Goodison on Sunday, having played there since 1892. It will be a fitting send-off for the Toffees, who have recorded 16 wins over Southampton at home in the Premier League, only beating West Ham as many times (also 16). “We were talking about it years ago when I first came here,” Moyes told TNT Sports, reflecting on his first spell between 2002 and 2013. “We were looking at new sites and had so many moments where we thought we’re getting something else, but it never came through. “I know for all Evertonians, they’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time for the new stadium… all looking forward to the move now. It’ll be sad to leave, but I think there’s a new beginning for Everton. “It’s had so many good games here over the years. We’re just fortunate enough to be the last ones to shut the back door on the way out.” 18.05.25 #EndOfAnEra pic.twitter.com/hLSO0kttil — Everton (@Everton) May 15, 2025 Southampton did beat Everton earlier this season, but having already been relegated and confirmed to finish bottom, there is little to play for in their final two games. They are winless in 11 matches, though they earned a huge point in a 0-0 draw with Manchester City last weekend. It ensured Southampton would not finish with the joint-lowest points tally in Premier League history, but interim head coach Simon Rusk insisted that had not been his biggest priority. “I didn’t know much about it [the points tally], it was hardly mentioned,” he told BBC Sport. “I understood the importance of it, but it wasn’t something I was focusing on. I was focusing on performances, improving and the environment [of the team].” PLAYERS TO WATCH Everton – Beto Beto is Everton’s top scorer in the Premier League this season with eight goals, though he has yet to assist a goal for his team-mates this term. Only Dominic Calvert-Lewin in 2020-21 (16) has scored more in a single campaign for the Toffees without providing an assist. Southampton – Aaron Ramsdale Southampton kept a clean sheet in the Premier League for the first time since December 2024 against Fulham when they drew with Man City, ending a run of 18 games without a single shutout in the competition. Aaron Ramsdale’s goal faced 26 shots in that match, with the goalkeeper making five saves to earn his shutout. St Mary’s at full volume Take a pitchside view of Saturday’s BIG shift — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) May 12, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: EVERTON WIN Everton lost their last home league match against Southampton in January 2023, ending a 17-game unbeaten run against the Saints at Goodison Park. They last lost consecutive home league games against them in April 1974. And following their 1-0 win at St Mary’s in the reverse fixture, Southampton are looking to complete the league double over Everton for the first time since 1997-98. This will be Everton’s 2,789th and final game at Goodison Park in all competitions (W1537 D660 L591). They are currently winless in seven home games (D5 L2), last having a longer run between October and December 2009 (eight), but they will want to sign off from their stadium in style. Though they have only kept one clean sheet in their last 13 Premier League games, Everton have not conceded more than twice in any of their last 23. Only Arsenal (59) and Bournemouth (25) are on longer current runs without conceding 3+ goals. Southampton have won just one of their last 26 Premier League games (D5 L20). However, their 0-0 draw with Man City last time out ensured the Saints will not finish the 2024-25 campaign with the joint-lowest points total in Premier League history. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Everton – 63.9% Draw – 19.8% Southampton – 16.2%",
