  "text": "Nashville SC missed the chance to go second in MLS’ Eastern Conference after they were held to a 2-2 draw by New York City FC. Brian Callaghan’s side led 2-0 at GEODIS Park as Sam Surridge’s first-half brace took his tally for the league season to 11 goals. However, Hannes Wolf was also at the double after the break to secure a share of the spoils for NYCFC. Nashville had won seven of their last nine home games and took the lead in the 27th minute, when Hany Mukhtar neatly controlled a long ball and teed up Surridge to slot into the bottom corner. The former Bournemouth striker doubled his and the hosts’ tally 14 minutes later, neatly sweeping past City goalkeeper Matt Freese. However, a couple of defensive lapses after the break proved costly for Nashville. Wolf halved the deficit in the 54th minute after they struggled to deal with a ball in the box and, when the hosts failed to clear an 87th-minute corner, the Austrian pounced again to snatch a point. Hannes Wolf with a late equalizer.@newyorkcityfc have fought back after being down two goals. pic.twitter.com/jUNptUDEZ9 — Major League Soccer (@MLS) May 31, 2025 Earlier in the day, 10-man St. Louis City SC ended their 11-game winless streak, with Eduard Lowen’s stoppage-time penalty sealing a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes. The hosts broke the deadlock in first-half stoppage time at Energizer Park, when Joao Klauss won a long aerial ball before chasing and firing past Earl Edwards Jr. in the visitors’ goal. However, San Jose got themselves back on level terms with six minutes remaining as two substitutes combined, with Josef Martinez turning in Vitor Costa’s cross. Nevertheless, there was to be a late twist when Edwards Jr. fouled Simon Becher in the box, before Lowen calmly slotted home from 12 yards. Despite seeing Conrad Wallem shown two yellow cards for time-wasting in quick succession, the hosts held out in the dying moments for a morale-boosting win – and David Critchley’s first as interim head coach. Data Debrief: St. Louis finally get a win St. Louis City’s club-record 11-match winless streak in the regular season is over thanks to Lowen’s late heroics. They have now won all five of their meetings with New York; the only MLS franchise they have played more than once while maintaining their 100% record. The Earthquakes’ eight-game unbeaten run – their longest in four years – is also over, and they have now failed to win any of their last 24 MLS matches in which they have conceded first. On a brighter note, Bruce Arena’s side have scored seven MLS goals via substitutes this season, more than any other franchise in the competition.",
