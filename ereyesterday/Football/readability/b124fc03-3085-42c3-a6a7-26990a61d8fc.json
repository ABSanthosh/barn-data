New signing Joao Pedro scored two stunning goals against his boyhood club to send Chelsea into Sunday’s showpiece match. The Premier League side have now reached their third Club World Cup final (2012 and 2021), including the previous format, with only LaLiga giants Real Madrid (six) and Barcelona (four) having reached more finals in the competition. Maresca’s side have now won 13 of their last 15 matches in all competitions and are hoping to win more silverware after their Conference League triumph in May. “It’s a great achievement – it has been a fantastic season, top four in the league, [winning] the Conference League, now in the final of this competition, we are so, so happy,” Maresca told DAZN. “Yes, [it feels like we have momentum], but probably because we go game-by-game. We don’t know how many games. We just know we go game-by-game. “Finally, now, it is the last game of the season, we can say that. Hopefully, we can win the tournament.” See you in the final. pic.twitter.com/HaKWi0QAly — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 8, 2025 Joao Pedro took advantage of Liam Delap’s suspension, which earned the Brazilian a spot in the starting lineup. Maresca is happy with the competition for places in his squad, specifically in the striker department, with Nicolas Jackson having come on from the bench in the second half. “We know that we have players who are able to do that [what Joao Pedro did]. We have to get them in situations where they can do that. We know Joao can do this,” Maresca added. “I’m very, very happy, to be honest. Because I know how difficult it is, with all the situations. We are into the final here – it is fantastic.” Chelsea will face either Real Madrid or European champions Paris Saint-Germain in the final. Maresca is not worried about which team they face, though he may well have to deal without star midfielder Moises Caicedo, who suffered an injury late on. He said: “We will see [on the Caicedo injury]. I told him he has to do everything to be on the pitch on Sunday! “[Madrid and PSG] are both top teams. One won the Champions League this season, the other won it last season. They are both top teams, but we are proud and happy to be there.”",
