  "text": "Brighton’s two-goal hero Yankuba Minteh says the Seagulls are dreaming of European football next season after easing to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Chelsea on Friday. Minteh followed up Kaoru Mitoma’s sensational opener with two strikes either side of half-time to move them up to eighth in the Premier League table. Indeed, after dumping Chelsea out of the FA Cup last week, it was the first time Brighton had beaten the same opponent in the space of seven days since November 2007. Brighton also enjoyed their first home win in six games in the Premier League (D3 L2), while it was their joint-biggest win in the competition over a side starting the day in the top four, along with a 3-0 win against Arsenal in May 2023 under Roberto De Zerbi. Their triumph was led by the impressive Minteh, who ended the contest with an expected goals (xG) total of 0.39, with only Joel Veltman (0.64) creating more. He also created more chances (three) and won more duels (12) than anyone on the pitch. Minteh bagged his first-ever brace in English football, while he has been directly involved in four goals in his last four Premier League games (three goals, one assist), one more than in his first 16 outings in the competition combined (three). “I think the compactness of the team was good, and the team always communicated with me and pushed me,” Minteh told Sky Sports. “I think everybody has helped me a lot. I went to Feyenoord and played one year, and now I am back in the Premier League, everything is going well.” When asked about the prospect of a second season in Europe, Minteh said: “Yes. We are dreaming.” Though Brighton had returned to winning ways in their FA Cup win over Chelsea, they were still licking their wounds from their 7-0 thrashing away to Nottingham Forest. And Fabian Hurzeler was pleased with how his side responded to that heavy defeat, citing his squad’s character as crucial to halting their two-game losing run in the top-flight. “I thought the 7-0 was crazy. We don’t want things like this to happen, but we analysed it, and it was important to stay calm and do the basic things right,” Hurzeler said afterwards. “We tried to work hard and bounce back on the pitch because talking does not help in moments like this. “The most important thing is that we make the Seagulls supporters proud and give them what they deserve. “I always say that I trust the process and I did not change my approach. I knew why it happened, and we analysed it and I did not overreact. “The players showed great character and the right reaction.” Hurzeler also showered praise on Mitoma for his exquisite finish to hand his team the lead in the 27th minute. Mitoma brilliantly brought down Bart Verbruggen’s punt forward before curling the ball into the net, scoring his third goal in his last five Premier League appearances, as many as in the 33 before that (three). “I think we have to also mention Bart Verbruggen, who made a mistake in the last game, for showing this personality and making this assist,” Hurzeler said. “It was a great touch and selection from Mitoma, but you always need somebody to assist you.” Georgi is all of us right now! pic.twitter.com/cvnxqzTbhV — Brighton \u0026 Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) February 14, 2025 Indeed, Verbruggen is only the second Brighton goalkeeper to register an assist in the Premier League, after Jason Steele against Brentford on April 1st 2023. There have been six assists by goalkeepers in the Premier League this season (Ederson (two), Mark Flekken, Jordan Pickford, Bernd Leno and Verbruggen), the most in a single campaign since 2007-08 (eight).",
