  "text": "Verdict: Portugal win Best Odds: 2/3 Bookmaker: Luckster Looking to extend on their 100% Nations League record on Tuesday night, Portugal will travel to Hampden when they meet Scotland. Scotland Starting with the hosts, marking their return to Nations League action over the weekend with a 2-1 loss away at Croatia, Scotland find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Enduring a real EURO 24 struggle over the summer as they only put a single point on the board, the pressure on Steve Clarke’s shoulders is at a boiling point. Getting their League A adventure underway on September 5th with a worrying 3-2 defeat at the hands of Poland, the former Kilmarnock boss has come under a huge amount of pressure. Signing off their European campaign with a toothless 1-0 defeat against Hungary, Scotland have registered just a sole point from any of their previous six competitive appearances. Likewise, facing what looks set to be another heavyweight challenge when they return to Hampden on Tuesday night, the Tartan Army have also recorded just a single win from any of their last 15 consecutive showdowns across all competitions. Team News Withdrawing from Scotland’s squad last week after sustaining an injury issue, Clarke will once again be unable to call upon Norwich goalkeeper Craig Gordon on Tuesday night. While veteran shot-stopper Craig Gordon might turn 42 in December, the ex-Sunderland star will start between the sticks at Hampden. While the Tartan Army might be dealing with an injury crisis, Liverpool defender Andy Robertson will lead out Clarke’s squad and earn a 78th international cap here. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench away at Croatia over the weekend, Torino striker Che Adams could be handed a full recall in Glasgow. Portugal As for the visitors, while Portugal might have suffered EURO 24 heartbreak over the summer as they fell to a quarter-final defeat against France, the Navigators have come roaring back in some style. Marking their return to League A action over the weekend with a rampant performance as they stormed their way to a 3-1 romp away at Poland, Roberto Martinez’s men are firing on all cylinders. Getting proceedings underway on September 5th with an eye-catching 2-1 win against Croatia, the former Belgium boss could be smelling a golden opportunity on Tuesday night. Clinching another 2-1 victory when they welcomed Scotland Lisbon last month, Portugal have won each of their three Nations League appearances by an aggregate score of 7-3. Appearing to cruise their way to a semi-final ticket this year, Martinez’s side should be relishing a trip to Hampden in midweek. Team News Picking up a muscle injury prior to Saturday’s trip to Poland, Portugal will be without Sporting Lisbon defender Goncalo Inacio on Tuesday night. Shockingly left out of Martinez’s squad over the weekend and enduring a tough start since arriving at Bayern Munich over the summer, ex-Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha could once again miss out here. Continuing to shatter even more records and recording a 133 international goal on Saturday night, five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo will earn a 216th cap at Hampden. Settling for a spot on the bench in Warsaw, Liverpool ace Diego Jota could be handed a full recall in midweek. Key Factors to Consider When Scotland and Portugal met for their reverse Nations League showdown on September 8th, the Navigators collected a 2-1 victory in Lisbon. Portugal have won each of their first three Nations League showdowns by an aggregate score of 7-3. Scotland have collected just a single point from any of their previous six competitive appearances. Likewise, the Tartan Army have registered just a sole win from any of their last 15 consecutive matchups across all competitions. Along with finding the net away at Poland over the weekend, Cristiano Ronaldo has recorded three goals in as many Nations League appearances. Conclusion Winning each of their first three Nations League appearances this year and cruising their way to a semi-final ticket, Portugal will be looking to lay down another League A marker here. Enjoying what has become a real purple patch over the past month and firing on all cylinders, Martinez’s camp will also be excited by their most recent showdown against a struggling Scotland. Landing a 2-1 win when they welcomed the Tartan Army to Lisbon for their reverse Nations League showdown on September 8th, we are expecting a similar outcome in midweek.
