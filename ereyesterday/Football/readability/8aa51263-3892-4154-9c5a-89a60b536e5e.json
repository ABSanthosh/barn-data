  "text": "West Brom have appointed Ryan Mason as their new head coach ahead of the 2025-26 season. Mason has signed a three-year deal with the Championship club, replacing Tony Mowbray after he was dismissed on April 21. The 33-year-old spent seven years in various coaching roles at Tottenham, where he also played between 2008 and 2016. The former midfielder also served as interim head coach after the north London club sacked Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, respectively. Overall, Mason took charge of Spurs for 12 Premier League games over the two short spells, winning six of those matches. Mason said he is looking forward to what the future holds at the Hawthorns. “This is a huge club with a fantastic infrastructure and an incredible fanbase, and I am excited about what we can achieve together,” said Mason. We’re delighted to announce the appointment of Ryan Mason as our new men’s first team Head Coach! Welcome to The Hawthorns, boss! — West Bromwich Albion (@WBA) June 2, 2025 “Having spoken at length to the board and those at the club, I am convinced that Albion is the perfect place for me to be, and I can’t wait to get started. “I will bring with me a huge amount of enthusiasm, dedication and ambition, and look forward to a positive future together at such a fantastic club.” West Brom finished ninth in the Championship last season, just four points off a play-off spot. The Baggies have not been in the Premier League since their relegation from the top-flight in 2021.",
