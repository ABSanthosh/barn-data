  "text": "CF Montreal head coach Marco Donadel and defender Joel Waterman remained optimistic despite a defeat to the Philadelphia Union last time out. Montreal, who are bottom of the Eastern Conference, lost 2-1 to table-topping Philadelphia in a closely contested match in midweek. Montreal produced 1.5 expected goals (xG), slightly lower than the Union’s 1.6. Although they lost the match, Montreal extended their scoring run to six games and showed they can compete against the best in the league. Donadel was proud to see his Montreal side continue to chase the match rather than sit back and accept defeat, while Waterman, who assisted Prince Owusu’s goal, is hoping to keep their efforts going into their next game against the Chicago Fire. “The guys wanted to come here and fight at the same level of the first-placed team in the standings to show something,” said Donadel. “We wanted to come here to try to win, to try to get points, and the guys have shown this on the field. I’m very happy, especially because we showed that after we went down 2-1, chasing the game, we could create a lot of chances. “As soon as they gave us a bit of space, the players recognised the possibility to play. We tried to show what we can do, and we fought.” Waterman added: “It’s very disappointing, but there is a lot to be proud of in that performance too. They are first in the league for a reason, and they do a lot of the little things really well. “When you go toe to toe with the best of the best in the league, it’s something you’re proud of, but at the same time, we’re not satisfied. I don’t want the boys to feel satisfied whatsoever. “One thing we can’t fault is the effort, and against a really good team. We have another game on Saturday, so we’ll try and learn a lot like always, and we’ll move forward.” De retour à la maison après quelques jours sur la route Back to Centre Nutrilait after a long road trip #CFMTL pic.twitter.com/9mmXzTygG2 — CF Montréal (@cfmontreal) July 17, 2025 Playoff-chasing Chicago Fire were dealt a late blow in their last game against Atlanta United after conceding a 94th-minute equaliser. The Fire are now four points behind Charlotte FC in ninth, but have played one game fewer than their counterparts. PLAYERS TO WATCH CF Montreal – Prince Owusu Prince Owusu has been a key performer for Montreal this season. He leads the club with 10 goals, three of which have been the critical first of the match. The German forward has scored in six of his last seven matches in all competitions, finding the net eight times across those games. Chicago Fire – Philip Zinckernagel Philip Zinckernagel has been one of Chicago’s leading attacking threats this season, providing 10 goals and eight assists. Zinckernagel scored on a corner kick just 62 seconds into Wednesday’s draw with Atlanta. It was the fastest Olimpico in MLS play over the last 15 seasons. MATCH PREDICTION – DRAW Montreal have won just one of their first 10 home matches this regular season (D3 L6). Entering this season, only Tampa Bay (four) in 2001 had collected fewer points in their first 10 home games of a season in MLS history. The Fire surrendered two different one-goal leads in their 2-2 draw at Atlanta on Wednesday. It was the sixth time this season that Chicago has failed to win an MLS match it had a lead in, tied for the most such games in 2025 with Orlando City, Real Salt Lake and St. Louis City SC. Montreal have won five of their last six true home matches (in Montreal) against Chicago (D1), dating back to 2018. Montreal have lost only two of their 15 all-time true home matches against the Fire (W10 D3). In their last six league matches, Montreal have won two, drawn one and lost three. Chicago, meanwhile, have won one, drawn one and lost four in their last six. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY CF Montreal – 36.5% Draw – 26.2% Chicago Fire – 37.3%",
