  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Both teams to score Odds: 2/3 @ 1xBet In what is a real showdown at the top of the A-League table, Melbourne City will welcome Auckland to AAMI Park on Sunday morning. Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to winning ways last time out as they claimed a 4-1 victory away at Brisbane, Melbourne city are desperately seeking a repeat performance here. While the Australian giants might have been frustrated last season as they eventually had to settle for a sixth-place finish, Aurelio Vidmar’s men are hoping to mount a genuine title charge this time around. Heading into November’s international break with a remarkable 5-0 romp against Perth, the Sky Blues have put 12 points on the board from their first six A-League appearances. However, facing what looks like it will be a heavyweight challenge on Sunday morning, Melbourne are still looking to put a maiden home victory on the board. Including what was an infamous 3-1 drumming at the hands of arch-rivals Melbourne Victory last month, Vidmar’s side have lost their first two A-League showdowns at AAMI Park by an aggregate score of 5-1. In fact, this is the first time that Sunday’s hosts have suffered consecutive home defeats for the rest time since October of last year. As for the visitors, while Auckland might have only made their A-League debut back in October, Australia’s latest franchise have embarked on a real fairytale. Getting proceedings underway with a 2-0 win against Brisbane, the Black Knights have rightfully received a string of plaudits. Last seen laying down a real marker as they secured a 2-1 win against local rivals Wellington, Steve Corica’s camp are riding what has been a sensational wave of momentum. In fact, the former Sydney boss has seen his high-flying squad win each of their first six A-League appearances and they are remarkably pencilled in as a leading title contender. The only side among Australia’s elite that can boast a 100% start, Sunday’s guests will arrive at AAMI Park looking to claim another heavyweight scalp. Winning their first six showdowns by an aggregate score of 10-1, Auckland have also notched at least a pair of goals in four of those outings. In what looks set to be an action-packed contest on Sunday morning, we are backing both teams to find the net here. Bet: Both teams to score at Melbourne City vs Auckland 2/3 for Sunday’s A-League showdown @ 1xBet",
