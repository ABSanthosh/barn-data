  "text": "Chelsea rallied from a goal down to see off a spirited Celtic team 2-1 in the Women’s Champions League, maintaining their perfect start to life under Sonia Bompastor. Bompastor had led the Blues to six straight wins in the Women’s Super League and masterminded triumphs over Real Madrid and Twente in Europe. However, her perfect record came under serious threat in Glasgow, where competition debutants Celtic led through Murphy Agnew ‘s 22nd-minute goal. She capped a lightning counter by racing in behind before slotting into the bottom-left corner, scoring Celtic’s first goal in the Women’s Champions League. However, their lead lasted just six minutes as Maika Hamano swept home Aggie Beever-Jones’ cutback for the equaliser, then Ashley Lawrence powered home a rebound in the 32nd minute to complete a rapid turnaround. Beever-Jones was dismissed after collecting her second yellow card in stoppage time, but it did not matter to Chelsea as they made it 12 straight wins in all competitions. They are now three points clear of Real Madrid at the top of Group B, after the Spanish giants routed Twente 7-0 earlier on Wednesday. In Group A, Bompastor’s former club Lyon posted an impressive 3-0 win at Roma to move three points clear of the Giallorosse. Melchie Dumornay scored twice before half-time to put the French champions in the ascendency, then Vanessa Gilles reacted quickest to a right-wing corner to prod home their third seven minutes into the second half. With three wins from as many matches, Lyon are three points clear of Roma and six ahead of Wolfsburg, who managed a 5-0 win over Galatasaray on Wednesday.",
