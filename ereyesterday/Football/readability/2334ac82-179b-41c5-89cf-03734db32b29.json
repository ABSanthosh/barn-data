  "text": "Verdict: Newcastle win Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Hoping to move into bronze medal position on Wednesday night, Newcastle will welcome Crystal Palace to St. James’ Park. Newcastle Starting with the hosts, enduring their 70-year wait for a piece of domestic silverware last month as they were crowned EFL Cup champions thanks to a 2-1 victory against Newcastle at Wembley, Newcastle are enjoying what has become a remarkable fairytale. Storming their way up the Premier League table, Eddie Howe’s men are riding a major wave of momentum. Laying down another heavyweight marker over the weekend as they stormed their way to a 4-1 romp against Manchester United, the Magpies find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Sat in the driving seat to book another iconic Champions League ticket come May, Newcastle can also leapfrog Nottingham Forest and move into bronze medal position here. Winning all of their previous five appearances across all competitions, Wednesday’s hosts will be desperate to take another giant leap towards a top-four finish. Newcastle Team News Both still dealing with respective knee injuries, Newcastle will once again be without the defensive duo of Sven Botman and Jamaal Lascelles on Wednesday night. Likewise, suffering a long-term blow back in February, Lewis Hall will miss the remainder of the season. Bagging a brace against Manchester United last weekend and now notching three goals in his previous two Premier League outings, Harvey Barnes will join attacking talisman Alexander Isak in the final third. England international Anthony Gordon could make a first start since March 2nd. Crystal Palace As for the visitors, suffering a real collapse away at soon-to-be former champions Manchester City over the weekend as they eventually fell to a 5-2 defeat, Crystal Palace will be seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, despite watching their purple patch come to a thumping end on Saturday lunchtime, Oliver Glasner’s men have continued to receive a string of plaudits. Although a late European charge might appear to be a step too far, the Eagles have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Booking their FA Cup semi-final ticket last month as they marked their return from March’s international break with a sensational 3-0 romp away at Fulham, Palace are more than capable of asking some real questions when they travel to St. James’ Park in midweek. Crystal Palace Team News Both serving respective one-match suspensions away at Manchester City last weekend, the duo of Eddie Nketiah and defensive talisman Marc Guehi will return to Palace’s squad. However, Mali international Cheick Doucoure remains on the sidelines with a long-term knee injury. Bagging a consolation strike at the Etihad on Saturday lunchtime and now registering five direct goal contributions in as many appearances for club and country, Eberechi Eze will play a leading role. Will Hughes could make a first Premier League start since the end of February at St. James’ Park. Newcastle vs Crystal Palace Key Factors to Consider When Newcastle and Crystal Palace met for their reverse Premier League meeting on November 30th, Wednesday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate at Selhurst Park. Including their EFL Cup triumph last month, Newcastle have won each of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Saturday’s 5-2 loss against Manchester City was the first defeat that Crystal Palace have suffered from their last eight matchups across all fronts. Newcastle have registered seven points from their previous three Premier League meetings against Crystal Palace at St. James’ Park. Six of Newcastle’s last seven showdowns at St. James’ Park have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Breezing their way to what was a sensational 4-1 romp against Manchester United last weekend, Newcastle are enjoying what has become a remarkable run. Crowned EFL Cup champions on March 16th following their famous 2-1 victory against Liverpool at Wembley, Howe’s men have hit top gear at a crucial time. In fact, the Magpies can jump into bronze medal position here. Landing a 4-0 win when they welcomed Crystal Palace to St. James’ Park last season, we are backing Newcastle to extend on their Champions League charge on Wednesday night. Verdict: Newcastle win Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
