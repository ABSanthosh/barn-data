  "text": "Germany forward Klara Buhl said the team are “incredibly bitter” after Sweden inflicted their heaviest tournament defeat in 34 years at Euro 2025. Germany, who are among the favourites to win a record-extending ninth European crown in Switzerland, entered matchday three knowing a victory would secure top spot in Group C. While Jule Brand gave Germany an early lead, Stina Blackstenius and Smila Holmberg struck to turn the game on its head before Carlotta Wamser was sent off for a handball on the goal line. Fridolina Rolfo converted the resulting penalty, then Lina Hurtig tapped into an unguarded net to cap a comprehensive victory for Peter Gerhardsson’s side. The result means Sweden enter the quarter-finals as group winners, while Germany finish second and will face the top team from Group D – likely France or England – in the last eight, ahead of a potential semi-final clash with world champions Spain. The defeat was Germany’s heaviest at a World Cup or European Championships since the 1991 World Cup, when they were beaten 4-0 by Sweden. Germany have now lost 15 major tournament matches, with Sweden inflicting four of those (26.7%). Bayern Munich forward Buhl called for Germany to quickly put the result behind them, with a quarter-final to come next Saturday. “We started the game very well. We were fully in it and the better team,” she told ZDF. “We then give the game away in 10 minutes. We’re incredibly bitter about that. We have to put that behind us as quickly as possible.” Sweden finish with a perfect record#WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/9f5fvcaWaw — UEFA Women’s EURO 2025 (@WEURO2025) July 12, 2025 Sweden have now won their last eight group-stage matches at World Cups and European Championships by a combined scoreline of 24-3. While Germany’s heavy defeat could stifle their momentum following victories over Poland (2-0) and Denmark (2-1), coach Christian Wuck remains upbeat. “We’re down now, but we’ll get up again,” Wuck said. “We’ll pick ourselves up again. This will take a few hours. But after that, we’ll go into the quarter-finals full of joy.” Elsewhere in Group C, Poland beat Denmark 3-2 to finish third, with Natalia Padilla, Ewa Pajor and Martyna Wiankowska on target. Janni Thomsen and Signe Bruun netted for Denmark, though both teams were already certain to exit the tournament.",
