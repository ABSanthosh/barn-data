  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Dachbet With a Club World Cup quarter-final ticket up for grabs on Sunday night, Flamengo will meet Bayern Munich at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida. Flamengo Starting with Flamengo, heading into Brazil’s summer interval leading the chase at the fop of the Serie A standings, Filipe Luis’ side are enjoying what has become a remarkable purple patch. Storming their way to a Club World Cup knockout stage ticket earlier in the week, the Rio de Janeiro-based outfit have rightfully received a string of plaudits from across the glob. Mustering seven points from their three Group D appearances this summer, the Mengao also collected a famous European scalp on June 20th. Laying down a major statement of intent as they claimed a thumping 3-1 victory against Premier League giants Chelsea, Flamengo find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Firing on all cylinders and unbeaten in their previous 11 matchups across all competitions, Luis’ side are more than capable of asking some serious questions in Florida. Flamengo Team News Set to miss the whole of this summer’s tournament after sustaining a knee injury last month, former River Plate midfielder Nicolas de la Cruz will not be part of Luis’ travelling squad here. However, aside from the Uruguayan international, Flamengo have reported a clean bill of health. Completing a free transfer from Arsenal this month, summer recruit Jorginho should be handed a full recall in the middle of the park. Former Juventus star Danilo will start at the heart of Luis’ defence on Sunday night and should be joined by Leo Pereira. Bayern Munich As for Bayern Munich, while Vincent Kompany’s heavily-altered squad might have eventually fallen to a 1-0 loss against Benfica in midweek, the German giants will be confident of dusting themselves down immediately. Getting their Club World Cup adventure underway with a record-breaking 10-0 romp against Group C whipping boys Auckland City, the former Burnley boss is dreaming of the chance to mount a genuine title charge this summer. Reclaiming their domestic crown last season and not suffering a single Bundesliga defeat after returning from March’s international break, Bayern will know the importance of avoiding a potential banana skin this weekend. Despite drawing a rare blank on Tuesday night, Kompany’s side have gained a real reputation for their clinical performances in the final third. Failing to find the net on just a single occasion since the middle of February, the Bavarians will have some real pressure on their shoulders here. Bayern Munich Team News Dealing with an Achilles tendon injury and with suggestions over his long-term future in Munich, Bayern will once again be without South Korean international Min-Jae Kim on Sunday night. However, all handed a rest against Benfica in midweek, the likes of Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and summer recruit Jonathan Tah should be handed a full recall. Bagging an opening weekend hat-trick against Auckland City on June 15th, German ace Jamal Musiala should get some more minutes under his belt. Storming his way to the Bundesliga Golden Boot last month after registering 26 top-flight goals, England skipper Harry Kane will lead the line here. Flamengo vs Bayern Munich Key Factors to Consider Including a famous 3-1 victory against Chelsea on June 20th, Flamengo collected seven points from their three group D appearances. Flamengo are unbeaten in all of their last 11 consecutive appearances across all competitions. Bayern Munich’s 1-0 loss against Benfica in midweek was the first time they have drawn a blank since returning from March’s international break. Along with notching eight goals in his previous nine appearances across all fronts, Michael Olise has registered three strikes in as many outings this summer. England skipper Harry Kane registered 35 direct goal contributions in his 31 Bundesliga appearances last season. Conclusion While Bayern Munich might travel to Florida on Sunday night pencilled in as a standout contender to book a Club World Cup knockout stage ticket, Kompany’s side could be asked some real questions here. Watching Flamengo collect a heavyweight scalp on June 20th as they claimed a 3-1 victory against Chelsea, the Brazilian leaders shouldn’t be overlooked by any measure. Unbeaten in all of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions, the Mengao should be confident of testing a Munich side that has struggled to find any real defensive stability since Kompany’s arrival last summer.
