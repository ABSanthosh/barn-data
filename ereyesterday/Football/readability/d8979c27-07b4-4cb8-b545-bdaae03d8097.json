  "text": "Roberto Martinez thinks “very little details” will be the difference when his Portugal side face Germany in the Nations League semi-finals on Wednesday. A Selecao das Quinas are back in the final four for the first time since winning the inaugural event in 2019, and aiming to become the tournament’s first multiple winners. The 2016 European champions face a tricky test against hosts Germany for the right to play either France or Spain in Sunday’s showpiece. And Martinez believes small margins will determine the outcome of the contest at the Allianz Arena, where he knows home advantage will play a crucial part. “It doesn’t get any bigger than the challenge of facing Germany, just because of the team that they are,” he told reporters. “I think [Julian Nagelsmann] is doing a very interesting job of bringing clear ideas that, whoever the player is, he executes to perfection, which is a big strength. “Then, the second challenge is to play away from home at their ground. We saw it in the quarter-finals; we saw that out of the eight games, only one home team lost. #FazHistória | #NationsLeague pic.twitter.com/adlnIEKABa — Portugal (@selecaoportugal) June 3, 2025 “That’s something we need to overcome and make sure we use the support of over 10,000 Portuguese fans that we are going to have here. “We want to be a team that can take risks against Germany. I think it’s going to be a great game. There’s going to be a lot of action in both boxes, and it’s going to go down to very little details.” Portugal have not beaten Germany since Euro 2000 – when Sergio Conceicao scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win – subsequently losing the five most recent encounters. Bruno Fernandes has challenged his team-mates to create “new history” when they take to the field in Munich. “We have players that can put in heroic efforts and, if one player has a moment of inspiration, then we can win the game,” the Manchester United midfielder said. “But we know how hard we have to work to beat Germany. “It’s about time to change that. We have a new Conceicao [Francisco] in the team also, so who knows? Obviously, we want to win the game. History is in the past, and we just want to write a new [piece of] history for us.”",
