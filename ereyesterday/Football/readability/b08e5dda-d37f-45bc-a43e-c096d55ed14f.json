  "text": "Verdict: Lamine Yamal to score anytime Best Odds: 21/20 Bookmaker: Dachbet Turning their attention back to La Liga duties this weekend, Barcelona will travel to the Estadio Jose Zorrilla when they meet an already-relegated Valladolid on Saturday night. Real Valladolid Starting with the hosts, with their immediate Segunda return already confirmed with plenty of time to spare, Valladolid have endured a public top-flight crisis this season. Last seen putting in another nightmare display as they slumped to a 5-1 drumming at the hands of Real Betis, Alvaro Rubio’s side are simply waiting to see the back of the 2024/25 campaign. Sat rock-bottom of the La Liga table, the Pucelle have put just 16 points on the board from any of their 33 appearances. Breaking a string of unwanted records, Valladolid have lost all of their previous seven straight La Liga appearances by an aggregate score of 21-7. Facing what is a monumental challenge this weekend, Rubio’s side have also registered just a single point from their last 14 attempts. Real Valladolid Team News Limping off against Real Betis in the opening moments last week, Valladolid have already confirmed that one-time Real Madrid youngster Javier Sanchez will miss the remainder of the season with a leg injury. Likewise, Arsenal loanee Karl Hein remains on the sidelines with a shoulder issue. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench in Andalusia last week, Senegal international Mamadou Sylla could be handed a full recall. Former Parma midfielder Stanko Juric should be partnered alongside Anuar in the middle of the park. Barcelona As for the visitors, eventually forced to settle for a remarkable 3-3 stalemate on Wednesday night as they opened their Champions League semi-final adventure in Catalonia, Barcelona have a real job on their hands when they travel to Italy next week. Nevertheless, suffering just a single defeat across any competition so far this calendar year, Hansi Flick’s side hold a four-point buffer at the top of the La Liga table and are still dreaming of the chance to complete an iconic silverware sweep in 2025. Crowned Copa del Rey champions last weekend following a dramatic 3-2 victory against arch-rivals Real Madrid, Barca will certainly be smelling a golden opportunity here. Breezing their way to a remarkable 7-0 romp when they welcomed Valladolid to Catalonia for their reverse La Liga meeting on August 31st, Flick’s camp are rightfully installed as a landslide contender. Barcelona Team News Once again missing out against Inter Milan earlier in the week, Barcelona will once again be without Polish record-breaker Robert Lewandowski here. Likewise, limping off in Catalonia with a first-half muscle injury, French defender Jules Kounde will certainly play no part. Making his 100th appearance for Barca on Wednesday night and notching a fifth Champions League goal of the season, 17-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal will play a leading role. Former Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen could make a first start of 2025 this weekend. Real Valladolid vs Barcelona Key Factors to Consider When Real Valladolid and Barcelona met for their reverse La Liga meeting on August 31st, Flick’s side cruised their way to a 7-0 romp in Catalonia. Barcelona have suffered just a single defeat across any competition so far this calendar year. Valladolid have lost all of their previous seven straight La Liga appearances by an aggregate score of 21-7. Saturday’s hosts have registered just a single point from their last 14 La Liga attempts. Valladolid have shipped a remarkable 81 goals in their 33 La Liga appearances this season. Conclusion While Barcelona might have failed to claim a Champions League first-leg advantage against Inter Milan on Wednesday night, Flick’s side should be excited to turn their attention back to domestic duties here. Looking to widen their buffer at the top of the table and take another giant leap towards this season’s La Liga crown, Barca have been handed a golden opportunity here. Storming their way to a 7-0 romp when they welcomed an already-relegated Valladolid to Catalonia on August 31st, Flick’s attacking superstars will be confident of filling their boots.
