  "text": "Ruben Amorim noted that Alejandro Garnacho has “changed in everything” since he took over at Manchester United and is keen to keep seeing him improve, with Crystal Palace next up. The 20-year-old was dropped for the Manchester derby back in December but has seemingly impressed Amorim with his response since. Garnacho came off the bench in Thursday’s 2-0 Europa League win over FCSB, setting up Kobbie Mainoo’s goal. United secured their automatic place in the last 16 of the competition and are now looking to translate that form to the Premier League, where they have lost just one of their last four games. The Red Devils start the weekend 12th in the table, but Amorim is hoping he can have an impact on Sunday. “He changed right away since that game against Manchester City, the way he understands things, he understands that I just want to help him, and I just want to win games,” Amorim said. “He changed in everything – the approach when I talk to him, the way he recovers, he understands sometimes I’m a different coach and that I’m demanding in my way. He understands [now] that it’s never in a bad way – it’s always for him. “I think all the merit is for Garnacho. He is improving, and we want to continue to improve with Garnacho.” VIVA GARNACHO #MUFC pic.twitter.com/9byBNkpgkM — Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 31, 2025 Palace, meanwhile, are looking to bounce back after suffering a 2-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend, which ended a five-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League. A win on Sunday would see them leapfrog United in the table, but Oliver Glasner confirmed his side have been dealt injury blows ahead of the match. Cheick Doucoure and Chadi Riad have both suffered season-ending injuries, but the Eagles will also be without the influential Eberechi Eze. “He [Eze] got a knock in the League Cup game [against Arsenal] at the Emirates and since then he’s always had pain, training and not training, playing and then taking him off…” said Glasner. “Last week he almost didn’t train the whole week, and this week it started again. We decided that we want to get him pain-free, so he can perform at his best level, so he won’t go with us to Manchester.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Manchester United – Manuel Ugarte Of players to play 500+ minutes this season, only Bournemouth’s Tyler Adams (4.8) has made more tackles per 90 minutes in the Premier League than Manuel Ugarte (4.5). It is the most by a Red Devils player to play 10+ games in a season since Rafael in 2011-12 (4.8), while it is the most by a midfielder since Owen Hargreaves in 2007-08 (4.8). Crystal Palace – Romain Esse Romain Esse netted on his Premier League debut just 119 seconds after coming on against Brentford last time out. The 19-year-old is looking to become only the fourth teenager to score in his first two appearances, after Alan Smith for Leeds in 1998, Federico Macheda for Man Utd in 2009 and Anthony Martial for Man Utd in 2015. Old Trafford #CPFC pic.twitter.com/L6y9nRuYHM — Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) January 29, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: MANCHESTER UNITED WIN United have won two of their last three Premier League games (L1), more than in their previous seven combined (W1 D1 L5). Ruben Amorim is looking for consecutive wins for the first time in his 13th game in charge, with Tommy Docherty in 1972-73 the last United manager to have as long a wait for back-to-back league wins from the start of his reign (14th game). However, United have failed to score in any of their last three Premier League games against Palace – they last went four league games without a goal against an opponent between 1981 and 1983 (vs Arsenal). Palace have won five of their last 11 Premier League games against United (D3 L3), having been winless in 22 league games against them before this (D4 L18). Having won just two of their first 22 away league games against Manchester United between 1922 and 2018 (D3 L17), the Eagles have now won three of their last five visits to Old Trafford (L2). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Manchester United – 46.2% Draw – 26.1% Crystal Palace – 27.7%",
