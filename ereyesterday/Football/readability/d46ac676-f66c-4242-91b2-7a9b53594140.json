  "text": "Kylian Mbappe was pictured by Real Madrid during an individual recovery programme amid growing questions over his France absence. Madrid released a statement on Monday to update on the forward’s recovery from a muscle issue that kept him out of France’s October internationals squad. Questions had persisted from reports in France after Mbappe was spotted in a Swedish nightclub on Thursday, when Didier Deschamps’ side hammered Israel. Deschamps insisted the matter was not an issue to discuss, though speculation remains over Mbappe’s commitment to France, with reports suggesting he is prioritising Madrid and a potential Ballon d’Or. Los Blancos seemingly sought to quash any growing murmurs of discontent by confirming Mbappe’s appearance at the club before France’s 2-1 win over Belgium in Brussels. “Kylian Mbappe continues to work on his individual fitness plan,” a short club statement read. “The forward is working on his own as he tries to recover fully from the discomfort in the biceps femoris of his left leg. “He trained on his own in the gym and out on the pitch at Real Madrid City, under the guidance of Antonio Pintus, who is in charge of the club’s physical preparation.” Mbappé, Courtois and Lunin carry out individual work at Real Madrid City.#RMCity — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) October 14, 2024 Mbappe subsequently posted a picture on Instagram of him in the Madrid gym, captioned “back to work” as the former Paris Saint-Germain forward continues his recovery. The 25-year-old was joined by goalkeeping pair Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin before more of Carlo Ancelotti’s squad return from international football on Tuesday. Deschamps’ men did not feel Mbappe’s absence, however, as Randal Kolo Muani’s brace secured the vital victory over Belgium to boost their top-two hopes in the Nations League.",
