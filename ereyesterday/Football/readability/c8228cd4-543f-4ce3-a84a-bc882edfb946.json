  "text": "FC Cincinnati praised the work Gregg Berhalter has done since joining Chicago Fire ahead of the sides’ meeting in MLS on Saturday. Cincinnati have made an impressive start to the 2025 season, and sit third in the Eastern Conference, just two points behind early leaders Columbus Crew. They are currently on a four-match unbeaten streak, winning each of their last three outings, and have suffered just two defeats in the league so far. But Noonan acknowledged the challenge posed by Chicago, who he believes have adapted well to life under Berhalter. “Gregg’s done a really good job. You can see ideas, you know, evolving, getting better,” Noonan said. “The results, obviously, you know, have been pretty good if you’re talking about a new coach with a bunch of new players. “We have to be prepared for a variety of ways that the front three will apply pressure, how the central players are pressing the ball. So that’ll be a good challenge.” Green team brought out a custom trophy pic.twitter.com/5NTXAyKDJt — FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) April 18, 2025 Chicago are eighth in the table, just four points behind Saturday’s opponents, having also lost just two of their first eight matches this season. They go into this game winless in three, though held Inter Miami to a 0-0 draw in their last outing. Berhalter was pleased with that performance, despite the lack of goals, and highlighted how proud he is of the team’s development under him so far. “I’ve been saying consistently since I’ve been here that you can win every game and lose every game,” he said. “No matter who the opponent is, we can put in a performance to beat them, but sometimes it doesn’t work that way. “For us, it’s really about trying to get better throughout this year and if we keep doing that, we’ll be playing soccer.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Chicago Fire – Chris Brady Chicago’s scoreless draw with Inter Miami on Saturday was the club’s first clean sheet since a 1-0 win over FC Cincinnati last July, with Chris Brady finally able to enjoy a shutout.
