Embarking on what has become a real fairytale this season, Nuno Espirito Santo’s men have continued to break a string of records and remarkably find themselves sat in the driving seat to punch an iconic Champions League ticket this season. While Ipswich might have made their famous Premier League return this season, the Blues have a major battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their top-flight status come May. In what could prove to be a season-defining battle for both camps, we have taken a look at the best Ipswich vs Nottingham Forest Bet Builder Tips. Forest looking to lay down another top-four marker While Nottingham Forest might have spent the whole of last season scrapping it out at the foot of the Premier League table, Saturday’s guests have come roaring back in a sensational fashion and have underlined their status as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages this time around. Last seen securing a late 1-0 victory against Manchester City, Santo’s men are simply looking to take another giant leap towards a famous Champions League spot come May. Extending on their FA Cup adventure earlier in the month as they edged past Ipswich following a nail-biting penalty shootout victory, the former Tottenham boss finds the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Travelling to Portman Road on Saturday afternoon remarkably sat in bronze medal position, Forest will certainly be relishing a trip to Suffolk this weekend. Despite their recent domestic issues away from the City Ground, Nottingham Forest are rightfully pencilled in as a standout contender and the Champions League dreamers will be confident of laying down another marker here. Bet Builder Tip: Nottingham Forest win @ 12/11 with 1xBet   Hudson-Odoi to extend on his recent flurry Arriving at the City Ground in the summer of 2023 for a reported fee of just £3million, it is fair to say that Callum Hudson-Odoi has already repaid that insignificant investment tenfold over the past 18 months. While the red-hot Chris Wood might have continued to steal plenty of that striking headlines around Nottingham after registering 18 top-flight goals, Hudson-Odoi has also played a leading role in Forest’s Champions League charge. Although the 24-year-old might have been left disappointed after missing out on a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s maiden England squad earlier in the week, the former Chelsea starlet is enjoying a real purple patch. Bagging a famous late winner against defending champions Manchester City last weekend and clearly enjoying life at the City Ground, Hudson-Odoi has now notched three goals in his previous six Premier League appearances. Finding the net away at fellow European hopefuls Newcastle on February 23rd, the three-cap International will certainly be looking to test an Ipswich defence that has continued to show some glaring defensive struggles this season. Bet Builder Tip: Callum Hudson-Odoi over 0.5 shots on target @ 1/1 with BetUS   Time ticking away for Ipswich While Ipswich might have signed off 2024 with a famous 2-0 victory against Chelsea, Kieran McKenna’s side have come crashing back down to earth in a worrying fashion and have a major uphill battle on their hands over the final couple of months. Pencilled in as a leading contender to be hit with an immediate Championship return this season, the Blues have continued to show some major issues and open Saturday’s showdown sat six points adrift of Premier League safety. Slumping to a 4-1 drumming at home against an inconsistent Tottenham on February 22nd, Ipswich have lost their previous three Premier League appearances by an aggregate score of 8-3. Likewise, watching their FA Cup adventure come to a heartbreaking penalties defeat at the City Ground on March 3rd, Ipswich have also collected just a single point from any of their previous eight consecutive top-flight showdowns. It should also be noted, McKenna’s struggling squad have not recorded a sole Premier League victory at Portman Road since opening the New Year.
