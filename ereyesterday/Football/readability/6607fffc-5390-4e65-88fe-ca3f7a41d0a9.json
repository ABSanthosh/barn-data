  "text": "Verdict: Home win Best odds: 29/50 Bookmaker: ZetBet In the opening leg of the Champions League qualifying first round, NK Olimpija Ljubljana will host Kairat at Stadion Stozice on Tuesday. Olimpija secured top spot in the Slovenian top division last season, collecting 74 points from 36 matches, while Kairat claimed the 2024 Kazakhstan Premier League title to earn a place in the first round of the Champions League qualifiers. Olimpija Ljubljana Olimpija secured their second league title in three years, finishing the season as the division’s strongest defensive side, conceding just 20 goals—at least 12 fewer than any of the other nine teams. Manager Victor Sanchez will be concerned by their late-season slump, as his team failed to win six of their final seven games in 2024-25, suffering two defeats during that stretch. The Dragons featured in the Conference League last season and have appeared twice in the Champions League, most recently exiting in the third qualifying round in 2023/24. Since the end of the 2024/25 campaign, Olimpija have played four friendlies, winning three and drawing one, while recording three clean sheets. Sanchez’s men have also been strong at home, winning nine of their last 12 competitive matches at Stadion Stozice and scoring at least twice in nine of those games. Team News Olimpija Ljubljana are likely to deploy central defenders Marcel Ratnik and Ahmet Muhamedbegovic ahead of goalkeeper Matevz Vidovsek. Midfield regulars Diogo Pinto, Peter Agba, and Agustin Doffo may be used as a trio in the centre on Tuesday. On the flanks, Rada Boultam and Marko Brest are expected to support central striker Alex Matthias Tamm. Kairat Almaty Kairat claimed top spot in their domestic league by a single point, though they currently sit second, one point behind leaders Astana with eight matches remaining in the 2025 season. The visitors arrive for Tuesday’s encounter on the back of three straight clean sheets, having scored six goals in that span. Kirill Keker’s men last featured in the Champions League qualifiers in 2021/22, when they were knocked out in the second round by Red Star Belgrade. The Team of the Nation are unbeaten in their last five outings, winning four of those matches. Kairat are also undefeated in their past three away games—securing two wins—but had lost the two away fixtures prior to that run. Team News Kairat are expected to line up with centre-backs Aleksandr Shirobokov and Egor Sorokin positioned in front of the goalkeeper, while Adilet Sadybekov and Olzhas Baybek may operate as the midfield double pivot. Up front, striker Ricardinho is likely to lead the line, supported by Jug Stanojev, Jorge Gabriel Costa Monteiro, and Ramazan Bagdat. Conclusion Kairat Almaty may present a tough test for Olimpija Ljubljana, given the visitors’ strong recent form. Nevertheless, the hosts should still be regarded as favourites due to their consistently impressive performances at home. Verdict: Home win Best odds: 29/50 Bookmaker: ZetBet",
