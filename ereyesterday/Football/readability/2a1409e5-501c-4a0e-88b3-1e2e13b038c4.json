  "text": "Competition: Championship Market: Sunderland win Odds: 8/15 @ Pribet Hoping to find a route into the automatic promotion spots, Sunderland will welcome Portsmouth to the Stadium of Light on Sunday afternoon. Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to winning ways on New Year’s Day as they clinched a 2-1 victory against Sheffield United, Sunderland find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Continuing to receive a string of plaudits from across the Championship, Regis Le Bris’ men are riding what has become a major wave of momentum. Opening up this weekend’s fixtures sat within striking distance of finding a route into the automatic promotion spots, the Black Cats have their sights set on securing an iconic Premier League return in 2025. Laying down a marker of intent last month as they snatched a 2-1 win against fellow play-off hopefuls Norwich, Sunderland have lost just one of their previous seven Championship appearances – a run that stems all the way back to November 29th. Pencilled in as a standout contender on Sunday afternoon, Le Bris’ camp have also gained a reputation for their extended success on home soil. In fact, the former Lorient boss has seen his squad muster 10 points from their last four Championship showdowns at the Stadium of Light. As for the visitors, claiming what was an essential boost earlier in the week as they stormed their way to a 4-0 romp against Swansea, Portsmouth will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. However, while the Blues might have only made their Championship return last summer, John Mousinho’s men are at the heart of a relegation scrap. Opening up this weekend’s fixtures holding just a one-point buffer from slipping into the drop zone, Sunday’s guests have continued to show some glaring issues on the road. Last seen away from Fratton Park falling to a 3-0 drumming at the hands of Bristol City, Pompey have lost each of their last three Championship showdowns on their travels by an aggregate score of 9-1. Likewise, with that rut underlined by a 4-0 defeat against Derby on December 13th, Portsmouth have also collected just two points on the road since the middle of October. Two sides who find themselves battling it out at opposite ends of the Championship table, we are backing a home victory on Sunday afternoon. Bet: Sunderland 8/15 to beat Portsmouth in Sunday’s Championship matchup @ Pribet",
