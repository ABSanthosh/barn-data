Guardiola watched on as Kylian Mbappe’s hat-trick gave the defending champions a 6-3 aggregate victory, booking their place in the last 16. For the first time in his managerial career, Guardiola has seen his side eliminated from the Champions League prior to the round of 16 (this being his 16th campaign). It was also the Citizens’ 13th defeat of the season across all competitions, the most ever by a side managed by the Spaniard (who had previously lost 12 in 2019-20). City were outclassed at the Bernabeu, registering an expected goals (xG) total of 1.38 to Madrid’s 1.82, with the visitors not registering their first shot on target until the 75th minute. “After we conceded the goal in the first action, we didn’t defend well, it was more and more difficult,” Guardiola told TNT Sports. “We have to accept it, the best team won, so congratulations to Real Madrid. Now, we are focusing on the Premier League. “It’s a fantastic team, they deserve to go through. We didn’t deserve it, it’s the first year we didn’t have a good Champions League season. “We have to accept it and fight for next season to be here again. Of course, Real Madrid are contenders to win the Champions League, but there are other good teams around.” 13 – Tonight was Manchester City’s 13th defeat of the season across all competitions, which is now the most ever by a Pep Guardiola side in a single campaign in his managerial career. Unprecedented. pic.twitter.com/pQMFlI8tzI — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 19, 2025 Indeed, Wednesday’s defeat saw Guardiola lose both legs of a Champions League knockout stage tie for just the third time. Two of those losses have come at the hands of Madrid, having lost in the 2013-14 semi-finals and on Wednesday, along with Liverpool back in the 2017-18 quarter-finals. And it is Arne Slot’s side up next for City this weekend, with both teams looking to respond from their midweek results, after Liverpool were held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa on Wednesday.",
