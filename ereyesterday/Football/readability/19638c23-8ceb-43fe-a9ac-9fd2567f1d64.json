  "text": "Competition: EFL Trophy Market: Both teams to score Odds: 5/6 @ Pribet Turning their attention back to EFL Trophy action on Tuesday night, Wrexham will travel to Port Vale. Starting with the hosts, while Port Vale might have endured real frustration over the past fortnight, Darren Moore’s men should still find the mood in their camp at a real high. Despite losing their League One status last season, it is no secret that the former Sheffield Wednesday boss is eyeing an immediate third-tier return this time around. Signing off October with an action-packed 3-2 victory against AFC Wimbledon, they have collected 15 points from their previous six League Two appearances. Still holding a three-point buffer at the top of the table and pencilled in as a leading promotion contender this year, the Stoke-based outfit will be looking to make another statement on Tuesday night. However, seeking some much-needed defensive stability, Moore’s side have gained a reputation for their lively outcomes on home soil. In fact, Port Vale have seen seven of their previous eight matchups in front of their own supporters finish with both teams getting on the scoresheet. As for the visitors, storming their way to what was a famous League One return for this season, Wrexham find themselves at the heart of what has been a public fairytale. However, watching their FA Cup adventure come to an abrupt end on November 3rd as they suffered a shock 1-0 loss against Harrogate, Phil Parkinson’s men are seeking some recent stability. Mustering just a single victory from any of their previous four appearances across all competitions, the one-time Bolton boss should have a real headache over his side’s extended issues away from the Racecourse Ground. Including what was an action-packed 2-2 stalemate against Charlton last month, the Dragons have recorded just a sole win on their travels from any of their last six attempts. In fact, mustering just a pair of wins on the road so far this season, Wrexham have also failed to register consecutive victories outside of Wales since back in April. Bet: Both teams to score at Port Vale vs Wrexham 5/6 for Tuesday’s EFL Trophy battle @ Pribet",
