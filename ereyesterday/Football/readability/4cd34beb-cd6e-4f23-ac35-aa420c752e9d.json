Kaoru Mitoma gave the Seagulls a 29th-minute lead after stealing in front of compatriot Yukinari Sugawara to head beyond top-flight debutant Joe Lumley. Flynn Downes then drew the Saints level just before the hour-mark with a well-taken finish from the edge of the area, netting his first Premier League goal. Southampton thought they had earned a first away victory of the season when Cameron Archer turned home from close range eight minutes later, only to see it ruled out for offside. That decision saw 10 minutes added to proceedings, and Brighton almost found a winner when Mitoma’s cross found Simon Adingra, but his effort glanced off the post. Friday’s draw moves Brighton, at least temporarily, one place behind leaders Liverpool, who play Manchester City in a heavyweight clash on Sunday, while Southampton remain bottom. Something to build on pic.twitter.com/i3oTTZ20Pv — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) November 29, 2024 Data Debrief: Downes does the damage Southampton have Downes to thank for helping them seal a first away point of the season, though he was perhaps fortunate to remain on the field to score, having made more fouls (five) than anyone on the pitch before being replaced by Joe Aribo in the 66th minute. The Saints also ended a run of nine straight away Premier League defeats, with Southampton avoiding defeat in a top-flight away game despite conceding the opening goal for the first time since January 2023 (2-1 v Everton). Russell Martin’s side have now scored in all 13 of their top-flight games against Brighton, the most they have faced an opponent while scoring every time in the competition, while Brighton have only faced Man City (15) more without keeping a clean sheet. Despite the disappointing draw, Fabian Hurzeler is the first manager to avoid defeat in each of his first seven home games in the Premier League (W3 D4) since Maurizio Sarri with Chelsea in 2018-19.",
