  "text": "Verdict: Bayern Munich win \u0026 Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to claim what could prove to be a crucial Champions League victory on Wednesday night, Bayern Munich will travel to De Kuip when they meet Feyenoord. Feyenoord Starting with the hosts, while Feyenoord might have opened proceedings back in August with their sights set on mounting another Eredivisie title charge, Brian Priske’s men have struggled to find any kind of stability. Suffering a late collapse away at Willem II over the weekend as they eventually had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate, the Rotterdam-based outfit have collected just a single point from any of their previous three Eredivisie appearances on either side of Holland’s festive interval. Getting the New Year underway with a 2-1 defeat at home against Utrecht, Feyenoord have also shown some glaring defensive issues so far this season. It should be highlighted, Priske’s side have conceded a pair of goals in all of their previous three consecutive showdowns at De Kuip across all competitions. Feyenoord Team News Both still dealing with respective long-term injury issues, Feyenoord will be unable to call upon the duo of Quillindschy Hartman and Swiss international Jordan Loromba on Wednesday night. While Japanese striker Ayase Ueda might have made a first appearance since the end of October last weekend, the former Cercle Brugge star will settle for a spot on the bench. Now notching nine goals in his previous 11 appearances across all competitions, Mexican marksman Santiago Gimenez will lead the line at De Kuip. Regaining his spot over the past week, Dutch starlet Thomas Beelen should once again partner Gernot Trauner at the back. Bayern Munich As for the visitors, while many around the Allianz might have been shocked last summer following the arrival of Vincent Kompany, Bayern Munich are clearly enjoying life under the former Burnley boss. Leading the chase at the top of the Bundesliga table, Wednesday’s guests find themselves at the heart of a real flurry. Last seen over the weekend clinching what was a dramatic 3-2 victory at home against Wolfsburg, the German giants have now won all of their previous four domestic showdowns by an aggregate score of 14-3. Heading into Germany’s festive break with a sensational 5-1 romp against RB Leipzig, Munich have even been billed as a potential European dark horse in 2025. Looking to skyrocket themselves into the quarter-final spots on Wednesday night, Kompany’s men will be looking to lay down a Champions League marker. Bayern Munich Team News Dealing with a real injury crisis since arriving from Fulham last summer, Portuguese midfielder Joao Palhinha remains on the sidelines. Likewise, still suffering from an ankle issue and not featuring over the past month, former Galatasaray defender Sacha Boey will not travel to Holland on Wednesday night. Once again breaking a string of records this season and notching five goals in as many Champions League appearances, England skipper Harry Kane will spearhead Kompany’s charge. Settling for a spot on the bench against Wolfsburg last weekend, 21-year-old superstar Jamal Musiala should make a first start of 2025. Feyenoord vs Bayern Munich Key Factors to Consider Wednesday’s showdown at De Kuip will be the first meeting between Feyenoord and Bayern Munich since the German giants collected a 3-1 victory back in 2001. Bayern Munich have won each of their previous four Bundesliga appearances by an aggregate score of 14-3. Feyenoord have conceded a pair of goals in all of their previous three consecutive showdowns at De Kuip across all competitions. Likewise, Wednesday’s hosts have recorded just a single clean sheet on home soil since back on September 22nd. England skipper Harry Kane has recorded five goals in as many Champions League appearances this season. Conclusion Enjoying what has become a real flurry on either side of Germany’s festive break, Bayern Munich will know the importance of extending on their purple patch here. Facing what should be a must-win Champions League showdown on Wednesday night, the German heavyweights should be relishing a trip to De Kuip in midweek. Continuing to shine with their free-scoring performances in the final third, Bayern will be confident of cashing in on a Feyenoord squad who are enduring a recent wobble. Verdict: Bayern Munich win \u0026 Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
