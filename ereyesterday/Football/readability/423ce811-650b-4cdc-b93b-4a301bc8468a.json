  "text": "Fabian Ruiz’s second-half strike secured a 1-0 win for Paris Saint-Germain at Toulouse on Saturday, extending the visitors’ unbeaten run and keeping them 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1. The Parisiens, who have not lost in the league all season, top the table with 56 points, 10 ahead of second-placed Marseille, who beat Saint-Etienne 5-1 on Saturday. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in, Desire Doue and Lucas Hernandez all had chances to break the deadlock in the first half as Toulouse struggled to find their rhythm. But none of them were able to find the breakthrough, with PSG needing 52 minutes to hit the front. Luis Enrique’s visitors finally found the net when Willian Pacho’s header crashed off the crossbar and the rebound fell kindly for Fabian, who slotted home from close range. PSG, who won the first leg of their Champions League tie against Brest 3-0 on Tuesday, were comfortable from then on, earning their sixth straight win in all competitions. They will meet Brest again on Wednesday in the second leg of their European play-off. Data Debrief: PSG in elite company PSG have remained unbeaten through their first 22 games of the season in Ligue 1, a feat only previously accomplished on three occasions. The Parisiens previously did so in both 1985-86 (first 26 games) and 2015-16 (first 27), while Nantes did so in 1994-95 (32). All three of those teams won the title. PSG have also gone unbeaten through their last 35 away league games, with only Milan – under the great Arrigo Sacchi from 1991 to 1993 – ever enjoying a longer such run in Europe’s top five leagues (38 matches).",
