The first leg of the Group A/Group B playoff tie will be held at Estadio Enrique Roca de Murcia in Murcia and is scheduled to kick off at 7:45pm UK time on Thursday. Ukraine Ukraine have done extremely well in the UEFA Nations League considering their circumstances. They cannot play their home matches in their own country, yet the players have stepped up to the plate and have acclimatised. Rebrov’s side their UEFA Nations League League B campaign with two victories, two draws and two defeats in their six matches. Ukraine finished second in Group 1, just three points eventual winners the Czech Republic. Ahead of the two-legged toe against Belgium, Ukraine head coach Rebrov. “I believe every game for the Ukrainian national team is of great responsibility. We cannot say this game is important, and this one is not. Team News: Ukraine are likely to line up in a 4-1-4-1 formation against Belgium. Trubin will be in goal for Ukraine. Konoplia, Zabarnyi, Matvilenko and Mykolenko will be the four defenders. Kaliuszhnyi will be the holding midfielder. Hutsuliak, Shaparenko, Sudakov and Zinchenko will be the four attacking midfielders. Dovbyk will lead the line for Ukraine. Belgium Belgium have been a force to be reckoned with in recent years, but things have been hugely disappointing for them for a while now. They failed to get past France in the Round of 16 at UEFA Euro 2024 and are now in danger of getting relegated from the top tier of the UEFA Nations League. Domenico Tedesco lost his job as the Belgium head coach after an underwhelming UEFA Nations League A campaign where they only finished above automatically relegated Israel on goal difference. Former Marseille boss Rudi Garcia has replaced Tedesco, and it will be interesting to see how Belgium fare under him. The one big positive for Belgium is that Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is back in the squad after a two-year absence. The former Chelsea star said: “There were a lot of misunderstandings, half truths, so I was able to explain what happened. The teammates were able to ask their questions. ”I’m relieved that we were able to talk everything out. Everything is clear and now we’re looking ahead. I know I made my mistakes. At that time, I wasn’t mentally 100% ready to play. “After a long season, you sometimes have impulsive reactions and that was not smart of me, that was not the best thing for the team and the supporters. “I still think the football association could have handled it better afterwards, but I also suffered a serious knee injury. I wasn’t ready to play at the European Championship anyway. And when a relationship with a coach breaks down it’s also difficult. “A lot had been written that I left because I didn’t get the captain’s armband, but that’s not true. That’s the biggest disinformation. “I understand it was hard for the fans at the time. I hope that they can accept me again. I understand it’s not easy, but I hope that they will support the team.” Team News: Belgium are likely to line up in a 4-3-3 formation. Courtois will be in goal for the visiting team. Debast, Faes, Theate and Cuyper will be the four defenders. Ketelaere, Tielemans and De Bruyne will be the three midfielders. Lukebakio, Lukaku and Doku will be the three forwards. Key Factors to Consider Ukraine and Belgium played out a 2-2 draw with each other at Euro2024. Ukraine scored 8 goals in 6 UEFA Nations League B Group 1 matches. Ukraine conceded 8 goals in 6 UEFA Nations League B Group 1 matches. Belgium scored 6 goals in 6 UEFA Nations League A Group 2 games. Belgium conceded 9 goals in 6 UEFA Nations League A Group 2 games. Conclusion Belgium have been in poor form lately, and although they have a better team than Ukraine, it is hard to see them win. It is very likely that the first leg of their playoff tie will end in a draw. Prediction: Turkey to win 3-0 Best Odds: 11/2 Bookmaker: Zetbet",
