  "text": "Igor Tudor said that Juventus’ competitveness mattered more than their tactical instructions after their crucial 2-0 victory over Monza in Serie A on Sunday. First-half goals from Nicolas Gonzalez and Randal Kolo Muani propelled Juventus, who had Kenan Yildiz sent off, back to fourth in the standings. Indeed, Tudor became the first Juventus coach to win all of his first three home games with the club since Maurizio Sarri in 2020. It was also their seventh victory at Allianz Stadium in 2025, a joint-division best alongside Bologna. In the top five European leagues, only Barcelona (eight) have more. Juventus provided the perfect response from their midweek defeat to Parma, boosting their hopes of finishing in the Champions League spots with four games remaining. “I always ask for that because tactics and ball possession are fine, but in the end, the one who wins is the one with more competitiveness and wins more duels,” Tudor said. “We did win in a way that I really liked, we stayed in it and even had the chance to make it 3-0. “It is fine, I do not mind winning like this — it helps the boys grow, it teaches them that you can suffer and still make it.” Juventus dictated the game from the off, but entered the interval with a man less after Yildiz was shown a red card for a stray arm into the face of Alessandro Bianco. It was the Turkish international’s first dismissal in Serie A on his 60th appearance in the competition, and it could be a huge blow for his team for the rest of the campaign. No player has created more chances (48) or completed more dribbles (55) for Juventus in Serie A this season than Yildiz, while only Dusan Vlahovic (15) has more goals in the top flight for the Bianconeri than the 19-year-old (six, level with Kolo Muani). “He is a champion — only the really strong ones can play in those tight spaces. Players like him are rare and they have great value. We will figure something out,” Tudor said. “We will find 11 strong players to start, that’s the important thing.”",
