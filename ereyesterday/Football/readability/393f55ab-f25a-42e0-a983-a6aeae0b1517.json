  "text": "Nottingham Forest claimed a potentially valuable point for their Champions League hopes as they drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace on Monday. Daniel Munoz and Anthony Elanga saw good chances go begging in the first half at Selhurst Park, but it was in the second half that the contest really sparked into life. Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels was penalised for a lunge on Tyrick Mitchell inside the box following a VAR review. Eberechi Eze converted the resulting spot-kick to put FA Cup finalists Palace ahead on the hour. But Murillo restored parity with a clever flick off Neco Williams’ low drive four minutes later. Having seen fellow Champions League contenders Manchester City, Chelsea and Aston Villa pick up victories over the weekend, Forest were forced to hold on as Palace ramped up the pressure to find a late winner. Eze sent a curling shot cannoning off the crossbar late on before Eddie Nketiah saw a goal disallowed for offside during a lengthy period of stoppage time. The draw leaves Forest in sixth place, two points off the top five with three games remaining, though they have a big chance to get back on track when they take on relegated Leicester City next time out. It ends level in South London. pic.twitter.com/4Ylm8uIn6v — Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) May 5, 2025 Data debrief: Excellent Eze shines bright Monday’s encounter was a cagey affair that saw Palace’s winless run against Forest stretch to nine league games (six draws, three defeats), with four of the last five meetings ending level. Despite finishing with a dominant expected goals tally of 2.56 xG to Forest’s 0.71, the hosts could not find a decisive second, though it was not for lack of trying, particularly from Eze. The playmaker was a standout once again. His penalty took him to 22 goal involvements this season (10 goals, 12 assists), equalling his best-ever return in a single campaign from the 2019-20 season. He also became the first Palace player since their return to the Premier League in 2013 to register double figures in both goals and assists in all competitions in a single season.",
