Potter worked with Chilwell when he was in charge of Chelsea, and the former Brighton and Hove Albion wants to bring the left-back to London Stadium in the middle of the season. Chilwell has been completely frozen out by Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca. The 28-year-old England international left-back has played just one appearance all campaign.

While Chelsea would prefer a sale, the former Premier League and UEFA Champions League are open to a loan deal. While the Blues are aiming to finish in the top four of the Premier League table, West Ham are only seven points above the relegation zone.",
