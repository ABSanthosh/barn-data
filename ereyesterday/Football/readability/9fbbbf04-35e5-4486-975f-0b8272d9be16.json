Kudus joined West Ham from Ajax in 2023. He contributed to 22 goals in the Premier League for the Hammers, scoring 13 times and providing nine assists. In that same time, only Jarrod Bowen (43) contributed to more top-flight goals for the club. The 24-year-old has both attempted (411) and completed (216) the most dribbles of any player in the league across the past two seasons. He only wanted Spurs. Welcome to North London, Mohammed Kudus. @stonebwoy pic.twitter.com/zllwRvuZeL — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) July 10, 2025 Kudus, who reportedly snubbed interest from Chelsea in order to prioritise a switch to Tottenham, may not be the only big-money signing coming through the door at Spurs. On Thursday, reports emerged that Spurs had activated a £60m release clause in Morgan Gibbs-White’s Nottingham Forest contract, as Thomas Frank looks to bolster his squad ahead of his first season in charge. Spurs are also said to have interest in Yoane Wissa, who thrived under Frank at Brentford.",
