  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 2/3 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to capitalise on their remarkable midweek comeback, Manchester United will welcome Brighton to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Manchester United Starting with the hosts, while Manchester United might have eventually dragged themselves to a dramatic 3-1 victory against Southampton on Thursday night, Ruben Amorim’s will know that they only just avoided what would have been an infamous defeat at Old Trafford. Really riding their luck for large spells in midweek, the Reds will be desperate for a more routine afternoon here. Nevertheless, springing a heavyweight FA Cup upset last weekend as they edged past historic rivals Arsenal, the former Sporting Lisbon boss finds his squad in the midst of a three-match unbeaten run across all competitions. Enjoying their most successful spell since Amorim’s arrival at Old Trafford back in November, United will now be desperate to make up some ground in their attempt to climb out the bottom-half of the table. Manchester United Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Manchester United will once again be without the likes of Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof. However, after serving a one-match suspension on Thursday night, Portuguese defender Diogo Dalot will return to Amorim’s squad here. Bagging a sensational hat-trick in the space of 12 minuets against Southampton earlier in the week, the red-hot Amad Diallo will play a leading role. Settling for a spot on the bench at Old Trafford in midweek, England international Harry Maguire could replace Leny Yoro at the back. Brighton As for the visitors, while Brighton might have shown some extended inconstancies since returning from November’s international break, the Seagulls should take plenty of positives away from an eye-catching display in midweek. Securing a 2-0 victory away at relegation scrappers Ipswich, Fabian Hurtzler’s side also found a route back into the top-half of the table. Picking up a first Premier League victory since November 23rd, Brighton will also be excited by their most recent showdown against Sunday’s hosts. Claiming a last-gasp 2-1 victory when they welcomed Manchester United to the Amex for their reverse Premier League meeting on August 24th, Sunday’s guests will be smelling the chance to collect another heavyweight scalp this weekend. In fact, Hurtzler’s men have collected nine points from their last four top-flight showdowns against the Red Devils. Brighton Team News Dealing with a recent ankle issue and still linked with a January movie away from the Amex, Ireland international Evan Ferguson is not expected to feature here. Likewise, all still dealing with respective injury concerns, the likes of James Milner, Mats Wieffer and Brazilian defender Igor will not travel to Old Trafford. Finding the net away at Ipswich earlier in the week, former Leeds starlet Georginio Rutter could make a first Premier League start since December 21st. Completing a January loan switch from Atalanta, ex-Everton defender Ben Godfrey could make a first Premier League appearance. Manchester United vs Brighton Key Factors to Consider When Manchester United and Brighton met for their reverse Premier League showdown on August 24th, the Seagulls collected a 2-1 victory at the Amex. In fact, Brighton have collected nine points from their previous four Premier League meetings against Sunday’s hosts. The Red Devils have not recorded a clean sheet from any of their last 11 appearances across all competitions. Likewise, Brighton have recorded just a single clean sheet away from the Amex since back on October 19th. Five of the last six meetings between Manchester United and Brighton at Old Trafford have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Avoiding what would have been an infamous night at Old Trafford on Thursday as they eventually snatched a 3-1 victory against Southampton, Manchester United are desperate for a more routine outing here. However, hit with a 2-1 loss when they travelled to the Amex for their reverse Premier League meeting on August 24th, Amorim’s squad hold a nightmare record against the Seagulls. With Brighton landing a thumping 3-1 win when they last travelled Old Trafford back in September 2023, Sunday’s guests will certainly ask some real questions.
