The game started slowly, with the hosts not opening the scoring until a 75th-minute Anis Mehmeti penalty after a foul on Sinclair Armstrong by goalkeeper Michael Cooper. The Blades showed great character to haul themselves back into the game, with 18-year-old Ryan One scoring the equaliser in the 86th minute. But things went up a notch in stoppage time when Robert Dickie was given a straight red card for a cynical foul on Callum O’Hare 35 yards out. The drama wasn’t finished yet and with seconds to go, Harrison Burrows smashed home a left-foot rocket to win the game for the Blades. Wow. pic.twitter.com/EVMii3jQVG — Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) November 5, 2024 At the bottom of the table, Plymouth opened a four-point gap between themselves and the relegation zone with a 1-0 victory over bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth. The victory means that Wayne Rooney’s side have dropped just two points in their last five games at Home Park, having lost six on the bounce in all competitions away. It is now four without a victory for Portsmouth, who have earned just nine points in their opening 14 matches back in the Championship. Elsewhere, Middlesbrough responded to their 3-0 defeat at home to Coventry City last weekend by beating second-bottom Queens Park Rangers 4-1 on the road. That was a first victory in three for Michael Carrick’s side, who are one place below the play-off positions and trail only by goal difference. QPR are four points behind fourth-bottom Preston North End, having failed to win any of their last 10 league games.",
