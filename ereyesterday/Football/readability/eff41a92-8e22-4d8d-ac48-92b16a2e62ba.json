  "text": "Competition: Serie B Market: Vila Nova draw no bet Odds: 2/3 @ BetUS Hoping to move within touching distance of the promotion spots, Vila Nova will welcome Operario to Goias late on Saturday night. Starting with the hosts, while Vila Nova might have got June underway in the midst of what was a woeful Serie B rut, the Tigers have certainly claimed a much-welcomed boost over the past fortnight. Last seen putting in an eye-catching performance as they stormed their way to a 3-1 victory away at Ferroviaria, Rafael Lacerda’s men will be desperately seeking a repeat display here. Signing off June and drawing a line under their extended rut thanks to a 1-0 victory against Atletico GO, the former Amazonas boss has seen his squad muster back-to-back wins for the first time since the end of April. Knowing that they can move within touching distance of the promotion spots this weekend, Vila Nova should be smelling a real opportunity on Saturday night. Landing a 3-2 victory when they last met Operario back in August 2024, they are unbeaten in all of their previous seven meetings across all competitions. As for the visitors, while Operario might have clinched a much-welcomed 2-0 victory against Novorizontino, it appears that might have just been a minor boost for the Parana-based outfit. Last seen falling to a 2-1 loss at the hands of Chapecoense, Rafael Guanaes’ side are now at the heart of a relegation scrap. Getting Saturday’s showdown underway holding just a two-point buffer over the drop zone, the former Tombense boss has seen his downbeat squad lose four of their previous five Serie B appearances. Likewise, signing off June with a toothless 1-0 defeat against Volta Redonda, Operario have also mustered just a sole win from any of their last eight matchups across all fronts. Suffering Copa do Brasil heartbreak against Vasco on May 20th, Guanaes’ men have also gained a real reputation for their glaring issues on the road. In fact, Saturday’s guests have lost all of their previous five straight showdowns away from the Germano Kruger. Bet: Vila Nova draw no bet against Operario 2/3 for Friday’s Serie B battle @ BetUS",
