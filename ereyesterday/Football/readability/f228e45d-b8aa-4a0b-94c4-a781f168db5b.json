  "text": "Aitana Bonmati insisted that Barcelona “will be back” following their heartbreaking Women’s Champions League final defeat to Arsenal. Barcelona were hoping to continue their European dominance at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Saturday, but came up short against Renee Slegers’ resilient side. Stina Blackstenius emerged from the bench to strike the decisive blow for the Gunners, clinching Arsenal’s first success in the competition in 18 years. Pere Romeu’s side dominated for much of the contest, ending the game with an expected goals (xG) total of 0.98 from their 20 shots to Arsenal’s 0.64 from their eight attempts. Barcelona had won nine straight matches on their way to the final, thrashing Wolfsburg and Women’s Super League champions Chelsea in the knockout stages. That is a big reason, along with lifting a sixth consecutive Liga F title this year, that Bonmati believes her team will be back challenging for the Champions League next season. “I don’t believe it. I just want to start the game again and do it differently. But this is football. This will serve us to come back stronger next year,” Bonmati told TV3. “We were not as good as we usually are in the first half. We were more comfortable after the break, but I have to congratulate Arsenal for their performance. “They had their game plan, and they took advantage of their chances. “Personally, this hurts me a lot. It’s tough. It’s hard looking at the stands and seeing all the supporters. It reminds me of Turin (when Barca lost their last final). “It’s a dead ball, and we didn’t defend it well. In the other area, those of us in attack have to take our chances. We’re really sorry, we gave everything. Culers pic.twitter.com/MqB6Uf5WOx — FC Barcelona Femení (@FCBfemeni) May 24, 2025 “We were not at our best and football penalises you when you’re not. Now we have to keep working hard and what’s happened in Lisbon has to serve to improve in the future. “A large part of the sadness and frustration I have is for the fans that have come. I am really sorry. We will be back.” And though Barcelona piled on the pressure to try and take the game to extra-time, they had to withstand some nervy moments of their own throughout the contest. Cata Coll made two tremendous saves in either half, first tipping Frida Maanum’s effort from distance over the crossbar before thwarting Blackstenius’ strike from close range. And the Barcelona goalkeeper echoed the sentiments of team-mate Bonmati, suggesting that reaching the showpiece match was an achievement in itself. “We played a bad first half and then when we improved, the ball just wouldn’t go in. That’s soccer,” Coll said. “Reaching a final is always a success. This is not a slump. I continue to completely believe in this team.”",
