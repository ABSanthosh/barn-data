Linfield Starting with the hosts, while Linfield might have put in a largely rugged first-leg performance last week, David Healy’s side did fall to a 1-0 loss in Dublin. In what was their first competitive contest since opening up the new campaign, the Blues will be desperate to dust themselves down immediately ahead of Wednesday’s return to Windsor Park. However, suffering Charity Shield frustration on July 4th as they fell to penalties heartbreak against Dungannon, Linfield are seeking somewhat of a clinical edge in the final third. Signing off the 2024/25 campaign with a 1-0 defeat against Coleraine, Healy’s side have failed to find the net in all of their last three consecutive appearances. However, it should be highlighted, Wednesday’s hosts have not shipped a single strike at Windsor Park in almost 350 minutes of action. Linfield Team News Ahead of Wednesday’s return to Windsor Park, Healy could be tempted to name an identical starting XI from last week’s first-leg showdown. Despite turning 39 last month, Jamie Mulgrew will start in the middle of the park. One-time Brighton youngster Ben Hall will partner Euan East at the heart of Healy’s defence here. Completing a permanent move from St. Mirren ahead of the 2025 campaign, 21-year-old Kieran Offord should get some more minutes under his belt. Shelbourne As for the visitors, dragging themselves to what could prove to be a crucial first-leg advantage last week, Shelbourne will be desperate to finish off their qualifying job on Wednesday night. However, despite making real history last season as they secured a first domestic crown since 2006, Joey O’Brien’s men have struggled to find much fluidity this time around. Nevertheless, getting July underway with a routine 3-1 victory against Cork City, the Dublin-based outfit have secured consecutive wins for the first time since way back in February. It should also be noted, last week’s 1-0 victory at Tolka Park was the first clean sheet that Shelbourne have registered since the middle of May. Appearing to have turned a recent corner, Shelbourne will be desperate to extend on their charge here. Shelbourne Team News Completing a loan switch from Liverpool ahead of the 2025 campaign, James Norris will start at left-back. Former Southampton starlet Kameron Ledwidge will partner Patrick Barrett at the heart of O’Brien’s defence. Bagging a first-leg winner at Tolka Park last weekend and now finding the net in all of his previous three consecutive appearances, one-time West Ham youngster Ademipo Odubeko will play a leading role in the final third. Linfield vs Shelbourne Key Factors to Consider When Linfield and Shelbourne met for their first-leg showdown last week, Wednesday’s guests collected a 1-0 victory at Tolka Park. Linfield have failed to find the net in each of their previous three straight competitive appearances. Shelbourne have suffered just a single defeat from their previous six appearances across all competitions. Five of Shelbourne’s last six appearances away from Tolka Park have finished with under 2.5 goals. All four of the historic meetings between Linfield and Shelbourne have finished with under 2.5 goals. Conclusion Watching Shelbourne drag themselves to a 1-0 first-leg victory last week, we could be set for another nail-biting affair from Windsor Park on Wednesday night. With Linfield now drawing a blank in all of their previous three straight competitive appearances, chances could come at a real premium here. Likewise, with each of the three historic meetings between Linfield and Shelbourne finishing with under 2.5 goals, we are expecting a similar outcome in midweek. Verdict: Under 2.5 goals Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Luckster",
