  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 10/11 Bookmaker: Luckster Two camps who will get their respective Champions League qualifying adventures underway on Tuesday night, Viktoria Plzen will welcome Servette to the Doosan Arena. Viktoria Plzen Starting with the hosts, while Viktoria Plzen might have been frustrated last season as they eventually had to settle for another silver medal finish among the Czech Republic’s elite, Miroslav Koubek’s men haven’t shown any signs of a hangover during their summer preparations. Getting the 2025/26 campaign underway with a dominant display last week as they stormed their way to a 5-1 romp away at Pardubice, the former Bohemians boss will be desperately seeking a repeat performance here. However, despite signing off last season with a routine 4-1 victory against Jablonec, Plzen know the importance of claiming some crucial defensive steel. It should be highlighted, Tuesday’s hosts have recorded just a single clean sheet from any of their previous 10 competitive appearances across all competitions. Viktoria Plzen Team News Both missing out away at Pardubice last week, Plzen are once again expected to be without the duo of Lukas Hejda and one-time Marseille youngster Check Souare on Tuesday night. Getting the new campaign underway with a domestic brace last time out, former Burnley marksman Matej Vydra will play a leading role in the final third and shoulder plenty of Plzen’s goalscoring threat. Completing a permanent switch to the Doosan Arena this summer, Tomas Ladra should make his European debut here. Servette As for the visitors, while Servette might travel to the Czech Republic on Tuesday night pencilled in as a real underdog contender, the Maroons have enjoyed an impressive summer flurry. Signing off their pre-season preparations with consecutive 3-2 victories against Xamax and French outfit St. Etienne, Thomas Haberil’s men should find the mood in their camp at a real high high. Making real history last season as they clinched a silver medal finish among Switzerland’s elite, Tuesday’s guests have also enjoyed a real free-scoring run in the final third. However, drawing a line under the 2024/25 campaign with an action-packed 3-3 stalemate against Lausanne, Servette have shown their own respective struggles at the back. In fact, Haberil’s side have registered just a single clean sheet across any competition since the end of March. Servette Team News Completing a free switch from Italian outfit Salernitana this summer, Dylan Bronn should make his Servette debut on Tuesday night. Enjoying a sensational domestic campaign last season and registering 24 direct goal contributions, one-time Sevilla midfielder Miroslav Stevanovic will play a leading role here. Returning from a muscle injury earlier in the month, veteran defender Steve Rouiller will be part of Servette’s travelling squad in midweek. Former France U21 international Yoan Severin will start at the heart of Haberil’s defence. Viktoria Plzen vs Servette Key Factors to Consider Opening the 2025/26 campaign with a 5-1 victory away at Pardubice last week, Viktoria Plzen have recorded at least a pair of goals in 10 of their previous 12 appearances across all competitions. Tuesday’s hosts have recorded just a single competitive clean sheet since the start of April. Servette’s final three domestic appearances last season produced 18 goals at both ends of the pitch. The Maroons have recorded just a sole clean sheet from their previous nine matchups across all competitions. Tuesday’s guests have also seen six of their previous seven competitive appearances finish with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Two camps who will know the importance of claiming their own respective first-leg advantages on Tuesday night, we could be treated to an enjoyable Champions League battle. Watching Viktoria Plzen open up the 2025/26 campaign with a thumping 5-1 victory away at Pardubice, the midweek hosts certainly picked up some perfect momentum. It should also be noted, with Servette seeing six of their final seven appearances last season finish with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome here. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 10/11 Bookmaker: Luckster",
