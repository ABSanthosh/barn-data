  "text": "Competition: NPL NNSW Market: Weston Bears win Odds: 2/3 @ 1xBet Meeting for the second time in the space of a few days, the Weston Bears will welcome Lambton to the Rockwell Automation Park on Wednesday morning. Starting with the hosts, while Weston might have got the 2025 campaign underway with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Charlestown, Kew Jaliens’ side have come roaring back in some style. Skyrocketing their way up the NPL NNSW standings, the Bears will simply be looking to make another statement here. Last seen over the weekend breezing their way to a 4-1 romp away at Lambton, the one-time Netherlands international will be seeking a repeat performance here. Comfortably sat in bronze medal position and pencilled in as a standout contender on Wednesday morning, Weston have won all of their previous five consecutive appearances. With their purple patch underlined by a 5-0 victory against New Lambton on June 21st, Jaliens’ camp have also continued to impress with their free-scoring performances in the final third. Notching 17 goals on that five-match winning run, Weston also hold the second-best attacking tally in the division. As for the visitors, blown away at the hands of Weston last weekend as they fell to that 4-1 drumming on home soil, Lambton will be bracing themselves for another monumental challenge here. Drastically struggling to find any kind of stability since opening up the 2025 campaign and sat in NPL NNSW limbo, David Tanchevski’s downbeat squad have registered just a single victory from any of their previous six consecutive appearances. Likewise, winning just a trio of their last 14 outings – a rut that stems all the way back to February 16th – Wednesday’s guests have also shown some extended defensive struggles. Including a 2-1 loss against Broadmeadow on June 24th, the Jaffas have shown some glaring defensive issues. Mustering just a sole clean sheet since the end of April, we are backing what could be an enjoyable home victory at the Rockwell Automation Park. Bet: Weston Bears 2/3 to beat Lambton in Wednesday’s NPL NNSW matchup @ 1xBet",
