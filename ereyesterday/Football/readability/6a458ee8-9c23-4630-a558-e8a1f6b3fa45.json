United sit 13th in the table on 37 points and could move up with a win, as Crystal Palace are not playing until Wednesday. Amorim’s side are currently on a four-match unbeaten streak in the top-flight and are looking for back-to-back wins for the first time this season, having beaten Leicester City 3-0 before the international break. Amorim also confirmed the returns of Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro from injury, and with other players due back soon, he is confident heading into the final nine games of the league season. “You can say I am really confident,” he said. “I feel the players are more confident, the energy is different. But I also know that can change with results. “We are focused on maintaining the energy. Even winning the games, we can acknowledge that we have a lot to improve. But we are in a different moment, more confident, and we are ready for the final two months of the season. “I don’t know which place we are going to finish, but we are looking up, and we want to win games.” Matchday loading #MUFC pic.twitter.com/xFhuV28Atp — Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 31, 2025 Forest, meanwhile, are third in the Premier League table, with a six-point cushion over fifth-placed Manchester City. They are also just four points behind Arsenal in second. Forest booked their place in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, edging past Brighton on penalties to set up a Wembley date against Man City. Nuno Espirito Santo says the celebrations have already finished though, as Forest look to try and cement their place in the Champions League next season. “It was beautiful – everybody enjoyed,” he said. “The fans enjoyed it, and that is more important than anything. But it lasts so short, and here we are again, focused on the game. “We are delighted [with the league position]. We are delighted that we’re going to play more matches and to have chances to perform, to improve and to grow as a club and a squad.” They were without Chris Wood for that game, with Nuno issuing a positive update on his recovery from injury, though it is not clear if he will be available to face United. PLAYERS TO WATCH Nottingham Forest – Morgan Gibbs-White Morgan Gibbs-White has assisted a goal in both of Forest’s last two Premier League games. The only players to assist a goal in three successive appearances for the club in the competition are Steve Stone (April 1995), Ian Woan (November 1995), Gibbs-White himself (April 2024), and Anthony Elanga (January 2025). Manchester United – Bruno Fernandes Bruno Fernandes has scored (three goals) or assisted (three assists) a goal in each of his last four Premier League games for United. Only twice before has he had a longer run of goal involvements in the competition: five appearances from February to June 2020 and six from December 2022 to February 2023. Focus turns to tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/IdCFsxiPWg — Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) March 31, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: NOTTINGHAM FOREST WIN Following their 3-2 win at Old Trafford in December, Forest are looking to complete their first league double over United since 1991-92 under Brian Clough. Forest also won this exact fixture 2-1 last season, last winning against Man Utd at the City Ground in consecutive league campaigns in 1988-89 and 1989-90. Indeed, United have lost their last two Premier League games against the Tricky Trees, more than they had in their first 13 beforehand (W10 D2 L1). After their 3-0 win at Leicester City, United are looking to win back-to-back Premier League games this season for the first time and back-to-back away league games for the first time since winning three in a row in February 2024. However, they face a tough test as Forest are unbeaten in their last eight home league games, winning six of them (D2), which is as many wins as their previous 24 at the City Ground beforehand (W6 D7 L11). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Nottingham Forest – 42.9% Draw – 26.1% Manchester United – 31.1%",
