Starting with the hosts, while Havant \u0026 Waterlooville might have opened November with back-to-back defeats, the Hawks certainly claimed a welcomed boost last weekend. Extending on their FA Trophy adventure as they clinched a 2-1 victory away at Welling, Shaun North’s men will be looking to use that performance as a platform to build on. Still dreaming of the chance to book an immediate National League South return this season, the Hampshire-based outfit can move within touching distance of the play-off places on Wednesday night. Despite their extended issues on the road, the midweek hosts will be excited to make a return to Westleigh Park here. Last seen in front of their own supporters storming their way to a sensational 5-2 romp against Hanwell Town, they have collected 10 points from their last four showdowns in Hampshire. Likewise, North’s camp are unbeaten in all of their previous nine straight showdowns at Westleigh Park across all competitions. As for the visitors, opening the new campaign with a nightmare 6-0 drumming away at Merthyr Town on August 10th, Tiverton have endured a real struggle this season. Battling it out in the relegation zone and with an uphill battle on their hands, Rob Dray’s side have put just 13 points on the board from a possible 48. Last seen falling to a 2-1 loss at home against Hanwell Town, the Yellows have recorded just a sole victory from any of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Suffering penalties heartbreak on October 5th as they watched their FA Cup adventure come to an end against Dorchester, Tiverton will be more than aware that they have another stern examination on their hands on Wednesday night. Pencilled in as a landslide underdog here, the Devon-based outfit should also be concerned by their extended issues on the road. In fact, continuing on from last season, Dray’s side have registered just a sole victory on their travels since the middle of April. Bet: Havant \u0026 Waterlooville 2/3 to beat Tiverton in Wednesday’s Southern League Premier South matchup @ 1xBet",
