The visitors had gone a goal down after a defensive mistake by Joe Allen in the 91st minute, but they scrambled an equaliser through David Brooks just five minutes later. “A rollercoaster of emotions. A game we were more in control of than I thought we would be. I really liked us, I thought we were really good,” Bellamy told BBC Sport’s Match of the Day. “We knew they’d play for set-plays and we kept giving away free-kicks and a corner. Then we made a mistake and they scored, but even then I didn’t feel it was over. “When I found out the minute we equalised, I thought ‘wow’. What an incredible group, eh? We didn’t deserve to get nothing from the game, no way. “I thought North Macedonia would be more on the front foot, but they were five at the back. I will have to go through the game again. My main reaction? Probably shock, still. “But we definitely didn’t deserve to lose the game.” The point leaves Wales second in Group J on four points, level with leaders North Macedonia, though favourites Belgium are yet to play. FT | 1-1 A dramatic ending in Skopje! Four points to kick off our @FIFAWorldCup qualifying campaign https://t.co/iszTrkYgs5 pic.twitter.com/beeNEVo3vr — Wales (@Cymru) March 25, 2025 Bellamy seemed satisfied with their return from the year’s first international break, but he thinks there is more to come from his players. “I’d have liked six points. This game didn’t work out as hard as I expected it to be,” he said. “But if you’d have offered me four points earlier in the week, I don’t know. I have a feeling with this group. There could be something more coming from them and I’m quite excited about that.” Goalscorer Brooks was pleased to get the equaliser but also thought Wales’ performance merited more than the solitary point they earned in Skopje. “The performance from the lads before I came on was absolutely fantastic. We probably deserved more from the game, but we’ll take a point from where we were with a minute to go,” he said. “We’re a good group with a lot of quality and I think we showed that today. It would’ve been very unjust if they’d walked away with three points, so we’re going to have to dust ourselves off and take the point. “There were a lot of positives in that performance to show we should’ve won the game, it’s just the final little details. “We should’ve got a goal earlier, but with a minute to go you take the point and go home happy.”",
