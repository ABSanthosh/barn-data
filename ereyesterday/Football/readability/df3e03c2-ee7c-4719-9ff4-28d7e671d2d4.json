The visitors lost Paulo Dybala to injury in the first half at Estadio do Dragao but led at the break when Alexis Saelemaekers’ cross deflected into the path of Celik, who drilled home. Moura slammed in a second-half leveller following a swift breakaway against the run of play, and Roma had to hold on with 10 men when Bryan Cristante pulled down Fabio Vieira to earn a cheap second yellow card. AZ hammered Galatasaray 4-1 to take a healthy lead to Istanbul. Sven Mijnans’ superb free-kick was cancelled out by Roland Sallai’s exquisite equaliser from range, but Troy Parrott’s penalty put AZ back in front before the break. AZ put on a show #UEL pic.twitter.com/X3t7Hmr4sk — UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) February 13, 2025 Kaan Ayhan’s cheap red card for a second bookable offence had Gala up against it, and Jordy Clasie and David Wolfe turned the screw to leave AZ with one foot in the last 16. Fellow Eredivisie side FC Twente scored a last-gasp penalty through Ricky van Wolfswinkel to defeat Bodo/Glimt 2-1 ahead of the return leg in Norway. Visiting captain Patrick Berg had cancelled out Sayfallah Ltaief’s excellent solo opener with their first shot on target, but they were denied by the late drama. FCSB fought back to beat PAOK 2-1 in Thessaloniki, the hosts hindered by Taison’s red card on the stroke of half-time. Substitutes Andrei Gheorghita and Joyskim Dawa were on target in the second half to cancel out Mbwana Samatta’s opener.",
