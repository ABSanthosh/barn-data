  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet In what is a heavyweight Club World Cup showdown on Tuesday night, Real Madrid and Juventus will meet at the Hard Rock Stadium. Real Madrid Starting with Real Madrid, while Los Blancos might have got Xabi Alonso’s tenure underway with a 1-1 stalemate against Al-Hilal on June 18th, the former Bayer Leverkusen boss has seen his new squad come roaring back in some style. Clinching top spot in Group H and putting seven points on the board, the Spanish giants have also found a recent clinical edge in the final third. Signing off their group stage adventure with a routine 3-0 romp against Salzburg, Alonso will be calling on his squad to collect a real heavyweight European scalp on Tuesday night. With the one-time Liverpool midfielder desperate to claim an immediate piece of silverware this summer, Real Madrid have also now recorded at least a pair of goals in eight of their previous nine appearances across all competitions. Real Madrid Team News Shown a straight red card in the opening exchanges against Pachuca on June 22nd, 22-year-old defender Raul Asencio will once again miss out through suspension on Tuesday night. All still dealing with respective injury issues, Real Madrid will also be unable to call upon the likes of Ferland Mendy, David Alaba and Dani Carvajal. However, in what could prove to be a real boost here, French skipper Kylian Mbappe could make a full return. Completing what was a controversial switch from boyhood club Liverpool this summer, England international Trent Alexander-Arnold will start at right-back. Juventus As for Juventus, eventually signing off their respective group stage adventure with an action-packed 5-2 loss against Manchester City, the Old Lady will be seeking an immediate response here. Nevertheless, clinching a knockout stage spot this summer and getting proceedings underway with a 5-0 romp against Al-Ain on June 19th, Igor Tudor has made a largely successful start to life in Turin. Arriving back in March and clinching another essential Champions League finish, the Italian heavyweights will now be hoping to find some much-welcomed defensive stability. Despite signing off their domestic campaign with a dramatic 3-2 victory away at Venezia on May 25th, Juventus have mustered just a trio of clean sheets from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions since returning from March’s international break. Juventus Team News Not making a single appearance so far this calendar year, Colombian international Juan Cabal has not travelled over to the United States this summer. Handed a full break against Manchester City last week, the attacking duo of Randal Kolo Muani will be handed a full recall on Tuesday night. Expected to complete a move away from Turin this summer, former Aston Villa star Douglas Luis will have to settle for another spot on the bench. Making his switch from Newcastle a permanent one this summer, Lloyd Kelly will start at the heart of Juve’s defence in Miami. Real Madrid vs Juventus Key Factors to Consider When Real Madrid and Juventus last met back in August 2023, the Old Lady collected a 3-1 friendly victory. Los Blancos recorded at least a pair of goals in eight of their previous nine appearances across all competitions. Juventus’ three group stage appearances this summer have produced 17 goals at both ends of the pitch. The Old Lady have mustered just a trio of clean sheets from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions since returning from March’s international break. Nine of the last 11 meetings between Real Madrid and Juventus have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Watching Juventus get hit with an action-packed 5-2 loss against Manchester City last week, neutrals will be hoping for another Club World Cup thriller on Tuesday night. While the Italian giants might have only recorded a trio of clean sheets since returning from March’s international break, Juve have gained a reputation for their lively outcomes. With their three group stage appearances producing 17 goals at both ends of the pitch, chances could come thick and fast in Miami. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
