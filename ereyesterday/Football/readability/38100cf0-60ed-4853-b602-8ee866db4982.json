Juventus Starting with the hoss, while Juventus might have shown a string of inconstancies since Thiago Motta’s arrival in Turin last summer, the Old Lady have certainly claimed a welcomed boost over the past fortnight. Getting their Champions League play-off adventure underway with a 2-1 win against Dutch outfit PSV, the former Bologna boss has seen his squad muster three consecutive victories across all competitions for the first time this season. Getting February underway with a 4-1 romp against Empoli, Juventus will now be hoping to find some crucial defensive steel. Including a 2-1 defeat at the hands of title contenders Napoli last month, Sunday’s hosts have recorded just a sole Serie A clean sheet since way back on November 23rd. Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat outside the Champions League spots, the Turin-based outfit will be desperate to collect a heavyweight scalp on home soil. Juventus Team News All still dealing with respective knee injuries, Juventus will once again be unable to call upon the likes of Arkadiusz Milik, Juan Cabal and Brazilian defender Bremer on Sunday night. Likewise, once again missing out against PSV in midweek, former AC Milan star Pierre Kalulu is not expected to feature here. Making an immediate impact after arriving from PSG on a loan deal during the January transfer window and recording five goals in his first three Serie A appearances, Randal Kolo Muani will lead the line in Turin. Ex-Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luis will be hoping to keep his spot alongside Manuel Locatelli. Inter Milan As for the visitors, while Inter Milan might have fallen to a shock 3-0 loss away at Fiorentina earlier in the month, Simone Inzaghi’s men have proven that downbeat display in Tuscany was nothing more than a minor blip. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway sat just one-point adrift of finding a route back to the top of the Serie A standings, the former Lazio boss has seen his squad suffer just a single top-flight defeat since way back on September 22nd. Cruising their way to a Champions League top-eight finish and signing off their group stage campaign with a 3-0 romp against Monaco, Inter Milan have continued to shine with their performances in the final third. Notching 58 Serie A strikes this season, Sunday’s guests also hold the best attacking tally among Italy’s elite. Inter Milan Team News Forced off against Fiorentina on Monday night after suffering a knock on his ankle, Inter Milan are sweating over the fitness of French marksman Marcus Thuram on Sunday night. However, after serving a one-match suspension earlier in the week, Dutch international Denzel Dumfries will return to Inzaghi’s squad in Turin. Recording nine goals in his previous 12 appearances across all competitions, attacking talisman Lautaro Martinez will play a leading role here. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench earlier in the week, veteran defender Stefan de Vrij will be hoping for a full recall. Juventus vs Inter Milan Key Factors to Consider When Juventus and Inter Milan met for their reverse Serie A showdown on October 27th, the two Italian giants played out a remarkable 4-4 stalemate at the San Siro. The Old Lady have won each of their previous three appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 8-3. Inter Milan have recorded 58 Serie A strikes this season and hold the best attacking tally among Italy’s elite. French international Randal Kolo Muani has notched five goals in his first three Serie A appearances.
