  "text": "Competition: Ligue 2 Market: Paris FC win Odds: 4/7 @ 1xBet Looking to find a route into the automatic promotion spots on Friday night, Paris FC will welcome Clermont to the capital. Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to winning ways last weekend as they secured an action-packed 4-2 victory against Caen, Paris have enjoyed a real Ligue 2 romp. Opening Friday’s fixtures sat just one-point adrift of breaking into the automatic promotion spots, the Blues find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Securing consecutive 3-2 wins against Annecy and Lorient on either side of opening March, Stephane Gilli’s men will be looking to make another statement here. In fact, the former Morocco coach has seen his promotion contenders muster 12 points from their previous five Ligue 2 appearances. Likewise, Paris have won seven of their previous nine showdowns against second-tier opposition – a purple patch that’s stems back to January 18th. It should also be noted, Friday’s hosts have gained a reputation for their extended dominance in the French capital. Pencilled in as a standout contender this weekend, Gilli’s camp have won all of their last six straight matchups at the Stade Sebastien Charlety. As for the visitors, while Clermont might have opened up the 2024/25 campaign with their sights set on securing an immediate Ligue 1 return, the Lancers have endured another public crisis this time around. Once again at the heart of a relegation scrap and opening Friday’s trip to Paris sat five points adrift of second-tier safety, Laurent Batlles’ men have an almighty uphill battle on their hands. Getting March’s underway with a 3-1 loss against Guingamp, the former Troyes boss has not seen his struggling squad muster a single victory from any of their previous 10 consecutive appearances – a rut that stems all the way back to January 10th. In a showdown between two camps who find themselves scrapping it out at opposite ends of the Ligue 2 standings, Clermont should also be concerned by their recent issues against Paris. Hit with a 1-0 loss when they welcomed Friday’s guests to town back on August 30th, we are expecting a similar outcome here. Bet: Paris FC 4/7 to beat Clermont in Friday’s Ligue 2 matchup @ 1xBet",
