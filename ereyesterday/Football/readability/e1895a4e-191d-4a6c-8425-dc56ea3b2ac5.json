  "text": "Verdict: Newcastle win Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to extend on their Champions League charge this weekend, Newcastle will welcome Manchester United to St. James’ Park on Sunday afternoon. Newcastle Starting with the hosts, making real history prior to March’s international break as they were crowned EFL Cup champions thanks to a famous 2-1 victory against Liverpool at Wembley, Newcastle are in the midst of what has become quite the fairytale. Last seen putting in another dominant display as they stormed their way to a 3-0 romp away at Leicester, Eddie Howe’s men find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Marking their return from March’s fortnight interval with a 2-1 win against Brentford, the former Bournemouth boss has seen his squad win each of their previous four appearances across all competitions. With their sights now firmly set on booking another iconic Champions League ticket this season, the Magpies will be confident of laying down another public marker at St. James’ Park. Newcastle Team News Still dealing with another knee issue and not featuring since the start of February, Newcastle will once again be without Dutch defender Sven Botman this weekend. Likewise, dealing with a recent thigh issue, Howe’s men are unable to call upon England international Anthony Gordon on Sunday afternoon. Enjoying what has been another Premier League romp this season and already notching 20 top-flight strikes, attacking talisman Alexander Isak will spearhead Newcastle’s charge here. Bagging a brace against Leicester earlier in the week and registering 16 direct goal contributions, Jacob Murphy will partner Isak in the final third. Manchester United As for the visitors, suffering last-gasp heartbreak away at Lyon earlier in the week as they eventually had to settle for a 2-2 stalemate in France, Manchester United have continued to show some glaring inconstancies. While there might have been plenty of excitement around Old Trafford back in November following Ruben Amorim’s arrival, the Red Devils are firmly stuck in the bottom-half of the Premier League table. Marking their return from March’s international break with a 1-0 loss at the hands of Nottingham Forest, United have won just a pair of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Facing what looks set to be another stern examination here, Amorim’s side should also be concerned by a nightmare record against Sunday’s hosts. Including a 2-0 loss when they welcomed Newcastle to Old Trafford on December 30th, they have lost four of their last five meetings. Manchester United Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Manchester United will once again be without the defensive trio of Lisandro Martinez, Johnny Evans and Matthijs de Ligt. Despite enduring another public crisis against Lyon on Thursday night, Andre Onana will keep his spot between the sticks at St. James’ Park. Making a late cameo appearance off the bench in midweek, England international Kobbie Mainoo should get some more minutes under his belt. Returning from a long-term muscle issue last month, former Chelsea star Mason Mount could make a first Premier League start of 2025 here. Newcastle vs Manchester United Key Factors to Consider When Newcastle and Manchester United met for their reverse Premier League meeting on December 30th, the Magpies collected a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford. In fact, Newcastle have won four of their previous five meetings against the Red Devils. Howe’s men have won each of their last four meetings against Premier League opposition across all competitions. Manchester United have registered just a pair of wins from any of their last eight appearances across all formats. Swedish marksman Alexander Isak has recorded 20 Premier League goals this season. Conclusion Enjoying what has become quite the fairytale, Newcastle will be confident of extending on their Champions League charge here. Crowned EFL Cup champions last month following an iconic 2-1 victory against Liverpool, Howe’s high-flying squad will be relishing a return to St. James’ Park on Sunday afternoon. Last seen earlier in the week storming their way to a routine 3-0 romp away at Leicester, Newcastle will be excited by a dominant recent record against Man United. Including a 2-0 win when they travelled to Old Trafford for their reverse meeting on December 30th, the Magpies have won four of their last five meetings.
