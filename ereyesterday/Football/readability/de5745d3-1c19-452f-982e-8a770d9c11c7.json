With the Championship making its return from March’s international break this weekend, we have 10 second-tier showdowns on the cards. Ahead of what is a stacked Saturday schedule from up and down the country, we have taken a look at some of the most appealing Championship betting tips. Sunday, March 29th BST 15:00 Leeds United vs Swansea City While Leeds might have suffered major play-off heartbreak last season, it is no secret that Daniel Farke’s side mark their return from March’s fortnight interval break pencilled in as the standout title contender. Despite being forced to settle for a 2-2 stalemate away at QPR prior to the international break, Saturday’s hosts do open this weekend’s fixtures leading the chase at the top of the Championship standings. Although Leeds might have notched just a single win from any of their previous four Championship appearances, they have gained a real reputation for their extended success on home soil. Last seen at Elland Road collecting a 2-0 victory against Millwall, Farke’s camp have not suffered a single Championship defeat in Yorkshire from any of their previous 15 consecutive outings. Likewise, it should also be highlighted, the Championship leaders have registered a staggering 44 points from those 16 showdowns on home soil. While Swansea might have enjoyed a minor boost on either side of opening March, Saturday’s guests have drastically failed to find any kind of stability this season. Almost sat in Championship limbo and scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the table, interim boss Alan Sheehan appears to have a tricky test on his hands over the final couple of months. Heading into March’s international break with consecutive defeats against Burnley and Watford, Swansea have won just a trio of their previous 15 appearances across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to December 29th. Losing all of their last four meetings against Leeds by an aggregate score of 12-5, the Swans travel to Yorkshire this weekend pencilled in as a landslide underdog. Tip: Daniel James over 0.5 shots on target @ 8/15 15:00 Burnley vs Bristol City  Although Burnley might have lost their Premier League status with a whimper last season, the Clarets have their sights firmly set on booking an immediate top-flight return in 2025. Heading into March’s international break with a routine 2-0 victory away at Swansea, Saturday’s hosts have certainly gained a reputation for their rugged success under Scott Parker’s guidance. Marking their return from the fortnight interval sat just two points adrift of breaking into the automatic promotion spots, Burnley are remarkably unbeaten in all of their last 25 consecutive Championship appearances. With that purple patch stemming all the way back to November 3rd, the former Fulham boss has also seen his squad muster 13 points from their previous five outings. Looking to lay down another promotion marker this weekend, it should also be noted that Burnley have not suffered a single Championship defeat at Turf Moor so far this season. Embarking on what was a real flurry prior to March’s international break, Bristol City have come skyrocketing up the Championship standings and now have a play-off finish at the top of their agenda. Unbeaten in all of their last seven outings, the robins travel to Turf Moor this weekend with just their goal difference keeping them outside the top-six. However, while the mood around Ashton Gate might be at a season-high, Saturday’s guests will be concerned by their issues on the road so far this season. Facing a real challenge here, Liam Manning’s men have notched just a single win from any of their previous 12 away fixtures against Championship opposition – a run that stems all the way back to November 9th. Tip: Josh Brownhill over 0.5 shots on target @ 19/20 15:00 Norwich City vs West Brom While Norwich might have signed off February with an action-packed 402 victory against Stoke, it appears that might have been just a minor boost for Saturday’s hosts. With mounting pressure on Johannes Hoff Thorup’s shoulders, the Canaries have endured a public struggle since opening the New Year. Heading into March’s international break with a 2-1 defeat away at Bristol City, the Norfolk-based outfit have mustered just a sole win from any of their previous eight Championship appearances. With their extended wobble highlighted by a dramatic 302 defeat at home against Sheffield Wednesday earlier in the month, Norwich have also shown some worrying defensive issues. With their play-off dreams taking a major dent this calendar year, Thorup’s struggling squad have managed to put just a single clean sheet on the board since New Year’s Day. Although West Brom might travel to Carrow Road sat in the play-off places thanks to their goal difference, the Baggies have shown their own inconsistencies. Heading into the fortnight interval with consecutive 1-1 stalemates against Hull and Burnley, the former Blackburn boss has seen his side muster just a pair of victories from their last seven Championship showdowns. Remarkably not collecting back-to-back wins since September, Saturday’s guests have also gained an unwanted reputation for their issues outside of the Midlands. Crashing out of the FA Cup on January 11th following a 5-1 drumming against Premier League outfit Bournemouth, Mowbray’s men are without a win from any of their previous 12 matchups away from the Hawthorns. Tip: Both teams to score @ 8/11 Our Saturday Championship Accumulator: Leeds United vs Swansea City – Daniel James over 0.5 shots on target @ 8/15 Burnley vs Bristol City – Josh Brownhill over 0.5 shots on target @ 19/20 Norwich City vs West Brom – Both teams to score @ 8/11 Place a £10 bet on our accumulator with Vegas Land and pocket £51.65 if all predictions are correct.
