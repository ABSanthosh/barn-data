With it looking like the race for this season’s La Liga crown will be heading right down to the wire, Barcelona will be looking to make another statement in Catalonia when they host local rivals Girona. Ahead of a stacked Sunday schedule from across Spain, we have taken a look at some of the most appealing La Liga betting tips. 15:15 Barcelona vs Girona While some around Catalonia might have been shocked last summer following Hansi Flick’s arrival in Catalonia, Barcelona are enjoying what has become a remarkable purple patch. Marking their return from March’s international break with a routine 3-0 romp against Osasuna, the former Bayern Munich boss has seen his squad gain a fearsome reputation from across the continent. Booking their Champions League quarter-final ticket earlier in the month as they claimed a 4-1 aggregate victory against Benfica, Sunday’s hosts will be looking to make another statement here. With many around Catalonia dreaming of the chance to complete an iconic European and domestic double this season, Barca have now won each of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Crowned Super Cup champions back in January following a famous 5-2 victory against arch-rivals Real Madrid, the Spanish giants have not suffered a single defeat since opening the New Year. Although Girona might have made real history last season as they secured a sensational bronze medal finish among Spain’s elite, Sunday’s guests have come crashing back down to earth this time around. Scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the La Liga table, Michel’s men have drastically failed to find any kind of stability and will be bracing themselves for a monumental challenge when they travel across Catalonia this weekend. Forced to settle for a 1-1 stalemate at home against Valencia prior to March’s International break, Girona have mustered just a single victory from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions – a run that stems back to January 11th. Likewise, enduring a public Champions League nightmare as they lost seven of their eight European showdowns this season, it should also be highlighted that the Blanquivermells have recorded just a single victory on their travels since the start of November. Barcelona vs Girona Betting Tip: Yangel Herrera to be shown a card @ 5/2 with Pribet 17:30 Valencia vs Mallorca While Carlos Corberan might have only arrived at the Mestalla over the festive period, the former West Brom boss has made an immediate impact. Skyrocketing themselves out of the drop zone, Sunday’s hosts will know the importance of widening their buffer over the relegation zone here. Heading into March’s international break with a 1-1 stalemate away at Girona, Los Ches have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous seven La Liga appearances. Securing a 2-1 victory against Real Valladolid earlier in the month, Valencia have also gained a recent reputation for their success on home soil. Including another 2-1 win against Celta Vigo last month, Corberan’s camp have mustered 12 points from their previous five La Liga showdowns at the Mestalla. With the red-hot Diego Lopez finding the net in each of his final three top-flight appearances prior to the fortnight interval, the former Barcelona starlet will be looking to extend on his flurry this weekend. Heading into March’s international break with a 2-1 victory at home against Espanyol, Mallorca have firmly cemented their spot as Spain’s ultimate surprise package this season. While the Pirates might have only just clung to their La Liga status last season, Jagoba Arrasate’s men have come roaring back in a remarkable fashion. Marking their return on Sunday knowing that they can move within touching distance of the European spots, the Palma-based outfit find the mood in their camp at a real high. However, despite breaking a string of records this season, Mallorca have struggled to find much stability since opening the New Year. Watching their Copa del Rey adventure come to a thumping end back in January as they fell to a 3-0 drumming at the hands of fourth-tier side Pontevedra, Arrasate’s side have now won just a pair of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions – a run that stems all the way back to December 21st. Valencia vs Mallorca Betting Tip: Diego Lopez over 0.5 shots on target @ 15/8 with Luckster Sunday’s La Liga Double Barcelona vs Girona – Yangel Herrera to be shown a card @ 5/2 Valencia vs Mallorca – Diego Lopez over 0.5 shots on target @ 15/8 Place a £10 bet on our Daily Double with Vegas Land and pocket £100.93 if all predictions are correct.
