  "text": "Enzo Maresca confirmed that Filip Jorgensen is his first-choice goalkeeper over Robert Sanchez at Chelsea as things stand. Sanchez was dropped from the Blues’ starting XI for their 2-1 Premier League win over West Ham but played in the FA Cup defeat against Brighton last time out. However, Maresca said Jorgensen is set to continue for league duty when they renew acquaintances with the Seagulls in the top flight on Friday. Sanchez had come under fire for a series of mishaps this season, with no player in the Premier League committing more errors leading to goals this season (five – level with Arijanet Muric). The Spaniard has conceded 27 goals from shots with an expected goals on target (xGOT) value of 28.16. His 1.2 goals prevented are only the 15th best in the Premier League of goalkeepers to have made at least five appearances. Quick reactions. @BingXOfficial | #EmpowerTheFuture #TrainingInsider pic.twitter.com/z9UOyAdN1o — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) February 13, 2025 Maresca said of his goalkeeping situation: “I said that the Filip solution was also to give Robert some time to recover mentally and physically. “But the idea is not to game by game change the keeper. “In the last Premier League game, we had Filip, and in the FA Cup, it was Robert. Our keeper at the moment is Filip. “I spoke with Robert a few days before West Ham where I took the decision to play Filip. I never spoke again with Robert. Filip, exactly the same. “They know the situation. This is the situation now and then we will see.”",
