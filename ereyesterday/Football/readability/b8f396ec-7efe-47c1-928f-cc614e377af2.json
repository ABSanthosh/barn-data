Leicester were beaten by league leaders Liverpool 1-0 at the King Power Stadium, with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s 76th-minute strike the difference in the contest. The Foxes have earned just eight points since Van Nistelrooy replaced Steve Cooper back in November, with their poor form at home continuing against Liverpool. Indeed, Leicester became the first team in top-flight history to go nine consecutive home league games without scoring. Sunday’s defeat was also the first league match at the King Power Stadium in which Leicester failed to land a shot on target since February 2023 against Arsenal. Leicester have now been relegated from the Premier League for the fifth time. Only Norwich City (six) and West Bromwich Albion (five) have ever suffered more. “I’m very disappointed that it’s a definite now. We kept hoping and fighting, but over the last weeks we saw the gap growing,” Van Nistelrooy said. “Then you see it coming, although we never gave up, and we shifted the focus towards the future to use these games and finish the season as best as possible. “Next season the Championship will start and it is my job to do the best things possible for the club. “I’m working in the coming weeks, it is my job to do everything in the best interests of Leicester City.” 9 – Leicester have become the first team in top-flight history to go nine consecutive home league games without scoring. Shy. pic.twitter.com/jkuJjn85Rh — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 20, 2025 Leicester have endured a miserable return to the top-flight this season, picking up just 18 points from their 33 games so far this campaign. Only already relegated Southampton (78) have conceded more goals than Leicester (73) in the Premier League this season. And with a return to the Championship now confirmed, Van Nistelrooy conceded that he was unsure about his future with the Foxes. “I’m waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue. It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there,” he added. Conor Coady echoed the disappointment of his manager, suggesting that Leicester’s performances this term have not been up to the standard that the top-flight demands. “We’ve not been good enough all season. I thought we played quite well today, moved the ball well and nullified Liverpool – they’re a world-class side,” Coady added. “But we look back on this season, and it’s not been anywhere near good enough. “We’ve got to look at ourselves as players in the mirror. We have to now, what’s happened has happened. “We have to try and put this club in a better position come the summer because we haven’t been good enough. “We’ve took a bit of stick and we’ll continue to take stick because it’s deserved. “From minute one this season, we haven’t been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it’ll chew you up and spit you out. “It’s something we have to look at because we’re absolutely devastated.”",
