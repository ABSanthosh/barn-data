  "text": "Competition: Europa Conference League Market: FC Copenhagen double chance Odds: 8/15 @ 1xBet Looking to extend on their recent purple patch, Copenhagen will travel to SK Rapid on Thursday night for a Europa Conference League showdown. Starting with the hosts, while SK Rapid might open their group stage finale sat just a single point adrift of finding a route into the quarter-final spots, Robert Klaub’s side are in the midst of what has become a recent wobble. Putting in a downbeat performance last week as they fell to a 3-1 loss away at Omonia, the Austrian giants have come under some recent scrutiny. Despite heading into November’s international break with back-to-back victories against Petrocub and Klagenfurt, it appears that might have just been a minor boost. Heading into the Bundesliga’s festive break with an action-packed 2-2 stalemate against Salzburg on December 7th, the former Nurnberg boss has seen his squad fail to win any of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Opening December with a 1-0 loss at home against BW Linz, the Vienna-based outfit have also put just a pair of wins on the board since the end of October. It should also be highlighted, the midweek hosts have collected just one-point from any of their last three showdowns at the Allianz across all formats. As for the visitors, while Copenhagen might be seeking a minor miracle in the race to collect a top-eight finish, the Lions are enjoying a real flurry. Last seen in Europa Conference League action collecting a routine 2-0 win against Scottish outfit Hearts, Jacob Neestrup’s men will be looking for a repeat performance here. Extending on their Landspokal Cup adventure last weekend as they claimed a 1-0 victory against Kolding, the former Viborg boss has seen his squad win each of their last six straight appearances across all competitions. Signing off November with a 2-1 win against Dinamo Minsk, Thursday’s guests are unbeaten in all of their previous 14 consecutive outings. With that purple patch stemming all the way back to October 10th, Copenhagen will also be excited by their success on the road. Along with collecting 10 points from their last four matchups away from the Parken Stadium, Neestrup’s men have also not suffered a single defeat on their travels since the middle of September. Given what has been a huge recent gulf in class, we are backing an away double chance here. Bet: FC Copenhagen draw no bet against SK Rapid 8/15 for Thursday’s Europa Conference League matchup @ 1xBet",
