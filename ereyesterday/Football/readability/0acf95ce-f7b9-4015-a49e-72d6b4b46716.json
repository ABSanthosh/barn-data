  "text": "Shaun Wright-Phillips has been blown away by Arne Slot’s remarkable start as Liverpool head coach. Slot took over ahead of the season following Jurgen Klopp’s departure. Having enjoyed success at Feyenoord, Slot has hit the ground running at Anfield. He has lost just one game so far, with Liverpool leading the Premier League by nine points, while they are top of the Champions League standings with a perfect record and are into the EFL Cup quarter-finals. Slot’s Reds are averaging 2.3 goals per game, while conceding just 0.6 on average, and former England international Wright-Phillips has been hugely impressed. “I don’t think I have [seen such a strong start]. He’s done tremendously well in so many phases of the game,” Wright-Phillips told Stats Perform. “If you think of Klopp’s style — high-risk, high-energy football — Slot hasn’t changed too much but doesn’t risk the ball as much. “They still play a similar direct style, as we saw against City. It seemed like they went direct more often than in previous games. “He seems to have a great handle on it. It’ll be interesting to see how they bounce back after the Christmas period, which will be tough with Champions League games and back-to-back Premier League fixtures. “He may not be used to playing that regularly, so it’ll be interesting to see how he handles this period.” Liverpool are nine points clear at the top of the Premier League, which is their biggest lead in the competition since they won the title in the 2019-20 season. According to the Opta supercomputer, the Reds now have an 83.7% chance of going on to win the title.",
