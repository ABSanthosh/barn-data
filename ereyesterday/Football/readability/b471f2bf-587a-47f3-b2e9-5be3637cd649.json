The soon-to-be former champions got off to a dream start at the Etihad as Portuguese international Bernardo Silva swept home after just seven minutes. However, with Pep Guardiola making it abundantly clear how important Tuesday’s showdown was in the Champions League chase, City were pegged back 11 minutes after Silva’s opener. With Ruben Dias controversially adjudged to have clipped Jacob Ramsey following a VAR check, Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford calmly converted from the penalty spot and silenced the home support. Dominating large spells after returning from the interval and showing rare signs of their best, Manchester City dragged themselves over the finishing line thanks to an unusual hero. It was makeshift right-back Matheus Nunes who proved to be City’s saviour on Tuesday night as the former Wolves star tapped home from close range following a delicious assist from second-half substitute Jeremy Doku. The Sky Blues have now leapfrogged Nottingham Forest into bronze medal position and currently sit five points adrift of second-place Arsenal. Both camps will now head to Wembley this weekend when they get their respective FA Cup semi-final adventures underway in north London. On a night when Man City claimed what could prove to be a season-defining victory, we have taken a look at the main talking points from the Etihad. City take a giant leap towards a Champions League ticket While Manchester City might have made real history last season as they became the first English club in Premier League history to claim four consecutive domestic crowns, the soon-to-be former champions have endured a public struggle this time around. Knowing that the FA Cup is their only chance to claim a piece of silverware in 2025, Guardiola’s camp have a Champions League ticket as their number one priority over the final month. Snatching what could prove to be a season-defining victory here, Tuesday’s hosts have turned an essential corner on either side of March’s international break. Overcoming what was a real challenge and getting one over on their Champions League rivals, the Sky Blues have won each of their previous three consecutive top-flight appearances by an aggregate score of 9-3. Likewise, not suffering a single domestic defeat since a 1-0 loss away at Nottingham Forest on March 8th, the former Barcelona boss should find the mood in his camp at a season-high. Heartbreak on the road for Villa Despite their Champions League heartbreak against French giants PSG last week, Unai Emery’s men certainly didn’t show any signs of a hangover when they turned their attention back to domestic duties over the weekend. Storming their way to a stunning 4-1 romp against Newcastle and making what was a major statement in the Midlands, Villa travelled to Manchester on Tuesday night confident of collecting another heavyweight scalp. However, although Emery’s squad might have suffered even more late frustration here, that is the only Premier League defeat that the top-five dreamers have suffered since the end of February. Still sat in seventh-place and knowing that their Champions League scrap will be going down to the wire, Emery’s camp don’t have any time to feel sorry for themselves as they head to Wembley this weekend. Looking to claim a first FA Cup crown since 1957, Villa will meet Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon with a spot in the final hanging in the balance. Guardiola’s side find a clinical edge without Haaland Watching attacking talisman Erling Haaland sustain an ankle injury during Man City’s 2-1 FA Cup victory away at Bournemouth last month, many though that Guardiola’s Champions League dreams had been dealt a critical blow. Notching 21 Premier League strikes this season and with only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah registering more top-flight goals, Haaland has now missed each of City’s previous five appearances across all competitions. However, storming their way to a sensational 5-2 victory against Crystal Palace earlier in the month, seven of City’s previous nine Premier League goals have been scored by different players. Likewise, while January recruit Omar Marmoush might have failed to breach Villa’s defence on Tuesday night, the Egyptian ace has made a real impact since arriving from Eintracht Frankfurt and has done a stellar job of filling Haaland’s void.
