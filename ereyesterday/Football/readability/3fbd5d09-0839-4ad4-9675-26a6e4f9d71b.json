  "text": "Despite snatching a late 1-1 draw in Sunday’s dramatic derby against AC Milan, Simeone Inzaghi was left regretting certain aspects of Inter’s performance. Stefan de Vrij scored the equaliser in the 93rd minute to snatch a point for Inter, who had been pushing throughout the game to get on the scoresheet. Federico Dimarco and Lautaro Martinez had first-half goals disallowed for offside, while the Argentinian was also denied in the second half, with that goal ruled out for a foul by Denzel Dumfries on Theo Hernandez in the build-up. Inzaghi’s men also struck the woodwork three times, with Yann Bisseck, Marcus Thuram and Dumfries all striking the woodwork before De Vrij finally got the breakthrough. Two of the last three times in which Inter have hit the woodwork at least three times in a Serie A match have happened against Milan, previously doing so in September 2019. Inter would have gone provisionally top of the table had they beaten their rivals, and stayed there after Napoli dropped points in a 1-1 draw with Roma later on Sunday. “The guys were magnificent, they went beyond themselves,” Inzaghi told Sky Sports. “Unfortunately, they couldn’t go beyond the various episodes. Three posts, three goals disallowed, and a sensational penalty not given. They were magnificent and we managed to level in the 93rd minute. “There is regret, we always want to win and it didn’t happen. Despite the episodes, we did not let ourselves be discouraged.” Inzaghi had sent on all five substitutes with 14 minutes left to play, and one of those replacements, Nicola Zalewski, had only signed on loan from Roma on Saturday. He made an immediate impact, chesting down the ball to assist De Vrij’s equaliser. “He came on well, he has quality and we were missing someone like that,” Inzaghi said. “I’m happy, [Sunday] morning he was immediately ready and will give us a hand.” “It’s definitely been a rollercoaster, [on Saturday] we did everything in a hurry,” Zalewski added. “We tried to make it in time to be available today, it was a lucky game from some points of view but we did well to draw it.”",
