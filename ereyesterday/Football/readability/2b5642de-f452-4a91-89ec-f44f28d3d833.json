Inter Milan Starting with the hosts, while Inter Milan might have suffered major Super Cup heartbreak earlier in the month as they fell to an action-packed 3-2 loss against arch-rivals AC, Simone Inzaghi’s men claimed an immediate response last week. Claiming what was a gritty 1-0 victory away at Venezia, the former Lazio boss has his sights firmly set on shattering more domestic records in 2025. Opening the New Year with what was a sensational 2-0 victory against fellow title contenders Atalanta, the Nerazzurri will simply be looking to lay down another marker here. Including a famous 6-0 romp away at historic rivals Lazio on December 16th, the defending Italian champions have won six of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. It’s also worth highlighted, Inter Milan have won each of their last five consecutive showdowns at the San Siro by an aggregate score of 10-1. Inter Milan Team News Missing out against Venezia last weekend, Inter Milan are once again expect to be without Turkish skipper Hakan Calhanoglu here. Likewise, still dealing with his own respective injury issue, Inzaghi’s camp will also be without the services of German defender Yann Bisseck. Not making a single appearance since the end of November, Francesco Acerbi remains on the sidelines. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench last weekend, French marksman Marcus Thuram could be handed a full recall at the San Siro on Wednesday night. Bologna As for the visitors, while Bologna might have been heartbroken last summer as Thiago Motta mid farewell to Emilia-Romagna, the Greyhounds have once again gained plenty of plaudits. Despite enduring what was a real Champions League struggle this season, Wednesday’s guests are enjoying what has become a recent flurry. Opening the midweek fixtures sat just three points adrift of finding a route back into the European spots, Vincenzo Italiano’s men have gained a reputation for their rugged approach. Despite suffering last-gasp heartbreak against Roma last time out as they opened the New Year with a 2-2 stalemate, Bologna have lost just one of their previous eight showdowns across all competitions. Despite being pencilled in as a landslide underdog when they arrive at the San Siro, Italiano’s side could ask some real questions. Bologna Team News Shown a straight red card against Verona on December 30th, AC Milan loanee Tommaso Pobega will miss out through suspension here. All still dealing with respective injury issues, Bologna will be without the likes of Michel Aebischer, Nicolo Cambiaghi and Morocco international Oussama El Azzouzi. Arriving from Aston Villa last summer on a season-long loan switch, 21-year-old Samuel Iling Junior will be hoping to make a first domestic start since the start of November. Finding the net against Roma last weekend, Dutch youngster Thijs Dallinga should keep his spot leading the line. Inter Milan vs Bologna Key Factors to Consider When Inter Milan and Bologna last met back in March 2024, the defending Serie A champions picked up a 1-0 victory at the Stadio Renato Dall’Ara. Inter Milan have won all of their last five showdowns at the San Siro by an aggregate score of 10-1. Bologna have suffered just a single defeat from any of their last eight appearances across all competitions. Likewise, the Greyhounds have suffered just a single domestic defeat on their travels since the end of August. Three of the last four meetings between Inter Milan and Bologna have finished with under 2.5 goals. Conclusion While Bologna might be enjoying what has become an extended flurry, the Greyhounds couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge on Wednesday night. With Inter Milan continuing to gain a fearsome reputation for their success at the San Siro, Inzaghi’s camp will be desperate to move within touching distance of top spot. Landing a 1-0 victory when they last met Bologna back in March 2024, we are expecting a similar outcome here. Verdict: Inter Milan win \u0026 Under 4.5 goals Best Odds: 20/21 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
