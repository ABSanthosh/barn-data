  "text": "Paris Saint-Germain continued their relentless march towards a fourth straight Ligue 1 title with a 4-1 win over fifth-placed Lille on Saturday, scoring all their goals in the first half. The capital club have 62 points from 24 matches and now boast a 16-point lead over both Marseille, who host Nantes on Sunday, and third-placed Nice. PSG’s waves of attacks forced Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier into several saves as he tried to stem the tide early on. Bradley Barcola scored the home side’s first goal after six minutes, pouncing on a rebound after a Chevalier save from Ousmane Dembele, and from there it just got worse for Lille. Marquinhos doubled their lead by bundling home in the 22nd minute, and just six minutes later, Dembele added a third to all but wrap up the points. In the 37th minute, Desire Doue completed the first-half scoring with a brilliant strike from a tight angle, leaving Lille with little to play for but pride after the restart. Both sides created chances in the second half, and 10 minutes from time, Jonathan David got a consolation for Lille, who stay on 41 points, two behind fourth-placed Monaco. Data Debrief: Flying start does the trick PSG have now scored at least four goals in the first half of 12 Ligue 1 matches since the beginning of the Qatar Sports Investments era. Since the start of 2011-12, no other team has achieved that feat more than three times. With Doue’s goal coming in the 37th minute, this was the first time PSG had scored four goals by that stage of a Ligue 1 match since April 2018, in a 7-1 win over Monaco where they were four up in 27 minutes. With Marquinhos getting in on the act, PSG have now had 16 different goalscorers in Ligue 1 this season. Only Inter (17) have had more different scorers in one of Europe’s top five leagues in 2024-25.",
