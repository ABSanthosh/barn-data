  "text": "Ruben Amorim is adamant Marcus Rashford’s exile is not a distraction for his Manchester United team-mates, revealing he has not spoken to the forward about his recent comments suggesting he wishes to leave. Rashford was absent from United’s squad for the third matchday in a row on Sunday, as they suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth at Old Trafford. Since Rashford made his league debut, no player has scored more Premier League goals for United than the England international (87), while he has also managed 40 assists, which means he leads in terms of overall goal contributions (147). However, Rashford only has 11 goals in 48 league appearances since the start of last season, with his performances under former boss Erik ten Hag attracting fierce criticism. After being left out for United’s 2-1 derby victory over Manchester City earlier this month, Rashford said he was “ready for a new challenge” in an interview with Henry Winter. Amorim has not discussed those comments with Rashford, and he remains certain that his decision to exile him is for the good of the team. “When I feel that it is the right moment, I will change something. Until then I will continue to think about what is best for the team,” Amorim said about Rashford’s absence. “I speak with him every day, not about the interview but about the performance. It’s my decision. He wants to play. He is trying. It’s my decision, only my decision. “I’m trying to do things my way. It’s the only way I know… if I don’t do that, I will lose myself and I will not lose myself. I know what I’m doing.” Asked if the saga could prove a distraction for anyone else at Old Trafford, Amorim said: “It’s not for me. “Not for the other players because everybody is there every day during training, they understand. That is the key point. For the media and for the other people I cannot control that. “But I’m really focused and they know, I’m so clear in my message, everybody in Carrington knows what I’m talking about and what I want from Marcus and everybody else. “So it’s not a distraction for us, maybe it is for the media but that is not my concern.” Rashford appears likely to miss out again when United visit Wolves on Boxing Day. The Red Devils have won seven of their last eight league games against Wolves, though their upcoming opponents are unbeaten in their last seven league matches played on Boxing Day (five wins, two draws).",
