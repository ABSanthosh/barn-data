  "text": "Competition: Championship Market: Watford double chance Odds: 8/15 @ BetUS Two sides who are battling it out in the play-off chase, Watford will welcome West Brom to Vicarage Road on Sunday afternoon. Starting with the hosts, managing to snatch a last-gasp equaliser away at Hull earlier in the week, Watford will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Although the Hornets might have limped their way to a bottom-half finish last season, Tom Cleverley’s men now have their sights firmly fixed on mounting a genuine top-six charge this time around. Heading into November’s international break with a gritty 1-0 win against Oxford United, the one-time Manchester United midfielder has not seen his squad suffer a single defeat from any of their previous five Championship appearances. Likewise, signing off November with another 1-0 victory against Bristol City, Sunday’s hosts have lost just one of their last eight outings – a run that stems back to October 22nd. Likewise, conceding just a single goal from any of their previous three outings, Watford have also continued to shine with their performances on home soil. In fact, Cleverley’s side are unbeaten in all of their first 11 showdowns at Vicarage Road so far this season (nine wins, two draws). As for the visitors, managing to make a much-welcomed return to winning ways in midweek as they claimed a 2-0 victory against Coventry, West Brom must use that performance as a platform to build on. However, although Carlos Corberan’s men might still find themselves scrapping it out in the play-off spots, the Baggies have struggled to find much stability over recent times. Failing to collect back-to-back Championship wins since the middle of September, the former Huddersfield boss has seen his squad win just a pair of their previous 14 consecutive outings. It should also be noted, Sunday’s guests have registered just a sole win from any of their last seven showdowns outside of the Midlands. Facing what could be another tricky test here, West Brom should also be concerned by a worrying record at Vicarage Road. Forced to settle for a frantic 2-2 draw when they travelled to Watford for a Championship battle last season, Corberan’s side have failed to win any of their previous seven straight trips to Hertfordshire.
