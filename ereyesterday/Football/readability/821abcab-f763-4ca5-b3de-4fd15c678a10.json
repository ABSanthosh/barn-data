  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Getting their respective World Cup qualifying campaigns underway on Friday night, Finland will travel to the Ta’Qali Stadium when they meet Malta. Malta Starting with the hosts, while Malta might have endured a EURO 24 qualifying campaign back in 2023 as they lost all of their eight Group C appearances, Emilio De Leo’s men had turned a recent corner. Signing off their Nations League campaign by mustering seven points from their final three appearances, the Reds should find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Including a 2-0 friendly victory against Liechtenstein on November 14th, Malta are unbeaten in each of their last four showdowns across all competitions – their longest unbeaten run since back in 2020. Potentially smelling the chance to claim a famous scalp this weekend, Friday’s hosts will also be excited by their extended success at the back. In fact, De Leo’s side have not shipped a single goal in just over 400 minutes of action. Malta Team News James Carragher, son of former Liverpool icon Jamie Carragher has received a maiden international call-up and is expected to feature on Friday night. Signing off 2024 with a Nations League red card against Andorra on November 19th, one-time Botafogo youngster Gabriel Mentz has been omitted from De Leo’s squad. Making 17 Ligue 1 appearances for French outfit Reims this season, Teddy Teuma will start in the middle of the park and earn a 42nd international cap here. While Basil Tuma might have only made four senior appearances for Reading this year, the 19-year-old has been called up. Finland As for the visitors, officially appointing new boss Jason Friis back in January, it is no secret that the former Augsburg coach has a major job on his hands. Enduring a public Nations League crisis last year and coming under a huge amount of scrutiny, the Eagle-Owls are desperately seeking an essential boost. In fact, signing off their League B nightmare with a 2-0 loss at home against Greece, Friday’s guests lost all of their six Nations League showdowns by an aggregate score of 13-2. Along with failing to muster a single victory on foreign soil since November 2023, Finland have also continued to show some glaring issues in the final third. Along with drawing consecutive blanks on two separate occasions over the past six months, Friis’ struggling squad have also failed to find the net in all of their last three appearances outside of Helsinki. Finland Team News Returning home back in January after joining HJK on a permanent basis, former Norwich striker Teemu Pukki has been included in Friis’ maiden squad and looks set to earn a 128th international cap on Friday night. Making 23 Bundesliga appearances for German giants Bayer Leverkusen this season, veteran goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky should return between the sticks. However, notching just a single strike for League One outfit Exeter this year, Imari Niskanen has been left out and will not feature over the next fortnight. Joining Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabab during the January transfer window, former Leeds star Glen Kamara will start in the middle of the park. Malta vs Finland Key Factors to Consider When Malta and Finland last met back in March 2018, Friday’s guests collected a routine 5-0 victory on home soil. Finland have won their four historic meetings against Malta by an aggregate score of 11-2. The Eagle-Owls lost all of their six Nations League appearances last year by an aggregate score of 13-2. Malta have not conceded a single goal across any completion in just over 400 minutes of action. Finland have drawn a blank in all of their previous three consecutive showdowns on foreign soil. Conclusion While Finland might open their World Cup qualifying campaign pencilled in as a standout contender, Friday’s guests should be bracing themselves for what could be a tricky test. Remarkably losing all of their six Nations League showdowns last year and coming under a huge amount of scrutiny, the Eagle-Owls have also failed to find the net in their previous three consecutive appearances on foreign soil. Meeting a Malta squad that are enjoying their longest unbeaten run since 2020, chances could come at a premium here. It should also be noted, the Reds have not conceded a single goal in just over 400 minutes of action. Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
