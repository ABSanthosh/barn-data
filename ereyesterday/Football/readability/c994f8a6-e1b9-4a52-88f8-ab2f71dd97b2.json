  "text": "Atalanta climbed to the top of the Serie A table after Ademola Lookman struck late to secure a 2-1 win against Milan at the Gewiss Stadium. Only moments after being denied a winner by Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, Lookman arrived unmarked at the far post to nod in a corner in the 87th minute to seal a hard-fought win. With 34 points from 15 matches, Tullio Gritti’s side are now two points clear of second-placed Napoli, who will play Lazio at home on Sunday. Charles De Ketelaere scored against his former club to put Atalanta ahead in the 12th minute, rising highest to head home Marten de Roon’s free-kick. But Milan struck back 10 minutes later when Rafael Leao’s cross into the box was turned home by Alvaro Morata for his fourth league goal of the season. The second half was an evenly contested affair, with both sides creating several chances before Lookman struck the decisive blow to leave Paulo Fonseca’s side seventh in the table.",
