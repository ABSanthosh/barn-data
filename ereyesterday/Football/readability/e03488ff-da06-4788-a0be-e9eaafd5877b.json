Nico Williams had fired the holders ahead in the ninth minute only for goals in either half from Cody Gakpo and Tijjani Reijnders to turn the contest in favour of the Dutch. But Jorrel Hato’s 81st-minute sending-off turned the tide, and in the third minute of second-half stoppage time, Mikel Merino pounced on a mistake by Bart Verbruggen to leave the tie finely poised ahead of the return leg in Valencia. The result saw Spain extend their unbeaten run across all competitions to 17 matches (W14 D3), their best streak since September 2018 (G27 – W18 D9). The Netherlands are, however, unbeaten in their last four matches against La Roja (W2 D2), and De La Fuente acknowledged the size of the task ahead of his players if they are to book their place in the final four. “It’s very difficult to beat a team like the Netherlands. It has been a match of alternatives, as planned,” De la Fuente said. “We knew that it was going to be resolved by details, and so it has been. They are a powerful team. We are very satisfied and even more so after four months without competing. “It is true that their third goal could have come, as well as our second with Morata’s header. It’s going to be very difficult for us to win in Valencia. I have no doubt.” 17 – @SEFutbol is ubeaten in their last 17 games in all competitions (W14 D3), their best streak since September 2018 (G27 – W18 D9). Momentum. pic.twitter.com/m0KAQyiyDe — OptaJose (@OptaJose) March 20, 2025 Thursday’s draw also saw Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen make his debut for Spain, replacing the injured Pau Cubarsi in the 41st minute of the contest in Feyenoord. Though he picked up a yellow card for a foul on Justin Kluivert, Huijsen impressed De La Fuente, and he predicted a bright future for the 19-year-old on the international stage. “It’s great news for us. He has shown that he is an extraordinary player and that he can help us a lot. He has shown maturity and that he is not impressed at all,” he added. Huijsen, however, was thrown into a cauldron of noise after making his debut for La Roja against the country of his birth. He represented the Netherlands at youth level before switching nationalities in 2024, going on to play six times for Spain’s Under-21s before being promoted to the first team. And though thrown in at the deep end, Huijsen relished the chance of taking his first steps in international football in a hostile environment. “At first, I didn’t have a Spanish passport, but when the opportunity arose to get a passport fast-tracked, I made the decision,” Huijsen said. “Spain is my home. I have lived in Spain all my life and done everything related to football here. My childhood friends are Spanish. “Getting called up was already the best moment of my career and playing for Spain makes me really proud, against whoever. “The best players are in Spain, and it’s an honour to be with them.”",
