  "text": "Competition: Serie B Market: Over 1.5 goals Odds: 2/5 @ BetUS Two sides who find themselves battling it out at opposite ends of the Serie B table, Reggiana will welcome Cremonese to the Mapei Stadium on Friday night. Starting with the hosts, marking their return from March’s International break with what was a woeful 5-1 drumming at the hands of Sassuolo last weekend, Reggiana are pencilled in as a leading relegation contender in 2025. Drastically failing to find any kind of stability on either side of opening the New Year, the Maroons have failed to muster a single victory from any of their previous eight Serie B appearances – a rut that stems back to January 26th. Likewise, putting just a single win on the board so far this calendar year, Davide Dionigi’s men have also shown some extended struggles on home soil. Last seen at the Mapei Stadium playing out consecutive 2-2 stalemates against Sampdoria and Carrarese, Friday’s hosts have notched just a pair of victories from their last 10 consecutive showdowns in front of their own supporters. It should also be noted, Reggiana have registered just a sole clean sheet in Emilia-Romagna since way back on October 20th. As for the visitors, while Cremonese might have suffered play-off heartbreak last season, the Tigers haven’t shown any signs of a hangover this time around. Despite eventually having to settle for an action-packed 2-2 stalemate at home against Cittadella last weekend, Giovanni Stroppa’s men have registered seven points from their previous three Serie B appearances. Heading into March’s international break with a dramatic 3-2 victory away at Palermo, the Lombardy-based outfit have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous seven appearances. With their promotion charge underlined by a 4-0 romp against Catanzaro on March 8th, Friday’s guests have enjoyed a real free-scoring run in the final third. In fact, Cremonese have bagged 11 goals in just their last four matchups against Serie B opposition. However, despite smelling a potential opportunity here, Stroppa’s side have shown their own respective defensive issues. It should be highlighted, the former Monza boss has seen his squad ship a pair of goals in four of their previous five outings. Bet: Over 1.5 goals at Reggiana vs Cremonese 2/5 for Friday’s Serie B contest @ BetUS",
