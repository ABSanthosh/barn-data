  "text": "Luis Enrique wants Paris Saint-Germain to focus on building on their impending Ligue 1 title as they look to triumph on multiple fronts this season. PSG thrashed relegation-threatened Saint-Etienne 6-1 on Saturday. With Marseille losing to Reims earlier on Saturday, PSG’s win meant a draw between Monaco and Nice in the late game would have been enough for Luis Enrique’s team to win the title. However, their celebrations over a fourth straight Ligue 1 crown were placed on ice after Breel Embolo’s goal saw Monaco beat Nice 2-1. With a 21-point lead with seven matches remaining, the title is going to PSG, and Luis Enrique has now laid down the challenge for his team, who will go up against Aston Villa in the Champions League quarter-finals and have been drawn against second-tier Dunkerque in the Coupe de France semi-finals. “We are already champions, we have been for a few weeks now. I think we’ve been the best team in the league from the beginning until now and it’s just an anecdote when we become champions,” Luis Enrique told reporters. “We want to win everything, that’s our goal, to compete, win and take every single trophy.” 38 – Paris SG have not lost any of their last 38 Ligue 1 away games (W30 D8), equalling the longest such unbeaten run ever among the European Top 5 leagues (38 for Milan between 1991 and 1993). Insane. #ASSEPSG pic.twitter.com/em5nuxkfqV — OptaJean (@OptaJean) March 29, 2025 PSG are unbeaten in 27 games, meaning they are just five short of matching the Ligue 1 record of 32, set by Nantes in 1994-95. They have also equalled their club record, set in the 2015-16 season. They are unbeaten in 38 successive Ligue 1 away games, equalling the longest such unbeaten run among teams in the top five European leagues (AC Milan, 38 between 1991 and 1993). Ex-Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who led the Spanish giants to a treble in 2015, added that PSG must maintain their intensity and avoid complacency to achieve the same. “We have two months of competition and we’re all playing for titles again, and we have to be competitive in all competitions,” he said. “That’s the hard part. The easy thing is to relax, the easy thing is to drop the intensity. We can’t let that happen.” Luis Enrique also got his wish, with the former Spain coach having told reporters he hoped Monaco and Nice did not draw, so PSG got the chance to win the title in front of their own fans at the Parc des Princes, where they host Angers on April 5.",
