  "text": "Mounting a dramatic comeback at Stamford Bridge on Monday night, Chelsea secured just a second Premier League victory of 2025 as they claimed a 2-1 victory against West Ham. While Enzo Maresca’s men might have found a route back into the Champions League spots, they got off to a nightmare start in west London as Jarrod Bowen opened the scoring in the 42nd minute following Levi Colwill’s weak back pass. However, with the former Leicester boss clearly cutting a frustrated figure on either side of the half-time break, Chelsea dragged themselves level in a controversial fashion as substitute Pedro Neto eventually swept home just after the hour mark. With the Blues having to ride their luck for Larne spells, they got an incredible slice of fortune just minutes after Neto’s equaliser as Cole Palmer’s cross was cruel deflected off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and looped over a helpless Alphonse Areola. On a night when Chelsea found a route back into the Champions League spots, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Monday’s showdown. Chelsea skyrocket their way into the top-four While Chelsea might have once agains struggled to find top gear with much stability on Monday night, the Blues did manage to find a route back into the Champions League spots. Suffering a 3-1 loss away at Manchester City last time out, Maresca had made it abundantly clear that he was simply seeking an immediate response from his squad in west London. Dragging themselves over the finishing line here and recording just a second Premier League victory since opening up the New Year, Chelsea will be desperate to use their controversial comeback as a platform to build on. With it no secret that Monday’s hosts have their sights firmly set on wrapping up an essential Champions League return in 2025, Maresca’s side will now be looking to find some much-welcomed defensive steel. In fact, Monday’s hosts have recorded just a single clean sheet from any of their previous 11 consecutive Premier League appearances – a run that stems back to a 3-0 victory against Aston Villa on December 1st. Heartbreak at Stamford Bridge for the Hammers While West Ham might have been left hugely frustrated on Monday night as they suffered a second-half collapse, the Hammers should take away plenty of positives away from another eye-catching performance. Believing that they deserved to leave Stamford Bridge to show for their efforts, it appears that Monday’s guests are enjoying life under the guidance of former Chelsea boss Potter. Pressing high and more than deserving of their opening goal, they certainly caused their London rivals some real issues and will know that things could have easily gone differently on a different day. Announcing the arrival of Brighton striker Evan Ferguson on a loan deal prior to Monday’s game, the Hammers will also be excited by the imminent return of both Crysencio Summerville and Jean-Clair Todibo. While Potter might not have claimed an emotional victory on his first return to west London since leaving the club in April 2023, West Ham have given themselves a platform to build on. Palmer drags Chelsea over the line again While Chelsea’s second-half winner might not officially be given to Palmer, Chelsea’s attacking talisman was once again at the heart of everything positive that Monday’s hosts produced. Although Maresca’s side might have struggled to find much stability since opening the New Year, the former Manchester City starlet has enjoyed another Premier League romp. Watching his deflected cross drag Chelsea to just a second Premier League victory of 2025, Palmer will certainly be crucial in the Blues’ charge to book a top-four return come May. Already notching 16 Premier League goals so far this season and leading the chase for Chelsea’s Golden Boot this season, Palmer has only continued to cement his spot as the leading man in west London. Turning their attention back to FA Cup action this weekend when they travel to Brighton, the 22-year-old will once again have another pivotal role to play at the Amex on Saturday night.
