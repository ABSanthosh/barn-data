United are one win away from an immediate return to the Premier League after thrashing Bristol City 6-0 across two legs of the play-off semi-finals. Kieffer Moore eased the pressure with a headed opener from a corner by Harrison Burrows, whose set-piece in the second half then teed up Gustavo Hamer to double the advantage with a deflected strike. As was the case in the first leg, Callum O’Hare again came off the bench on Monday to seal the victory and send United into the final, where either Sunderland or Coventry City will await. Wilder dragged his players away from full-time celebrations at Ashton Gate, insisting the job was not finished, though struggled to suggest his squad should not enjoy this victory at Bramall Lane. “I just spoke to the players and said: ‘look after yourselves, look after each other’,” the United manager told Sky Sports. “Then I thought, would I have a beer tonight if I was a player? 100 per cent! You’ve got to enjoy nights like this. “It’s been an incredibly challenging season for us, and to have a night like this at home in front of our spectators gives the boys the boost and the recognition they really deserve.” THIS TEAM. pic.twitter.com/5nvUue6aLA — Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) May 12, 2025 No side had ever progressed when losing by a three-goal margin at home in the first leg to reach the final in any English Football League play-off tie. But Liam Manning’s side came on strong in Sheffield as Scott Twine and Jason Knight offered the hosts an early scare. Those fears were eased when Moore caught Max O’Leary out of position to head past the City goalkeeper, with United never looking back from then on for a record-breaking win. Indeed, the 6-0 aggregate triumph was the largest across any two-legged Championship play-off semi-final in history. “You know what football’s like, one moment can all of a sudden change the complete environment and atmosphere,” Wilder added. “To get through that first 20-25 minutes was key and then we just found a little bit of rhythm, connected with a few passes then, on transition we had a few opportunities, but to get the first goal was huge for us tonight and just settled everybody down. “We’ve done OK over these last two games, so we’ve just got to replicate the situations we were put in. It’s a one-off and it will bring the noise, excitement and everything a Wembley final brings. “But we have to get the balance right, we can’t be too emotional about the game and that’s going to be the biggest task for the players because they are bound to be excited – and rightly so.” United have never been promoted from nine previous play-off attempts in the EFL, across multiple divisions. “Everybody tells me it’s the best way to be promoted, but we’ve still got work to do,” Wilder concluded.",
