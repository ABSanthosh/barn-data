Hungary As for the visitors, while Hungary might have signed off October’s International break with a much-welcomed 2-0 victory away at Bosnia \u0026 Herzegovina, it appears that was just a minor boost for the Magyars. Putting in a woeful performance over the weekend as they slumped to a 4-0 drumming at the hands of Holland, Marco Rossi’s men will be bracing themselves for another monumental challenge on Tuesday night. Getting their Nations League adventure underway with a 5-0 loss away at Germany, Hungary have recorded just a sole win from any of their first five Nations League appearances this year. Enduring a downbeat EURO 24 campaign over the summer as they failed to progress out of the group stage, Rossi’s men couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge when they return to home soil in midweek. Team News Missing out against Holland over the weekend after serving a one-match Nations League suspension, Hungary will welcome back Attila Fiola on Tuesday night. Suffering an injury blow last weekend and withdrawing from Rossi’s squad, Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez will not feature here. While Dominik Szoboszlai might still be waiting to open his Premier League account this season, the Liverpool ace will lead out Hungary in midweek. Making the move to Turkish giants Galatasaray over the summer, former Freiburg striker Rolan Sallai will lead Rossi’s attack. Germany As for the visitors, while Germany might have suffered EURO 24 heartbreak over the summer as they eventually fell to a quarter-final defeat at the hands of eventual winners Spain, Julian Nagelsmann’s men haven’t shown any signs of a hangover. Embarking on what has become a real Nations League flurry, the former Bayern Munich boss has seen his high-flying squad breeze their way to a semi-final spot. Last seen over the weekend putting in another dominant display as they stormed their way to a 7-0 romp against Bosnia \u0026 Herzegovina, the former world champions have collected 13 points from their five League A showdowns. Getting proceedings underway with a 5-0 victory at home against Hungary on September 7th, Tuesday’s guests have also gained quite the reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. In fact, Germany have registered 17 goals in their five Nations League appearances this year. Team News Picking up what was a costly booking against Bosnia \u0026 Herzegovina over the weekend, Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah will serve a one-match suspension here. Likewise, suffering a second-half knock, Bayer Munich skipper Joshua Kimmich is not expected to feature in midweek. Already booking their semi-final spot, Nagelsmann could be tempted to make a handful of changes. However, bagging a Nations League brace on Saturday night, Borussia Monchengladbach striker Tim Kleindienst will be hoping to keep his spot leading the line. Key Factors to Consider When Hungary and Germany met for their reverse Nations League showdown on September 7th, Tuesday’s guests stormed their way to a 5-0 romp. Germany have collected 13 points from their five Nations League appearances so far this year. Hungary have collected just a sole win from any of their five Nations League appearances. Germany have won each of their last three Nations League appearances by an aggregate score of 10-1. The former world champions have registered 17 goals in their five Nations League appearances. Conclusion Already storming their way to a Nations League semi-final spot, Germany will simply be looking to lay down another statement of intent on Tuesday night. Claiming a sensational 7-0 romp against Bosnia \u0026 Herzegovina over the weekend, the former world champions are in the midst of a real purple patch. Getting their League A campaign underway on September 7th with a 5-0 victory against Hungary, Nagelsmann’s high-flying squad will be seeking a repeat performance here. Gaining a real reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third, Germany should be smelling another oppotunity in midweek. Verdict: Germany win Best Odds: 6/11 Bookmaker: Luckster",
