With their La Liga title dreams hanging by a threat, Carlo Ancelotti’s side opened the scoring in the 33rd-minute as Turkish starlet Arda Guler produced a sublime curling effort. Watching attacking talisman Kylian Mbappe bag a quickfire brace on either side of the half-time break, Los Blancos appeared to be cruising their way to all three points in the Spanish capital. However, with Celta Vigo refusing to show any quit and causing Madrd’s defence some real issues, Sunday’s guests dragged one back in the final 20 minutes as Javi Rodriguez tapped home. With the mood in Madrid taking a sudden turn, second-hall substitute Williot Swedberg set up a grandstand finish after grabbing Celta’s second just minuets after Rodriguez’s strike. Celta squandered a golden oppotuniay to snatch a sensational late point as Pablo Duran was denied by former Chelsea shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois who managed to recover after the initial shot squirmed under his body. While Real Madrid might have dragged themselves over the finishing line here, they still sit four points adrift of arch-rivals Barcelona ahead of their season-defining trip to Catalonia next weekend. In what was a rollercoaster showdown from the Bernabeu, we have taken a look at the key talking points. Los Blancos keep their fading title dreams alive Although an official decision might not have been announced, it is widely expected that Ancelotti will be leaving the Spanish capital this summer. Still facing a major uphill battle in the race to defend their domestic crown in 2025, Los Blancos have continued to show some real issues and have come under a tremors amount of scrutiny. Crashing out of the Champions League last month after slumping to a 5-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Arsenal, Madrid have continued to show some worrying defensive struggles. Almost suffering an infamous La Liga collapse here, Madrid have registered just a pair of clean sheets at the Bernabeu across all competitions so far this calendar year. Likewise, the reigning Spanish champions have conceded at least a pair of goals in seven of their previous 10 showdowns in front of their own supporters. All eyes fall on Catalonia next week While Real Madrid might have kept their outside title dreams alive here, Los Blancos will already be planning for what is a season-defining trip to Catalonia next week. Although a victory might move them within just one-point of Barcelona, Ancelotti’s side will be concerned by a nightmare recent record against the La Liga leaders. Suffering Copa del Rey heartbreak on April 26th as they eventually fell to a dramatic 3-2 loss at the Estadio de La Cartuja, Madrid have lost all of their three competitive meetings across all competitions this season. Slumping to a 5-2 drumming in the Middle East as they watched their Super Cup dreams come to an infamous end, Sunday’s hosts have also shipped 12 goals on those three consecutive defeats against Barca. With their arch-rivals embarking on a sensational romp this calendar year and looking to complete an iconic silverware sweep, Ancelotti’s camp will have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders in Catalonia. Celta’s European charge dealt a blow Although Celta Vigo might have gained plenty of plaudits from across Spain’s elite this season, Sunday’s guests are desperate to find some kind of fluidity over the final few weeks. Despite almost completing what would have been a remarkable comeback here, Claudio Giraldez’s side made an immediate return to losing ways and have now been hit with a defeat in three of their previous four La Liga appearances. Securing just a pair of victories since returning from March’s international break, the Sky Blues have also registered consecutive top-flight wins on just a single occasion since way back in August. Despite still being sat in the driving seat to clinch a famous European return this month, Celta Vigo have gained a reputation for their extended issues on the road. In fact, Giraldez’s camp have won just a pair of their last 11 La Liga showdowns outside of Galicia – a run that stems all the way back to October 5th.
