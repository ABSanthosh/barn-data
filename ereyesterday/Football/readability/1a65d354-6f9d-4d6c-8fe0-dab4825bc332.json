Despite securing the Ligue 1 title earlier this month and having the first leg of their Champions League semi-final tie against Arsenal to come on Tuesday, PSG sent out a strong side as they looked to maintain their invincible record. The home side dominated the opening half-hour and created chance after chance, but the visitors took the lead through Morgan Sanson, as he marked his first start of the season by applying a clinical first-time finish to Badredine Bouanani’s throughball in the 35th minute. The lead lasted just six minutes as Fabian Ruiz scored with a sumptuous half-volley to level, but Luis Enrique’s team were later punished for a slow start to the second half. Just 22 seconds after the restart, Sanson volleyed in from close range to give Nice the lead for the second time. Having scored from their only two shots on target up to that point, the visitors went 3-1 up when Youssouf Ndayishimiye headed home Bouanani’s free-kick in the 70th minute. PSG enjoyed 75% of the possession and created several excellent chances, but they were left frustrated by their own wayward finishing and some inspired goalkeeping from Marcin Bulka. With the clock ticking past 90 minutes and seven being added on for stoppages, Bulka pulled off a superb reflex save to deny Goncalo Ramos and he followed that up with another top-drawer stop from Vitinha’s long-range strike, celebrating each save loudly. The Parisiens continued to pour forward but Nice defended doggedly and held on to give their hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League a considerable lift. They climb up to fourth in the table on 54 points, only behind third-placed Monaco on goal difference and just a single point off Marseille in second. Lille, Lyon and Strasbourg are all within three points of Franck Haise’s team, with all of the sides around them possessing a game in hand. Data debrief: PSG prove they are human PSG entered Friday’s game knowing they had just four more hurdles to clear to make history and become the first ‘Invincibles’ in Ligue 1. They were also just two games without defeat from matching Nantes’ record for the longest run without losing from the start of a season (32 games in 1994-95). But instead, they were sent crashing to their first league defeat since May 12, 2024 (versus Toulouse) and just their third under Luis Enrique overall – all of his losses have come at home. They struggled at both ends, and they are now guaranteed to set their lowest total of clean sheets in a Ligue 1 season in the Qatar Sports Investments era (since 2011-12), with seven to date in 2024-25 and just three games to play (previously 11 in 2011-12). Ousmane Dembele, Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia were simply unable to beat Bulka, whose 12 saves are a single-game record for a Nice goalkeeper in Ligue 1 (since data collection began in 2006-07).",
