  "text": "Verdict: Real Madrid to score in both halves Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Marking their return return from March’s international break on Saturday night, Real Madrid will welcome local rivals Leganes to the Bernabeu. Real Madrid Starting with the hosts, while Real Madrid might mark their return from the fortnight interval chasing arch-rivals Barcelona, Carlo Ancelotti’s men have their sights firmly set on completing another iconic domestic and European sweep in 2025. Heading into March’s break with a 2-1 victory away at Villarreal, Los Blancos have won three of their previous four La Liga appearances and know that stability is key heading into the final couple of months. However, despite punching their Champions League quarter-final ticket earlier in the month as they edged past bitter local rivals Atletico Madrid, Ancelotti’s men have struggled to find any kind of defensive steel. Getting March underway with a 2-1 loss at the hands of Real Betis, the defending champions have mustered just a pair of Clean sheets from any of their last 13 matchups across all competitions. Real Madrid Team News While Spanish international Dani Carvajal might be inching towards a shock return following a long-term knee injury, the 33-year-old is not expected to feature here. However, Los Blancos have already confirmed that they will be unable to call upon the likes of Ferland Mendy and Eder Militao this weekend. Notching 20 La Liga strikes after completing a blockbuster move from PSG last summer, French skipper Kylian Mbappe will lead Ancelotti’s attack. Making a controversial return to Belgium’s national squad this month, former Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois will start between the sticks. Leganes As for the visitors, while Leganes might have only made their La Liga return this season, Borja Jimenez’s men have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their top-flight status in 2025. Heading into March’s international break with a frantic 3-2 loss at home against Real Betis, El Lega mark their return from the fortnight interval sat in the drop zone and pencilled in as a leading relegation contender. Signing off February with a 3-0 drumming at the hands of Real Sociedad, Leganes have mustered just a single victory from any of their previous nine appearances across all competitions. Crashing out of the Copa del Rey on February 5th as they fell to another 3-2 defeat at home against Los Blancos, Jimenez’s men couldn’t have asked for a tougher examination this weekend. Leganes Team News Both still dealing with respective knee injuries, Leganes will once again be without the duo of Enric Franquesa and former Rangers defender Borna Barisic this weekend. However, returning from a three-match suspension prior to March’s international break, ex-Barcelona starlet Munir El Haddadi could feature here. Bagging what was a pair of consolation strikes against Real Betis on March 16th and notching four goals in his previous five appearances, Dani Raba will lead the line. One-time Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic will partner Sergio Gonzalez Poirrier at the back. Real Madrid vs Leganes Key Factors to Consider When Real Madrid and Leganes met for a Copa del Rey showdown on February 5th, Los Blancos collected a 3-2 victory at the Estadio Municipal Butarque. Ancelotti’s men have recorded 17 goals in just their last four meetings against El Lega. Real Madrid have recorded just a pair of clean sheets from any of their previous 13 appearances across all competitions. Leganes have notched just a single victory from any of their previous nine meetings against La Liga opposition. El Lega have lost each of their last three showdowns away from the Estadio Municipal Butarque by an aggregate score of 7-1. Conclusion While Real Madrid might have struggled to find top gear with much stability since opening the New Year, Los Blancos will be smelling a golden opportunity here. Landing an action-packed 3-2 victory when they travelled to the Estadio Municipal Butarque for a Copa del Rey showdown on February 5th, Ancelotti’s men hold a dominant record against their local rivals. Cruising their way to a 5-0 romp when they last welcomed Leganes to the Bernabeu back in 2019, Madrid are rightfully installed as a landslide contender this weekend.
