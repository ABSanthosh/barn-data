  "text": "Southampton have sacked manager Russell Martin following their 5-0 Premier League defeat to Tottenham on Sunday. The Saints conceded all five goals in a torrid first half at St. Mary’s – with the first going in after just 36 seconds – subjecting them to a 13th league defeat of the campaign. Southampton sit bottom of the table on just five points, nine away from safety, and have won just once in the Premier League this season – a 1-0 win over Everton in November. They have conceded 36 goals while scoring a league-low 11, with Southampton averaging just 0.31 points per game in the top-flight since their promotion. The home fans booed Martin during and after Sunday’s match, though he acknowledged their frustration in his post-match comments. “After the first goal, our response was very poor,” he said. “I was hurt in the first half. We did not respond very well to the setbacks as a group. We have seen that all too often this season. “It’s disappointing because we had worked on a plan. We had a week’s training, and the players have been part of that process, but we did not carry out anywhere near the intensity or aggression we needed. I didn’t recognise our team in the first half. “The fans were amazing in the second half. Really good. “I understand that it [the boos] is not personal. It hurts me as well as the team, but I understand it. “We have no choice but to keep working and fighting. It’s what I have been doing in this job and I will continue doing it until I am told not to.” Southampton confirmed that Under-21s manager Simon Rusk will take charge on an interim basis, with an EFL Cup tie against Liverpool on Wednesday and a trip to Fulham in the Premier League coming up. “Going into the start of the season, we all knew the challenges that we would face this year as we readjusted to life in the top-flight, competing in the best and most competitive league in the world,” Southampton said in a statement. “However, the reality of our situation is clear. The board have supported Russell and his staff and been open and transparent regarding our expectations. We have all been on the same page in recognising the urgency of needing results to improve. “We would like to take this opportunity to thank Russell and his staff for all the hard work and dedication they have given the club on and off the pitch over the last 18 months. Everyone connected with Southampton FC will always have fantastic memories of last season, especially the play-off Final win in May.”",
