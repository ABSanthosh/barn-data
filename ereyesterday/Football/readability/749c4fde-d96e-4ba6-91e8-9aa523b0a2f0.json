The New Zealand striker has scored 14 goals in 22 Premier League outings this campaign and has penned terms that keep him at the City Ground until 2027. Wood was initially due to be out of contract in June but follows centre-back Murillo in agreeing to fresh terms. The New Zealand international told Sky Sports News: “You can see the dream and ambition this club has. “We’ve had a great start to the season, now midway through. We’ve got a lot more to achieve and strive towards. “I think this club, the ownership, the staff, the players and the fans, have a lot they want to achieve to grow into a great club again. “I’m full of confidence and there is a lot of belief instilled in me from the manager down to my team-mates.” pic.twitter.com/NwGzgRDQQv — Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) January 23, 2025 Only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak have scored more goals than Wood in the top flight this term. The Kiwi has taken fewer shots than anybody else inside the top-10 goalscorers, converting more of his shots into goals (34 per cent) than any of those players. He said: “Scoring goals is the biggest confidence-booster for a striker. “You’ve still got to do the hard work for the team and make sure your other team-mates are doing well at the same time, but it’s a great confidence-booster when you are scoring.”",
