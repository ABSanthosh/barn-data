  "text": "Verdict: Lyon win Best Odds: 4/6 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to make it three Europa League victories in as many appearances, Lyon will welcome Besiktas to the Park Olympique Lyonnais on Thursday night. Lyon Starting with the hosts, while Lyon might have spent large spells of last season at the heart of a Ligue 1 relegation scrap, Pierre Sage’s squad have continued to shine this time around. Marking their return from October’s international break with a 4-0 romp away at Le Havre, the former Chambery boss finds the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Getting their Europa League adventure with a 2-0 win against defending champions Olympiacos, Les Gones have now won each of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Last seen in European action storming their way to a 4-1 victory away at Scottish giants Rangers, Lyon have gained quite the reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. With their sights set on mounting a genuine Europa League charge this season, Thursday’s hosts have registered 14 goals on their five-match winning run. Team News Once again missing out away at Le Havre last weekend, Lyon will once again be without former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic on Thursday night. However, after serving a domestic suspension on Sunday, Sage’s side will welcome back ex-Southampton defender Duje Calaeta-Car in midweek. Opening his Europa League account against Rangers on October 3rd, former Arsenal skipper Alexandre Laxazette will spearhead Lyon’s charge in the final third. Arriving from Nottingham Forest over the summer, Moussa Niakhate will start at the heart of Lyon’s defence. Besiktas As for the visitors, marking their return from October’s international break with a 2-0 victory at home against Konyaspor, Besiktas will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. Getting their respective Europa League adventure underway on September 26th as they slumped to a nightmare 4-0 drumming at the hands of Ajax, the Black Eagles have struggled to find any kind of fluidity on the European stage. Opening October with a 3-1 defeat at home against Bundesliga outfit Eintracht Frankfurt, Thursday’s guests have shown some extended inconsistencies outside of Istanbul. In fact, Giovanni van Bronckhorst has seen his squad register just a single win away from the Tupras Stadium from any of their previous five attempts. Already shipping seven goals in their opening two Europa League defeats, the former Rangers boss should have another real challenge on his hands here. Team News Both still dealing with respective injury issues, Besiktas will once again be without the duo of Necip Uysal and Turkish shot-stopper Ersin Destanoglu on Thursday night. However, van Bronckhorst’s side remain hopeful that former Norwich star Milot Rashica will be able to travel to France in midweek. Once again finding the net against Konyaspr last weekend and only continuing to shine since arriving from Italian giants Lazio last summer, Ciro Immobile will play a leading role in the final third. One-time Tottenham loanee Gedson Fernandes will start in the middle of the park and partner Italian youngster Cher Ndour. Key Factors to Consider When Lyon and Besiktas last met in Europa League action back in April 2017, Les Gones secured a thrilling 4-3 aggregate victory at the quarter-final stage. Lyon have won each of their previous five consecutive appearances across all competitions. Likewise, Thursday’s hosts have won their opening two Europa League showdowns by an aggregate score of 6-1. Besiktas have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous five appearances outside of Istanbul. Lyon have recorded at least a pair of goals in all of their previous four consecutive showdowns on home soil. Conclusion Enjoying what has become a sensational purple patch and continuing to shine on either side of October’s international break, Lyon will be looking to make another statement here. Winning each of their last five appearances across all competitions and really impressing in the final third, Thursday’s hosts will be confident of cashing in on a Besiktas squad that have shown some glaring inconstancies outside of Istanbul. With Les Gones winning their opening two Europa League showdowns by an aggregate score of 6-1, we are backing a home victory in midweek. Verdict: Lyon win Best Odds: 4/6 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
