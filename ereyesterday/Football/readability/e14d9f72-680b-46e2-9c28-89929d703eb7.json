The former Liverpool striker scored his first goal in over two years, as the Blades leapfrogged Leeds United back to the top of the table. Japhet Tanganga and George Saville both struck the woodwork for Millwall in what was Neil Harris’ final home game in charge, but Brewster broke the deadlock just before the break. Chris Wilder’s side had to remain concentrated during the second half as the hosts pushed for the equaliser, but they held out for a crucial three points. Rhian Brewster babypic.twitter.com/92q3Exqc91 — Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) December 11, 2024 Elsewhere, Ruben Selles was unfortunate not to begin his tenure with bottom side Hull City in victorious fashion against Watford. Chris Bedia broke the deadlock for the hosts in the 82nd minute, and it looked like it could be enough to give them their first win since early October. However, Rocco Vata equalised for the visitors two minutes from time to prevent the Tigers from moving off the foot of the table and out of the relegation zone. Meanwhile, West Bromwich Albion moved back into the top six as goals from Alex Mowatt and Karlan Grant secured a 2-0 win over Frank Lampard’s Coventry City. Queens Park Rangers and Preston North End both pulled clear of the relegation zone following 2-0 victories over Oxford United and Cardiff City respectively, and the Bluebirds remain in the bottom three due to their inferior goal difference.",
