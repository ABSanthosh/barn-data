  "text": "Verdict: Kevin De Bruyne over 0.5 shots on target  Best Odds: 4/6 Bookmaker: Dachbet With all eyes falling on Wembley this weekend, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City will meet for a spot in the final of this season’s FA Cup. Nottingham Forest Starting with Nottingham Forest, while Nuno Espirito Santo’s side might have only just clung to their Premier League status last season, the former Wolves boss has seen his squad come roaring back in a remarkable fashion this time around. Firmly underlining their status as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages this year, they remarkably sit in the driving seat to book an iconic Champions League ticket. Shattering a string of records, Santo’s men travel to Wembley this weekend riding a sensational wave of momentum. Last seen picking up some perfect momentum as they claimed a 2-1 win against Tottenham on Monday night, Forest will also be excited by their most recent showdown against Manchester City. Landing a late 1-0 victory when they welcomed the soon-to-be former champions to Nottingham on March 8th, Santo’s side will be desperate seeking a repeat performance here. Nottingham Forest Team News While Ola Aina might have missed each of Nottingham Forest’s last three appearances with a calf issue, the Nigerian international could return to Santo’s squad here. Despite settling for a spot on the bench against Tottenham on Monday night, ex-Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi could make a full return at Wembley. Finding the net in north London earlier in the week and notching 19 Premier League goals this season, the red-hot Chris Wood will spearhead Forest’s attack. Making a real impact after arriving from Fiorentina last summer, Nikola Milenkovic will partner Murillo at the back. Manchester City As for Manchester City, while the Sky Blues might have endured a public crisis this season, Pep Guardiola’s men have turned a recent corner. Snatching a last-gasp 2-1 victory against Aston Villa earlier in the week, that result saw them leapfrog Nottingham Forest into bronze medal position. Mounting a stellar comeback against Crystal Palace on April 12th as they stormed their way to a 5-2 romp against Crystal Palace, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad win each of their previous three Premier League appearances by an aggregate score of 9-2. Likewise, Guardiola’s side have not suffered a single defeat since that 1-0 loss at the City Ground on March 8th. With FA Cup success their only chance to clinch a piece of silverware this season, Man City face what will be a season-defining showdown in north London. Manchester City Team News Not making a single appearance since sustaining an ankle injury against Bournemouth on March 30th, attacking talisman Erling Haaland remains on the sidelines. Dealing with a recent groin issue, Manchester City are once again sweating over the fitness of Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson. Now on his farewell tour, Belgium ace Kevin De Bruyne will lead out Guardiola’s side at Wembley. Making an immediate impact after arriving from Bundesliga outfit Eintracht Frankfurt, Omar Marmoush will lead City’s charge in north London. Nottingham Forest vs Manchester City Key Factors to Consider When Sunday’s semi-finalists last met on March 8th, Nottingham Forest collected a 1-0 victory at the City Ground. The Sky Blues have won their previous three Premier League appearances by an aggregate score of 9-2. Man City are unbeaten in their last seven matchups across all competitions (five wins, two draws). Nottingham Forest have recorded consecutive clean sheets against Premier League opposition on just a single occasion so far this calendar year. New Zealand international Chris Wood has notched 19 Premier League goals this season. Conclusion With all of their eggs firmly placed in this year’s FA Cup basket, Manchester City travel to Wembley on Sunday afternoon facing a season-defining showdown in north London. Although the Sky Blues might be in the midst of what has become a real purple patch, they will meet a Nottingham Forest squad who have embarked on a fairytale. With Santo’s side landing a famous 1-0 win when they welcomed the soon-to-be champions to town on March 8th, Forest are more than capable to springing an iconic upset in the capital.
