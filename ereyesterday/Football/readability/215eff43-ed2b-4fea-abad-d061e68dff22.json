  "text": "Graham Potter is looking to make his mark on West Ham ahead of his first Premier League game in charge, with Fulham the visitors at the London Stadium. Potter’s bow as West Ham head coach did not go to plan as his side were knocked out of the FA Cup after giving up a lead in a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa last Friday. West Ham have lost their last two Premier League matches heavily, with their 4-1 defeat to Manchester City spelling the end for Julen Lopetegui, but they could move up to 12th in the table if they get back to winning ways. Potter is keen to build on the positives he saw against Villa and hit the ground running in the top-flight. “I’m really excited for Tuesday night. The fans’ support at Villa Park on Friday was brilliant,” Potter said. “The supporters have always been incredibly loyal, and behind the team. As an away manager, London Stadium is a tough place to come, so we need to build and utilise that connection between the crowd and the players. “To do that we have to field a team that the supporters can identify with and that they believe and trust in. That connection is so important, and though we’re at the early stages of it now, hopefully, we can build it through good performances and results.” West Ham (A) awaits. #WHUFUL pic.twitter.com/Jd5C7NemHw — Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) January 13, 2025 Fulham sit ninth in the table after an eight-match unbeaten run in the Premier League and also beat Watford in the FA Cup on Thursday. They have drawn six of those matches, including against Arsenal and Liverpool, while also beating Chelsea, and Marco Silva is hoping to build on their recent momentum. “It’s been a great run for us. We should have taken more points because we deserve it the way we have been playing in some of those games, but it’s been really, really good,” he said. “We showed the resilience, showed the quality, showed that we have been able to be competitive in any stadium in this country against any team, and we want to repeat that again against West Ham. “The players, they are confident that they can do a good job, and we collectively are a strong side.” PLAYERS TO WATCH West Ham – Mohammed Kudus Potter confirmed Niclas Fullkrug is set for a spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury, meaning the onus will fall to Mohammed Kudus to make something happen for West Ham. Against Manchester City, he had the most shots (five), the most touches in the opposition box (seven), and completed all 10 of his passes in the final third, the most of any West Ham player with 100% such accuracy. Final preparations for Fulham @Topps_UK Training Shots pic.twitter.com/zE9cUTA6E5 — West Ham United (@WestHam) January 13, 2025 Fulham – Raul Jimenez Raul Jimenez has scored eight Premier League goals this season, his most in a single campaign since 2019-20 (17). He has also netted more goals against West Ham than against any other opponent in the competition (six). MATCH PREDICTION: DRAW West Ham are winless in their last three Premier League meetings with Fulham (D1 L2), having won five of their previous six against them before this (D1). The Hammers are also winless in five Premier League London derby matches (D2 L3), with their last two finishing in 4-1 and 5-2 defeats against Tottenham and Arsenal respectively – no team has ever shipped four or more goals in three consecutive Premier League London derby matches before. Fulham, meanwhile, are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League London derby matches (W5 D5) – it is their longest run without a league defeat against fellow London sides since a run of 12 between February 1936 and October 1938. Fulham won this exact fixture 2-0 last season, ending a 12-match winless away run against West Ham in the Premier League (D4 L8). They have not won away at the Hammers in consecutive league campaigns since 1978-79 and 1979-80 in the second tier. Only Liverpool (15) and Arsenal (10) are on a longer current unbeaten run in the Premier League than Fulham (eight), though six of the Cottagers’ eight games in this run have been draws. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY West Ham – 34.6% Draw – 25.9% Fulham – 39.5%",
