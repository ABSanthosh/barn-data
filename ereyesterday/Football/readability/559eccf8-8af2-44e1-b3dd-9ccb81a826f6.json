  "text": "While there might have been plenty of excitement around Old Trafford back in November following Ruben Amorim‚Äôs arrival, Manchester United broke a string of unwanted records last season. With many fans around the red half of Manchester making their frustrations abundantly clear following a woeful 15th-place finish, the former Sporting Lisbon boss already has a huge amount of pressure on his shoulders. Only notching 44 Premier League strikes last season and with only one club outside the relegated trio recording fewer top-flight strikes, a huge part of United‚Äôs struggles was their glaring issues in the final third. With it heavily suggested that the misfiring Rasmus Hojlund could be set for an immediate Serie A return this summer, it is no surprise that attacking reinforcements are at the top of Amorim‚Äôs wishlist ahead of the 2025/26 campaign. With the Old Trafford hierarchy making it clear that Amorim will be heavily backed when the summer transfer window reopens, we have taken a look at the striking stars who are linked with a blockbuster Manchester switch. Viktor Gyokeres ‚Äì Sporting Lisbon Firing Sporting Lisbon to a record-breaking 21st Primeira Liga crown last season, it appeared almost a certainty that Viktor Gyokeres was going to find himself at the heart of a heavyweight transfer saga this summer. Since completing a permanent switch from Championship outfit Coventry two years ago, the Swedish marksman has embarked on a sensational run of form and has quickly underlined his status as one of Europe‚Äôs elite number nines. Once again breezing his way to Portugal‚Äôs Golden Boot last season, the 27-year-old has registered an astonishing 97 goals in his 102 appearances across all competitions in Lisbon. However, while Gyokeres might have a release clause in his current contract that is believed to be in the region of ¬£85million, both parties suddenly find themselves in the midst of what has become a messy public divorce. With it widely reported that the Sporting hierarchy had made it clear last summer that they would allow their striking talisman to leave for ¬£59million after agreeing to stay for another year, Gyokeres has made his frustrations abundantly clear. Despite Amorim making it clear that he is desperate for a blockbuster reunion with his former leading marksman, it has been suggested that Gyokeres is not as open to an Old Trafford switch this summer. üö®üá∏üá™ Viktor Gy√∂keres‚Äô priority is to join Arsenal this summer despite calls from Manchester United in the recent weeks. Gy√∂keres always an option amid ≈†e≈°ko talks with no deal sealed so far, Arsenal keep assessing situation. United remain keen but believe deal now unlikely. pic.twitter.com/iTdDbkEcCV ‚Äî Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 14, 2025 Hugo Ekitike ‚Äì Eintracht Frankfurt With Sporting Lisbon playing hard ball and growing frustrations from all parties, it was reported over the weekend that Manchester United are weighing up other options and one of Bundesliga‚Äôs hottest starlets is attracting plenty of admirers from Old Trafford. While Hugo Ekitike might have only made his move to Eintracht Frankfurt a permanent one last summer, the former PSG starlet has blossomed into one of Europe‚Äôs most sort after attacking talents. Bagging 22 goals across all competitions last season and spearheading Frankfurt‚Äôs charge to a sensational bronze medal finish, it is no secret that the French youngster has been linked with plenty of Europe‚Äôs elite. Although Frankfurt might have publicly stated that they will not forced into accepting any kind of cut-price offer, it is widely accepted that Ekitike will be allowed to leave Deutsche Bank Park should an acceptable bid come their way. With it reported over the past couple of months that Ekitike has his sights set on securing a blockbuster Premier League switch this summer, the likes of Chelsea have remained heavily linked with the France U21 international. However, with talks expected to pick up some pace over the coming weeks, it was suggested over the weekend that Manchester United have moved into pole position. üö®üëÄ ‚ÄúMy favourite club as a child was Manchester United.

Playing a leading role as Crystal Palace clinched a maiden FA Cup crown last month and helping the Eagles secure an iconic Europa League adventure for next year, Jean-Philippe Mateta has enjoyed a remarkable run over the past two campaigns. Notching 30 Premier League goals over the last two campaigns, the former Mainz marksman has become a cult figure in south London and Palace will do everything within their power to keep hold of the 27-year-old this summer. One of the Premier League‚Äôs standout strikers last season, Mateta has been linked with a move to Old Trafford on multiple occasions over the past 12 months. However, while it might have been reported heavily last season that Amorim is a huge admirer of Crystal Palace‚Äôs leading marksman, Mateta is in discussions over a new deal at Selhurst Park and Manchester United will have a real mountain to climb. Jean-Philippe Mateta is in talks about extending his Crystal Palace contract but clubs such as Manchester United and Juventus are also interested in signing the striker this summer üëÄ ‚úçÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/SKm59BWbvK ‚Äî Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) June 7, 2025",
