  "text": "Putting in another dominant European display on Tuesday night, Liverpool extended on their 100% Champions League record as they claimed a 2-1 win against Lille. Almost in complete control on either side of the interval, it was unsurprisingly Mohamed Salah who opened the scoring as the Egyptian icon recorded his 50th European strike for Arne Slot’s side. While Salah might have missed a handful of chances after opening the scoring in the 34rd-minute, the Premier League giants largely didn’t need to get out of third gear. Things got even more difficult for Lille on the hour mark as they were reduced to 10 men just before the hour mark when Aissa Mandi was shown a second booking for a foul on Luis Diaz. However, while Lille might have largely been chasing shadows at Anfield, the Mastiffs did briefly silence the home support as Canadian marksman Jonathan David bagged a shock equaliser. That was only a moment of joy for the French outfit as second-half substitute Harvey Elliot notched the winner just five minuets after David recorded a seventh Champions League goal of the season. On a night when Liverpool extended on their 100% European record, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Anfield. Liverpool lay down another European Champions League While Liverpool might have already stormed their way to a Champions League quarter-final tickets prior to Tuesday’s showdown at Anfield, Slot made it clear that he would not tolerate his squad taking the foot off the accelerator. Although the former Feyenoord boss might have made a handful of alterations here, the Reds are enjoying a major European romp and his side have underlined their status as a leading title contender. Only going from strength to strength and still holding a dominant 100% record from their first 17 Champions League appearances, Liverpool have won all of those contests by an aggregate score of 15-2. Snatching a dramatic late 2-0 victory away at Brentford on Saturday afternoon and continuing to shine under Slot’s guidance, Tuesday’s hosts are capable of completing a famous title sweep in 2025. Suffering just a pair of defeats across any competition so far this season and with the mood around Anfield at a red-hot high, Liverpool have only further cemented their position as the hottest team from across the globe. Salah steals the show at Anfield once again While Darwin Nunez might have proven to be Liverpool’s hero away at Brentford last weekend, it is their record-breaking icon who has only further underlined his status as the King of Anfield. Although Salah might be in the final few months of his current deal with the Premier League giants and at the heart of a major transfer saga, the one-time Chelsea misfit has enjoyed another sensational run this season. Opening the scoring here and notching a 50th Champions League goal for the leading European contenders, Salah has also produced seven direct goal contributions in as many appearances. With the fans around Anfield once again giving their attacking talisman a standing ovation, the 32-year-old looks set to break a string of records before his contract saga comes to an end this summer. Now recording 22 goals across all competitions and leading the race for the Premier League’s Golden Boot, Salah will simply have his sights set on spearheading Liverpool’s charge for an iconic double-winning campaign. Defensive issues haunt Lille Already picking up a pair of heavyweight European scalps this season after collecting victories against both Real Madrid and Atletico, Lille would have gained plenty of plaudits from across the continent. However, despite dreaming of the chance to spring another sensational upset on foreign soil, Tuesday’s guests were dominated at Anfield and saw their top-eight dreams take a blow. Despite opening Tuesday’s showdown in the midst of a remarkable 21-match unbeaten run across all competitions, Bruno Genesio’s side are seeking some recent stability. Dropping out of the quarter-final spots here, Lille have recorded just a single victory from any of their last five appearances across all competitions within 90 minuets. Recording just a sole clean sheet against top-flight opposition since the end of November, they have also failed to come away unscathed from any of their previous seven Champions League appearances.
