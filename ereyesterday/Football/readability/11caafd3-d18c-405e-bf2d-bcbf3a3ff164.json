  "text": "Verdict: Away win Best odds: 9/20 Bookmaker: ZetBet Bayer Leverkusen, the reigning Bundesliga champions, will aim to keep pace with league leaders Bayern Munich when they head to Weserstadion for a clash against Werder Bremen on Saturday. Currently sitting in fourth with 14 points from their opening seven games, Leverkusen trail Bayern by three points and will be eager to close the gap. Werder Bremen, meanwhile, occupy eighth place with 11 points and come into this fixture on the back of a confidence-boosting 4-2 victory over Wolfsburg. Werder Bremen Werder Bremen showed resilience in their recent 4-2 victory over Wolfsburg, rallying from a 1-0 deficit after conceding an early goal in the 19th minute. Mitchell Weiser’s equalizer in first-half stoppage time provided the spark they needed, and by the 67th minute, they had a commanding 3-1 lead. Bremen’s attacking efficiency was on display, as they created four big chances and took 15 shots, narrowly outpacing Wolfsburg’s 14 shots but edging them in clear opportunities. Head coach Ole Werner praised his squad’s perseverance, noting that despite a sluggish start, they stuck to his tactical plan and ultimately reaped the rewards. Bremen’s form has been inconsistent, with three wins and two losses in their last five league outings, but they’ve struggled to string together consecutive Bundesliga victories since April. Additionally, their home record has been patchy, with only two wins in their last 10 league games at Weserstadion, and back-to-back home losses in recent weeks. As they prepare to face Leverkusen, Bremen will look to improve their form at home and aim for more consistency in their performances. Team News Werder Bremen will have to cope without Jens Stage due to a calf injury that sidelines him until mid-November, while winger Marco Grull and center-back Niklas Stark are also ruled out until next month. Stark’s absence may prompt manager Ole Werner to opt for a back three of Julian Malatini, Marco Friedl, and Amos Pieper to solidify their defense. In midfield, Leonardo Bittencourt and Senne Lynen are likely to step up, filling the void left by Stage. Up front, Marvin Ducksch is expected to lead the attack. Bayer Leverkusen Bayer Leverkusen enter this match after a 1-1 Champions League draw against Brest, in which they struggled creatively, producing only one big chance. With Xabi Alonso making eight lineup changes from their recent 2-1 Bundesliga victory over Eintracht Frankfurt, it seems the Spanish coach prioritized squad rotation amid a congested schedule. Leverkusen fought back to win that Frankfurt fixture after conceding early, thanks to goals from Robert Andrich and Victor Boniface. While Die Schwarzroten have showcased a potent attack with 18 goals this Bundesliga season, their back line has been less impressive, conceding 13 goals, which ranks them as the league’s 11th-best defensive side. But despite defensive lapses, Leverkusen have been resilient, remaining unbeaten in their last eight games, with five wins and three draws. Their recent form includes consecutive 1-1 draws, but prior to that, they clinched four straight wins with a combined scoreline of 12-3. Team News Leverkusen face a significant blow with Amine Adli sidelined for several months due to a leg fracture sustained against Brest. In his absence, Xabi Alonso is likely to opt for an attacking setup featuring Martin Terrier and Florian Wirtz supporting striker Victor Boniface. This lineup should provide plenty of creativity and movement up front. In defence, Edmond Tapsoba, Jonathan Tah, and Piero Hincapie are expected to form a solid backline, with Granit Xhaka and Robert Andrich anchoring the midfield. Xhaka’s experience and Andrich’s energy should offer stability and defensive cover, especially crucial given Leverkusen’s recent defensive vulnerabilities. Conclusion Leverkusen’s impressive offensive output this season has often overshadowed their defensive frailties, and even if they struggle to keep a clean sheet, their attacking firepower remains formidable. Given their attacking depth with Boniface, Wirtz, and Terrier, taking the lead could indeed open the floodgates for Alonso’s side. Verdict: Away win Best odds: 9/20 Bookmaker: ZetBet",
