  "text": "Competition: Meistriliiga Market: Narva win Odds: 1/2 @ Pribet Looking to find a route into the European spots on Tuesday evening, Narva will welcome Harju JK to the Kalev-Fama Stadium. Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to winning ways last week as they clinched an action-packed 5-2 victory away at Tallinna Kalev, Narva are enjoying what has been an extended flurry. Getting Tuesday’s return to the Kalev-Fama Stadium sat just three points adrift of skyrocketing themselves into the European spots, Roman Kozhukhovskyi’s men should be smelling a real opportunity here. Despite watching their Estonian Cup adventure come to an abrupt end earlier in the month, the Reds have won each of their previous three consecutive Meistriliiga appearances by an aggregate score of 13-4. Getting May underway with a stellar 4-0 romp against Tammeka, Narva have also gained a reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. Pencilled in as a standout contender in midweek, Kozhukhovskyi’s side will also be excited by their success on home soil. Including a 4-2 win against Parnu JK Vaprus earlier in the month, Tuesday’s hosts have registered nine points from their last four showdowns in front of their own supporters. As for the visitors, only making their Meistriliiga return this season, Harju JK simply have their sights set on retaining their top-flight status in 2025. Despite getting May underway with a 3-1 victory away at Tallinna Kalev, Lauri Nuuma’s side have struggled to find any kind of stability. Suffering a late collapse away at Paide as they eventually had to settle for a 2-2 stalemate, the Harjumaa-based outfit have mustered just a pair of wins from their previous 10 appearances – a run that stems back to March 16th. Facing what will be a stern examination here, Harju should also be concerned by a nightmare record against the European contenders. Including a routine 3-0 drumming when they welcomed Narva to town on March 29th, they have lost their last two meetings by a 3-0 scoreline. In fact, Nuuma’s camp have lost five of their six historic battles against Tuesday’s hosts. Bet: Narva 1/2 to beat Harju JK in Tuesday’s Meistriliiga matchup @ Pribet",
