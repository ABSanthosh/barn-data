  "text": "San Diego FC have impressed in the early stages of their time in MLS, and head coach Mikey Varas is determined to keep their streak going against the Colorado Rapids. San Diego are second in the Western Conference after seven games, sitting two points behind leaders Vancouver Whitecaps, and have suffered just one defeat so far. After two games without a win, San Diego have now won their last two on the bounce, beating Los Angeles FC and Seattle Sounders. Varas is delighted with how his team have played this season but highlighted the importance of building on their current momentum. “We’re looking to find consistency,” he said. “One of our aims is to keep the streak going, and that takes a lot of focus and energy to be relentless with the task at hand. “We need to control the things we can control, so we’re learning about ourselves in this moment, and it’s a great opportunity. “We’re really putting in the effort to make sure we’re consistent.” Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere? pic.twitter.com/SH7d9GWAq0 — San Diego FC (@sandiegofc) April 11, 2025 Colorado, meanwhile, sit seventh in the West, three points behind their opponents ahead of Saturday’s meeting. The Rapids have alternated between wins and losses in their last four MLS matches, losing to Vancouver last time out. While Colorado have never faced San Diego before, head coach Chris Armas knows what to expect from Varas’ team and is determined to make sure his team are up to the task. “There’s always enough film. A lot of what they know about themselves, we know about them because you can see it,” Armas said. “I think sometimes when you don’t know the [opponent] as well, it’s so much more about us, but I think it’s pretty clear. “Some teams are very, very clear about what they try to do, their behaviors, their principles. That’s clear: They’re a team that can play direct, and they’re a team that can play really, really good in possession.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Colorado Rapids – Kevin Cabral Colorado attempted just seven shots in its defeat to Vancouver on Saturday, failing to hit a shot on target for the second time this season (vs. St. Louis City SC in February). Kevin Cabral was one of just two players to have more than one shot (two) and accumulated the highest expected goals (xG) with 0.14, as he continued his search for a first goal of the season. San Diego FC – Hirving Lozano Two of San Diego’s three goals in their win over Seattle on Saturday were scored in the final five minutes of the first half, with Hirving Lozano scoring the second in first-half stoppage time. Overall, eight of San Diego’s 13 goals this season have been scored in the final 15 minutes of halves, including six in the final five minutes of each half plus stoppage time. It starts at the source and builds all the way to the pitch #Rapids96 pic.twitter.com/w17tAzVu6g — Colorado Rapids (@ColoradoRapids) April 11, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: COLORADO RAPIDS WIN Colorado have won only three of 14 regular-season matches against expansion teams dating back to 2015 (D4 L7). Two of the three wins came against Austin FC in 2021. The Rapids have lost only two of their 18 home matches against expansion teams dating back to 2005 (W10 D6). The only MLS newcomers to defeat the Rapids in Colorado this century are Los Angeles FC in 2018 and Austin in 2021. San Diego have impressed so far, and their 3-0 win over Seattle on Saturday was their third win by multiple goals in their first seven MLS matches. San Diego’s +7 goal difference is tied with St. Louis City SC in 2023 for the second-best by an expansion team in their first seven games of a season (Atlanta United – +9 in 2017). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Colorado Rapids – 43.9% Draw – 26.8% San Diego FC – 29.3%",
