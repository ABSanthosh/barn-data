  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Looking to widen their buffer at the top of the Serie B table on Saturday night, Goias will travel to Alagoas when they meet CRB. CRB Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to losing ways last week as they slumped to a 1-0 loss away at Avai, CRB are desperate to get their promotion charge back on track. Despite extending on their Copa do Brasil adventure last month as they edged past Santos, Umberto Louzer’s side have won just a pair of their previous 10 appearances across all competitions within 90 minutes. However, getting this weekend’s fixtures underway sat within touching distance of breaking into the top-four, CRB will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Last seen in Alagoas claiming a 2-0 victory against Remo, Saturday’s hosts have not been hit with a single Serie B defeat at the Rei Pele since opening up the 2025 campaign. CRB Team News Still dealing with a long-term knee injury and not making a single appearance across any competition so far this season, CRB will once again be without former Sport Recife defender Fabio Alemao on Saturday night. However, returning to Louzer’s squad last month, Atletico GO loanee Daniel Lima could feature. Completing a free switch from Italian outfit Salernitana ahead of the 2025 campaign, Mikael will spearhead Goias’ charge in the final third. Former Palmeiras youngster Henri will partner Luis Segovia Vega at the heart of Louzer’s defence. Goias As for the visitors, only continuing on what has been a sensational Serie B romp since opening up the 2025 campaign, Goias are riding a major wave of momentum. Last seen putting in another eye-catching display as they claimed a routine 2-0 victory against Volta Redonda, it is no surprise that Vagner Mancini’s men are pencilled in as the standout title contender this year. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway holding a four-point buffer at the top of the table, Saturday’s guests will be looking to make another statement here. In fact, Goias have put 26 points on the board from their opening 11 Serie B appearances. Likewise, clinching a 1-0 victory when they travelled to Alagoas last season, the former Corinthians boss will be seeking a repeat performance this week. Goias Team News Both shown costly first-half bookings against Volta Redonda last week, the duo of Diego Caito and Uruguayan international Gonzalo Freitas will miss out through suspension on Saturday night. However, former Avai midfielder Rafael Gava could return to Mancini’s travelling squad this weekend. While ex-Sport Recife marksman Arthur Caike might have come off the bench and notched a third Serie B strike of the season last week, the 32-year-old will like remain among Mancini’s substitutes. Santos loanee Luiz Felipe will start at the heart of Goias’ defence. CRB vs Goias Key Factors to Consider When Goias last travelled to Alagoas last season, Saturday’s guests collected a 1-0 victory. Leading the chase at the top of the Serie B table, Goias have registered 26 points from their first 11 appearances. CRB are unbeaten in all of their last six home fixtures across all competitions (five wins, one draw). Likewise, CRB have conceded just a single strike on that six-match unbeaten run in Alagoas. Shipping just six Serie B strikes so far this season, no second-tier outfit has conceded fewer goals since opening up the 2025 campaign. Conclusion Landing a gritty 1-0 victory when they travelled to Alagoas for a Serie B showdown last season, Goias will be desperately seeking a repeat performance here. However, despite the title contenders shipping just six Serie B goals since opening up the 2025 campaign, Saturday’s guests could face a rugged challenge this weekend. It should also be highlighted, with CRB conceding just a sole strike in any of their last six consecutive showdowns at the Rei Pele, don’t be surprised to see chances come at a real premium.
