  "text": "Fran Kirby has announced her retirement from international football ahead of Women’s Euro 2025. The attacking midfielder has called time on her 11-year career with England, for whom she earned 77 caps and helped win the 2022 European Championship. Kirby, who was named in the Lionesses’ squad for their Nations League double-header against Portugal and Spain, had intended to retire from England duty at the conclusion of next month’s European Championship. However, the 31-year-old brought the announcement forward, after head coach Sarina Wiegman informed her she would not be part of the final party in Switzerland. “After being in the England team since I was 21, it’s time to close that chapter of my life,” Kirby said in a statement. “I didn’t ever want this day to come, but I cannot tell you how proud I am it happened. “It’s been the biggest honour to represent my country, one that I had only dreamt about as a young girl. “I’ve played with some incredible players, worked with some incredible managers, played in some amazing tournaments and have irreplaceable memories.” Fran Kirby has announced her international retirement with immediate effect. — Lionesses (@Lionesses) June 3, 2025 Kirby is the second player to call time on her England career before the tournament, with goalkeeper Mary Earps doing the same last week after losing the number one jersey to Hannah Hampton. The Brighton midfielder said her announcement came following an “emotional” discussion with Wiegman. “It is something I have been thinking about for over a year,” she told BBC Sport. “I knew this was going to be my last major tournament. “The plan was to retire after the Euros, but after speaking to Sarina, I’m not going to make the squad. “It was like a dagger to my heart, but also a weight off my shoulders all at the same time. It was emotional for both of us, but we both respected what each person was saying.”",
