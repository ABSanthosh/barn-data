  "text": "Under-pressure Borussia Dortmund boss Nuri Sahin remained optimistic ahead of his side’s Champions League clash at Bologna despite their poor Bundesliga form. Sahin watched on as Dortmund were beaten 2-0 by Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, marking their third consecutive defeat in the German top-flight. BVB sit 10th in the standings with 25 points, seven adrift of the top four and 20 behind leaders Bayern Munich, with their attention now turning to the Champions League. Dortmund have fared better in Europe this year as they aim to avenge their defeat in the competition’s showpiece match against Real Madrid at Wembley last June. Sahin’s side have taken 12 points from their six fixtures and occupy ninth place, just a point and a place behind the automatic qualification places for the knockout stages. Dortmund have only lost three of their last 16 matches in the first phase of the Champions League, although one of those did come in their last outing (2-3 v Barcelona). But Sahin was looking forward to their trip to the Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on Tuesday, hoping to restore some confidence among his squad against the Serie A side. “You can’t compare the Champions League with the Bundesliga, the stars are better aligned here,” Sahin said. “And hopefully tomorrow with a win we can take a big step towards the round of 16.” Stadio Renato Dall’Ara pic.twitter.com/PZqunWS5Fa — Borussia Dortmund (@BVB) January 20, 2025 “Of course, it affects each individual, but I don’t feel any pressure at all. We all have to deliver,” Sahin told reporters on Monday, referring to his side’s recent losing run. “It affects me personally. But I’m fine. I’m really looking forward to the game, and I’m confident. “We want to take a giant step and at the same time gain momentum for the Bundesliga.” Despite the growing criticism surrounding his team, Sahin backed his players and took responsibility for trying to turn around their slow start to the year. “I’ve never felt let down,” the 36-year-old said of his players. “I’m the coach, I have to lead the way. “Everyone knows that more has to come … We know what they can do. And we know what we want to do tomorrow.”",
