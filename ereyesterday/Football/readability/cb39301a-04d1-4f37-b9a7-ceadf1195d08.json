  "text": "Rio Ferdinand has warned Marcus Rashford there is “no way back for him” at Manchester United following Ruben Amorim’s comments on his professionalism. Rashford has not featured for United since a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League back on December 12. And following the Red Devils’ 1-0 win over Fulham last Sunday, Amorim suggested he would rather have goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital in his squad than Rashford. The comments came after Rashford had started strongly following Amorim’s appointment, netting three goals in six appearances under him across all competitions. Since, Rashford has expressed his desire to find a new challenge away from Old Trafford, and former United defender Ferdinand believes this month is the right time to move on. “If I was the player the manager said that about, my heart, my pride, my ego – it’s an embarrassment,” said Ferdinand on his Rio Presents YouTube channel. “For someone to question your application, to question you giving 100 per cent to the team, saying you’re lacking effort and taking shortcuts, that’s a damning comment. “There’s no way back for Marcus after that. If he does come back, that means other players can take their foot off the gas and have a way back into the team and take shortcuts.” Rashford has been with United since 2005, bursting onto the scene 10 years later with two goals in the Europa League against Midtjylland on his first-team debut. The England international has since gone on to make 426 appearances for the Red Devils across all competitions, netting 138 goals and laying on a further 63 assists. Ferdinand knows the quality that Rashford possesses, but felt the 27-year-old would have made a public statement if Amorim’s latest comments were incorrect. “For me, if it isn’t true, I’m coming out all guns blazing. I’m holding a press conference and saying ‘I’m not having anyone say that about me’,” said Ferdinand. “You only do that if you are 100 per cent sure that nobody can say you’re taking shortcuts. “We’re in an era where you have the ability to really communicate with the fans directly so the story is not getting twisted. “I would love to sit across the table from Marcus and look into his eyes and see if he could say that. If you can’t, you have to look at yourself.”",
