  "text": "Atalanta have key players missing, but Gian Piero Gasperini was in no mood to look for excuses ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Club Brugge. Last season’s Europa League champions Atalanta will go head-to-head with Brugge over two legs for a place in the last 16. With key players missing in defence and attack, the Italian side will once again turn to goalkeeper Rui Patricio, who has started their previous two league matches following first-choice keeper Marco Carnesecchi’s thigh injury. “Rui Patricio will play. We brought Carnesecchi but he is not at his best,” Gasperini told reporters. “We have had some excellent performances but unfortunately, the issue of injuries has an impact. In all teams there are these particular periods, with many games in quick succession. “We need to make up for some absences, maybe we will soon recover [Ademola] Lookman and defender [Sead] Kolasinac. In 10 days they have missed four games.” Charles #BruggeAtalanta #GoAtalantaGo pic.twitter.com/pC6ZANozFC — Atalanta B.C. (@Atalanta_BC) February 11, 2025 Their injury crisis deepened as defender Giorgio Scalvini and forward Gianluca Scamacca were ruled out for the remainder of the season with shoulder and thigh injuries respectively. The Europa League champions narrowly missed automatic qualification for the competition’s last 16, ending the new-look league phase in ninth place after finishing with a 2-2 draw at Barcelona. “Let’s go back to the formula of the old Champions League, with the return leg. Playing it at home may seem like a small advantage,” Gasperini added. “Undoubtedly playing many games in Europe, and at a high level, has given us good growth and a better approach to matches, even away. But every time it’s different, the emotion is different in every match.” When asked about Atalanta’s chances of advancing, Gasperini remained cautious. “I don’t believe in predictions, they are of little use,” Gasperini said. “From what I’ve seen several times, we’re facing a tactically prepared team, a team used to winning. With Manchester City they played defensively, always maintaining the team concepts. “It will be difficult to face them. We’ll have to play well, they know how to stay close in a few metres, they have good individuality and intensity.”",
