  "text": "Vincent Kompany described Bayern Munich’s performance as “complete” after they put themselves on the brink of Bundesliga glory with Saturday’s 4-0 thrashing of Heidenheim. Harry Kane, Konrad Laimer and Kingsley Coman struck to put Bayern 3-0 up on their relegation-threatened hosts inside 36 minutes, while Joshua Kimmich added a fourth. The victory took Kompany’s team nine points clear of defending champions Bayer Leverkusen – who face St. Pauli on Sunday – with just four rounds of the season remaining. That means that should results elsewhere go in their favour, Bayern could clinch their record-extending 34th German title as early as next Saturday, when they host Mainz. And despite Heidenheim being 16th in the table and currently bound for the relegation play-off, Kompany was keen to lavish praise upon his players. “I know that now afterwards everyone will say that it’s normal for Bayern that we win here like this,” Kompany, whose Bayern side suffered a Champions League exit in midweek at the hands of Inter, told reporters. “But if you look at the last games of Heidenheim like against Bayer Leverkusen, and how difficult that was for the opponents, then I knew that it wouldn’t be easy. “It was a complete performance, that’s of course a big compliment for the boys after the somewhat difficult week.”",
