  "text": "Erling Haaland endured a miserable outing as Norway captain, with his goal-scoring exploits powerless in stopping Austria claim a thumping 5-1 win in their Nations League clash. Haaland, standing in for injured skipper Martin Odegaard, watched on as his nation suffered a second-half collapse at the Raiffeisen Arena on Sunday. The Manchester City striker became Norway’s all-time top scorer with a brace in their 3-0 win over Slovenia in midweek, taking his total to 34 goals in 36 games, and threatened to add to that tally when he struck the post early on. However, a dominant start by the hosts was rewarded when Marko Arnautovic thundered his side in front in the eighth minute with a fierce effort off the crossbar. Norway found themselves level six minutes before half-time when Alexander Sorloth headed Julian Ryerson’s free-kick beyond the on-rushing Patrick Pentz. Andreas Hanche-Olsen’s foul on Christoph Baumgartner inside the box proved to be the beginning of the end for Norway after the break, with Arnautovic stepping up to score the resulting penalty. Austria increased their lead soon after through Philipp Lienhart’s header, with Stefan Posch nodding the hosts 4-1 in front after being picked out at the back post by Marcel Sabitzer. The rout was complete in the 71st minute, with Sabitzer again the architect, teeing up Michael Gregoritsch for yet another header to send Austria joint-top of Group B3 alongside Norway.
