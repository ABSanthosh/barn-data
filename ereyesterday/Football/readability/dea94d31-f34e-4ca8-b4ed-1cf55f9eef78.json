Inzaghi, the former AC Milan and Juventus star and the brother of former Inter and current Al-Hilal coach Simone, led Pisa to promotion from Serie B in 2024-25. Yet instead of staying on to oversee Pisa’s first season in Serie A in over 30 years, Inzaghi quit his post on Friday after less than a year in charge. The 51-year-old has now signed a multi-year contract with Palermo, who have reportedly paid a €1m release clause to secure his services.

(@Palermofficial) June 17, 2025 Palermo finished eighth in Serie B last season, one point short of the play-offs but six places behind Pisa. They will be the ninth club Inzaghi has coached. Inzaghi won 23 of the 39 games he oversaw at Pisa (59%). In total, Inzaghi has coached 355 games, winning 149. If three points were awarded for every win, he would average 1.5 points per game.",
