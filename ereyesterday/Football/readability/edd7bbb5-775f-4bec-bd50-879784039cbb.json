The Rapids played out an entertaining 3-3 draw with the New England Revolution last time out, but were left disappointed having let a three-goal lead slip from their grasp. Maximiliano Urruti’s equaliser in the third minute of second-half stoppage time stopped the Rapids from recording back-to-back league wins for the first time since mid-May. But Armas lauded his team for their efforts at the Gillette Stadium, and he is hoping to put on a show for the Colorado supporters to push them up the Western Conference table. “Obviously a big game for us coming up,” Armas said. “What those three points would mean to us, especially at home in front of our fans on the Fourth of July, it should be a really spectacular event. “I know it’s the biggest fireworks display in Colorado, so with the festivities before the game, hopefully during the game, and then after the game, I think it sets up to be a really good night for us. “But we want to take from these last few games. We’ve scored seven goals in two games. Two didn’t count against the Galaxy, but we’ve got our attack moving a little bit. “Of course, we would have loved all the points in New England, but I was proud of the way the guys stepped on the pitch. We went out to win, that was clear. The guys said we are at home on any field, and I love to hear this.” Get ready for a Friday full of food fútbol and fireworks Celebrate the holiday with the largest public fireworks show in the state, happening only at DICK’S Sporting Goods Park! Rapids fans, plan to arrive early to avoid crowds and please drive safely when leaving. — Colorado Rapids (@ColoradoRapids) July 1, 2025 Sporting Kansas also played out a draw in their last MLS fixture, sharing the spoils against Real Salt Lake at Children’s Mercy Park. Former Kansas star Johnny Russell had given his new team the lead before Erik Thommy netted a 59th-minute equaliser to leave them eighth in the standings. And despite dropping points, Kansas’ interim head coach Kerry Zavagnin was left impressed by his team’s never-say-die attitude, having watched his side play out the closing stages of the match with a man less following Jake Davis’ red card. “I think we got off to an OK start, but as the half went on it felt like our shape and our energy became a bit disorganised. The goal that was scored before half-time by Salt Lake was deserved because they were on us,” Zavagnin said. “The half-time adjustments we made added something to the game which changed a little bit of our formation, which we changed three times. I think once we shifted a little bit in the midfield, we got a bit more of the game. “So, it’s just another example that we have a group who never gives up, and it’s a credit to them and what their mentality is because on the day, you’re not going to be perfect in any game. “I truly believe on the day we gave our best effort. It wasn’t our best performance but we gave our best effort, especially in the second half.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Colorado Rapids – Darren Yapi Yapi had two assists in Colorado’s draw with New England, becoming the second Rapids player this season with a multi-assist game (Oliver Larraz, two against FC Dallas). Prior to the Rapids’ last game, the American had just two career assists in his 79 career MLS matches (regular season \u0026 playoffs). Sporting KC – Manu Garcia Garcia has delivered an assist in four consecutive games, tied for the second-longest assist streak in MLS this season (Antony – five straight between April and May). He is the first Sporting Kansas player to have four straight league matches with an assist within one season since Benny Feilhaber had also grabbed four in a row in 2016. MATCH PREDICTION: COLORADO RAPIDS WIN Colorado and Sporting Kansas will meet for the fourth time on U.S. Independence Day (2003, 2005, 2024) with the Rapids winning all three previous matches. Colorado are SKC’s most common Fourth of July opponent, while the Rapids have only faced off with the New York Red Bulls more on the holiday (five times). The Rapids also have 14 victories in their 26 all-time Independence Day matches (D5 L7). That is the second-most Fourth of July wins by any MLS team, behind only the LA Galaxy’s 15. Sporting Kansas, however, are unbeaten in each of their last four matches in which they have trailed at half-time (W1 D3). They have not had a longer such streak since a six-game run in the 2011 season. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Colorado Rapids – 41.9% Draw – 26.7% Sporting KC – 31.4%",
