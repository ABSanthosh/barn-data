Los Colchoneros had a chance to go top ahead of Barcelona hosting Real Sociedad on Sunday, after Real Madrid lost 2-1 at Real Betis earlier on Saturday. Diego Simeone’s side went close to taking the lead in the first half through Alexander Sorloth, who sent a header off-target from Antoine Griezmann’s pass. But Alvarez, who came on for Sorloth just before the hour mark, scored the winner in the 66th minute with a precise left-footed shot after being played through by Marcos Llorente. Simeone’s side top LaLiga with 56 points, two clear of title rivals Barcelona and Madrid, while they also face the latter in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday. Athletic stay fourth on 48 points, six behind Madrid and four clear of Villarreal. pic.twitter.com/QoeYCvS8GQ — Atlético de Madrid (@atletienglish) March 1, 2025 Data Debrief: Super sub lifts Atleti again Alvarez’s winner on Saturday was the 16th goal they have scored through substitutes in LaLiga this season. Not only is that a division-high figure, but it is also the most by any team in one of Europe’s top five leagues, ahead of Lazio with 14.",
