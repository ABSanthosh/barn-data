  "text": "Tottenham midfielder Lucas Bergvall has signed a new contract with the club, less than a year after his arrival, to run until 2031. Spurs struck an £8.5million deal to sign Bergvall from Swedish Allsvenskan side Djurgarden in February 2024, though he did not join the Premier League club until July. The 19-year-old has wasted little time in nailing down a spot in Ange Postecoglou’s plans, having appeared 45 times across all competitions in his debut season. Only four players have appeared in more games for Spurs this season – Pape Sarr (49), Pedro Porro, Brennan Johnson and Dejan Kulusevski (all 46). Bergvall has made 21 of his appearances from the bench, though he has still made an impact, recently becoming a regular starter in midfield and scoring his first goal for the club in a 1-0 first-leg win over Liverpool in the EFL Cup semi-finals in January. Though Spurs ultimately exited that competition with a 4-0 second-leg defeat, they retain a chance of silverware in the Europa League, with Bodo/Glimt their semi-final opponents. Ahead of the first leg of that tie on Thursday, Spurs announced Bergvall had agreed fresh terms, having signed a deal to run until 2029 when he first arrived. “I’m really excited and grateful to everyone who helped me and for the journey to continue.” Lucas Bergvall pic.twitter.com/h7X0iNs3fT — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) April 29, 2025 “I’m really excited and grateful to everyone who helped me, and for the journey to continue”, the teenager told Spurs’ media channels. “It’s a club with great ambition. I’m really enjoying being here and playing for this amazing football club. I worked really hard for this and, with help from my team-mates and the staff, I’ve developed a lot this season.”",
