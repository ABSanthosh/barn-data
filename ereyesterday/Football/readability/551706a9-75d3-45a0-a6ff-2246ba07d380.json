The match between the Gunners and the Cherries will be held at the Emirates Stadium in North London and is scheduled to kick off at 5:30pm UK time on Saturday May 3. Arsenal Arsenal started the season aiming to win the Premier League title, but once again, they have failed to sustain their challenge until the final weeks of the campaign. Liverpool have already won the title, with the Gunners now aiming to finish second. Mikel Arteta’s side are second in the Premier League table at the moment with 67 points from 34 matches. Arsenal are five points ahead of third-placed Newcastle United and are six points clear of fourth-placed and last season’s Premier League champions Manchester City. Arsenal will take on Paris Saint-Germain at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday before facing Bournemouth at home in the league. The Gunners played out a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium on April 23, which followed a 4-0 hammering of Ipswich Town away from home in the league. Team News: Arsenal are likely to line up in a 4-3-3 formation against Bournemouth. David Raya will be in goal for the North London outfit. Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Jakub Kiwior and Myles Lewis-Skelly will be the four defenders. Martin Odegaard, Thomas Partey and Declan Rice will be the three midfielders. Raheem Sterling, Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli will be the three forwards. Bournemouth Bournemouth are a modest club who play their home games in a modest stadium with a modest capacity, but the Cherries are doing well this season. Andoni Iraola’s side finished 12th in the Premier League table last season and could end up in the top half of the standings this time around. The Cherries are 10th in the Premier League table at the moment with 50 points from 34 matches. Bournemouth are 10 points behind sixth-placed Nottingham Forest and are now unlikely to end up in the UEFA Champions League places in the standings. Bournemouth will head into the Premier League game against Arsenal away from home at the Emirates Stadium in North London on May 3 on the back of a 1-1 draw with Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium in the league. It came after a goalless draw with Bournemouth away from home at Selhurst Park in London in the league, which came after 1-0 victory over Fulham in front of their fans in the Premier League. Team News: Bournemouth are likely to line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation against Arsenal. Kepa Arrizabalaga will be in goal for the Gunners. Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez will be thefour defenders. Tyler Adams and Alex Scott will be the two holding midfielders. Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert and Dango Ouattara will be deployed in attacking midfield. Daniel Jebbison will lead the line for the Cherries. Key Factors to Consider Kai Havertz is Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League this season with 9 goals in 21 appearances. Arsenal have won 3 of their last 6 Premier League matches. Arsenal have lost 3 Premier League matches all season. Arsenal have scored 63 goals and conceded 29 goals in 34 Premier League matches this campaign. Bournemouth have won 1 of their last 6 Premier League games. Bournemouth have scored 53 goals and conceded 41 goals in 34 Premier League matches this campaign. Conclusion With Bournemouth in dire form at the moment and Arsenal having a better team, the North London club should be able to pick up all three points against the Cherries with ease.  Prediction: Arsenal to win 3-0 Best Odds: 12/1 Bookmaker: Zetbet",
