The first leg of the Round of 16 tie between the Belgian Pro League club and the Premier League outfit will be held at the Jan Breydelstadion and is scheduled to kick off at 5:45pm UK time on Tuesday. Club Brugge Club Brugge are a modest club in European terms, but they are one of the biggest teams in Belgium. Nicky Hayen’s side won the Belgian Pro League last season and are in with a chance of winning it again. Blauw-Zwart beat Aston Villa at the Jan Breydelstadion in the League Stage of the UEFA Champions League. Club Brugge needed to go through the playoffs to progress to the last 16, and they will back themselves to go a step forward. Club Brugge manager Hayen said: “We don’t have a specific way of stopping them (recent Villa signings Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio). “We are not going to point to one player because they have more than just Rashford and Asensio as quality players. “Before they joined they still had really good results. It doesn’t change. They have more quality now in their squad which makes them stronger than before. “Individually, they have a lot of quality, but they are often the same. They bring intensity and will bring lots of offensive quality.” Team News: Club Brugge are likely to line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation against Aston Villa. Mignolet will be in goal. Seys, Ordonez, Mechele and De Cuyper will be in defence. Jashari and Vetlesen will be the two holding midfielders. Talbi, Vanaken and Tzolis will be the three attacking midfielders. Jutgla will lead the line for the Belgian club. Aston Villa Aston Villa are one of the biggest clubs in England who are a force to be reckoned with under former Arsenal manager Unai Emery. The Spaniard led the Villans to the Premier League top four last season, and there is a very distinct possibility that they could do the same this time around. Villa’s recent form, though, has not been great and they will have to step up their game if they are to progress further in the UEFA Champions League this season. The Villans did extremely well to finish in the Round of 16 in Europe’s premier club competition this season. Villa manager Emery said: “When we played here [at Jan Breydel Stadium in the league phase] we weren’t competing like I want to do. The players know and we analysed why we didn’t compete in that moment like we can hopefully do [Tuesday]. “Firstly is knowing them better and trying to compete, stopping them – collectively, in their game plan, individually. And then trying to get the best of us in our structure, in our game plan, feeling comfortable in our positions.  “Then, playing football is the next step tomorrow, trying to do our best being motivated, being excited, getting balance emotionally and playing good football.” Team News: Aston Villa are likely to line up in a 4-2-3-1 formaton against Club Brugge. Emiliano Martinez will be in goal for the Premier League club. Axel Disasi, Ezri Konsa, Pau Torres and Lucas Digne will be the four defenders. John McGinn and Youri Tielemans will be he two holding midfielders. Morgan Rogers, Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford will be the three attacking midfielders. Ollie Watkins will lead the line for the Villans. Key Factors to Consider Club Brugge have won 2 of their last 3 UEFA Champions League games. Club Brugge have won 3 of their last 6 matches in all competitions. Aston Villa have won 3 of their last 6 UEFA Champions League games. Aston Villa have lost just 1 of their last 6 matches in all competitions. Ollie Watkins has scored 12 goals in 28 matches for Aston Villa. Conclusion Club Brugge have done well in the UEFA Champions League this season and will fancy their chances of winning the first leg at home, especially as they beat Aston Villa in front of their fans in the league phase. However, Villa have a better team and should eke out a narrow win in Belgium. Prediction: Aston Villa to win 2-1 Best Odds: 15/2 Bookmaker: Zetbet",
