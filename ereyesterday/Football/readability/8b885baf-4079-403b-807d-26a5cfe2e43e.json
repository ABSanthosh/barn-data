  "text": "Verdict: Florian Wirtz over 0.5 shots on target  Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Luckster In what is a heavyweight Bundesliga showdown on Friday night, Borussia Dortmund will welcome Bayer Leverkusen to Signal Iduna Park. Borussia Dortmund Starting with the hosts, heading into Germany’s festive break with a 3-1 victory away at Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. With their still mounting pressure on Nuri Sahin’s shoulders, BVB have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability this season. Marking their return on Friday night with just their goal difference keeping them in the top-six, Dortmund have recorded just a single win from any of their last five appearances across all competitions. Failing to collect back-to-back domestic victories so far this season, Sahin’s camp have also shown some glaring defensive issues. Including an action-packed 3-2 defeat at the hands of Spanish giants Barcelona last month, Friday’s hosts have recorded just a sole domestic clean sheet since the end of August. Borussia Dortmund Team News Shown a straight red card against Wolfsburg prior to Germany’s festive break, former Brighton midfielder Pascal Gross will miss out through suspension here. However, despite dealing with a knock last month, former Bayern Munich star Marcel Sabitzer should make a full return on Friday night. While Netherlands international Donnell Malen might be linked with a Premier League switch during the January transfer window, the 25-year-old should feature this weekend. Notching 12 goals across all competitions since arriving from Stuttgart last summer, Serhou Guirassy will lead the line in rural Germany. Bayer Leverkusen As for the visitors, while Bayer Leverkusen might have endured a stuttering start when getting proceedings underway back in August, the defending champions have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Last seen signing off 2024 with a real statement of intent as they cruised their way to a 5-1 romp against Freiburg, Xabi Alonso’s men are riding a stellar wave of momentum. Including a 1-0 victory against Inter Milan last month, Friday’s guests have won each of their previous eight consecutive appearances across all competitions. With that purple patch stemming all the way back to a 1-1 stalemate against Bochum on November 9th, Leverkusen will be looking to collect another heavyweight scalp here. Marking their return this weekend sat four points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich, Alonso’s camp will be desperate to make up some ground in the title chase. Bayer Leverkusen Team News Dealing with a long-term thigh injury and not making a single Bundesliga appearance since returning from November’s international break, Victor Boniface remains on the sidelines. Likewise, Morocco international Amine Adil will not travel to rural Germany this weekend. Bagging four goals against Freiburg prior to Germany’s festive break, Patrik Schick will lead the line on Friday night. Already recording 15 direct Bundesliga goal contributions this season and cementing his spot as one of Europe’s hottest young starlets, Florian Wirtz will partner Schick in the final third. Borussia Dortmund vs Bayer Leverkusen Key Factors to Consider When Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen last met back in April 2024, Friday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate in rural Germany. The defending Bundesliga champions have won each of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. BVB have recorded just a single victory from any of their last five showdowns across all fronts. Friday’s hosts have recorded just a single domestic clean sheet since the end of August. Seven of the last nine Bundesliga meetings between Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Heading into Germany’s festive break in the midst of a real purple patch, Bayer Leverkusen will simply be looking to carry on from where they left off prior to the interval. Winning each of their previous eight appearances across all competitions, the defending champions will meet a Dortmund squad who are desperately seeking some kind of stability. Showing a string of glaring defensive issues and with just their goal difference keeping them inside the top-six, Sahin’s squad should be bracing themselves for what will be another heavyweight challenge this weekend.
