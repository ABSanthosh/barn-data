  "text": "Nuno Espirito Santo believes Nottingham Forest’s comeback victory over Aston Villa – which lifted them into the Premier League’s top four – was a statement result. Forest looked set to be leapfrogged by Villa when Jhon Duran’s second-half header put Unai Emery’s men ahead at the City Ground, but two late goals turned the game on its head. Nikola Milenkovic levelled with a powerful header in the 87th minute, then substitute Anthony Elanga swept home in the 94th minute to hand Forest three huge points. They now sit fourth in the table ahead of Manchester City’s clash with Manchester United on Sunday. With 28 points from 16 games, they have made their best start to a top-flight campaign since 1994-95, when they had the same number at this stage and finished third. Following Forest’s fourth win in their last five home league games, Nuno praised his players for the mental resilience they showed after falling behind. “It is a big moment. It is a huge moment. After the team went down the reaction was good,” Nuno told Sky Sports. “The players gave everything and had a desire to go beyond football. “The fans were a big part in the game today. They helped the team and it goes beyond football, moments like this. It is about the heart and desire of the boys. “We played against a very good team. After the goal, the game opened up and the spaces were there. “It pleases me and I give huge credit to them. I gave them another day off! It is easier to work on good results.” Forest emerged as the winning side despite trailing after 86 minutes and 14 seconds – the latest they have ever been behind in a Premier League game before going on to win. They go to Brentford next week before hosting Tottenham on Boxing Day, which could prove to be a vital matchup as they battle for European qualification. “We try try every day to build something nice that we can identify with the club, with the city,” Nuno continued. “It is an important moment that we feel when things go against you and you react… that is what I appreciate the most. “I think it is about enjoying. We are working very hard. We are working with clear plans of improvement and building the team. “We are competing with all the clubs. Our way is about organisation and belief. It is about taking advantage of the moment we have, and the boys did well today.”",
