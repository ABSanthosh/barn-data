  "text": "As relayed by Fabrizio Romano, agent Nedal Huoseh, who represents Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies, has played down the rumours that the Canadian left-back had already decided to join Real Madrid at the end of the season. As things stand at the moment, Davies will run out of contract at Bayern next summer, and Real Madrid are reportedly interested in signing him as a free agent. Media in Spain, as they usually do when Real are pursuing a player, recently declared that everything was agreed and that the 24-year-old will join Los Blancos. However, Househ has made it perfectly clear that it’s not true that his client has made any decision as of yet. Joining Real remains, of course, an option for Davies, but so does moving elsewhere, or signing a new contract at Bayern.",
