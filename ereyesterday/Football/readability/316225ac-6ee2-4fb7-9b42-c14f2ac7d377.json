  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Luckster Seeking a much-welcomed Serie B boost in the early hours of Tuesday, Cuiaba will welcome Botafogo to the Arena Pantanal. Cuiaba Starting with the hosts, while Cuiaba might still have their sights set on booking an immediate Serie A return this season, Guto Ferreira’s men are seeking a recent boost. Last seen falling to what was a routine 2-0 loss away at Coritiba, the Mato Grosso-based outfit have now suffered consecutive defeats on a second occasion since the middle of May. However, getting Tuesday’s showdown underway sat within touching distance of breaking into the promotion spots, Cuiaba will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Including a 1-0 victory against relegation scrappers Paysandu earlier in the month, Ferreira’s camp have won four of their last five matchups at the Arena Pantanal – a run that stems back to a 2-2 stalemate against Avai on April 11th. Cuiaba Team News Picking up what was a costly first-half booking away at Coritiba last week, academy graduate Jadson will serve a one-match suspension here. Likewise, yet to make a single Serie B appearance since opening up the 2025 campaign, former DC United striker Yamil Asad remains on the sidelines. Making his first-debut debut last week, 20-year-old Victor Barbara could get some more minutes under his belt. Arriving from Vasco ahead of the 2025 campaign, De Lucca will start in the middle of the park on Tuesday. Botafogo SP As for the visitors, managing to make a welcomed return to winning ways last time out as they snatched a 1-0 victory at home against Chapecoense, Botafogo will be desperate to use that gritty performance as a platform to build on. However, despite clinging to their Serie B status last season, Marcio Zanardi’s side once again find themselves at the heart of a relegation scrap. Putting just 13 points on the board in as many appearances since opening the 2025 campaign, Botafogo have also shown some extended issues in the final third. Along with registering just a single strike in over 270 minutes of action, Tuesday’s guests have also failed to record more than a single strike in six of their last seven second-tier outings. Botafogo SP Team News Both serving respective one-match suspensions against Chapecoense last time out, the duo of Sabit Abdulai and Jonathan Cafu will return to Zanardi’s travelling squad here. However, yet to make a single Serie B appearance so far this season, ex-Coritiba midfielder Gustavo Bochecha remains on the sidelines. Recording three goals in his last four appearances, former Fluminense youngster Alexandre Jesus will shoulder plenty of Botafogo’s goalscoring threat in the early hours of Tuesday. Making his senior Serie B debut last week, 20-year-old Cadu should keep his spot from the start. Cuiaba vs Botafogo SP Key Factors to Consider When Cuiaba and Botafogo last met back in December 2020, Tuesday’s hosts collected a 2-0 victory at the Arena Pantanal. Cuiaba have won four of their previous five appearances in front of their own supporters. Likewise, Tuesday’s hosts have recorded three clean sheets in their last four matchups at the Arena Pantanal. Along with registering just a single strike in over 270 minutes of action, Botafogo have also failed to record more than a single strike in six of their last seven second-tier outings. Only one of the last six meetings between Cuiaba and Botafogo has finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Two camps who have drastically failed to find any kind of fluidity in the final third, we look set for a cagey Serie B showdown in the early hours of Tuesday. With Cuiaba drawing consecutive second-tier blanks, don’t be surprised to see chances come at a real premium here. Watching Botafogo register just a sole strike in over 270 minutes of action, Tuesday’s opponents also have a habit of producing low-scoring outcomes when they meet. With just one of their last six meetings finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome in Mato Grosso. Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Luckster",
