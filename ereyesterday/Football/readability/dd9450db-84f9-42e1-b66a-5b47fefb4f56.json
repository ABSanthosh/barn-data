With Milos Kerkez edging closer to a £45million move to the Premier League champions from Bournemouth, La Liga club Atletico believe that the door has opened for them to bring Scotland international left-back Robertson. Robertson is in the final 12 months of his contract at Liverpool. Although a brilliant player for the Reds over the years, the Scotsman was far from his best last season, despite Arne Slot’s side winning the Premier League title and also reaching the final of the Carabao Cup. Kerkez is one of the best young left-backs in the Premier League and is keen on a move to Liverpool. Bournemouth already have a replacement ready for the Hungarian star. Rennes left-back Adrien Truffert has agreed personal terms with the Cherries and will cost the Premier League club £15 million in transfer fees.",
