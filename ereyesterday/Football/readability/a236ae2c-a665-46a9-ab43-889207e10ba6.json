  "text": "Verdict: Over 1.5 goals Best Odds: 2/5 Bookmaker: Luckster Hoping to skyrocket their way back into the automatic promotion spots on Tuesday night, Doncaster will travel to Moor Lane when they meet Salford. Salford City Starting with the hosts, while Salford might have once again shown some inconsistencies this season, Karl Robinson’s men have turned a recent corner. Opening Tuesday’s showdown sat five points adrift of finding a route into the play-off places, the Ammies face what appears to be a season-defining battle in midweek. Putting in an impressive performance over the weekend as they stormed their way to a 3-1 victory away at Notts County, the former MK Dons boss has seen his squad suffer just a single defeat from any of their previous eight League Two appearances. However, despite signing off March with an action-packed 3-2 win against Bromley, Salford have failed to find any kind of fluidity on home soil. Last seen at Moor Lane playing out a thrilling 2-2 stalemate against Gillingham, Robinson’s camp have mustered just a sole win from their seven matchups in front of their own supporters so far this calendar year. Salford City Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Salford will once again be without the likes of Kevin Berkoe, Kylian Kouassi and former West Ham youngster Dan Chesters. Oxford United loanee Stephan Negru could return to Robinson’s squad on Tuesday night. Finding the net away at Notts County over the weekend and now getting on the scoresheet in three of his previous four appearances, 20-year-old Kelly N’Mai will be looking to extend on his recent flurry. Former Everton defender Luke Garbutt will start at the back alongside Jamaican international Curtis Tilt. Doncaster Rovers As for the visitors, while Doncaster might have suffered play-off heartbreak last season, the Rovers have their sights firmly set on booking a League One return in 2025. However, despite travelling to Moor Lane on Tuesday night sat just one-point adrift of breaking into the automatic promotion spots, Grant McCann’s men are seeking some recent stability. Despite snatching a late 1-1 stalemate at home against AFC Wimbedlon over the weekend, the Yorkshire-based outfit have won just a pair of their previous seven appearances. Looking to lay down what would be a real statement of intent in midweek, Doncaster will be excited by their most recent trip to Salford. Landing a 2-0 victory as they extended on their EFL Cup adventure on August 13th, the former Peterborough boss will be desperately seeking a repeat performance here. Doncaster Rovers Team News Shown a late red card against AFC Wimbledon over the weekend just seconds after coming off the bench, former Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp will miss out through suspension. One-time Manchester United youngster Joseph Olowu could return to Doncaster’s squad. Despite turning 40 this summer, veteran defender Richard Wood should keep his spot at the heart of McCann’s defence. Completing a loan switch from Premier League giants Chelsea back in January, 22-year-old Teddy Sharman-Lowe will start between the sticks here. Salford City vs Doncaster Rovers Key Factors to Consider When Doncaster travelled to Moor Lane for an EFL Cup showdown on August 18th, the Rovers collected a 2-0 victory. However, Tuesday’s guests have won just a pair of their previous seven League Two appearances. Salford have suffered just a sole defeat from their previous eight League Two matchups. Each of Salford’s last four appearances have finished with both teams getting on the scoresheet. 20-year-old Kelly N’Maihas found the net in three of his previous four League Two appearances. Conclusion Desperate to skyrocket their way into the automatic promotion spots on Tuesday night, Doncaster face what could be a season-defining showdown here. Although the Rovers might have mustered just a pair of wins from any of their last seven appearances, McCann’s men will certainly be excited by their most recent trip to Salford. Landing a 2-0 victory when they travelled to Moor Lane for an EFL Cup tie back on August 18th, Doncaster will be seeking a repeat display here.
