The Timbers have endured a rough start to the 2025 season, winning just one of their four games so far, leaving them 12th in the Western Conference. They gave up a lead in their 1-1 draw with struggling LA Galaxy last weekend, and Neville acknowledged there are still elements of Portland’s game that need to be fine-tuned. “We’re a team that’s still learning,” he said. “We’re a team that needs to be a little more ruthless and show more courage on the ball. “Our defending is outstanding compared to last year. Everyone’s working for each other, but we give up too much ground and space.” On the road to the Rapids : Nature Unites : https://t.co/nEQobRtjuH pic.twitter.com/rWif6c7Eat — Portland Timbers (@TimbersFC) March 20, 2025 Colorado, meanwhile, are fourth in the table and have made an unbeaten start to MLS this season, with two wins and two draws so far. They have won their last two matches, both on the road, but had to fight back for a 3-3 draw against FC Dallas in their previous home outing. Head coach Chris Armas is looking forward to being back on home soil and expects the Timbers to give them a tough challenge, despite their rocky start. “We’re excited to get home and play in front of our fans,” Armas said. “Quite honestly, we’re excited for the match-up against Portland. “They put us in a tough game every time. They’re not only well coached, with Phil, but they have weapons up the pitch and are dangerous in transition, but they’re also organized and hard to break down. “It’ll be a good challenge for us. We’re looking forward to it.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Colorado Rapids – Adam Beaudry Zack Steffen earned plaudits last weekend as he only allowed one goal against the San Jose Earthquakes despite Colorado conceding 21 shots inside the box.

The Rapids have never collected more than 10 points from their first five matches of a season before (10 in 2010, 2014 and 2021). The Timbers, meanwhile, have won only two of their last 18 away matches in all competitions (D6 L10) dating back to mid-March 2024, including going winless in eight straight on the road (D3 L5). Portland have not gone more than eight straight away games without a win in all competitions since a 16-match run in 2016.
