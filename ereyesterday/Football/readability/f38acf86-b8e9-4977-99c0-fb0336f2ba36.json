  "text": "Ten-player Germany beat France 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to seal their place in the semi-finals of Euro 2025. Ann-Katrin Berger made herself the hero with two saves, the second of which ensured Germany’s progression to the last four. Berger was in fine form throughout, making 11 stops in total after Kathrin Hendrich received the earliest ever red card in a match at the Women’s Euros. Germany’s goalkeeper was beaten from the spot in the 15th minute, when France were awarded a penalty after a VAR check revealed a hair-pull on Griedge Mbock from Hendrich. Grace Geyoro’s made no mistake from 12 yards, but her effort was cancelled out by Sjoeke Nusken’s header 10 minutes later. France duo Delphine Cascarino and Geyoro saw goals disallowed, while Nuskin missed a penalty of her own when Pauline Peyraud-Magnin made a great save low to her right. Having made an incredible save to prevent a possible own goal from Janina Minge in extra time, Berger had her crossbar to thank when Melvine Malard clattered the woodwork to send the game to penalties. Berger kept out Amel Majri’s awkward strike, but France equalised with their fourth spot kick after Sara Dabritz, who came on specifically to take a penalty, skied her shot while Sandy Baltimore buried hers. Yet Berger was the hero in sudden death, as she lunged to her left to deny Alice Sombath and tee up a mouthwatering clash with world champions Spain. GERMANY GO THROUGH!#WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/ogoJilNfk7 — UEFA Women’s EURO 2025 (@WEURO2025) July 19, 2025 Data Debrief: Brilliant Berger Berger’s nine saves across the 120 minutes were the second most on record by a goalkeeper in a Women’s Euros knockout match, behind Daphne van Domselaar for the Netherlands against France at this stage of Euro 2022 (11). Despite playing against 10 players from the 13th minute onwards and having 73% possession, France had just 13 shots and an xG total of 1.7 before this game went into extra-time, both totals lower than they recorded in any of their group stage matches. Geyoro was their bright spark, as she created four chances and had five touches in the box, a tally only bettered by Marie-Antoinette Katoto (nine). The midfielder’s penalty saw her become France’s all-time outright top goalscorer in the competition (five goals). Berger, though, will take the credit, and Germany have now reached the semi-finals of Euros for the seventh time since the format changed to introduce the group stage in 1997, two more times than any other nation.",
