  "text": "Verdict: Achraf Hakimi over 0.5 shots on target Best Odds: 20/21 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Looking to extend on their World Club Cup adventure on Sunday evening, PSG will travel to Atlanta when they meet Inter Miami this weekend. PSG Starting with PSG, making an immediate return to winning ways earlier in the week as they clinched a routine 2-0 victory against Seattle in Washington, Luis Enrique’s side find the mood in their camp at a continued high. Despite slipping to a shock 1-0 loss at the hands of Botafogo on June 20th, that result appears to be nothing more than a minor blip for the French giants. Making real history last month as they claimed a maiden piece of European silverware thanks to an iconic 5-0 romp against Inter Milan, PSG have shattered a string of records this calendar year. Completing a famous title sweep across all fronts this season, Enrique’s side have also gained a fearsome reputation for their free-scoring performances in the final third. PSG Team News While attacking talisman Ousmane Dembele might have missed all of PSG’s three Group B appearances this summer, the Ballon d’Or contender is expected to make a timely return on Sunday evening. Despite speculation over a summer move away from Paris, Bradley Barcola could be handed a first Club World Cup start here. Opening his Group B account against Seattle earlier in the week and making an immediate impact since arriving from Napoli back in January, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia could play a leading role in the final third. Expected to sign a new deal this summer, Italian skipper Gianluigi Donnarumma will start between the sticks. Inter Miami As for Inter Miami, while the Herons might have suffered last-gasp heartbreak earlier in the week as they eventually had to settle for a thrilling 2-2 stalemate against Palmeiras, Javier Mascherano’s side were able to follow the South American giants out of Group A. However, despite springing a famous upset on June 19th as they claimed a 2-1 win against Portuguese giants Porto, the Florida-based outfit will be bracing themselves for a monumental challenge on Sunday evening. Mustering consecutive victories across any competition on just a single occasion since the end of March, Inter Miami have also failed to find any real defensive steel. Mustering just a sole clean sheet from any of their last 13 straight outings, Mascherano’s camp couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge here. Inter Miami Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Inter Miami will once again be without the likes of David Ruiz, Yannick Bright and Drake Callender on Sunday evening. However, ex-Barcelona ace Jordi Alba could make a first Club World Cup start of the summer and replace Greek youngster Noah Allen at left-back. Opening his summer account with a sensational free-kick against Porto on June 19th, eight-time Ballon d’Or winner and former PSG superstar Lionel Messi will play a leading role in the final third. 20-year-old Benjamin Cremaschi could be handed a full recall in the middle of the park alongside Sergio Busquets. PSG vs Inter Miami Key Factors to Consider Sunday’s showdown in Atlanta will be the first meeting between PSG and Inter Miami. Including their iconic Champions League success on May 31st, PSG have won seven of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Inter Miami have recorded just a sole clean sheet from any of their last 13 straight outings. Georgian ace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has registered five direct goal contributions in as many appearances across all competitions. 11 of Miami’s last 12 matchups have finished with over 2.5 goals. Conclusion While Inter Miami might have sprung somewhat of an upset this summer as they edged out Porto in the race for a knockout stage ticket, the Herons couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge on Sunday evening. Rightfully travelling to Atlanta this weekend pencilled in as a landslide underdog, they meet a PSG squad who are in the midst of what has been a record-breaking flurry over the past few months. Storming their way to a first Champions League crown last month as they claimed that iconic 5-0 romp against Inter Milan in Munich, Enrique’s camp are smelling the chance to claim another immediate piece of silverware this summer.
