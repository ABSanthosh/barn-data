Putting in a rugged performance of foreign soil last week as they claimed a 1-0 victory at the Stade Louis II, the Portuguese giants are riding what has become a wave of momentum. Opening Tuesday’s return to Lisbon sat in the driving seat, Bruno Lage’s men will meet a Monaco squad that have continued to show some glaring inconsistencies. In what could prove to be another nail-biting Champions League showdown from the Estadio da Luz, we have taken a look at some of the most appealing Benfica vs Monaco bet builder tips. Benfica sitting pretty While Benfica might have suffered an infamous Champions League collapse last month as they eventually fell to a remarkable 5-4 loss in Lisbon, the Eagles have come roaring back in an impressive fashion. Enjoying what has become a real purple patch over the past month and opening Tuesday’s showdown holding a one-goal advantage, Lage’s side find the mood in their camp at a real high. Keeping up their recent flurry over the weekend as they clinched a 1-0 victory away at Santa Clara, the one-time Wolves boss has seen his squad win each of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Likewise, last seen at the Estadio da Luz landing an action-packed 3-2 win against Moreirense, Benfica have won three of their previous four showdowns in front of their own supporters. It should also be highlighted, Lage’s high-flying squad have registered 14 goals in those four straight appearances in Lisbon. Bet Builder Tip: Benfica win @ 19/20 with 1xBet   Pavlidis to play a leading role in Lisbon Although Vangelis Pavlidis might have initially struggled to find his feet after arriving from Dutch outfit AZ Alkmaar last summer, the Greek international has enjoyed a sensational flurry over the past month. Bagging Benfica’s first-leg winner at the Stade Louis II last week, the 26-year-old has quickly cemented his spot as Lage’s leading marksman in Lisbon. Notching a famous Champions League hat-trick at home against Barcelona on January 21st, Pavlidis has now recorded eight goals in his previous seven appearances across all competitions. Set to spearhead Benfica’s charge on Tuesday night, the former Bochum youngster has also gained a reputation for his free-scoring performances on home soil. Including a brace against Moreirense on February 8th, Pavlidis has bagged five goals in just his last two appearances at the Estadio da Luz. Bet Builder Tip: Vangelis Pavlidis to score anytime @ 6/4 with BetUS   Issues on the road haunt Monaco Making what was a much-welcomed return to winning ways over the weekend as they stormed their way to a 7-1 romp against Nantes, Monaco will be desperately seeking a repeat performance here. However, missing out on the chance to claim a first-leg advantage at the Stade Louis II last week, Ali Hutter’s men have a real challenge on their hands when they travel to Lisbon on Tuesday night. Slumping to a routine 4-1 drumming at the hands of domestic rivals PSG earlier in the month, the ex-Eintracht Frankfurt boss will have a real headache over his side’s extended issues on the road. Signing off their Champions League group stage adventure with a 3-0 loss against Italian heavyweights Inter Milan, Monaco have lost each of their last four away fixtures across all competitions. It’s also worth highlighting, Tuesday’s guests have won just a pair of their previous 14 Champions League showdowns away from the Stade Louis II. Bet Builder Tip: Benfica over 3.5 shots on target @ 4/11 with Dachbet Benfica vs Monaco Bet Builder Tips Benfica win Vangelis Pavlidis to score anytime  Benfica over 3.5 shots on target  ODDS – 5/1 with Vegas Land You can also visit our betting promotions section for the latest enhanced odds promos, accumulator bonuses and more.",
