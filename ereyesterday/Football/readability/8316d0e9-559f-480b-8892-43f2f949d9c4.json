The match itself was not a great spectacle with limited chances either way, as Cristiano Ronaldo’s 200th start for Portugal ultimately ended in disappointment. It was a performance of grit over style for Steve Clarke’s side, though, who managed just three shots during the match. Portugal came closest to finding the net, with Craig Gordon getting down expertly to stop Bruno Fernandes slotting home from a Rafael Leao cutback in the 87th minute. The draw leaves Scotland bottom of Nations League Group A1, although their first point means the gap to third-placed Poland stays at three points ahead of the two meeting in the November international break. Portugal, meanwhile, are top of the standings on 10 points and know a victory from their remaining two games will seal their progression to the quarter-finals, after maintaining their three-point buffer to second-placed Croatia following their 3-3 draw with Poland. FULL TIME: Scotland 0-0 Portugal. A resilient performance from every Scotland player on the park earns us a point at Hampden Park this evening.#SCOPOR pic.twitter.com/mJ2uH9fNjx — Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) October 15, 2024 Data Debrief: Scotland ruin Ronaldo’s landmark appearance Ronaldo made his 200th start for Portugal tonight, 21 years and four days after making his first start for the Selecao against Albania in October 2003. After scoring in each of Roberto Martinez’s first 12 competitive matches in charge of Portugal, the Selecao have since drawn a blank in four of their last seven matches under the Spaniard. Portugal attempted 715 passes tonight – their highest number in this Nations League campaign, with their 14 attempts the lowest they have managed in the competition this term, ending the contest with an expected goals (xG) total of 1.52. Scotland, meanwhile, are now winless in their last 10 competitive matches (D4 L6), their longest-ever run without a competitive victory, though they managed to keep a clean sheet against a team above them in the FIFA rankings for the first time since a 2-0 win over Spain in 2023.",
