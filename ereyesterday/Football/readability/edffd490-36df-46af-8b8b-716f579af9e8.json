  "text": "Competition: League One Market: Charlton win Odds: 7/10 @ 1xBet Looking to make up some ground in the play-off chase, Charlton will welcome Crawley to the Valley on Tuesday night. Starting with the hosts, while Charlton might have spent large spells of last season looking over their shoulder at a League One relegation scrap, Nathan Jones’ men are now dreaming of the chance to mount a play-off charge. Extending on their FA Cup adventure over the weekend as they stormed their way to a stellar 4-0 romp away at Walsall, the Addicks should find the mood in their camp at a real high. Signing off October with a 1-0 victory against Burton, the former Southampton boss will be desperate for his squad to make up some ground in the top-six chase. In fact, winning three of their previous four appearances across all competitions, the south London outfit have suffered just a pair of defeats from any of their last 10 consecutive outings. With that extended flurry stemming all the way back to October 1st, Jones’ side will also be excited by their continued success on home soil. Including a shock 1-0 win against Birmingham, Charlton have lost just one of their previous nine showdowns at the Valley. As for the visitors, although Crawley might have only made their League One return this season, the Red Devils have a real battle on their hands this time around. Scrapping it out at the foot of the League One table, Rob Elliot’s men hold just a single point buffer from dropping into the relegation zone. Suffering FA Cup heartbreak over the summer as they eventually fell to a 4-3 loss at home against Lincoln, the Sussex-based outfit should be bracing themselves for another stern challenge here. In fact, despite clinching a much-needed 1-0 victory against Rotherham last month, that is the only win that Tuesday’s guests have collected from any of their last nine appearances across all competitions within 90 minuets. Pencilled in as a real outside contender when they travel to the Valley in midweek, Crawley have also gained a reputation for their issues on the road. Including a 2-1 loss against Wycombe on November 12th, Elliot’s relegation scrappers have failed to muster a single League One victory on their travels. Bet: Charlton 7/10 to beat Crawley in Tuesday’s League One matchup @ 1xBet",
