  "text": "Arne Slot said Trent Alexander-Arnold’s celebration after scoring in Liverpool’s win at West Ham “told enough” about his commitment to the club. Alexander-Arnold netted Liverpool’s fourth goal in their 5-0 thrashing of the Hammers on Sunday, moving them eight points clear at the Premier League summit. The Reds have now scored 5+ goals in consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since October 2021, when they beat Watford and Manchester United 5-0. Much of the post-match talk revolved around the futures of Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and, most notably, Alexander-Arnold, who has been subject to recent speculation. The England international, who has made 333 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool since his debut in 2016, has been touted for a move to Real Madrid. After scoring his first goal of the season on Sunday, Alexander-Arnold celebrated by gesturing a talking motion with his hand. Asked whether the noise around Alexander-Arnold was the biggest concern of the trio, Slot believes that Alexander-Arnold’s celebration told everyone all they needed to know. “No, I don’t think it’s negative at all. He’s playing really well and scored a great goal,” Slot said. “The way he celebrated his goal probably tells you enough, so I don’t think I have to say much more about it. “I’m really happy with Trent, as happy as I am with Mo and with Virgil. For me, there’s no difference. “For the outside world, maybe there’s more happening around Trent with the media than the other two, but I’m happy with all three of them at the moment.” Each of Liverpool’s out-of-contract stars will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign sides from the start of next year. Salah has been the standout performer for the Reds this season, netting his 17th Premier League goal of the season, while also taking his assist tally to 13. He has both scored and assisted in eight different top-flight games for Liverpool this term, already the most any player has done so in a single campaign in the competition. The Egyptian has also now scored 20+ goals in all competitions in all eight of his seasons with Liverpool since his move from Roma back in 2017. Among Premier League players (since 1992-93), only Alan Shearer (10) and Harry Kane (nine) have had more 20+ goal campaigns than Salah. Van Dijk has also been in imperious form, helping Liverpool keep a joint division-high eight clean sheets (level with Nottingham Forest). Slot was asked whether the January transfer window changes anything at Anfield, and the Liverpool boss said that talks are guaranteed to happen at this time of the season. “Not on the inside but on the outside it definitely does,” Slot said. “People talk even more about it. Not just about these three but also about other players, because it’s a month when players can make a transfer as well. “So, this upcoming month, it’s probably not only about the three but about the players we can bring in or the ones that could leave. “That is always a thing in August and also in January.”",
