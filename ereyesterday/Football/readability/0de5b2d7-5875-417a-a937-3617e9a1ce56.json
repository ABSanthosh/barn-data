  "text": "Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League clash with Aston Villa is “like a final” as they aim to secure Champions League football next season. After winning the last four league titles during an unprecedented spell of domestic dominance, City’s goal this term is to earn a place back at European football’s top table. The Citizens sit fourth in the standings with five games remaining, while Villa are seventh, but just a point behind Tuesday’s opponents with several teams in the mix. Guardiola acknowledged the difficulty his side will face at the Etihad Stadium, and lauded Villa for their display in their Champions League second-leg loss to Paris Saint-Germain. “They are a contender to qualify for the Champions League,” said Guardiola. “You see the game they played against my friend Luis Enrique [PSG boss] – wow, I was really, really impressed. “They can play low block and play away, but when they decide to go, with the weapons they have, the speed they have, the set-pieces, they are incredibly well-organised. “It is a final and we need our people because I think our people want the Champions League again next season, and hopefully they can help us from the first minute. “Sometimes we are sloppy, sometimes we are not playing well, now we need them desperately to support us, to make noise and be there all the time, because it’s absolutely a final for us.” Villa, meanwhile, will be looking to build on their 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle United last time out, a result that has them right back in the European hunt. Unai Emery also had some positive words for his opposite number, but said his team are relishing the opportunity against last season’s champions. “We can’t stop,” Emery said. “We are involved in our key moment in the season. Through the Premier League, we are trying to get our first objective in 38 matches. “Tomorrow is day 34 against Manchester City, one of the teams contending to be in the top four or top five. They want to win the title, but this year has been more difficult for them. “My respect for them is massive, as always. We are ready. Every player and every worker here in Aston Villa is so, so focused in the moment we’re in.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Manchester City – Omar Marmoush While Marmoush is still waiting for his first away goal in the Premier League this season, he has found comfort at the Etihad Stadium since his January switch from Eintracht Frankfurt. He has scored six goals in his six home top-flight appearances for City so far, scoring every 81 minutes, while across his last 17 home league outings, including his time with Frankfurt, he has 14 goals and six assists. Aston Villa – Ollie Watkins In contrast, Watkins has had a hand in 48 away Premier League goals in 88 appearances (34 goals, 14 assists), including five in his last seven (four goals, one assist). Only Gabriel Agbonlahor has reached 50 or more goals and assists away from home for Villa (40 goals, 19 assists). MATCH PREDICTION: MANCHESTER CITY WIN City have won their last 14 Premier League home games against Villa, scoring at least twice in each of the last 13. Their last defeat was in April 2007 under Stuart Pearce. The Citizens have also won each of their last nine home Premier League matches in April by an aggregate score of 35-8. The last side to beat City at the Etihad in this month was Leeds United in a 2-1 win back in 2021. Across their 14 consecutive home Premier League wins against Villa, City have trailed in just two games, going 1-0 down in May 2010 and 2-0 down in May 2022 before winning 3-1 and 3-2 respectively. In Premier League history, only the Citizens themselves against Newcastle United (an ongoing run of 16) have won more consecutive home games against an opponent. But the Etihad is not the fortress it once was. Guardiola’s team have conceded 21 home Premier League goals this season, their most in a season since the 2015-16 campaign (also 21). They last conceded more on home soil in a season back in 2003-04 (24). Villa, meanwhile, have won two of their last three league games against Man City, as many as in their previous 23. They’re also looking to complete their first league double over the Citizens since 1962-63. The Villans have won their last three away Premier League matches, keeping a clean sheet in each. Their last longer away winning run was between November and February 2008-09 (seven), while they’ve never won four in a row without conceding in the top-flight. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Manchester City – 50% Draw – 23.1% Aston Villa – 26.8%",
