  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/15 Bookmaker: Luckster Turning their attention back to Bundesliga action on Friday night, Bayer Leverkusen will welcome Stuttgart to the BayArena. Bayer Leverkusen Starting with the hosts, while Bayer Leverkusen might have extended on their DFP Pokal adventure earlier in the week thanks to a 3-0 win against Elversberg, Xabi Alonso’s men have struggled to find much stability since opening up the new campaign. Currently sat five points adrift of climbing to the top of the Bundesliga table, the defending champions face what is certainly a must-win showdown on Friday night. However, eventually forced to settle for a lively 2-2 stalemate away at Werder Bremen last weekend, Leverkusen have now only collected a single point in three of their previous four showdowns against top-flight opposition. Heading into October’s international break with another action-packed 2-2 draw against Bundesliga returners Kiel, Alonso will also have a real headache over his side’s defensive struggles. In fact, Leverkusen have failed to record a single clean sheet from any of their first eight Bundesliga appearances. Team News Missing out against Werder Bremen last weekend, Morocco international Amine Adil remains a doubt on Friday night. Settling for a spot against Elversberg in midweek, German international and playmaking sensation Florian Wirtz will be handed a full recall at the BayArena. While Patrik Schick might have bagged a DFP Pokal brace earlier in the week, the 28-year-old will be replaced by Victor Boniface in the final third. veteran shot-stopper Lukas Hradecky will return between the sticks on Friday night. Stuttgart As for the visitors, while Stuttgart might have marked their return from October’s international break with a nightmare 4-0 drumming at the hands of Bayern Munich, Die Roten have claimed a much-welcomed boost over the past fortnight. Extending on their DFP Pokal adventure in midweek as they clinched a 2-1 victory against Kaiserslautern, Sebastian Hoeneb’s side have won all of their previous three appearances across all competitions. Springing what was a heavyweight Champions League upset last week as they clinched a famous 1-0 win away at Italian giants Juventus, Friday’s guests are desperate to make up some ground in the top-four chase. Putting just 12 points on the board from any of their first eight Bundesliga matchups across all competitions, the Reds have shown their own respective defensive issues. In fact, much like the defending champions, Stuttgart have failed to record a single top-flight clean sheet. Team News Shown a second-half red card against Kiel last weekend, summer recruit and ex-Koln defender Jeff Chabot will miss out through suspension here. Sustaining a long-term knee injury last month, former Borussia Dortmund star Dan-Axel Zagadou remains on the sidelines and will not play any part on Friday night. Making his move from Brighton a permanent one over the summer and already registering five Bundesliga strikes, Deniz Undav will lead Stuttgart’s charge. Recently returning to first-team training, Nikolas Nartey could be included in Hoeneb’s squad. Key Factors to Consider When Bayer Leverkusen and Stuttgart met in the German Super Cup back on August 17th, Friday’s hosts collected a penalties victory at the BayArena following a 2-2 draw. Likewise, when Friday’s opponents last met in Bundesliga action on April 27th, they played out another 2-2 stalemate at the BayArena. Each of the last five meetings between Bayer Leverkusen and Stuttgart have finished with both teams finding the net. The defending Bundesliga champions have failed to record a clean sheet from any of their first eight top-flight appearances. Stuttgart have also failed to put a single Bundesliga clean sheet on the board so far this season. Conclusion In a Bundesliga battle that tends to produce fireworks, neutrals will be hoping for another thriller from the BayArena. Two camps who have remarkably failed to put a single Bundesliga clean sheet on the board from any of their first eight attempts, chances could come thick and fast on Friday night. With all of their last five meetings finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome from the BayArena. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/15 Bookmaker: Luckster",
