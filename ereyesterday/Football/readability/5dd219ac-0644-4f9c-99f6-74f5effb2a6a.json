Tottenham Starting with the hosts, While Tottenham might still find themselves battling it out in the bottom-half of the Premier League table, Ange Postecoglou’s men have turned somewhat of a recent corner.

Watching their Champions League adventure come to an end on February 19th as they fell to a 6-3 aggregate defeats against Real Madrid, the Sky Blues have lost three of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Gaining an unwanted reputation for their defensive issues, City have also failed to find any kind of stability on their travels.

Manchester City Team News Not even named among Manchester City’s substitutes over the weekend, attacking talisman Erling Haaland remains a major doubt on Wednesday night. Likewise, Swiss defender Manuel Akanji remains on the sidelines with a long-term muscle issue. Notching a sensational Premier League hat-trick against Newcastle earlier in the month, January recruit Omar Marmoush will spearhead Guardiola’s side.
