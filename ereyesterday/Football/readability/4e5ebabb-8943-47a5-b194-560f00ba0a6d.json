  "text": "Competition: Chinese Super League Market: Beijing Guoan win Odds: 2/5 @ BetUS Looking to widen their buffer in the AFC Champions League spots on Tuesday lunchtime, Beijing Guoan will welcome Qingdao West Coast to the Workers Stadium. Starting with the hosts, marking their return from China’s month interval over the weekend with a 2-1 victory at home against Changchun Yatai, Beijing have enjoyed a sensational start to the 2025 campaign. Despite suffering real heartbreak last season as they missed out on a lucrative AFC Champions League ticket, Quique Setien’s men are sat firmly in the driving seat this time around. Opening Tuesday’s showdown sat just three points adrift of climbing to the top of the Super League standings, the Imperial Guard find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Extending on their FA Cup charge last month as they stormed their way to a routine 5-0 romp away at Shijiazhuang Gongfu, the one-time Barcelona boss has not seen his high-flying squad suffer a single defeat across any competition so far this season. Embarking on what has become quite the purple patch, Beijing will be confident of laying down another marker in midweek. As for the visitors, while Qingdao West Coast might have enjoyed their own bright start to proceedings back in February, the Yellows have struggled to find any real fluidity over recent times. Missing out on what they had billed as a potential opportunity last weekend as they marked their return with a 0-0 stalemate at home against Yunnan Yukun, Shao Jiayi’s men have claimed just a single win from any of their previous six Super League showdowns – a run that stems back to April 20th. Only holding a one-point buffer from slipping out the top-half of the table, Tuesday’s guests have also collected just a sole top-flight win on their travels so far this calendar year. Likewise, pencilled in as a major underdog in midweek, Qingdao should also be concerned by their most recent trip to the title contenders. Hit with a 4-1 drumming when they travelled to the Workers Stadium last season, we are backing a similar home victory here.
