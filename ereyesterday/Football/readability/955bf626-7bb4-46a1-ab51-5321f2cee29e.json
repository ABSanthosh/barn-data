  "text": "Unai Emery wants Aston Villa to be “protagonists” when they face Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. The Spaniard is gearing up for a “special and spectacular” return to Parc des Princes, where he spent two seasons in charge of PSG between 2016 and 2018. He does so with a Villa side full of momentum, having secured a top-eight finish, before cruising to a 6-1 aggregate victory over Club Brugge in the last 16. They have also won each of their last seven matches in all competitions, firing themselves into contention for a second successive top-four Premier League finish in the process. And Emery is focused on leading Villa to consistent success at Europe’s top level. Tomorrow night. pic.twitter.com/tDLeDZQsKC — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) April 8, 2025 “When I came to Aston Villa, it was a challenge. I wanted to win titles, to be in Europe,” he told reporters during his pre-match press conference. “To be in the Champions League is unbelievable, but to do it consistently is my next challenge. “To play in Paris, a quarter-final, is something special and spectacular for all of us involved in this club. But we want to be consistent at this level. We are very confident to have chances and to enjoy ourselves. “What I did here is in my backpack. It’s special for me to be back in Paris, especially because of the circumstances. I’m trying to fulfil my responsibility to the club I’m at, to get the best out of the team, out of the players. “[PSG are] playing fantastic football. They’re competing, which Luis Enrique’s teams have always done, dominating with superiority in the league and in the Champions League. Against Liverpool, they showed enormous strength. “In the pressing, they are very good with the players they have, and they are being so, so aggressive and intense in each action they are doing all over the field. We want to compete and be protagonists on the field.”",
