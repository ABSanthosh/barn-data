  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Sydney FC double chance Odds: 7/10 @ BetUS In what could prove to be a frantic A-League showdown on Friday morning, Melbourne Victory will welcome Sydney to AAMI Park. Starting with the hosts, while Melbourne might have clinched a bronze medal finish among Australia’s elite last season, the Victory have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability this time around. Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat outside the play-off places, interim boss Arthur Diles has a real job on his hands at AAMI Park. Eventually falling to a dramatic 3-2 loss against title contenders Adelaide, Melbourne are without a win from any of their previous six consecutive A-League appearances – a rut that stems back to December 8th. Despite mustering 10 points from their first four top-flight showdowns, Friday’s hosts have come crashing back down to earth in a worrying fashion. Suffering an infamous A-League collapse at home against Western United on January 10th, the Victory have shown some glaring defensive struggles. In fact, Melbourne have shipped 13 goals on their six-match losing rut. It should also be noted, Diles’ temporary squad have conceded six goals in their last two showdowns at AAMI Park. As for the visitors, watching their extended flurry come to an abrupt end last weekend, Sydney will be seeking an immediate response here. Eventually falling to an action-packed 4-3 loss at home against Brisbane, Ufuk Talay’s men will know the importance of dusting themselves down quickly. Losing just one of their previous seven A-League appearances, the former Wellington boss will be excited by his side’s clinical performances in the final third. Storming their way to a sensational 4-1 romp against Central Coast earlier in the month, Friday’s guests have notched at least a pair of goals in seven of their previous eight outings. Finding a route back into the play-off places, Sydney will take plenty of positives away from their most recent battle against Melbourne. Landing a thumping 3-0 victory when they welcomed the Victory to town back on December 28th, Talay’s side could be smelling the chance to lay down a similar marker on Friday morning. Bet: Sydney FC double chance against Melbourne Victory 7/10 for Friday’s A-League matchup @ BetUS",
