The Blades’ 2-1 defeat to Burnley on Monday, which was their fourth loss in five games, ensured the Clarets and Leeds United both sealed top-two finishes. The play-offs now await Chris Wilder’s team, but they took out their frustration on Stoke as Sam McCallum and Andre Brooks netted at the bet365 Stadium. After Femi Seriki and Tyrese Campbell both had penalty appeals waved away, McCallum headed home in the 38th minute, after Rhian Brewster’s corner caused a scramble. Lewis Baker went close to a glorious equaliser just before half-time but Stoke were largely lacklustre and were arguably fortunate to keep 11 men on the pitch when Ben Wilmot clattered Brewster from behind. Ali Al-Hamadi was denied by Michael Cooper with 13 minutes to play and Sheffield United killed the contest in the 88th minute, Brooks coming off the bench to cap a flowing move with a simple finish. pic.twitter.com/PD7AbU6EIb https://t.co/iuoxgGnGBl — Sky Bet Championship (@SkyBetChamp) April 25, 2025 While Sheffield United are guaranteed to finish third and have 89 points with one game remaining, Stoke stay 17th in the table. Mark Robins’ side are only four points above the relegation zone, with all of their rivals possessing a game in hand, so it could yet be a nervous end to the season for them. Data debrief: Stoke miss chance, Blades back on track This was the 17th game in which Stoke have failed to score this season, with only Plymouth Argyle (19) failing to net more often in the Championship this term. The Potters had won three of their last four home league games (one defeat) and another win here would have confirmed safety, but they are now left to wait on other results. Sheffield United, meanwhile, will feel they thoroughly deserved this victory after amassing 13 shots worth 2.0 expected goals (xG), compared to Stoke’s 10 worth 0.73 xG.",
