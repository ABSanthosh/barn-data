Watching PSG and Monaco meet for the French Super Cup this weekend, many of Europe’s elite will steal centre stage throughout Sunday afternoon. So, for those of you looking to put on a Sunday flutter, we have taken a glance at two of Europe’s most appealing betting tips. 16:30 Liverpool vs Manchester United Although Arne Slot might have only got his Anfield tenure underway last summer, Liverpool have embarked on a sensational rise under the former Feyenoord boss. Last seen putting in another dominant display as they stormed their way to a 5-0 romp away at Liverpool, Sunday’s hosts have their sights set on completing an iconic silverware sweep in 2025. Opening this weekend’s fixtures holding a six-point buffer over the chasing pack, Liverpool have suffered just a single defeat across any competition so far this season. Breezing their way to a Champions League quarter-final spot and the only club from across the continent that can boast a 100% record, Slot’s side will certainly be relishing a return to Anfield here. Claiming a remarkable 6-3 win against Tottenham last month, Sunday’s hosts have won each of their previous four appearances across all competitions by an aggregate score of 16-5. Undoubtably Europe’s new poster boys, Slot’s men are rightfully pencilled in as a landslide contender here. While there might have been plenty of excitement around Old Trafford following Ruben Amorim’s arrival back in November, Manchester United find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Last seen signing off 2024 with a 2-0 defeat at home against Newcastle, the former Sporting Lisbon boss already has a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders. Including another 2-0 defeat against relegation scrappers Wolves last month, Sunday’s guests have lost each of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Remarkably opening this weekend’s fixtures sat 14th in the Premier League standings and breaking a string of unwanted records, Man United have also continued to show some glaring issues at the back. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny on December 22nd, the Red Devils have conceded 11 goals on their four-match losing rut. Facing a monumental challenge on Sunday afternoon, Amorim’s squad couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge when they travel to their arch-rivals on Sunday afternoon. Liverpool vs Manchester United Betting Tip: Mohamed Salah over 1.5 shots on target @ 19/20 with Pribet 16:30 PSG vs Monaco While PSG might have embarked on a real Champions League struggle this season, the French giants are once again enjoying another domestic romp. Opening up the New Year holding a commanding 10-point buffer at the top of the Ligue 1 table, it is no surprise that Luis Enrique’s men are pencilled in as a landslide favourite to shatter more domestic records in 2025. Last seen on December 22nd as they edged past Lens en route to booking a Coupe de France Round of 16 ticket, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad win each of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Suffering just a single defeat from any of their last nine outings, PSG have once again gained a reputation for their clinical performances in the final third. Bagging 11 goals in their final four appearances before entering the New Year, Enrique’s side will be looking to lay down an early marker and claim a first piece of silverware of 2025. Although Monaco might have opened the New Year sat in the driving seat to book another Champions League ticket, Add Hutter’s men have struggled to find any kind of recent suability. Last seen in Ligue 1 action on December 18th falling to an action-packed 4-2 defeat at the hands of PSG, the Monegasques have won just a pair of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Likewise, losing their last two Champions League showdowns by an aggregate score of 6-2, the former Eintracht Frankfurt boss will also have a major headache over his side’s extended defensive struggles. Including a 2-1 defeat against Monaco last month, Monaco have recorded just a single clean sheet against Ligue 1 opposition since back on October 18th. It should also be noted, including that frantic 4-2 loss last month, Hutter’s camp have conceded nine goals in their previous three showdowns against PSG. PSG vs Monaco Betting Tip: PSG win \u0026 Both teams to score @ 21/10 with Luckster Sunday’s European Double Liverpool vs Manchester United – Mohamed Salah over 1.5 shots on target @ 19/20 PSG vs Monaco – PSG win \u0026 Both teams to score @ 21/10 Place a £10 bet on our Daily Double with Vegas Land and pocket £60.45 if all predictions are correct.
