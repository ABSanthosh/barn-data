  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet With a spot in the final of this summer’s European Championships hanging in the balance on Tuesday night, England and Italy will meet in Geneva. England W Starting with England, dragging themselves past Sweden last week following what was a remarkable comeback in Zurich, the Lionesses will be desperately seeking a more routine performance here. Looking to defend their European crown this summer, it is fair to say that Sarina Wiegman’s camp are seeking some recent stability. Getting their adventure underway with July 5th with a 2-1 loss at the hands of France, the former Netherlands boss is still searching for some recent defensive steel. Despite signing off their group stage charge with a stellar 6-1 romp against Wales, England have mustered just a single clean sheet over in Switzerland so far this summer. England W Team News While central defender Leah Williamson might have limped off against Sweden last week with a reported ankle issue, England are hopeful that the Arsenal star will be able to feature here. Likewise, despite dealing with some hamstring tightness, Lucy Bronze will start at right-back. Coming off the bench and bagging that dramatic equaliser in Zurich last week, 19-year-old Michelle Agyeman could make a first start of the summer. Chelsea ace Keira Walsh will start in the middle of the park on Tuesday night. Italy W As for Italy, while Le Azzurre might have signed off their group stage campaign with a routine 3-1 loss at the hands of summer favourites Spain, Andrea Soncin’s camp came roaring back last time out. Putting in what was an eye-catching performance last weekend as they clinched a 2-1 victory against Norway, the Blues will be dreaming of the chance to claim another heavyweight European scalp here. However, hit with a 5-1 drumming when they last met England for a friendly showdown back in February 2024, Italy will be concerned by a nightmare record against the Lionesses. In fact, Soncin’s side have failed to win any of their previous five straight meetings against Tuesday’s opponents (four defeats, one draw). Italy W Team News Bagging a sensational quarter-final brace against Norway last weekend and now notching five goals in as many international appearances across all competitions, Juventus ace Cristian Girelli will play a leading role on Tuesday night. Roma’s Mandela Giugliano will partner Arianna Caruso in the middle of the park. Now making consecutive summer starts, veteran defender Barbara Bonansea will keep her spot at right wing-back here. England W vs Italy WKey Factors to Consider When England and Italy last met back in February 2024, the Lionesses collected a 5-1 victory in Algeciras. In fact, England are unbeaten in all of their previous five meetings against Tuesday’s opponents (four wins, one draw). Along with mustering just a single clean sheet so far this summer, England have come away unscathed in just two of their previous seven competitive appearances across all competitions. Italy have failed to register consecutive competitive victories so far this calendar year. Seven of the eight historic meetings between England and Italy have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Eventually dragging themselves past Sweden last week, England will be desperately seeking a more routine night in Geneva. However, although the Lionesses might open Tuesday’s semi-final pencilled in as a landslide favourite, the reigning European champions are searching for some defensive stability. Likewise, despite landing a routine 5-1 romp when they last met Italy back in February 2024, it should be noted that Tuesday’s opponents do have a habit of producing plenty of action when they meet. With seven of their eight historic showdowns finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting chances to fall at both ends of the pitch. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
