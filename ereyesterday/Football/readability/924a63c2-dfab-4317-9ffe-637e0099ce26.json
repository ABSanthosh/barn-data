  "text": "Xabi Alonso said that his impressive record against Bayern Munich counts for nothing ahead of Bayer Leverkusen’s all-Bundesliga clash in the Champions League. Under Alonso, Leverkusen are unbeaten in their six matches against Bayern across all competitions, winning three and drawing the other games. They have also kept a clean sheet in three of their last four against them, after not keeping any in their previous 15 games beforehand, conceding 42 goals in those games. But despite Alonso’s run of results against Bayern, it is Vincent Kompany’s side who hold an eight-point advantage over the Bundesliga champions in the top-flight. The two teams have met three times this season, with Leverkusen registering the only victory in their DFB-Pokal clash back in December. “There is no secret,” Alonso told reporters. “The last game against Bayern means nothing to us for tomorrow, they bring us nothing. “Tomorrow is the next game. It’s always the most important. We’re preparing as always. “Of course, we know it’s the Champions League, it’s a bit different from the Bundesliga. The first game is in Munich, and we’re expecting a hard, intense game.” Touched down in Munich #UCL | #FCBB04 pic.twitter.com/JU8vOepuEJ — Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) March 4, 2025 This will be the first ever meeting between Bayern and Leverkusen in a major European competition, with Alonso hopeful of a better result than the last the Werkself faced German opposition outside the Bundesliga. Leverkusen last faced a German side in the 2007-08 UEFA Cup, when they were defeated 3-2 by Hamburg. And despite his excellent record, Alonso knows his team are facing a club which has won six European Cups, and Bayern now look on course to win the Bundesliga title. “It’s clear the situation, we know, and we have a lot of respect for FC Bayern, for history and now also in this moment,” Alonso said. “They have played a very good season, and we are in a good moment. “We are ready to have a very, very tough fight tomorrow, and again next week, and we come here to be competitive, to bring a good game.”",
