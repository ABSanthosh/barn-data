  "text": "Benfica coach Bruno Lage called for his team to receive the respect they deserve after they stunned Bayern Munich to top Group C at the Club World Cup. Benfica entered matchday three needing a result to ensure they finished above Boca Juniors and qualified for the last 16, while Bayern only required a point to top the group. Andreas Schjelderup’s composed finish put the Portuguese side ahead in the 13th minute, and though Bayern piled on plenty of pressure after half-time, an inspired performance from goalkeeper Anatolii Trubin kept them out. It was Benfica’s first competitive victory over Bayern, having lost 10 and drawn three of the teams’ previous 13 meetings while conceding a total of 36 goals. Benfica will now face the runners-up from Group D – potentially Chelsea – in the last 16, and Lage believes they have sent out a statement. “I think it’s time for people to believe more in our work,” Lage told DAZN. “I’m talking about the work of our president, our directors, my work as a coach and my players. “It was said that we had to beat Boca Juniors, that we had to score a lot of goals against Auckland City to be second in the group and people forgot about this game. “I didn’t forget that we had three games. People should believe more in the work we are doing so that, in the end, we can achieve these victories.” Bayern, meanwhile, must now face Group D winners Flamengo in the next round, and Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain could await in the last eight if they win that tie. Tuesday’s game was played in temperatures of over 36 degrees Celsius at Bank of America Stadium, and Bayern coach Vincent Kompany felt the conditions had a major impact. “I think our first half wasn’t good at all. With the pitch and the heat, I just feared this wouldn’t go as fluid as normal, but I was still confident for the second half,” he said. “We created so much and played really well. It’s football. If you have chances and don’t take them, you pay the price. “We were dominant, we created more chances, we didn’t win. We can’t afford for this to happen, but we still take momentum into the next game.” Kompany left several big names on the bench until half-time, when Harry Kane, Michael Olise and Joshua Kimmich were all introduced, and he said the scorching temperatures had forced him to protect his stars. “It was the plan. I’d rather finish strong because I knew it would start slow,” Kompany said. “I was definitely confident this was what we needed to do. “We don’t have to play in Charlotte any more. I can’t take anything else from this game.”",
