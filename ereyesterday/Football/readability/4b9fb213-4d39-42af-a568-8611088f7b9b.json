  "text": "Francesco Acerbi has withdrawn from Italy’s squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers due to a lack of respect. His decision comes one day after Inter’s heavy 5-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final. Acerbi featured from the start in that game, becoming the fifth-oldest outfield starter in a European Cup/Champions League final at 37 years and 110 days. The defender has not featured for the national team since November 2023, but after impressing for Inter in the latter stages of the season – including scoring an equaliser in the Champions League semi-final second-leg win over Barcelona – he was recalled to Luciano Spalletti’s squad. However, in a post on social media, Acerbi announced his decision, saying: “After deep consideration, I informed the CT today that I will not accept the call to the national team. “It’s not a choice I took lightly because wearing the blue shirt has always been an honour and pride to me. However, I felt that, in light of recent events, the conditions to continue this path peacefully do not exist. “I don’t seek alibis or favours, I demand respect. And if the respect is lacking on the part of those who should lead a group, then I prefer to step aside. “I’ve always given everything, but I don’t stay where I’m no longer really wanted to, and it’s clear that I’m not part of the project. This is my decision, but it is not final nor dictated by anger, not much less ‘depression’ for a Champions League final lost, but only by a need to step back.” Acerbi did not clarify what the lack of respect referred to, and before the 37-year-old’s statement was released, Spalletti spoke of him in a press conference. “For me, Acerbi has value. We knew he had some physical problems, he had been operated on, I had given space at the time to other defenders, too,” Spalletti said. Italy are bidding to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, having failed to reach either of the last two editions of the tournament. The Azzurri begin their qualifying campaign in Group I on June 6 against Norway, before facing Moldova three days later. Italy were knocked out at the Nations League quarter-final stage in their last matches, losing 5-4 to Germany on aggregate, and Spalletti is looking to start their bid for a place at the World Cup on a positive note. “Let’s be clear: in Norway, everything is on the line when it comes to whether or not we’ll qualify for the World Cup,” Spalletti told reporters. “We have a duty to fulfil this task that’s been entrusted to us. We need to qualify because it’s absolutely crucial for us. “As for us, we have everything we need to play our game. We have all the potential for a great match, and that’s exactly what we intend to put into practice.”",
