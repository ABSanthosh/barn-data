In a showdown between two Premier League strugglers who have broken a string of unwanted records this season, it almost seemed fitting that Wednesday’s battles in the Basque Country would be decided by a scrappy moment. Watching the ball deflect off both Luke Shaw and Brennan Johnson in the final moments of the first-half, Andre Onana was unable to get down low as the Wales international was able to smuggle the ball over the line and write himself into Tottenham’s history books. Although Dutch defender Micky van de Ven might have produced a sublime goal line clearance to deny Rasmus Hojlund, Manchester United once again failed to find any kind of clinical edge in the final third and will be bracing themselves for another hefty backlash. While Thursday’s iconic 1-0 victory at San Mames might not be enough to save Ange Postecoglou his job in north London, the Australian tactician become the first manager since 1984 to guide Spurs to a piece of European silverware. Although Tottenham might have endured a public domestic nightmare this season, Postecoglou certainly lived up to his promise of producing a trophy in his second campaign in charge. In a Europa League final that proved to be as cagey as many had expected, we have taken a look at the main talking points from the Basque Country. Postecoglou leaves up to his promise Remarkably sat 17th in the Premier League table and just a single place above the relegation zone, it is no secret that Postecoglou has had a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders throughout this season. However, despite registering just a single point from any of their previous six consecutive Premier League appearances, the former Celtic boss had always stated that he would bring silverware back to north London in his second campaign in charge. Leading Tottenham to a first trophy since their Carabao Cup success way back in 2008, the Australian coach has cemented his spot as a Spurs hero after joining Bill Nicholson and Keith Burkinshaw in winning a European crown. While Postecoglou might have cut a frustrated figure during the pre-match media duties after he was forced to state that he would “never be a clown”, the Tottenham boss will know that he can leave north London with his head held high. Although Wednesday’s iconic night at San Mames might be long remembered as one of the most famous night’s in Spurs’ history, it is hard to overlook what has been a woeful domestic rut as they still find themselves sat 17th in the table after winning just one of their last 11 top-flight appearances. Where does Amorim go from here? While there might have been plenty of excitement around Old Trafford back in November as Ruben Amorim was announced as Erik ten Hag’s permeant replacement, Manchester United have only continued to break a string of unwanted records under the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss. With Amorim openly branding his squad as one of the worst in United’s illustrious history, the Portuguese tactician has also stated that his position will become untenable if the Red Devils don’t come flying out of the traps next season. However, facing what will certainly be another public backlash over the coming days, there are large sections of the Old Trafford support that are already demanding a change in the dugout ahead of the 2025/26 campaign. With no European football pencilled in for next season and opening their Premier League finale this weekend sat 16th in the table, Amorim’s men have remarkably failed to win any of their last nine consecutive meetings against top-flight opposition. Drastically failing to find any kind of attacking fluidity and now failing to find the net in their previous three straight showdowns, United have only further underlined their status as a club in crisis. Spurs simply have United’s number While Tottenham might have travelled to the Basque Country having collected just a single Premier League victory since the end of February, Spurs were always smelling a golden opportunity here. Meeting a Man United squad who were enduring their own long-standing nightmare at Old Trafford, Postecoglou’s side hold what is a remarkable recent record against their domestic rivals. Landing another 1-0 victory when they welcomed United to the capital back on February 16th, they have now won all of their last four straight meetings. Likewise, Tottenham are also unbeaten in their previous seven battles across all fronts (five wins, two draws). In fact, this is the first time in four decades that the Red Devils have lost four consecutive meetings against a single opposition in a campaign. Expecting what is a hero’s return when they travel back to north London on Thursday as the newly-crowned Europa League champions, there could still be some sore heads in Postecoglou’s camp when they meet Brighton for their season finale on Sunday afternoon.
