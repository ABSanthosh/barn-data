Madrid fell behind to a neat Martin Valjent finish after just 11 minutes at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, knowing that anything but a victory would see Barcelona crowned champions without kicking a ball. But Kylian Mbappe equalised midway through the second half before young defender Jacobo Ramon – who had never scored a senior goal – volleyed home in the 95th minute. Madrid’s comeback delayed Barca’s coronation for at least 24 hours, as a victory at Espanyol on Thursday – or a win in any of their three remaining games – would secure the title for Hansi Flick’s men. Madrid were without 12 players for Wednesday’s game, with Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelien Tchouameni, David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, Lucas Vazquez and Eder Militao among their many absentees. They were also playing for the first time since it was confirmed that Ancelotti will leave to take the Brazil job at the end of the season, but the Italian was delighted by the focus they showed. Asked if he regretted Madrid not replicating Wednesday’s performance more often, Ancelotti told Movistar: “Yes, we covered so many casualties with an extraordinary effort. “If we had done this in more games, the season would have been better. We did not give up despite having 12 players injured, that is something very rare. “The problem was resolved today with a great attitude by the whole team. I’ve never seen a team shoot 40 times on goal like we did today.” POV: you score for the first time for @RealMadridEN and it seals a comeback at the Bernabéu! pic.twitter.com/u4hRKROuqu — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) May 14, 2025 Ramon’s winner came from Madrid’s 39th and final shot in the match – their highest tally at the Bernabeu in LaLiga since Opta records began in 2003-04. In addition, Los Blancos took an eye-watering 26 corners in Wednesday’s game, a record by any team in the competition since Opta began collecting corner data in 2005-06. Ancelotti’s distinguished second spell with Madrid is ending on a sour note, with Los Blancos failing to win a major trophy in 2024-25. He has been criticised in the Spanish media for a supposedly lax approach to training in recent weeks, having recently quipped: “If you want a coach with a whip, sign another coach.” But he claims Madrid’s failings are not related to his impending departure, saying: “It has been nothing special, it has been simple, without any problems. “It has been a good period of coaching, the players have had the necessary respect for me, there have been no problems in that sense. “The problems have not been because of that. The whip, all that nonsense… we just had problems with our balance.”",
