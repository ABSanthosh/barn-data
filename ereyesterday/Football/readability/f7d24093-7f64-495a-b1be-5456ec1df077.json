Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s 74th-minute own goal proved decisive, as he inadvertently turned Cole Palmer’s cross over Alphonse Areola with his attempted clearance. Graham Potter’s return to Stamford Bridge had started well, Jarrod Bowen profiting from Levi Colwill’s slack backpass to give them the lead three minutes before the break. However, substitute Pedro Neto levelled the score in the 64th minute, pouncing on the rebound of Enzo Fernandez’s blocked shot with a tight-angled finish. Mohammed Kudus struck the post with an unmarked header moments later, before West Ham were punished at the other end as Palmer forced the winner. Tosin Adarabioyo superbly blocked Kudus’ late attempt to grab an equaliser, sealing back-to-back home wins for Chelsea, who rise to fourth on 43 points, while West Ham remain 15th on 27. Three points at the Bridge! #CFC | #CHEWHU pic.twitter.com/8URo8GLddp — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) February 3, 2025 Data Debrief: A rare comeback Things were not looking so bright for Chelsea at half-time. Having dropped Robert Sanchez due to recent errors, and replacing him with Jorgensen, Enzo Maresca was still left to rue another mistake. Colwill’s blind backpass gifted Bowen the opener. Only Southampton (17) and Aston Villa (11) have made more errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season than Chelsea (10). In the end, they made up for it though, winning a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge in which they had trailed at half-time for the first time since December 2013 against Southampton, with this the 15th game since (D2 L15). Wan-Bissaka also notched a bit of unwanted history, becoming West Ham’s 42nd scorer of an own goal in the competition, the most of any side.",
