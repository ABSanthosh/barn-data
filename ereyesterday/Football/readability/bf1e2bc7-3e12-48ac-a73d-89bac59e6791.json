  "text": "Verdict: Roma win Best Odds: 8/15 Bookmaker: Luckster Hoping to drag themselves into the top-half of the Serie A table, Roma will welcome Parma to the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday lunchtime. Roma Starting with the hosts, extending on their Coppa Italia adventure earlier in the week as they secured a routine 4-1 romp against Sampdoria, Roma will be looking to use that performance as a platform to build on. Last seen in Serie A action slumping to a 2-0 loss away at Como, returning boss Cluadio Ranieri finds his squad scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the table. However, claiming a much-welcomed Europa League boost earlier in the month as they claimed a 3-0 win against Portuguese outfit Braga, the former Leicester manager will be excited to make a return to home soil this weekend. Including another 4-1 win against Lecce on December 7th, the Wolves have won each of their last three showdowns at the Stadio Olimpico by an aggregate score of 11-2. Roma Team News Not featuring since picking up an ankle injury against Tottenham on December 2nd, Bryan Cristante is not expected to feature here. However, aside from the Italian international, Roma have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh issues. Bagging a Coppa Italia brace against Sampdoria earlier in the week, summer recruit and former Girona marksman Artem Dovbyk will be hoping to keep his spot leading the line. With real speculation over his future in Rome, Paulo Dybala could settle for a spot on the bench here. Parma As for the visitors, while Parma might have secured a Serie A return for this season, the Crusaders have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their top-flight status. Suffering a collapse on home soil last weekend as they eventually fell to a 3-2 loss against Verona, Fabio Pecchia’s side currently find themselves holding just a one-point buffer from slipping into the relegation zone. Marking their return from November’s international break with a 3-1 drumming at the hands of title contenders Atalanta, Sunday’s guests have lost three of their previous four Serie A appearances. Likewise, Parma have registered just a pair of victories from any of their last 14 consecutive showdowns against top-flight opposition. It should also be noted, Pecchia’s men haven’t registered a single victory in Rome since way back in 1997. Parma Team News Both dealing with respective knee injuries, the duo of Alessandro Circati and Polish youngster Mateusz Kowalski remain on the sidelines and will not feature here. Likewise, suffering another injury setback and missing out against Verona last weekend, 25-year-old Lautaro Valenti is seen as a doubt. Bagging a Serie A brace at the Stadio Ennio Tardini last week, Switzerland international Simon Sohm will start in the middle of the park. Despite notching just a single strike since the middle of October, Ange-Yoan Bonny will lead the line in Rome. Roma vs Parma Key Factors to Consider When Roma and Parma last met back in March 2021, the Crusaders collected a 2-0 win in Emilia-Romagna. However, Parma have not collected a single victory at the Stadio Olimpico since way back in 1997. Roma have won each of their last three home fixtures across all competitions by an aggregate score of 11-2. Parma have lost three of their previous four Serie A appearances. Continuing on from last season, the Crusaders have collected just a single competitive victory on their travels since the middle of March. Conclusion Extending on their Coppa Italia adventure earlier in the week as they collected a 4-1 victory against Sampdoria, Roma should be smelling another golden opportunity here. Winning each of their last three straight showdowns at the Stadio Olimpico by an aggregate score of 11-2, Sunday’s hosts are desperate to find a route into the top-half of the Serie A standings. With Parma failing to muster a single victory in Rome since way back in 1997, we are backing a home win this weekend. Verdict: Roma win  Best Odds: 8/15 Bookmaker: Luckster",
