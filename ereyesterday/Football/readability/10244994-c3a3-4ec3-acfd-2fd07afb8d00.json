  "text": "Competition: Saudi Pro League Market: Over 1.5 goals Odds: 4/11 @ Pribet Two camps who will know that they can officially keep hold of their Pro League status on Wednesday evening, Al-Kholood will welcome Al-Fayha to Ar Rass. Starting with the hosts, while Al-Kholood might open their penultimate Pro League showdown holding a four-point buffer over the drop zone, Noureddine Zekri’s men are limping their way over the finishing line. Making an immediate return to losing ways last weekend as they slumped to a 4-1 drumming at the hands of Al-Ahli, the former Damac boss will certainly have some mounting pressure on his shoulders. Getting May underway with another 4-1 defeat against Al-Qadisiya, the Pride of Ar Rass have lost seven of their previous eight Pro League appearances. With that rut stemming all the way back to a 2-1 win against Al-Fateh on March 6th, Wednesday’s hosts have also continued to show some glaring defensive issues. Conceding 63 goals in their 32 Pro League outings this season, Al-Kholood hold the third-worst defensive tally among Saudi’s elite. It should also be highlighted, Zekri’s struggling squad have mustered just a sole clean sheet from their last 11 consecutive outings. As for the visitors, making an immediate return to winning ways last weekend as they clinched a deserved 2-0 victory at home against Al-Okhdood, Al-Faya have their sights firmly set on punching another top-half finish this month. Getting May underway with a 2-1 win against Damac, Pedro Emanuel’s men have just just a trio of their previous 13 Pro League appearances – a run that stems all the way back to a 3-0 defeat against Saudi giants Al-Nassr on February 7th. However, collecting just one-point from their last three showdowns away from the Al-Majma’ah Sports City, Wednesday’s guests have also shipped 10 goals in those three consecutive away fixtures. Including a 5-0 drumming against Al-Ahli on April 18th, it should also be highlighted that Al-Faya have seen all of their last nine Pro League outings finish with over 1.5 goals. Bet: Over 1.5 goals at Al-Kholood vs Al-Fayha 4/11 for Wednesday’s Saudi Pro League battle @ Pribet",
