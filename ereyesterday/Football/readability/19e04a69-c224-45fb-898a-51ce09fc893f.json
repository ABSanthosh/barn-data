  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Both teams to score Odds: 4/7 @ Pribet Looking to spring an upset and extend on their recent flurry, Melbourne Victory will travel to the Allianz Stadium on Saturday morning when they meet Sydney. Starting with the hosts, mounting a sensational last-gasp comeback away at Adelaide last weekend as they snatched a 3-3 stalemate, Sydney will be desperate to use that dramatic late flurry as a platform to build on. However, despite opening December with a much-needed AFC Champions League boost, Ufuk Talay’s men have drastically struggled to find any kind of domestic stability. Falling to an infamous 4-3 loss at the hands of local rivals Western United earlier in the month, the Sky Blues have collected just a single point from any of their last three A-League showdowns. Heading into November’s international break with a 2-1 defeat at home against Macarthur, Sydney have also gained a reputation for their glaring defensive struggles. Opening Christmas Day battling it out in the bottom-half of the table, Saturday’s hosts have conceded nine goals on their three-match winless rut. It should also be noted, the former Wellington boss has not seen his squad muster a single clean sheet from any of their previous 13 matchups across all competitions. As for the visitors, collecting a bronze medal finish among Australia’s elite last season, Melbourne are desperate to mount a genuine A-League title charge this time around. Opening Christmas Day sat just two points adrift of finding a route to the top of the table, the Dark Blues have collected seven points from their previous three appearances. Getting December underway with a statement of intent as they stormed their way to a 3-1 romp away at Western United, the Victory should find the mood in their camp at a real high. Suffering just a single defeat from any of their first eight A-League showdowns so far this season, Saturday’s guests should also be excited by a dominant recent record against Sydney. Despite settling for a 1-1 stalemate when they welcomed their historic rivals to AAMI Park back in January, they have registered seven points from just their last three A-League battles. However, it should be noted, Melbourne have put just a single clean sheet on the board since returning from November’s international break. Bet: Both teams to score at Sydney FC vs Melbourne Victory 4/7 for Saturday’s A-League showdown @ Pribet",
