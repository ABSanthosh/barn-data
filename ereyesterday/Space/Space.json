    "description": "The recurrent binary-star nova goes boom approximately every 80 years and we’ve been on alert for it since AprilWhat on earth is T Coronae Borealis playing at? We’ve been on alert for it to explode since April, when we confidently expected it to go boom some time before September. But we are still waiting.The star is a recurrent nova. This means it actually consists of two stars: a red giant and a white dwarf. The white dwarf is a dense stellar core about the size of the Earth, whose gravity is stripping gas from the red giant. The gas accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface before detonating in a thermonuclear explosion, causing the star to temporarily brighten. This does not destroy the white dwarf, which then returns to normal and the cycle repeats. Continue reading...",
