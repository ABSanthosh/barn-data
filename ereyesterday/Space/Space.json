    "description": "He is surrounded by people who have grandiose plans and dreams beyond our planet. Vengeful nihilism is a big part of the Maga projectIn thinking about the war being waged against life on Earth by Donald Trump, Elon Musk and their minions, I keep bumping into a horrible suspicion. Could it be that this is not just about delivering the world to oligarchs and corporations – not just about wringing as much profit from living systems as they can? Could it be that they want to see the destruction of the habitable planet?We know that Trump’s overriding purpose is power. We have seen that no amount of power appears to satisfy his craving. So let’s consider power’s ultimate destination. It is to become not only an emperor, but the last of the emperors: to close the chapter on civilisation. It is to scratch your name indelibly upon a geological epoch. Look on my works, ye vermin, and despair.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

    "description": "Assaulted at 22, Nguyen was shocked to find she would have to pay for her rape evidence kit – which might be destroyed long before any court case. She talks about her battle for survivors’ rights, and the ambition that is taking her into spaceBehind a hospital curtain, under strip lighting, with a specialist nurse and a rape crisis volunteer at her side, Amanda Nguyen lay dazed and bruised. Her body and soul hurt in places she didn’t know could hurt. She felt icy cold but at the same time burning hot – she was, she said, a cold slab of meat while her insides were liquid magma. Yet from her hospital bed, she was expected to process information and make decisions that could change her life.Just hours earlier, Nguyen, then 22, had been living her dream. “I was a student at Harvard, three months from graduation with the rest of my life in front of me,” she says. Her head was buzzing with two possible futures: her lifelong ambition of becoming an astronaut – astrophysics was her subject and she’d interned at Nasa aged 18 – or a career with the CIA, as a spy. She had been approached by a recruiter and started the process of onboarding. Then, a frat party had ended in rape – one so planned and precise that she is convinced her rapist had done it before – and here she was in the early hours, at a Harvard teaching hospital, her body suddenly a crime scene.
