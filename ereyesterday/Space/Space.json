On Make Me a Mixtape, a celebrity invents a reason why they need a curated selection of songs, and hosts Clara Amfo and Jordan Stephens come up with a playlist of six tracks each. We hear a little bit of each song, along with Amfo and Stephens’s justifications, before the celeb chooses their winning tape. It’s a sort of soundclash. Continue reading...",

It is my first experience of zero gravity on an European Space Agency (Esa) parabolic flight. In theory I know what is going on, but my brain just cannot grasp that it is actually me that is floating, that I’m suspended midair.I am accompanying Britain’s first female Esa astronaut, Rosemary Coogan, on the flight as part of her zero gravity training for a potential six-month deployment to the International Space Station. During the three-hour flight, sometimes referred to as the vomit comet, the plane will trace out 31 parabolas – soaring arcs in the sky. Continue reading...",
