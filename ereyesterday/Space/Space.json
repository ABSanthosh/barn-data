Then the Amazon founder’s rocket company delayed the launch until at least Sunday 12 January due to rough seas.Named New Glenn, the rocket is slated to lift off from the Cape Canaveral space force station in Florida. A statement from the company read: “We’re shifting our NG-1 launch date to no earlier than January 12 due to a high sea state in the Atlantic, where we hope to land our booster.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "‘I took all the images with a precisely tuned telescope then joined them up. Use the wrong type of telescope and you’ll blind yourself and burn your house down’I bought a telescope on a whim in 2017, thinking back fondly to when my dad used to show me Jupiter and Saturn through his. I thought: “Why not revisit some of those memories, now that I can afford to spend a few hundred bucks on essentially a toy?” It was a 10in Dobsonian telescope that I set up in my back yard and pointed towards the brightest things I could see in the sky from the southern horizon – which by sheer luck happened to be Jupiter and Saturn. I was immediately transported back to being a kid, staring at these incredible things. Then I did what any millennial would do: I took out my iPhone and tried to take a photo of what I was seeing through the telescope. It didn’t turn out very good but it made me want to share what I was seeing with the world.I started to teach myself about astrophotography and what equipment I’d need. My photos got better and better. Then, during the pandemic, I was laid off from a tech startup and couldn’t find a new job. I thought: “What if I try selling the pictures I’m taking through the telescope?” Before I knew it, I had people helping me turn my hobby into a business, and I was learning the skills I’d need to get into more elaborate deep space photography, such as capturing the sun.
