    "description": "Investing in space vital for sustaining quality of life amid ‘volatile geopolitical’ landscape, says Josef AschbacherDonald Trump’s return to the White House has prompted a shift away from ties with America by European political leaders and a rapid increase in defence spending as the continent’s security reaches a “turning point”. The ripples from Europe’s newfound desire for self-reliance could go even further: as far as space.Europe’s drive for more autonomy means it must also increase its invesment in space technology, according to Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency (Esa), the intergovernmental body tasked with overseeing the space exploration ambitions of European countries including much of the EU and the UK.

But these fish are on a mission.When fully grown, they will produce offspring that will be the first to be launched into space as part of a scientific project called Lunar Hatch that is exploring whether sea bass can be farmed on the moon – and eventually Mars – as food for future astronauts.
