Space and Earth science missions would bear the brunt of the cutbacks, losing more than 53% of what was allocated to them in 2024. Continue reading...",

Now Nelly Ben Hayoun-Stépanian has made a hilarious film taking issue with the tech bros’ dreams of celestial conquest‘She’s a great inspiration,” says Nelly Ben Hayoun-Stépanian, picking up a photo she keeps in her wildly decorated office of the scientist Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel prize and also the first person to win one twice. “I pick people that really inspire me. Partners in crime. When a project is difficult, I think, ‘What would Marie Curie have done? What would Hannah Arendt have done?’ Hahaha.”She talks mile-a-minute, finishing sentences with a laugh as she speaks to me in her office, which could well be the best one in London: an old, graffiti-covered tube carriage plonked on top of the roof of a Shoreditch nightclub, with views over the city.
