A Nasa astronaut – who was not identified – was kept for observation for an unspecified medical issue. Citing patient privacy, the space agency declined to identify the astronaut or release details about their condition – other than to say the astronaut is in “good health” and would “resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members”.The crew arrived at the International Space Station in March and should have been back on Earth two months ago.
