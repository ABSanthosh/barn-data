Astronomers said it would last have been visible from our planet about 80,000 years ago, and was only discovered in January 2023.Stargazers in the southern hemisphere have already glimpsed Comet A3 but it can now also be seen in the northern hemisphere, the society said. Between 12 and 30 October, people may be able to see the comet using binoculars or even with the naked eye. Its closest pass will be on Saturday, at a distance of about 44m miles.To see the comet, stargazers have been told to look to the west just after sunset, which is 6.13pm in London. The comet’s tail, thought to be about 18m miles long, will be a prominent feature.In a video on the society’s website, the deputy director Dr Robert Massey said taking photos of the comet may be possible, particularly if using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera.According to RAS, the comet comes from the Oort Cloud – a giant spherical shell that surrounds our solar system and contains billions of objects including comets.",
