Kicking off the Fan Fest on stage were Ken Newton, director of the NASA Shared Services Center Service Delivery Directorate; Pam Covington, director of the NASA Stennis Office of Communications; and Dawn Davis, chief of the NASA Stennis Engineering \u0026 Test Directorate Office of Technology Development. NASA representatives, including HBCU alumni, supported the morning-long event, providing Fan Fest attendees with promotional items and information about student internship and employment opportunities with the agency. The annual Bayou Classic event attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year and features several days of activities, including a nationally broadcast football game, involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Louisiana – Southern University in Baton Rouge and Grambling State University in Grambling. The NASA outreach and engagement effort during this year’s event focused on the theme – There’s Space for Everybody at NASA. It was part of an ongoing agencywide commitment to advance equity and reach deeper into underrepresented and underserved segments of society and was in support of efforts to advance racial equity in the federal government.",
