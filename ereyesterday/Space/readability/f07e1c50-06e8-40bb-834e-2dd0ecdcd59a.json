  "text": "In October, the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System a project managed at NASA Ames, was recognized by TIME Magazine as a “Top Invention of 2024”! TIME Magazine also recognized two other NASA missions this year: Europa Clipper, and the Deep Space Optical Communications experiment.    The Advanced Composite Solar Sail System is a demonstration of technologies that enable spacecraft to “sail on sunlight,” using solar radiation for propulsion. Results from this mission could provide an alternative to chemical and electric propulsion systems and guide the design of future larger-scale spacecraft for space weather early warning satellites, near-Earth asteroid reconnaissance missions, or communications relays for crewed exploration missions at the Moon and Mars.   This twelve-unit (12U) CubeSat features a reflective sail held taut by composite booms made from flexible polymer and carbon fiber materials that are stiffer and lighter than previous designs. The square-shaped solar sail measures approximately 80 square meters, but the new boom technology could support future missions for solar sails up to 500 square meters.    The mission launched on April 23 via a Rocket Lab Electron rocket and met its primary objective in August by deploying the boom and sail system in space. Next, the team will attempt to demonstrate maneuverability in orbit using the sail.    Congratulations to the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System team and the Small Spacecraft Technology program office, based at Ames, for this well-earned recognition. Their contributions continue to push the boundaries of what we can achieve at NASA, and this acknowledgment highlights the capabilities and vision of our center.    Representative Anna Eshoo Recognized for 32 Years of Distinguished Public Service On Oct. 29, Ames hosted a recognition event for Representative Anna Eshoo to honor her 32 years of public service and to thank her for her enduring support for NASA and our center. Representative Eshoo announced her retirement from Congress in 2023. Representative Zoe Lofgren, public officials from across the Bay Area, and colleagues from around the center were in attendance to celebrate Representative Eshoo’s decades of tireless support. During the formal program, Ames Center Director Dr. Eugene Tu presented her with a replica of a Pioneer Plaque (photo above) as a token of appreciation for her many years as a champion for NASA Ames – from Hangar One, to the USGS Building, and the Moffett Field Museum. On Oct. 1, a Safety Day Organizational Silence Town Hall was held that focused on employee feedback and insights from prior Safety Culture, Federal Employee Viewpoint, and DEIA Organizational Climate surveys. Fostering a psychologically safe culture of open communication at NASA and Ames is imperative for the safety of our team and for the collective success of our missions. This is a topic of particular interest and concern to Ames center leadership.  Acting Director of the NASA Safety Center, Bob Conway, presented in person at Ames to conduct the hybrid town hall event in the N201 auditorium on Organizational Silence. In addition to valuable insights and tactics, there was the opportunity for employees to ask questions via a Conference I/O channel and in person during the event.  On Sept. 16, Ames welcomed NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy to the center. Having toured the facilities at Ames on past visits, Melroy visited the center to engage in several roundtable discussions with employees focused on procurement, NASA 2040, and leadership. She also greeted a delegation from the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia, with Australia being among the original eight international partners to sign on to the Artemis Accords in 2020. Across all of her conversations, Melroy voiced her appreciation for the Ames workforce for their steadfast dedication. She also consistently expressed her admiration for the diverse array of foundational work being done at Ames to advance NASA’s mission.  The President of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs visited Ames on Sept. 18 to learn about our aeronautics research and some of the center’s technical capabilities. Accompanied by a delegation of Latvian business representatives, the president visited the Airspace Operations Lab and FutureFlight Central.   During the visit, he was briefed on the center’s air traffic management simulation capabilities aimed at solving the challenges – present and emerging – of the nation’s air traffic management system. Center experts discussed innovative work in airspace management, including commercial and public safety drone operations that extend from local incidents to large-scale disaster response. Through these international visits, we are showcasing NASA to the world.   The 2024 Aeronautics Innovation Forum was held Sept. 17 – 19, supporting aeronautics research and innovation. A panel discussion, “Aeronautics \u0026 Space Economy” was held the first day with Dr. Parimal Kopardekar, Director of the NASA Aeronautics Research Institute (NARI) acting as the moderator. Panelists were Dr. Alex MacDonald, Chief Economist, NASA; Peter Shannon, Radius Capital, AAM Investor; Julia Black, Director of Range Operations, Stoke Space; and Dr. Yewon Kim, Professor, Stanford Graduate School of Business. Facility tours were also given during the forum. Lightning pitches were presented, along with an All Hands meeting, an aeronautics taco fiesta picnic and games at the Ames Park, and an ice cream social and Aeronautics Innovation Center (AIC) discussion. by Hillary Smith NASA, in partnership with AeroVironment and Aerostar, recently demonstrated a first-of-its-kind air traffic management concept that could pave the way for aircraft to safely operate at higher altitudes. This work seeks to open the door for increased internet coverage, improved disaster response, expanded scientific missions, and even supersonic flight. The concept is referred to as an Upper-Class E traffic management, or ETM.  There is currently no traffic management system or set of regulations in place for aircraft operating 60,000 feet and above. There hasn’t been a need for a robust traffic management system in this airspace until recently. That’s because commercial aircraft couldn’t function at such high altitudes due to engine constraints.   However, recent advancements in aircraft design, power, and propulsion systems are making it possible for high- altitude, long-endurance vehicles — such as balloons, airships, and solar aircraft — to coast miles above our heads, providing radio relay for disaster response, collecting atmospheric data, and more.   But before these aircraft can regularly take to the skies, operators must find a way to manage their operations without overburdening air traffic infrastructure and personnel.   “We are working to safely expand high-altitude missions far beyond what is currently possible,” said Kenneth Freeman, a subproject manager for this effort at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley. “With routine, remotely piloted high-altitude operations, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of the planet through more detailed tracking of climate change, provide internet coverage in underserved areas, advance supersonic flight research, and more.”  Current high-altitude traffic management is processed manually and on a case-by-case basis. Operators must contact air traffic control to gain access to a portion of the Class E airspace. During these operations, no other aircraft can enter this high-altitude airspace. This method will not accommodate the growing demand for high-altitude missions, according to NASA researchers.   To address this challenge, NASA and its partners have developed an ETM traffic management system that allows aircraft to autonomously share location and flight plans, enabling aircraft to stay safely separated.  During the recent traffic management simulation in the Airspace Operations Laboratory at Ames, data from multiple air vehicles was displayed across dozens of traffic control monitors and shared with partner computers off site. This included aircraft location, health, flight plans and more. Researchers studied interactions between a slow fixed-wing vehicle from AeroVironment and a high-altitude balloon from Aerostar operating at stratospheric heights. Each aircraft, connected to the ETM traffic management system for high altitude, shared location and flight plans with surrounding aircraft.   This digital information sharing allowed Aerostar and AeroVironment high-altitude vehicle operators to coordinate and deconflict with each other in the same simulated airspace, without having to gain approval from air traffic control. Because of this, aircraft operators were able to achieve their objectives, including wireless communication relay.  This simulation represents the first time a traffic management system was able to safely manage a diverse set of high-altitude aircraft operations in the same simulated airspace. Next, NASA researchers will work with partners to further validate this system through a variety of real flight tests with high-altitude aircraft in a shared airspace.    The Upper-Class E traffic management concept was developed in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration and high-altitude platform industry partners, under NASA’s National Airspace System Exploratory Concepts and Technologies subproject led out of Ames.   by Lee Mohon NASA and its industry partners continue to make progress toward Artemis III and beyond, the first crewed lunar landing missions under the agency’s Artemis campaign. SpaceX, the commercial Human Landing System (HLS) provider for Artemis III and Artemis IV, recently tested a 1.2% scale model of the Super Heavy rocket, or booster, in the transonic Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames. The Super Heavy rocket will launch the Starship human landing system to the Moon as part of Artemis. During the tests, the wind tunnel forced an air stream at the Super Heavy scale model at high speeds, mimicking the air resistance and flow the booster experiences during flight. The wind tunnel subjected the Super Heavy model, affixed with pressure-measuring sensors, to wind speeds ranging from Mach .7, or about 537 miles per hour, to Mach 1.4, or about 1,074 miles per hour. Mach 1 is the speed that sound waves travel, or 761 miles per hour, at sea level. Engineers then measured how Super Heavy model responded to the simulated flight conditions, observing its stability, aerodynamic performance, and more. Engineers used the data to update flight software for flight 3 of Super Heavy and Starship and to refine the exterior design of future versions of the booster. The testing lasted about two weeks and took place earlier in 2024. After Super Heavy completes its ascent and separation from Starship HLS on its journey to the Moon, SpaceX plans to have the booster return to the launch site for catch and reuse. The Starship HLS will continue on a trajectory to the Moon. To get to the Moon for the Artemis missions, astronauts will launch in NASA’s Orion spacecraft aboard the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket from the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Once in lunar orbit, Orion will dock with the Starship HLS or with Gateway. Once the spacecraft are docked, the astronauts will move from Orion or Gateway to the Starship HLS, which will bring them to the surface of the Moon. After surface activities are complete, Starship will return the astronauts to Orion or Gateway waiting in lunar orbit. The astronauts will transfer to Orion for the return trip to Earth.  With Artemis, NASA will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from home, and prepare for future human exploration of the Red Planet. NASA’s SLS, exploration ground systems, and Orion spacecraft, along with the human landing system, next-generation spacesuits, Gateway lunar space station, and future rovers are NASA’s foundation for deep space exploration. NASA astronauts, scientists, and researchers, and leadership from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) met with cancer patients and gathered in a discussion about potential research opportunities and collaborations as part of President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative on Oct. 4. Roundtable discussions centered conversation around the five hazards of human spaceflight: space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity, and closed or hostile environments. Many of these hazards have direct correlations to a cancer patient’s lived experience, like the isolation of a hospital room and long-term effects of radiation. During the visit with patients at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco, NASA astronaut Yvonne Cagle and former astronaut Kenneth Cockrell answered questions about spaceflight and life in space. Patients also received a video message from NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station, and met with the Director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston Vanessa Wyche, Ames Center Director Dr. Eugene Tu, and other agency leaders. By connecting the dots between human space research and cancer research, NASA and the University of California hope to open doors to innovative new research opportunities. NASA is working with researchers, institutions, and agencies across the federal government to help cut the nation’s cancer death rate by at least 50% in the next 25 years, a goal of the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Learn more about the Cancer Moonshot at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot by Gianine Figliozzi NASA recently evaluated initial flight data and imagery from Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator-4 (PTD-4), confirming proper checkout of the spacecraft’s systems including its on-board electronics as well as the payload’s support systems such as the small onboard camera. Shown below is a test image of Earth taken by the payload camera, shortly after PTD-4 reached orbit. This camera will continue photographing the technology demonstration during the mission.  Payload operations are now underway for the primary objective of the PTD-4 mission – the demonstration of a new power and communications technology for future spacecraft. The payload, a deployable solar array with an integrated antenna called the Lightweight Integrated Solar Array and anTenna, or LISA-T, has initiated deployment of its central boom structure. The boom supports four solar power and communication arrays, also called petals. Releasing the central boom pushes the still-stowed petals nearly three feet (one meter) away from the spacecraft bus. The mission team currently is working through an initial challenge to get LISA-T’s central boom to fully extend before unfolding the petals and beginning its power generation and communication operations. Small spacecraft on deep space missions require more electrical power than what is currently offered by existing technology. The four-petal solar array of LISA-T is a thin-film solar array that offers lower mass, lower stowed volume, and three times more power per mass and volume allocation than current solar arrays. The in-orbit technology demonstration includes deployment, operation, and environmental survivability of the thin-film solar array.   “The LISA-T experiment is an opportunity for NASA and the small spacecraft community to advance the packaging, deployment, and operation of thin-film, fully flexible solar and antenna arrays in space. The thin-film arrays will vastly improve power generation and communication capabilities throughout many different mission applications,” said Dr. John Carr, deputy center chief technologist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “These capabilities are critical for achieving higher value science alongside the exploration of deep space with small spacecraft.” The Pathfinder Technology Demonstration series of missions leverages a commercial platform which serves to test innovative technologies to  increase the capability of small spacecraft. Deploying LISA-T’s thin solar array in the harsh environment of space presents inherent challenges such as deploying large highly flexible non-metallic structures with high area to mass ratios. Performing experiments such as LISA-T on a smaller, lower-cost spacecraft allows NASA the opportunity to take manageable risk with high probability of great return. The LISA-T experiment aims to enable future deep space missions with the ability to acquire and communicate data through improved power generation and communication capabilities on the same integrated array. The PTD-4 small spacecraft is hosting the in-orbit technology demonstration called LISA-T. The PTD-4 spacecraft deployed into low Earth orbit from SpaceX’s Transporter-11 rocket which launched from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Aug. 16. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama designed and built the LISA-T technology as well as LISA-T’s supporting avionics system. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology program, based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and led by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, funds and manages the PTD-4 mission as well as the overall Pathfinder Technology Demonstration mission series. Terran Orbital Corporation of Irvine, California, developed and built the PTD-4 spacecraft bus, named Triumph. On Oct. 24, Astronaut Nicole Mann presented the Silver Snoopy Awards in the Syvertson Auditorium at the center. The Silver Snoopy best symbolizes the intent and spirit of Space Flight Awareness.  An astronaut always presents the Silver Snoopy because it is the astronauts’ own award for outstanding performance, contributing to flight safety and mission success.  Fewer than one percent of the aerospace program workforce receive it annually, making it a special honor to receive this award. by Maria C.

Congratulations Major Crystal Armendariz on a well-deserved promotion and remarkable achievements! “From my earliest childhood, flight had always captivated me. I lived out in the boonies and the farmlands, so I didn’t have neighbors to go and play with. If I wasn’t working, I was left to my own devices, and often, I would just be captivated by the wildlife and in particular, the birds of prey that I would see. “To me, they represented a freedom of some kind or another. These birds and the view they have — they can take in so much. So, from that point on, I knew I wanted to be involved in flight and aviation. “I [enjoyed] all things flight, all things spaceflight. I couldn’t get enough of it. I became an avid reader, whereas before, I wasn’t much of a reader. I couldn’t get enough material to read about my heroes from flight and space. They became my role models and the path that they took involved, at some point or another, a pretty rigorous education and dedication to doing well academically, physically, or athletically. So, I threw myself into that entire sort of mindset. “When I was working for the Air Force, I was able to fly and work on aircraft that I would dream about, looking at in the magazines Aviation Week and Space Technology. Here they are, right in front of me. “… So, my career has been as close as possible to that of a flight test engineer. And then, right on the heels of being captivated by atmospheric flight, working in human spaceflight has put me over the Moon.” —Dr. Donald Mendoza, Chief Engineer, NASA Engineering \u0026 Safety Center, NASA’s Ames Research Center Check out some of our other Faces of NASA. On Oct. 29, Jonathan Kaldani, a cybersecurity specialist on the Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Services (CPAS) team within the Cybersecurity and Privacy Division (CSPD) at NASA Ames, spoke to students in Professor Ahmed Banafa’s Computer Network class at CSU East Bay in Hayward, California. The insightful session, “Fly Me to the Moon” delved into NASA’s mission and it’s future, and cybersecurity. It provided students with valuable career insights, including information about jobs and internships at NASA. The engagement was exceptional with students actively participating, and showcasing a high level of interest through numerous questions that extended beyond the scheduled class time. For all NASA Ames employees, if you are interested in sharing the NASA mission with others in your community, you are encouraged to take time to participate in NASA Engages speaking events! by Rachel Hoover Malcolm O’Malley and his mom sat nervously in the doctor’s office awaiting the results of his bloodwork. This was no ordinary check-up. In fact, this appointment was more urgent and important than the SATs the seventeen-year-old, college hopeful had spent months preparing for and was now missing in order to understand his symptoms.  But when the doctor shared the results – he had off-the-charts levels of antibodies making him deathly allergic to shellfish – O’Malley realized he had more questions than answers. Like: Why is my immune system doing this? How is it working? Why is it reacting so severely and so suddenly (he’d enjoyed shrimp less than a year ago)? And why does the only treatment – an injection of epinephrine – have nothing to do with the immune system, when allergies appear to be an immune system problem? Years later, O’Malley would look to answer some of these questions while interning in the Space Biosciences Research Branch at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley. “Anaphylaxis is super deadly and the only treatment for it is epinephrine; and I remember thinking, ‘how is this the best we have?’ because epinephrine does not actually treat the immune system at all – it’s just adrenaline,” said O’Malley, who recently returned to his studies as a Ph.D. student of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville. “And there’s a thousand side effects, like heart attacks and stroke – I remember thinking ‘these are worse than the allergy!’” O’Malley’s curiosity and desire to better understand the mechanisms and connections between what triggers different immune system reactions combined with his interest in integrating datasets into biological insights inspired him to shift his major from computer science to biomedical engineering as an undergraduate student. With his recent allergy diagnosis and a lifelong connection to his aunt who worked at the UVA Heart and Vascular Center, O’Malley began to build a bridge between the immune system and heart health. By the time he was a senior in college, he had joined the Cardiac Systems Biology Lab, and had chosen to focus his capstone project on better understanding the role of neutrophils, a specific type of immune cell making up 50 to 70% of the immune system, that are involved in cardiac inflammation in high blood pressure and after heart attacks. “The immune system is involved in everything,” O’Malley says. “Anytime there’s an injury – a paper cut, a heart attack, you’re sick – the immune system is going to be the first to respond; and neutrophils are the first responders.” O’Malley’s work to determine what regulates the immune system’s interrelated responses – like how one cell could affect other cells or immune processes downstream – provided a unique opportunity for him to support multiple interdisciplinary NASA biological and physical sciences research projects during his 10-week internship at NASA Ames over the summer of 2024. O’Malley applied machine learning techniques to the large datasets the researchers were using from experiments and specimens collected over many years to help identify possible causes of inflammation seen in the heart, brain, and blood, as well as changes seen in bones, metabolism, the immune system, and more when humans or other model organisms are exposed to decreased gravity, social isolation, and increased radiation. These areas are of keen interest to NASA due to the risks to human health inherent in space exploration and the agency’s plans to send humans on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. “It’s exciting that we just never know what’s going to happen, how the immune system is going to react until it’s already been activated or challenged in some way,” said O’Malley. “I’m particularly interested in the adaptive immune system because it’s always evolving to meet new challenges; whether it’s a pandemic-level virus, bacteria or something on a mission to Mars, our bodies are going to have some kind of adaptive immune response.” During his NASA internship, O’Malley applied a statistical analysis techniques to plot and make more sense of the massive amounts of life sciences data. From there, researchers could find out which proteins, out of hundreds, or attributes – like differences in sex – are related to which behaviors or outcomes. For example, through O’Malley’s analysis, researchers were able to better pinpoint the proteins involved in inflammation of the brain that may play a protective role in spatial memory and motor control during and after exposure to radiation – and how we might be able to prevent or mitigate those impacts during future space missions and even here on Earth. “I had this moment where I realized that since my internship supports NASA’s Human Research Program that means the work I’m doing directly applies to Artemis, which is sending the first woman and person of color to the Moon,” reflected O’Malley. “As someone who’s both black and white, representation is important to me. It’s inspiring to think there will be people like me on the Moon – and that I’m playing a role in making this happen.” When O’Malley wasn’t exploring the mysteries of the immune system for the benefit of all at NASA Ames, he taught himself how to ride a bike and started to surf in the nearby waters of the Pacific Ocean. O’Malley considers Palmyra, Virginia, his hometown and he enjoys playing sports – especially volleyball, water polo, and tennis – reading science fiction and giving guest lectures to local high school students hoping to spark their curiosity.  O’Malley’s vision for the future of biomedical engineering reflects his passion for innovation. “I believe that by harnessing the unique immune properties of other species, we can achieve groundbreaking advancements in limb regeneration, revolutionize cancer therapy, and develop potent antimicrobials that are considered science fiction today,” he said. The Ames Exchange sponsored its 21st annual Chili Cook-Off on Oct. 30 behind Building 3. The theme for this year’s event was “Halloween Night,” which led to some really creative costumes. Attendees, both from Ames and the NASA Research Park, sampled chili and voted on their favorites. See below for photos of some of the spooky entries.

The concept is referred to as an Upper-Class E traffic management, or ETM.  There is currently no traffic management system or set of regulations in place for aircraft operating 60,000 feet and above. There hasn’t been a need for a robust traffic management system in this airspace until recently. That’s because commercial aircraft couldn’t function at such high altitudes due to engine constraints.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, recent advancements in aircraft design, power, and propulsion systems are making it possible for     high- altitude, long-endurance vehicles — such as balloons, airships, and solar aircraft — to coast miles above our heads, providing radio relay for disaster response, collecting atmospheric data, and more.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before these aircraft can regularly take to the skies, operators must find a way to manage their operations without overburdening air traffic infrastructure and personnel.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are working to safely expand high-altitude missions far beyond what is currently possible,” said Kenneth Freeman, a subproject manager for this effort at NASA’s\u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/ames/\"\u003e Ames Research Center\u003c/a\u003e in California’s Silicon Valley. “With routine, remotely piloted high-altitude operations, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of the planet through more detailed tracking of climate change, provide internet coverage in underserved areas, advance supersonic flight research, and more.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent high-altitude traffic management is processed manually and on a case-by-case basis. Operators must contact air traffic control to gain access to a portion of the Class E airspace. During these operations, no other aircraft can enter this high-altitude airspace. This method will not accommodate the growing demand for high-altitude missions, according to NASA researchers.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this challenge, NASA and its partners have developed an ETM traffic management system that allows aircraft to autonomously share location and flight plans, enabling aircraft to stay safely separated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the recent traffic management simulation in the Airspace Operations Laboratory at Ames, data from multiple air vehicles was displayed across dozens of traffic control monitors and shared with partner computers off site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis included aircraft location, health, flight plans and more. Researchers studied interactions between a slow fixed-wing vehicle from AeroVironment and a high-altitude balloon from Aerostar operating at stratospheric heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach aircraft, connected to the ETM traffic management system for high altitude, shared location and flight plans with surrounding aircraft.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis digital information sharing allowed Aerostar and AeroVironment high-altitude vehicle operators to coordinate and deconflict with each other in the same simulated airspace, without having to gain approval from air traffic control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, aircraft operators were able to achieve their objectives, including wireless communication relay. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis simulation represents the first time a traffic management system was able to safely manage a diverse set of high-altitude aircraft operations in the same simulated airspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, NASA researchers will work with partners to further validate this system through a variety of real flight tests with high-altitude aircraft in a shared airspace.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Upper-Class E traffic management concept was developed in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration and high-altitude platform industry partners, under NASA’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/armd/atm-x-description/\"\u003eNational Airspace System Exploratory Concepts and Technologies subproject\u003c/a\u003e led out of Ames.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eby Lee Mohon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNASA and its industry partners continue to make progress toward Artemis III and beyond, the first crewed lunar landing missions under the agency’s Artemis campaign. SpaceX, the commercial \u003ca href=\"http://nasa.gov/hls\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eHuman Landing System (HLS)\u003c/a\u003e provider for Artemis III and Artemis IV, recently tested a 1.2% scale model of the Super Heavy rocket, or booster, in the transonic Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames. The Super Heavy rocket will launch the Starship human landing system to the Moon as part of Artemis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the tests, the wind tunnel forced an air stream at the Super Heavy scale model at high speeds, mimicking the air resistance and flow the booster experiences during flight. The wind tunnel subjected the Super Heavy model, affixed with pressure-measuring sensors, to wind speeds ranging from Mach .7, or about 537 miles per hour, to Mach 1.4, or about 1,074 miles per hour. Mach 1 is the speed that sound waves travel, or 761 miles per hour, at sea level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers then measured how Super Heavy model responded to the simulated flight conditions, observing its stability, aerodynamic performance, and more.

Shown below is a test image of Earth taken by the payload camera, shortly after PTD-4 reached orbit. This camera will continue photographing the technology demonstration during the mission. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayload operations are now underway for the primary objective of the PTD-4 mission – the demonstration of a new power and communications technology for future spacecraft. The payload, a deployable solar array with an integrated antenna called the Lightweight Integrated Solar Array and anTenna, or LISA-T, has initiated deployment of its central boom structure. The boom supports four solar power and communication arrays, also called petals. Releasing the central boom pushes the still-stowed petals nearly three feet (one meter) away from the spacecraft bus. The mission team currently is working through an initial challenge to get LISA-T’s central boom to fully extend before unfolding the petals and beginning its power generation and communication operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall spacecraft on deep space missions require more electrical power than what is currently offered by existing technology. The four-petal solar array of LISA-T is a thin-film solar array that offers lower mass, lower stowed volume, and three times more power per mass and volume allocation than current solar arrays. The in-orbit technology demonstration includes deployment, operation, and environmental survivability of the thin-film solar array.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The LISA-T experiment is an opportunity for NASA and the small spacecraft community to advance the packaging, deployment, and operation of thin-film, fully flexible solar and antenna arrays in space. The thin-film arrays will vastly improve power generation and communication capabilities throughout many different mission applications,” said Dr. John Carr, deputy center chief technologist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “These capabilities are critical for achieving higher value science alongside the exploration of deep space with small spacecraft.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pathfinder Technology Demonstration series of missions leverages a commercial platform which serves to test innovative technologies to  increase the capability of small spacecraft. Deploying LISA-T’s thin solar array in the harsh environment of space presents inherent challenges such as deploying large highly flexible non-metallic structures with high area to mass ratios. Performing experiments such as LISA-T on a smaller, lower-cost spacecraft allows NASA the opportunity to take manageable risk with high probability of great return. The LISA-T experiment aims to enable future deep space missions with the ability to acquire and communicate data through improved power generation and communication capabilities on the same integrated array.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PTD-4 small spacecraft is hosting the in-orbit technology demonstration called LISA-T. The PTD-4 spacecraft deployed into low Earth orbit from SpaceX’s Transporter-11 rocket which launched from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Aug. 16. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama designed and built the LISA-T technology as well as LISA-T’s supporting avionics system. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology program, based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and led by the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, funds and manages the PTD-4 mission as well as the overall Pathfinder Technology Demonstration mission series.

The engagement was exceptional with students actively participating, and showcasing a high level of interest through numerous questions that extended beyond the scheduled class time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all NASA Ames employees, if you are interested in sharing the NASA mission with others in your community, you are encouraged to take time to participate in \u003ca href=\"https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/nasaengages/s/\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eNASA Engages\u003c/a\u003e speaking events!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eby Rachel Hoover\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm O’Malley and his mom sat nervously in the doctor’s office awaiting the results of his bloodwork. This was no ordinary check-up. In fact, this appointment was more urgent and important than the SATs the seventeen-year-old, college hopeful had spent months preparing for and was now missing in order to understand his symptoms. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the doctor shared the results – he had off-the-charts levels of antibodies making him deathly allergic to shellfish – O’Malley realized he had more questions than answers. Like: Why is my immune system doing this? How is it working? Why is it reacting so severely and so suddenly (he’d enjoyed shrimp less than a year ago)? And why does the only treatment – an injection of epinephrine – have nothing to do with the immune system, when allergies appear to be an immune system problem? Years later, O’Malley would look to answer some of these questions while interning in the Space Biosciences Research Branch at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Anaphylaxis is super deadly and the only treatment for it is epinephrine; and I remember thinking, ‘how is this the best we have?’ because epinephrine does not actually treat the immune system at all – it’s just adrenaline,” said O’Malley, who recently returned to his studies as a Ph.D. student of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville. “And there’s a thousand side effects, like heart attacks and stroke – I remember thinking ‘these are worse than the allergy!’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO’Malley’s curiosity and desire to better understand the mechanisms and connections between what triggers different immune system reactions combined with his interest in integrating datasets into biological insights inspired him to shift his major from computer science to biomedical engineering as an undergraduate student. With his recent allergy diagnosis and a lifelong connection to his aunt who worked at the UVA Heart and Vascular Center, O’Malley began to build a bridge between the immune system and heart health. By the time he was a senior in college, he had joined the Cardiac Systems Biology Lab, and had chosen to focus his capstone project on better understanding the role of neutrophils, a specific type of immune cell making up 50 to 70% of the immune system, that are involved in cardiac inflammation in high blood pressure and after heart attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The immune system is involved in everything,” O’Malley says. “Anytime there’s an injury – a paper cut, a heart attack, you’re sick – the immune system is going to be the first to respond; and neutrophils are the first responders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eO’Malley’s work to determine what regulates the immune system’s interrelated responses – like how one cell could affect other cells or immune processes downstream – provided a unique opportunity for him to support multiple interdisciplinary NASA biological and physical sciences research projects during his 10-week internship at NASA Ames over the summer of 2024. O’Malley applied \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/walter-alvarado/\"\u003emachine learning techniques\u003c/a\u003e to the large datasets the researchers were using from experiments and specimens collected over many years to help identify possible causes of inflammation seen in the heart, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/april-e-ronca/\"\u003ebrain\u003c/a\u003e, and blood, as well as changes seen in \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/joshua-s-alwood/\"\u003ebones\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/jared-broddrick/\"\u003emetabolism\u003c/a\u003e, the immune system, and more when humans or other model organisms are exposed to decreased gravity, social isolation, and increased radiation. These areas are of keen interest to NASA due to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-research-and-technology/space-station-science-101/space-station-science-101-human-research/\"\u003erisks to human health\u003c/a\u003e inherent in space exploration and the agency’s plans to send humans on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s exciting that we just never know what’s going to happen, how the immune system is going to react until it’s already been activated or challenged in some way,” said O’Malley. “I’m particularly interested in the adaptive immune system because it’s always evolving to meet new challenges; whether it’s a pandemic-level virus, bacteria or something on a mission to Mars, our bodies are going to have some kind of adaptive immune response.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his NASA internship, O’Malley applied a statistical analysis techniques to plot and make more sense of the massive amounts of life sciences data. From there, researchers could find out which proteins, out of hundreds, or attributes – like differences in sex – are related to which behaviors or outcomes. For example, through O’Malley’s analysis, researchers were able to better pinpoint the proteins involved in inflammation of the brain that may play a protective role in spatial memory and motor control during and after exposure to radiation – and how we might be able to prevent or mitigate those impacts during future space missions and even here on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had this moment where I realized that since my internship supports NASA’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/\"\u003eHuman Research Program\u003c/a\u003e that means the work I’m doing directly applies to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/\"\u003eArtemis\u003c/a\u003e, which is sending the first woman and person of color to the Moon,” reflected O’Malley. “As someone who’s both black and white, representation is important to me. It’s inspiring to think there will be people like me on the Moon – and that I’m playing a role in making this happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen O’Malley wasn’t exploring the mysteries of the immune system for the benefit of all at NASA Ames, he taught himself how to ride a bike and started to surf in the nearby waters of the Pacific Ocean. O’Malley considers Palmyra, Virginia, his hometown and he enjoys playing sports – especially volleyball, water polo, and tennis – reading science fiction and giving guest lectures to local high school students hoping to spark their curiosity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO’Malley’s vision for the future of biomedical engineering reflects his passion for innovation. “I believe that by harnessing the unique immune properties of other species, we can achieve groundbreaking advancements in limb regeneration, revolutionize cancer therapy, and develop potent antimicrobials that are considered science fiction today,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ames Exchange sponsored its 21st annual Chili Cook-Off on Oct. 30 behind Building 3. The theme for this year’s event was “Halloween Night,” which led to some really creative costumes. Attendees, both from Ames and the NASA Research Park, sampled chili and voted on their favorites.
