SpaceX tried to launch the mission Monday (July 21) but aborted the try 11 seconds before liftoff, for reasons that the company did not immediately explain.A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches two of SES' O3b mPOWER communications satellites from Florida on July 22, 2025. (Image credit: SpaceX)The Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth as planned today roughly 8.5 minutes after launch, touching down on the SpaceX droneship \"Just Read the Instructions,\" which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.According to a SpaceX mission description, it was the sixth launch and landing for this particular booster, which is designated B1090.If all goes according to plan today, the Falcon 9's upper stage will continue carrying the two mPOWER satellites to MEO, deploying them there across a seven-minute stretch about two hours after liftoff.The Falcon 9's first stage rests on the deck of a drone ship shortly after launching two of SES' O3b mPOWER communications satellites from Florida on July 22, 2025. (Image credit: SpaceX)Previous Booster 1090 missions:Luxembourg-based SES's mPOWER constellation currently consists of eight high-throughput satellites, which reached orbit on four Falcon 9 launches from December 2022 to December 2024.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!mPOWER is operational now, providing internet service to customers around the world. But the constellation will continue growing, to a total of 13 satellites. Each is built by Boeing and weighs about 3,750 pounds (1,700 kilograms).\"The remaining three O3b mPOWER satellites are currently being manufactured and are scheduled for launch over the next 12 months,\" SES representatives wrote in a brief update earlier this month.Today's launch was the 89th Falcon mission of the year already. SpaceX also has three other liftoffs under its belt this year — test flights of its Starship megarocket, which took place in January, March and May.
