About 43 tonnes (43,500kg) of similar debris strike Earth every day, according to Nasa, but is much more likely to plunge into an ocean than on to someone’s front stoop.The space rocks also streak the night sky as shooting stars during meteor showers, which happen several times a year.The footage from July is believed to be a first. While cameras have captured meteors streaking through the sky, it is rare to capture the sound of a complete meteorite strike on video.The space rock, officially registered on Monday, was named Charlottetown after the city on Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada where it struck.",
