(Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Steve Gribben) On New Year's Day, NASA's Parker Solar Probe added to the festive cheer by sending home more good news about its record-breaking closest-ever approach to the sun.On Wednesday (Jan. 1), mission control at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland began receiving the Parker Solar Probe's first telemetry â€” or housekeeping data â€” that confirms Parker's systems and science instruments are \"healthy and operating normally\" after its historic rendezvous with the sun, NASA shared in an update on Thursday (Jan. 2).\"All is looking good with the spacecraft systems and instrument operations,\" Michael Buckley, a spokesperson at JHUAPL, which oversees the Parker Solar Probe mission, told Space.com in an email. \"It really is a remarkable spacecraft!\"The latest telemetry transmission also confirms the Parker Solar Probe successfully carried out the commands programmed into its flight computers and that its science instruments were functioning during the flyby, according to the statement. That means the spacecraft collected valuable data about our star as it swooped to within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the sun's surface â€” the closest yet a spacecraft has ever gotten to our star.\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Helene Winters, the program manager for the Parker Solar Probe mission at JHUAPL, said in the statement.On Dec. 26, Parker Solar Probe signaled Earth to report it survived its record-breaking flyby of the Sun on Dec. 24. New transmissions received on Jan. 1 give more details, confirming the spacecraft collected data during the flyby, and more: https://t.co/FzGCGTXjhoJanuary 2, 2025The telemetry transmission, which mission control is receiving through NASA's Deep Space Network, continues through Thursday, Buckley said. The probe should beam home its collected science data later this month, when its most powerful onboard antenna will be in better alignment with Earth to transmit at higher rates.\"The data that will come down from the spacecraft will be fresh information about a place that we, as humanity, have never been,\" Joe Westlake, the director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, said in a Dec. 27 update. \"It's an amazing accomplishment.\"Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!On Christmas Eve, the Parker Solar Probe hurtled through the scorching solar atmosphere while traveling at a maximum speed of 430,000 miles per hour (690,000 kilometers per hour) â€” fast enough to travel from Tokyo to Washington, D.C. within a minute â€” breaking its own record as the fastest object ever built.Scientists were out of contact with the probe during the rendezvous, and just before midnight on Dec. 26, they received a simple yet much-anticipated beacon tone indicating the spacecraft survived the encounter and is operating normally. Thanks to a custom, 4.5-inch-thick (11.4-centimeter-thick) heat shield, the spacecraft could successfully endure temperatures up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (982 degrees Celsius), NASA previously said.Signal Received. ðŸ“¡NASA's #ParkerSolarProbe made history with its closest pass to the Sunâ€”3.8M miles at 430,000 mph.
