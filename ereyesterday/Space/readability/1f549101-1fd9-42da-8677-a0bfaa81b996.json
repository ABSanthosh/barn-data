Now we will go to the stars together, safely, and responsibly, and create new opportunities for international cooperation and the Artemis Generation.” Aisén Etcheverry, minister of science, technology, knowledge and innovation, signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of Chile. Jennifer Littlejohn, acting assistant secretary, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State, and Juan Gabriel Valdés, ambassador of Chile to the United States, also participated in the event. “The signing marks a significant milestone for Chile, particularly as our government is committed to advancing technological development as a key pillar of our national strategy,” said Etcheverry. “Chile has the opportunity to engage in the design and development of world-leading scientific and technological projects. Moreover, this collaboration allows us to contribute to areas of scientific excellence where Chile has distinguished expertise, such as astrobiology, geology, and mineralogy, all of which are critical for the exploration and colonization of space.” Earlier in the day, Nelson also hosted the Dominican Republic at NASA Headquarters to recognize the country’s signing of the Artemis Accords Oct. 4. Sonia Guzmán, ambassador of the Dominican Republic to the United States, delivered the signed Artemis Accords to the NASA administrator. Mike Overby, acting deputy assistant secretary, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State, and other NASA officials attended the event. In 2020, the United States, led by NASA and the U.S. Department of State, and seven other initial signatory nations established the Artemis Accords, identifying an early set of principles promoting the beneficial use of space for humanity. The Artemis Accords are grounded in the Outer Space Treaty and other agreements including the Registration Convention, the Rescue and Return Agreement, as well as best practices and norms of responsible behavior that NASA and its partners have supported, including the public release of scientific data.  The commitments of the Artemis Accords and efforts by the signatories to advance implementation of these principles support the safe and sustainable exploration of space. More countries are expected to sign in the coming weeks and months.
