On the night of 20 November, it will be joined in the night sky by a waxing gibbous moon.The chart shows the view looking east from London at 23.00 GMT. As the night progresses into the early hours of the next morning, the pair will continue to rise higher into the sky. Continue reading...",

On the night of 20 November, it will be joined in the night sky by a waxing gibbous moon.The chart shows the view looking east from London at 23.00 GMT. As the night progresses into the early hours of the next morning, the pair will continue to rise higher into the sky.The moon will be just over 20 days into its lunar month and will have 70% of its visible surface illuminated. Mars will also be reflecting sunlight, and growing steadily brighter night after night as the Earth’s orbital motion draws it nearer.The closest approach between the two worlds will occur on 25 January 2025, when Earth will be 54m miles (87m km) from the red planet. This is not the closest they can come to one another, however. In 2003, Mars drew to within 34m miles of Earth. It was the closest approach for nearly 60,000 years.From the southern hemisphere, the pairing of Mars and the moon will rise a few hours later in the night, and then follow an arcing path across the northern sky.",
