It's a little on the expensive side, but it's a set we're glad to have in our collection. Pros +Great build +So many gold bricks! +Excellent movement in the fingers Cons -Overpriced given its piece count Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products. Key detailsPrice: $79.99/£79.99Model number: 76191Number of pieces: 590Dimensions: 13 x 6 x 5 inches / 31 x 13 x 11cmRecommended age: 18+Most Lego sets stay on store shelves for a year or two at most before being moved on and retired, making way for new sets. Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet bucks that trend: It's been around for four years now, first released in 2021, and it's still going strong. That alone speaks of the strength of this set: It's clearly been very popular with Marvel fans, and it's not hard to see why. Gold bricks tend to be rather elusive in Lego sets, but here, the gauntlet is awash with them. Besides, is there anything as iconic as the Infinity Gauntlet when it comes to Marvel?There's a lot to like about the set too: The range of movement in the fingers is seriously impressive, and — if Thanos was normal-person-sized — it's practically life-size. It's almost a shame it's not hollow so we could slip our own hands inside.This 18+ set is designed to be a display piece, although it's impossible to resist arranging the fingers in a number of gestures — we wouldn't dare suggest you do anything rude with them! The only real negative we can levy at the Infinity Gauntlet, however, is its price: $79.99 for a 590-piece set feels very expensive.Is it worth it? Well, that's up to you, really: Read on to see what we think, and whether or not the Infinity Gauntlet is worth a place in our list of the best Lego Marvel sets.The golden bricks and gem details on the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet are undoubtedly eye-catching. (Image credit: Kim Snaith)Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet review: The buildA fun, interesting buildSo many gold bricks!Excellent finger jointsWe've counted, and we reckon there are 176 shiny gold bricks used in the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet set. That's about a third of the pieces used in the set, which is very impressive indeed. Does any other set have as many gold pieces? We can't say for sure, but we're fairly certain not.Those gold bricks alone are probably enough for some Lego collectors to pick up the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet. After all, these rare-ish pieces are highly sought-after, and for amateur Lego designers, buying this set is probably the best way to get their hands on so much gold.But piece value aside, there's a lot to love about the Infinity Gauntlet. This is a straightforward but fun build, with its pieces spread across three bags. It'll take roughly 90 minutes to build and for the most part, it's a straightforward and pleasant process.The joints in the fingers in Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet are second to none. (Image credit: Kim Snaith)Putting the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet together feels very methodical. Starting with the stand, you'll then move onto constructing the inside of the gauntlet, which provides it some much-needed structure. It's when you move onto the third bag that things get more interesting: Here, you construct the fingers.As you'd expect from a set with so much motion in the fingers, there are some interesting building techniques used. Replicating the movement of a real hand, the thumb has one joint, with every other digit having two.It feels like a very premium set when put together: It's solid, as well as being wonderful to look at. Even better, there's not a sticker in sight — always a boon.The Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet has realistic joints and is realistically-sized. (Image credit: Kim Snaith)Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet review: DesignRealistically-sized... If Thanos wasn't so hugeFeatures a sturdy display standVibrant and eye-catchingSerious props need to go to the Lego designers here, because the construction of the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet truly is a feat of engineering. Not only is it seriously sturdy, but it packs in a realistic range of movement too. The joints are loose and easy to move, but tight enough so the Gauntlet will stay in whatever position you place it. It's a shame that the fingers can't move outwards, but we can't have everything — their back-and-forth movements still allow for plenty of creative positioning.The Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet is roughly the size of a human hand, and it's affixed to a sturdy black display stand. It's a stand that matches Lego's range of Star Wars helmets, so the set wouldn't look out of place standing next to a Darth Vader and Stormtrooper helmet. That said, it looks just as striking by itself: Thanks to all those gold bricks, it stands out and demands attention no matter where you put it.The Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet comes on a sturdy stand complete with a printed plaque. (Image credit: Kim Snaith)Of course, being an 18+ set, the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet is very much designed to be a display set rather than a play set. As we've said, the fingers can be adjusted but that's about all you can do with it — as sturdy as it is, we're not sure we'd want smaller hands tugging on the fingers and trying to wedge their hands into the base (you can't: It's completely solid inside).But as a display set, there's so much to like here. The only reservation we have is the $79.99/£79.99 price, which unfortunately increased since the set first released in 2021. It's increased by $10 in the US and an eye-watering £20 in the UK. If you're in the UK, then you'll certainly want to wait for a sale — and thankfully, we've regularly seen it reduced by 20% or more.Should you buy Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet?If you don't mind stumping up the $79.99 asking price for the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet, then yes, this makes a wonderful addition to any collection. Even if you're not a huge Marvel Avengers fan. It's hard to argue just how lovely-looking this set is — and how eye-catching all those golden bricks are.We'd perhaps say you should wait for a bit of a discount, though, because the asking price is pretty steep, and you can get much bigger sets (in terms of piece count) for a similar price. Still, once you've built this and seen just how nice it looks in the flesh, it's hard to resent the asking price too much.The range of movement in the fingers is truly impressive. (Image credit: Kim Snaith)Other Lego sets to considerIf it's value for money you want, take a look at Venomized Groot. It has more pieces than the Infinity Gauntlet, yet it is $30 cheaper at $49.99. It's a seriously fun set too, combining the cuteness of Groot and the fearsome vibes of Venom, and can be built in two different ways.If money's no object, take a look at the super-impressive Lego Marvel Avengers Tower. It may cost an eye-watering $499.99, but it's the ultimate set for Avengers fans, packing in 31 minifigures into an almost meter-tall tower.

Not only is it seriously sturdy, but it packs in a realistic range of movement too. The joints are loose and easy to move, but tight enough so the Gauntlet will stay in whatever position you place it. It\u0026#39;s a shame that the fingers can\u0026#39;t move outwards, but we can\u0026#39;t have everything — their back-and-forth movements still allow for plenty of creative positioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet is roughly the size of a human hand, and it\u0026#39;s affixed to a sturdy black display stand.

As we\u0026#39;ve said, the fingers can be adjusted but that\u0026#39;s about all you can do with it — as sturdy as it is, we\u0026#39;re not sure we\u0026#39;d want smaller hands tugging on the fingers and trying to wedge their hands into the base (you can\u0026#39;t: It\u0026#39;s completely solid inside).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as a display set, there\u0026#39;s so much to like here. The only reservation we have is the $79.99/£79.99 price, which unfortunately increased since the set first released in 2021. It\u0026#39;s increased by $10 in the US and an eye-watering £20 in the UK. If you\u0026#39;re in the UK, then you\u0026#39;ll certainly want to wait for a sale — and thankfully, we\u0026#39;ve regularly seen it reduced by 20% or more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"section-should-you-buy-lego-marvel-infinity-gauntlet\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShould you buy Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0026#39;t mind stumping up the $79.99 asking price for the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet, then yes, this makes a wonderful addition to any collection.
