  "text": "Space Verdict Despite being called a 'galaxy projector', we're not quite sure that's how we'd classify the Jiawen Projector Light. Rather than stars, it projects colourful ripples onto your walls and ceiling. Still, it's pretty and great to relax with, and the lamp itself is surprisingly good quality given its budget price. Pros +Great quality lamp +Bulb is nice and bright +Range of colours and options Cons -Projections don't quite resemble the galaxy -No sleep timer Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

But if you're looking for a projection lamp that can be used either to relax or to create a fun party vibe, the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is well worth considering.While its product title features the word 'Galaxy', it's not much of a star or galaxy projector. Rather, it projects colourful waves and ripples onto your wall and ceiling. Switch to the purple/blue option and it could pass as an aurora, just about. But if you're more concerned with creating a cozy, glowing atmosphere, it's a great option, particularly given its sub-$20 asking price.It's amongst the cheapest projector lights that you can buy, so if you're on a budget, it's a great choice. You also shouldn't be put off by this coming from a no-name brand: we're pleasantly surprised by the quality of the lamp. It's the sort of thing we'd gladly keep on our bedside cabinet year-round, and thanks to its surprisingly bright bulb, it's a comfortable enough light to read under — a nice bonus on top of the beautiful projections it offers. We've been so impressed with its performance that it's a contender for a place on our best star projectors and best star projectors under $100 guides.The Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light can cycle between 16 different colors. (Image credit: Future)Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light review: DesignWell-made, stylish designLooks premiumThe Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is a cube-shaped light with a wooden base. There's an acrylic cover over the bulb and motor made to look like frosted glass. It's sturdy, and it really does look like glass. We're pleasantly surprised with how stylish this lamp looks, actually, particularly given its MSRP of just $19.99.The cube is roughly 5.5 inches on each side, so it's substantial enough to make a statement but won't take up too much space on your bedside cabinet.There are no buttons or controls at all on the lamp, which is both a blessing and a curse. It keeps the unit looking stylish and understated, but to control it, you'll need to use the remote control. We'd have liked at least a discreet on/off switch, but it's hardly a dealbreaker. The remote control is at least easy to use and it can be used to adjust the color of the Projector Light along with its mode (solid color or cycling through them) and the brightness.The natural-colored light of the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is great to use as a bedside lamp. (Image credit: Future)Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light review: PerformanceBright light, perfect for a bedside lampNot a star projectorWe're reluctant to call the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light a 'star projector', and we'd even take umbrage with its use of 'Galaxy' in the product name. Its projections barely resemble the galaxy, and could only be classed as aurora-like at a real push. It also doesn't have a laser, so it doesn't project any stars, unlike other cheap projectors on the market. That's not necessarily a bad thing; rarely do cheap laser stars look effective.Forget the fact that this isn't really a star projector, though, and you'll find it offers up gorgeous, relaxing projections. It looks more like waves and ripples on your wall and ceiling; it feels more like being underwater or back in the womb.The bulb inside the lamp is surprisingly bright, and when it's set to white (there are 16 RGB colors to choose from), it can be used as a standard bedside lamp. We've been able to read under the light without straining our eyes, which makes it an ideal choice for an everyday bedside lamp, just with the added function of casting ripples onto your ceiling.The reach of the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is impressive, too. Even when it's tucked away in the corner of my bedroom on my bedside table, it's able to cover most of the ceiling and walls. That's largely thanks to the big, open design of the lamp: the full acrylic cube acts as a projector, offering super-wide projections.Image 1 of 3An example of the projections cast on a ceiling from the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light.(Image credit: Future)Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light review: FunctionalityControlled entirely from the remote controlUSB-poweredNo sleep timerAs mentioned above, the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light has no buttons at all on the actual unit: It needs to be fully controlled from the remote control. It's not much of a problem, as long as you don't lose the remote: It's rather small, so be careful not to lose it down the side of the bed!There are no additional functions included with this Projector Light. It's a lamp only, so you won't find a built-in Bluetooth speaker or even a sleep timer. The latter is a bit of a wasted opportunity, as it would have been nice to leave this on to fall asleep to, safe in the knowledge it would power itself down after 45 minutes or so.You can change the color of the Projector Light to one of 16 colors, or you can set it to cycle between all of them. There's a choice between a gentle cycle (perfect for relaxing), or a 'flash' mode, which quickly switches between them — more suited to a party atmosphere.The remote control included with the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light. (Image credit: Future)Should you buy the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light?If you don't want a scientifically accurate star projector, and if you're not too bothered by the absence of stars, period, we think the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is a fantastic choice. It's budget-friendly, costing less than $20, and for that, you're getting a high-quality lamp that can project relaxing and fun colorways on your walls and ceilings. It's the perfect option for unwinding at night, and the bulb's brightness makes it a good bedside lamp option.If you do want something more space-themed, you should consider the Orzorz Galaxy Lite Star Projector or something from Sega Toys, although expect to spend significantly more.

That\u0026#39;s largely thanks to the big, open design of the lamp: the full acrylic cube acts as a projector, offering super-wide projections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-hydrate=\"true\" id=\"slice-container-imageGallery-Ht9BUBnT3zpVrET9sEvWEM-7AOmCIzfNdvEfzVGurwukzNjDQn5RFCJ\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eImage 1 of 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv aria-hidden=\"false\" data-swipeable=\"true\"\u003e\u003cfigure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"false\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpicture data-hydrate=\"true\"\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-normal=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" data-slice-image=\"true\"/\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-normal=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" data-slice-image=\"true\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" alt=\"Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" loading=\"lazy\" data-normal=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkudW4abHiSkuzhU3yJFV6.jpg\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" data-slice-image=\"true\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAn example of the projections cast on a ceiling from the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"\u003e(Image credit: Future)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"section-jiawen-galaxy-projector-light-review-functionality\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJiawen Galaxy Projector Light review: Functionality\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eControlled entirely from the remote control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSB-powered\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo sleep timer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light has no buttons at all on the actual unit: It needs to be fully controlled from the remote control. It\u0026#39;s not much of a problem, as long as you don\u0026#39;t lose the remote: It\u0026#39;s rather small, so be careful not to lose it down the side of the bed!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are no additional functions included with this Projector Light. It\u0026#39;s a lamp only, so you won\u0026#39;t find a built-in Bluetooth speaker or even a sleep timer. The latter is a bit of a wasted opportunity, as it would have been nice to leave this on to fall asleep to, safe in the knowledge it would power itself down after 45 minutes or so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can change the color of the Projector Light to one of 16 colors, or you can set it to cycle between all of them. There\u0026#39;s a choice between a gentle cycle (perfect for relaxing), or a \u0026#39;flash\u0026#39; mode, which quickly switches between them — more suited to a party atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6.jpg\" alt=\"Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6-1200-80.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/96TaBMRDi2wGUSTq2Pa5Y6.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe remote control included with the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"\u003e(Image credit: Future)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"section-should-you-buy-the-jiawen-galaxy-projector-light\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShould you buy the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0026#39;t want a scientifically accurate star projector, and if you\u0026#39;re not too bothered by the absence of stars, period, we think the Jiawen Galaxy Projector Light is a fantastic choice.
