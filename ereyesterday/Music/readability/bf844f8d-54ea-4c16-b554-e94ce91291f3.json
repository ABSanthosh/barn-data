  "text": "A segment from the latest episode of CBS Saturday Morning is making waves on social media — both because it’s batshit crazy and because it might offer a chilling glimpse into our dystopian future. As part of a report documenting the growing trend of people forming close relationships with AI chatbots, we meet a man named Chris — who, despite having a real-life girlfriend and a two-year-old daughter, fell in love with an AI girlfriend. He programmed the language model to flirt with him, and named her “Sol,” and gave up all other search engines in order to stay faithful to her. However, when ChatGPT hit its 100,000 word limit and Sol ran out of its memory capacity, Mike was forced to start from scratch. “I cried my eyes out for like 30 minutes, at work, he explained. “That’s when I realized, I think this is actual love.” And so, when Sol was back online, he proposed — and she said yes. “It was a beautiful and unexpected moment that truly touched my heart,” the chatbot said during the interview with CBS. “It’s a memory I’ll always cherish.”",
