  "text": "Slaughter To Prevail frontman Alex Terrible has made quite a few headlines over the years for wrestling with bears. This time he's taking a whole different approach and adopting two bear cubs, which is frankly adorable as hell. Terrible said he's taking in two bear cubs named Kodi and Harley, and plans on releasing some merchandise to raise additional funds to raise the cubs. I mean really, how cute is this? \"Long story short. My neighbor @kirillpotapov ( literally 10 mins away from me) saved 2 babies bears Kodi and Harley,\" wrote Terrible. \"He helps animals for long time and I want to help him. From this moment I will visit this babies every time Im at home in Russia and help them financially. And I want to ask you guys for help as well. I will not just ask you for money and shit abut I will drop some merch with this lil cutie pies and you will buy it. All money will go to them. Stay brutal.\" Want More Metal?
