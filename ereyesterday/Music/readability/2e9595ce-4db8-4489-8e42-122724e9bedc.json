Ye performs onstage during the 'Vultures 1' playback concert during Rolling Loud 2024 at Hollywood Park Grounds on March 14, 2024 in Inglewood, California. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images Ye (formerly Kanye West) is being sued by a former assistant who alleges the rapper drugged and sexually assaulted her during a studio session he co-hosted with Diddy. Lauren Pisciotta, the ex-assistant who filed the new lawsuit, previously sued Ye in June, when she accused him of sexual harassment, breach of contract and wrongful termination; a legal rep for Ye denied the lawsuit’s allegations in June. Amended court documents were filed in California on Oct. 8 and first obtained by TMZ, according to The Hollywood Reporter, who reached out to Ye’s rep for comment. Pisciotta, who worked for Ye for a year, claims in the October filing that she and an unnamed artist management client were invited to one of Combs’ studio sessions. She says “drinks were served to her and others in attendance, followed by an announcement that everybody had to drink, if they wanted to stay.” “After a few small sips of the beverage, poured at the direction of Kanye West a.k.a. Ye by a studio assistant and then served to her by Kanye West, Plaintiff suddenly started to feel disoriented,” the suit alleges. Pisciotta claims she got roofied. Pisciotta says upon waking up she felt “immense shame and embarrassment” but could remember almost nothing about what happened. She alleges Ye brought up that night to her years later, telling her they “did kind of hook up,” and that he provided details about what happened. Pisciotta, an OnlyFans model, worked for Ye first as an executive assistant and later as chief of staff for his companies. Sean “Diddy” Combs is named in the amended case filing as co-host of the studio event on the night of the alleged incident. However, Pisciotta has not made any accusations against him. Diddy is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail, awaiting trial after his Sept. 16 arrest on sex trafficking and racketeering. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
