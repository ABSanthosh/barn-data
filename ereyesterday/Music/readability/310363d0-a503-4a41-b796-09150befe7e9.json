  "text": "The 'Brat' star, who revealed she'll \"probably do something completely different\" on her next album, was the night's top winner. Charli XCX poses on the red carpet upon arrival for the BRIT Awards in London on March 1, 2025. Henry Nicholls/AFP via Getty Images 2025 BRIT Awards winner Charli XCX was gorgeously draped in a Dilara Findikoglu dress, a garment of sheer layers that mostly concealed the singer’s bust, at Saturday night’s show — but the look must’ve nearly been deemed risqué by British network ITV. “I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,” Charli commented at the podium on March 1 at London’s O2 Arena, while accepting the artist of the year award. “I feel like we’re in the era of free the nipple though, right?” “Thanks for being on my side,” she added after the crowd cheered. Styled by Chris Shoran, Charli wore look nine from Dilara Findikoglu‘s autumn/winter 2025 collection. The black dress, with a calf-skimming, pencil skirt silhouette layered over a minimalist, bikini-shaped bottom, was paired with classic pumps by Christian Louboutin.

Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images “I’ve gotta say, I feel like I’ve always been an artist but it really takes a whole team, and they’re all like sat at that table. I just want to say thank you so much to the people who helped me make this record,” said the Brat singer as she accepted her third of four award wins at the 2025 BRITs. She’d already collected the awards for song of the year and dance act. Charli gave a special shout out her fiancé in her artist of the year speech: “George Daniel, love you, baby.” (Daniel is a notable musician and producer, and a founding member of the band The 1975. For Charli he produced “Apple” and “Club Classics” on Brat, and also worked on “I Might Say Something Stupid,” which also features Jon Hopkins and Daniel’s 1975 bandmate Matty Healy, for the companion release Brat and It’s Completely Different but Also Still Brat).

JMEnternational/Getty Images “Thank you to all the artists out there who feel like they don’t fit in but are brave enough to try and be rejected a million times. I share this with you,” Charli said, candidly. “Keep partying,” she told the audience. It was a pastime she was likely talking part in; host Jack Whitehall joked at the start of the ceremony that Charli had asked to not perform so she could get drunk Saturday night. The mind behind Brat won the awards for artist of the year, album of the year, song of the year (for “Guess,” featuring Billie Eilish) and dance act at the 2025 BRITs, and the night’s honorary songwriter of the year prize also went to her. Brat executive producer A.G. Cook won producer of the year. What should fans expect from Charli’s next album? “I’ll probably do something completely different,” she said at the BRIT Awards. “I used to tell myself that things like this weren’t important,” Charli admitted when returning to the stage to accept the album of the year award. “This kind of recognition, awards in general, weren’t important. That was really easy for me to do because until last year I was literally never nominated for anything … Now it’s cool to not be in that position.” “I guess this time around the culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us,” she said.
