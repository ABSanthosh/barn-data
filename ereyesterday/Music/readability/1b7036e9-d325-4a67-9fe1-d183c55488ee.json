  "text": "Spinefarm has just signed Florida's Cold Steel and I can totally see why – this band has one speed, and it's \"stomping fucking riffs.\" To mark the occasion, the band has unleashed their brand new single, \"Blacksmith of Damnation,\" a crushing introduction to their signature brand of aggressive metal, fusing thrash intensity, hardcore grit, and bone-breaking grooves. \"Blacksmith of Damnation\" was produced by Arthur Rizk (Power Trip, Blood Incantation, Cavalera). \"Bear witness to an earth-shattering force that is 'Blacksmith of Damnation'—a harrowing tale of good versus evil, a hunt for salvation, and an unrelenting quest to unveil what lies beyond,\" said Cold Steel vocalist Jose Menendez. \"We're truly grateful for our team at Spinefarm Records, not just for the opportunity, but for giving us free rein to embrace our creative expression. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, especially to our supporters. We sincerely hope you all enjoy this blistering take on the hero's journey.\" Check it out below and catch Cold Steel at one of their two upcoming shows below. 6/21 Brandon, FL @ Florida Rules Fest @ The Noise Box8/8 Tampa, FL @ The Brass Mug (w/ Crowbar \u0026 Eyehategod) Want More Metal?
