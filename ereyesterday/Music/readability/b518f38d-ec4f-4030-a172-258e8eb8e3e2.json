  "text": "Our Songs of the Week column looks at great new music from the last week and analyzes notable releases. Find all our latest favorites and more on our Spotify Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, check out our Spotify New Sounds playlist. This week, new tracks from Wishy, McKinley Dixon, Weatherday, and more.   Staff Picks: February 17th – 21st 2025 Brandon – “Right Back” R\u0026B vocalist Brandon has described his upcoming album, Before You Go, as an exploration of the idea that love is in a constant state of change. The idea is effectively captured by his latest single, Right Back,” a soulful alt-pop track exploring a return to something that will inevitably end in more pain. The layered harmonies support the confessional vocal at the heart of the song. “You’re like cyanide/ But baby I still want you,” he sings, veering through a melodic chorus and conversational verses. — Mary Siroky Carly Pearce – “no rain” Arriving with the deluxe version of her 2024 album hummingbird, Carly Pearce’s “no rain” is an intimate ode to optimism. While the idea of rain being important to make the flowers grow is a mantra that’s been explored before, something about it feels fresh in Pearce’s hands, along with the rootsy production and string-laden bridge. The continuing forward momentum feels emblematic of this chapter in her story as a whole, as Pearce continues to establish herself as one of the most essential female voices in the genre. — M. Siroky Hannah Cohen — “Draggin’” From the first note that Hannah Cohen sings on new song “Draggin’,” it’s clear that her voice is inimitable. Doubled up in the mix, her high timbre and powerful control of dynamics give “Draggin’” a soulful twist. With plenty of background vocals, bluesy guitars, and a throwback sound straight from the early ’70s, Hannah Cohen is untouchable on “Draggin’,” and it’s a golden hour offering from her upcoming LP Earthstar Mountain. — Paolo Ragusa Hurray for the Riff Raff – “Pyramid Scheme”  “Pyramid Scheme” is a folk rock gem from Hurray for the Riff Raff’s Alynda Segarra, one that gets us diving into our closet for those favored cowboy kickers. There’s an exuberance from the instrumentals that radiate light and positivity, making you feel armored to conquer the world…or at least the weekend. — Nicolle Periola Maruja – “Ceathair” Today, Maruja, one of our artists to watch in 2025, dropped the improvised Tír na nÓg EP. Having previously previewed the project with the exhilarating “Aon,” the rest of the lot proves to be no less exciting. The closing track “Ceathair,” in particular, showcases the group’s mastery of texture and dynamics. A slow-building rise that leads to the EP’s ultimate climax, “Ceathair” is a high note to go out on, adding to the anticipation for whatever Maruja will cook up next. — Jonah Krueger McKinley Dixon – “Sugar Water” (feat. Quelle Chris \u0026 Anjimile) The star has been on the rise for Richmond-born, Chicago-based rapper McKinley Dixon. But with his latest, the wildly energetic and jazz-infused “Sugar Water,” his next chapter has arrived with an especially attention-grabbing release. Here, Dixon is haunted by the ghosts of his past, particularly those of his home in the south — he’s aided by multi-hyphenate talent Quelle Chris and indie-folk artist Anjimile to round out the story, making his narrative feel tangible and urgent. — M. Siroky \u003c",
