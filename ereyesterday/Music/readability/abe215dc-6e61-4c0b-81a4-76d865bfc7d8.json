  "text": "Brazil made headlines earlier this month with a record-setting showing at Lady Gaga‚Äôs concert at Copacabana Beach. But wait till you see footage from System of a Down‚Äôs gig in S√£o Paulo earlier this week: ‚ÄúThis is not a war zone, this is not a riot, this is a System of a Down style Rock \u0026 Roll concert in Brazil!!!!!!!‚Äù guitarist Daron Malakian proudly declared from the stage to an estimated crowd of 75,000 fans, some waving flares and fire spinners while others moshed with abandon. A drone captured the scene from above ‚Äî and it‚Äôs really something else (see below). Get System of a Down Tickets Here The concert came as part of System of a Down‚Äôs first visit to South America in a decade, so clearly the crowd was extra hyped. For North American fans, the band will be playing a series of special stadium shows in East Rutherford, NJ; Chicago; and Toronto this summer ‚Äî though something tells me flares won‚Äôt be as aplenty at these dates (blame the fire marshals).
