  "text": "The 1999 Sundance Film Festival breakout documentary American Movie has been released in 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray format in celebration of its 25th anniversary. After taking home the Grand Jury Documentary Prize during its initial screening at the annual festival, the movie has become a celebrated cult favorite. Officially available as of today, October 15th, the disc is presented in 4K resolution with Dolby Vision and includes director and cast commentary and deleted scenes. It also contains a cut of Coven, the short film that was developed by Mark Borchardt, the eccentric subject of the documentary. Order a copy here. The thoughtful, intense documentary focuses on Borchardt and his obsession with making movies — despite living in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, and operating on zero budget. Filmed over a stretch of two years, the heartfelt and thought-provoking project is a moving portrait of human ambition in the face of difficulties and vices. Borchardt’s good friend Mike Schank acted in Coven, wrote music for the soundtrack, and served as an assistant on set and in the editing room. Their dynamic is one of the highlights of the film. Schank passed away in 2022 at the age of 56 after a battle with cancer. 20 years ago, the New York Times included American Movie on its list of the 1,000 best movies ever made.",
