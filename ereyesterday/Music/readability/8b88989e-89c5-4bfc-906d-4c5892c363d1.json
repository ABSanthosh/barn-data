  "text": "Ka, the Brownsville, Brooklyn rapper and firefighter born Kaseem Ryan, has died at 52 years old. According to an Instagram statement posted by his family, Ka “died unexpectedly” this past Saturday (October 12th) in New York City. No cause of death has been revealed. “Born and raised in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Ka lived a life of service — to his city, to his community, and to his music,” the statement reads. “As a 20-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, he put his life on the line to protect his fellow citizens. Ka rose to the rank of FDNY captain and was a first responder on September 11, 2001 during the attacks on the World Trade Center. He leaves an extraordinary legacy as a recording artist, including eleven remarkable self-released solo albums.” A proudly independent artist, Ka began rapping in the early ’90s, first as a member of the group Natural Elements and then as a part of the duo Nightbreed. In 1999, he stepped away from music and became a New York City firefighter. He eventually quit rapping altogether in 2003. After nearly a decade in the NYFD, Ka picked up the mic again to record the 2008 album Iron Works and linked up with Wu-Tang Clan member GZA on the latter’s song “Firehouse” that same year. From there, Ka served as a one-man operation by self-funding albums with the money he made while working overtime as a firefighter and mailing records directly to fans himself. Fellow New York rapper Mickey Factz memorialized Ka in the comments with the following thoughts: “KA is one of the greatest lyricists ever…. And without rhyming, being a fireman is one of the greatest jobs we as people respect. Im heartbroken. Condolences to the family.” Ka released his final studio album, The Thief Next to Jesus, this past August. Editor’s Note: Read why Ka’s A Martyr’s Reward was one of the top rap albums of 2021.",
