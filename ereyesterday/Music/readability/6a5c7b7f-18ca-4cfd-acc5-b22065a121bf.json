  "text": "The impossible has happened: Brit-pop legends Oasis played their first show together in 16 years, kicking off their reunion tour at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, UK, on Friday, July 4th. The band took the stage at exactly 8:15 p.m. local time and delivered a two-hour set heavy on classics from their iconic first two albums, Definitely Maybe and (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, including “Morning Glory,” “Supersonic,” “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova,” and “Live Forever.” The latter song ended with a tribute to Liverpool footballer Diogo Jota, who was killed earlier this week at age 28; his photo appeared on the video screens near the end of the performance. Oasis’ third album, 1997’s Be Here Now, was also represented with a pair of songs: “D’You Know What I Mean?” and “Stand By Me.” The band also ran through beloved non-album singles “Whatever,” “Acquiesce,” and “The Masterplan.” The current touring lineup of Oasis features brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher alongside original member Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs on guitar and piano, Gem Archer on guitar, Andy Bell on bass, and Joey Waronker on drums (who Noel introduced as the band’s “14th drummer”). Additional musicians on the tour include Christian Madden on keyboards, Jessica Greenfield on backing vocals, Alasatair White on trombone, Steve Hamilton on saxophone, and Joe Auckland on trumpet. Consequence was live on the scene in Cardiff; stay tuned for our full review of the concert to be published in the coming hours. Prior to tonight, Oasis last performed together in 2009, when Noel dramatically quit the band just before their set at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris. Following the split, Liam formed Beady Eye with fellow Oasis members Gem Archer, Andy Bell, and Chris Sharrock, before eventually launching a solo career. Meanwhile, Noel went on to create Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds. In the years since, the Gallagher brothers traded barbs in the press and repeatedly shot down any chance of a reunion. But throughout 2024, Liam seemed to extend an olive branch to his brother, even reserving a seat for Noel at each show on a recent solo tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of Definitely Maybe. Liam and Noel took the stage holding hands and shared a brief hug at the end of the show, but didn’t interact during the show itself. They did, however, take turns acknowledging the crowd: “Yes, beautiful people, it’s been too long,” Liam said at one point. When Noel took the mic, he joked about the steep ticket prices fans paid to be there: “I hope it was worth £175 of anybody’s money. Sorry, £210. Sorry, £250.” When Oasis announced their reunion last August, tickets sold out at breakneck speed, with only an estimated 2.3% of UK fans who signed up for the ticket lottery receiving a purchase code. Even those lucky enough to get a code reported technical issues and other obstacles that kept them from securing tickets, prompting the UK government to launch an investigation into Ticketmaster’s handling of the sale. Oasis will continue their reunion tour this month with shows in cities including Manchester, London, and Dublin before making their way over to North America in late August.
