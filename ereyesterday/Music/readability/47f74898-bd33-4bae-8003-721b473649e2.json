  "text": "Kelly Osbourne has made her first public remarks on the death of her father, the legendary Ozzy Osbourne, other than the joint statement put out by his family announcing his passing earlier this week. On her Instagram Story on Thursday (July 24th), Kelly shared the opening lyric to the Black Sabbath song “Changes”: “I feel unhappy I am so sad. I lost the best friend I ever had.” Not only is the lyric poignant in the wake of Ozzy’s passing, it’s taken from the same song that Kelly and Ozzy duetted on when they covered the 1972 Sabbath classic back in 2003. Just a couple days prior to Ozzy’s death, Kelly had shared a video of the metal icon eating breakfast at his home in Buckinghamshire, England. In the clip, Kelly and Ozzy exchanged “good morning” greetings with one another. Earlier this month, at the “Back to the Beginning” concert featuring the final performances of Ozzy and Sabbath, Kelly became engaged to her boyfriend, Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson, who proposed to her in front of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, among other family members. At one point, Ozzy quipped, “Fuck off! You’re not marrying my daughter.” Ozzy Osbourne died at age 76 on Tuesday (July 22nd). Since his passing, dozens of fellow musicians and entertainers have paid tribute to the legendary singer. See Kelly and Ozzy duetting on “Changes” below, followed by a screenshot of her aforementioned Instagram story.",
