Fire personnel respond to homes destroyed while a helicopter drops water as the Palisades Fire grows in Pacific Palisades, California on January 7, 2025. A fast-moving wildfire in a Los Angeles suburb burned buildings and sparked panic, with thousands ordered to evacuate January 7, 2025 as \"life threatening\" winds whipped the region. Frightened residents abandoned their cars on one of the only roads in and out of the upscale Pacific Palisades area, fleeing on foot from the 770-acre (310-hectare) blaze engulfing an area crammed with multi-million dollar homes in the Santa Monica Mountains. DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images Español Since Tuesday (Jan. 7), ferocious wildfires have been blazing through the greater Los Angeles region, causing extensive damage to life and property, including those of many individuals working in the music business. With nearly 180,000 residents impacted by evacuation orders, at least five dead and thousands of structures damaged or destroyed, music industry organizations are finding ways to provide relief for impacted music workers. Below, find a list of some of the music organizations offering relief for L.A. industry workers. We will continue to update this list as more announcements are made. (For health alerts, evacuation updates and shelter information, check out L.A. County’s emergency website here.) MusiCares The Recording Academy’s philanthropic arm MusiCares is offering financial assistance. A representative from MusiCares stated, “MusiCares is a resource to music professionals impacted by the fires in the Los Angeles area. MusiCares provides short-term disaster relief, including $1,500 in financial assistance and a $500 grocery card, to music professionals impacted. MusiCares disaster relief is intended to cover short-term costs, should you incur costs from evacuating (hotel, food, supplies). MusiCares is also able to provide additional support for individuals with considerable impact, including damage to their homes, medical issues, damaged music equipment or longer-term relocation needs. MusiCares support is available to music professionals (in any capacity) with 5 years employment or credit on 6 commercially-released recordings. If you would like to request support from MusiCares, please reach out to musicaresrelief@musicares.org.” Along with The Recording Academy, MusiCares announced Thursday (Jan. 9) that it had launched a Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort to support music professionals impacted by the crisis. The organizations kicked off the fund with a joint $1 million donation. ASCAP Emergency Relief Fund Announced Wednesday (Jan. 15), the $1 million fund is designed “to assist ASCAP composer and songwriter members in the Los Angeles area who have suffered loss or damage to their primary residence or studio, or been evacuated from their homes as a result of the LA fires.” ASCAP will provide one-time stipends in the amount of $1,500 to ASCAP writer members in good standing as of Jan. 1, 2025, “who does not have a resignation notice pending.” The stipends will be awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis while funds are available. You can apply for relief here. We Are Moving the Needle Microgrants Wildfire Relief Fund Launched on Thursday (Jan. 9), the fund is designed to support “early and mid-career producers, engineers, and creators who have lost studio space or gear” in the wildfires. Those looking to apply (or those wishing to donate) can go here. Entertainment Community Fund Emergency financial assistance from the Entertainment Community Fund is open to “eligible performing arts and entertainment professionals” who are “in times of unexpected critical need.” It can help with “basic living expenses” including health care and housing. On its website, the fund notes that applicants impacted by the L.A. wildfires will be asked “to upload a list of documents. If you do not have access to these documents, upload a blank file. Once we receive the application, we will work with you to complete the application.” You can apply for relief here. Backline Mental health non-profit Backline is sharing resources for musicians in Los Angeles via social media and offering its own services. “Know that Backline is here for you and that you are not alone,” the organization wrote on Instagram. “You can reach out to us via our case submission form and a Case Manager will contact you to help you get the long-term support you need. If you need immediate assistance, please reach out to the Disaster Distress Hotline for free 24/7 support by calling 1-800-985-5990.” Sweet Relief Musicians Fund Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, the non-profit helping musicians and music industry workers in need, has launched a natural disaster relief fund for those in Los Angeles County and the surrounding areas. Applications are also open for those seeking relief, with funds raised going toward loss of music-related equipment, medical bills related to the fires and other vital living expenses. Head here to donate or fill out an application. Guitar Center Music Foundation The Guitar Center Music Foundation has announced on its website that it is offering support to L.A.-area musicians and music programs affected by the devastating fires. Eligible individuals can apply for a one-time grant to help replace instruments lost or damaged in the fires. Applications are open through Feb. 28. To apply, visit the link here. NAMM The NAMM Foundation has pledged $50,000 and is welcoming further donations via its website. The fund aims to provide needs-based assistance to NAMM members, employees of NAMM member companies, music education programs and music professionals impacted by the fires. The foundation said it is currently assessing the needs of the affected community and will announce details about the distribution process and application guidelines in the near future. NAMM president and CEO said in a statement released on Thursday (Jan. 9) that the 2025 NAMM Show will go on as planned Jan. 21-25 in Anaheim, currently 60 millions southeast of the wildfires. “NAMM will continue to monitor the situation daily as the winds calm down and fires are contained,” he said.
