  "text": "Swedish atmospheric black metal band Wormwood have unveiled The Star, the climactic conclusion to their critically acclaimed conceptual series known as the Trilogy of Death. Following the historical tragedy explored in Nattarvet and the apocalyptic themes of Arkivet, The Star marks the band's most ambitious and profound work to date — the symbolic final breath of a cosmos that, as the band boldly suggests, we may never have deserved. The Star picks up the conceptual torch where its predecessors left off. While Nattarvet unearthed the grim reality of the 19th-century Nordic famine and Arkivet delved into humanity's inevitable collapse, The Star ventures far beyond Earthly confines. The album paints a harrowing yet strangely beautiful portrait of a dying universe, inviting listeners to witness the grand finale of existence through Wormwood's signature blend of melodic black metal, atmospheric layering, and poetic lyricism. Frontman Nine explains: \"The Star is the last gasp of a universe we didn't deserve. With this album, we invite our fans to join us on a cosmic odyssey, exploring the depths of despair and the peace that follows. It's the conclusion of a trilogy, a story we've been eager to share.\" The Star was mixed and mastered by renowned Swedish metal producer Sverker Widgren (Diabolical, ex-Centinex, etc.). Check out the single \"Thousand Doorless Rooms\" below in all its miserable glory, and maybe do it late at night – really end your day on a bummer. Pre-orders for The Star are available here.
