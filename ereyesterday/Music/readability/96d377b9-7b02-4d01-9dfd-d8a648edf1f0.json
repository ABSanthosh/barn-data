  "text": "Patriarkh – the band formerly known as Batushka and who is fronted by Bartłomiej \"Варфоломей\" Krysiuk – will release their first album under the Patriarkh name ПРОРОК ИЛИЯ (PROROK ILJA) on January 3. Patriarkh is now streaming the third single \"ВЕРШАЛИН II\" (\"Wierszalin II\"), whose lyrical content explores the overarching themes of revelation across the band's new record. \"'Wierszalin II [ВЕРШАЛИН II]' explores the theme of revelation, highlighting the significant role of the Mother of God as a symbolic sign within the piece. It reflects an anointing that accompanies the prophet's message, functioning as a prayer imbued with purpose,\" said Patriarkh of the single. \"This hymn is associated with the Prophet Ilya, encapsulating his expressions of worship, praise, and gratitude for the opportunity to serve and glorify heaven through his work. Ultimately, the song emphasizes the connection between divine revelation and the prophet's mission, which ends in failure.” Pre-orders for ПРОРОК ИЛИЯ are available here. On the new record and its concept, Patriarkh further explained: \"With this new release, we are starting a new chapter in our history – not only is our name changing, but our music is also undergoing a natural evolution. \"The story on the album encouraged us to get out of our comfort zone, we reached for means that we had not used before in our music. Many of you will wonder if this is still black metal? Or is it even metal? Radio play, audiobook, theater, film soundtrack, folk music, performance… All these terms will fit here. Some will hate, others will love…\" Want More Metal?
