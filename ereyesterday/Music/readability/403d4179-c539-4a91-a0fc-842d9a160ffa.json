  "text": "The upcoming Final Destination Bloodlines movie has a pretty straightforward soundtrack featuring artists like Johnny Cash, Kelly Clarkson, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and UK-based thrash band Evile. One of those things is certainly not like the other, but it's true! Evile's 2007 track \"Enter The Grave\" appears somewhere in the movie, though who knows where. Now I'm gonna have to go and watch this thing just to see where Evile pops up. Shout out to Evile for the exceptionally cool career feat – hopefully this means the band is getting cut at least a decent check. Final Destination Bloodlines is the follow-up to their 2011 horror movie Final Destination 5. Final Destination Bloodlines was directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein, written by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, and stars Kaitlyn Santa Juana (The Flash) as the main character Stefani Reyes.
