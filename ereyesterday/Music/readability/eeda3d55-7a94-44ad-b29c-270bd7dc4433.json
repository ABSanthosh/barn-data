  "text": "Clutch is closing out their 2024 with four year-end US dates. All four dates will showcase Clutch playing their 2004 record Blast Tyrant in full, and will feature Many Eyes and The Native Howl as support. Get those dates below (apologies in advance to everyone that's not in the Northeast) and get your tickets right here. 12/5 Norfolk, VA The Norva12/6 Baltimore, MD Ram's Head Live!12/7 Wantagh, NY Mulcahy's Concert Hall12/8 Sayreville, NJ Starland Ballroom To answer the question a lot of you are probably thinking, yes – Clutch is working on a new album. Clutch recently had their first demo session with producer Tom Dalgety, though vocalist Neil Fallon said the new album is unlikely to arrive prior to the third quarter of 2025. If anything, this post should be a good reminder that Blast Tyrant is a modern classic and that you need to go listen to it. If you're not (at the absolute least) having a good time when \"Subtle Hustle\" comes on, you are medically dead and should report to your local morgue. Want More Metal?
