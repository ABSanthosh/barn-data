  "text": "Blink-182 guitarist and UFO theorist, Tom DeLonge, has weighed in on the surge of alleged “drone” sightings on the East Coast, suggesting that they are reminiscent of UFOs sighted in the 1960s. Taking to Instagram, DeLonge wrote a (possibly misconstrued) description of the aircrafts. “The drones that are being discussed, can hover for six hours, and then disappear once they are spotted,” he said. “This is why it’s been hard to get facts from any US Agency. Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called ‘transmedium travel.’ A very hard thing to do.” Continuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. “It seems like it’s a repeat of exactly what happened in the ‘60s,” he wrote. According to DeLonge — who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories — UFOs have a pattern of “mimicking” other aircraft. “This even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,” he wrote. “And again, also decades ago in the ‘60s. It’s all something to consider.” DeLonge then wrote, “Although we don’t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with ‘mimicry’ and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?” DeLonge doesn’t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: “Well, we are noticing nonetheless.” Read DeLonge’s full post below. DeLonge’s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. “We plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,” he said in a statement at the time. Meanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they’re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).",
