She recounts her journey from Toronto to Bollywood, her collaboration with Jason Derulo and CK, plans for a 2025 tour and more! Nora Fatehi: Hi, I’m Nora Fatehi, and you’re watching Billboard News. So I think what makes me different as an artist, not only am I coming from India, not being Indian, being Moroccan, but being Canadian. I have all these three identities that make my brand Nora Fatehi, and it makes me a unique artist. And a lot of people globally from different parts of the world can relate to me and see a little bit of themselves within me. And I think with my upbringing in Toronto, being so cosmopolitan, I’ve been exposed to different styles of music from Dance Hall, Afro, Bollywood, Arabic, Hip-Hop. I’ve taken all that and I’ve injected it within my artistry. I also make sure the dance styles are very diverse. So in some videos, you may see us do afro. In some other videos, you might see us do belly dance. You might see us do strictly Bollywood dance styles. But I make sure that within the music that I put out, I also make sure visually, the dance styles are very diverse. And while doing that, I’ve gained a huge, large, diverse fan following that have fallen in love with the type of steps I do, the hook steps, the choreography. And I noticed on social media, people would dance to the music that I put out and copy the hook steps. And I’m like, “Oh my God, let me create a platform for them on social media.”  Keep watching for more!",
