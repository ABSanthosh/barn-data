  "text": "We Came As Romans return with their most ambitious and emotionally resonant work to date: All Is Beautiful… Because We're Doomed, out August 22. The upcoming album represents a profound evolution for the band – an introspective journey shaped by grief, gratitude, and philosophical reflection on life's cycles of death and rebirth. Built around a seamless looping structure where the final track transitions back into the opening, the album mirrors its own message: that every ending is the beginning of something new. Lyrically and musically, All Is Beautiful… Because We're Doomed serves as a sonic autobiography, drawing directly from personal moments throughout the band's storied career. Following 2022's grief-stricken Darkbloom, this new record pushes even deeper, weaving existential themes with anthemic intensity. The track \"culture wound\" anchors the album's duality, representing both struggle and transformation. It underwent extensive reworking—a process symbolic of the band's relentless dedication to crafting an album that feels both vulnerable and expansive. Pre-orders are available here. \"'culture wound' is about taking a look inside and deciding which side of yourself is going to control your life,\" wrote We Came As Romans of the single. \"This song was written to question our human nature – is it inherently good or inherently selfish? Are we here to try and make something better for everyone or just survive for ourselves? \"All of the different 'sides of ourselves' that we've discovered, struggled with, or left behind is really what this album is about, and our journey through all of those experiences is written in every song.\" To celebrate the album's release, We Came As Romans will embark on the Bad Luck World Tour, beginning July 22 in Toronto and culminating in a massive hometown show at The Fillmore in Detroit on August 23 – just one day after the album drops. European and UK dates follow in the fall, along with appearances at major festivals including Warped Tour, Inkcarceration, and When We Were Young.
