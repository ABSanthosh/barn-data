According to a post from Airbourne themselves, thieves broke into their gear locker in Melbourne and stole some very sentimental gear, among other things. Airbourne is asking anyone in the area to keep an eye out for the gear stolen. \"G'day everyone. It's with a heavy heart that we put this out there. Our Airbourne Australian Lockup was broken into on Sunday night. The thieves made off with 6 Guitars amongst other things. Most important was my father's old Mini Maton and his mandolin. \"Those of you who know Ryan and myself know that we lost our father back in 2014, so for me personally when I play my Dad‘s old guitar it brings me a little bit closer to him again, it's like a part of him comes back around again, it really helps me through shit when I feel I need to talk to him. Anyway, we just wanted to put this out there in case somebody heard anything or saw anything. \"From pawn shops to Facebook marketplace, conversations in bars or wherever, we are offering a handsome reward for any information that leads us to finding Dad's old Guitar and any of the others. Please DM us if you have any information. Cheers rockers xx\" The following is a list of the stolen gear, per Airbourne: Dads Mini maton – 5795 Gretsch 1963 Duo Jet Black in original grey moulded case. – 47938 Gibson 1976 black beauty Les Paul – 117972 Gretsch acoustic (no photo) Dads Mandolin (no photo) Takamine G series Acoustic bass wood grain w case – EG512CGANQ (no photo) Malcolm young signature series – JT10081871 Want More Metal?
