  "text": "Mexican regional act Grupo Firme have pulled out of their scheduled appearance at the La Onda Festival this weekend after their visas were unexpectedly suspended. The performance was set to take place on Sunday (June 1st) in Napa Valley, CA. The band said their visas are “under administrative review by the U.S. Embassy,” per an Instagram statement obtained by the Associated Press, and stated it would be “impossible” to stage their show. Due to the confidential nature of visa proceedings, the AP also corroborated the U.S. Embassy in Mexico could not provide any additional information at this time. Grupo Firme isn’t the only Mexican act facing visa issues as of late; last month, Julión Álvarez abruptly postponed a sold-out show in Arlington, TX, after his work visa was revoked, barring his entry into the States. Both acts are known for performing narco-corridos, a genre that has long stirred debate. While critics argue these songs glorify cartel leaders, supporters contend they offer a raw reflection of the difficult realities faced by youth entangled in the drug trade. Amid the growing controversy, Grupo Firme has taken steps in recent months to stop performing narco-corridos live. Beyond the targeting of Latino musicians, Canadian trans musician Bells Larsen had to cancel his US tour because “US Immigration now only recognizes identification that corresponds with one’s assigned sex at birth.” Meanwhile, FKA twigs faced setbacks for her “Eusexua Tour” after not completing visa paperwork on time, rescheduling several US tour dates multiple times. UK Subs revealed they were denied entry to the United States, with bassist Alvin Gibbs hypothesizing it may have been due to his lambasting of Donald Trump.",
