  "text": "As the world continues to mourn the passing of rock and metal icon Ozzy Osbourne, the Alamo in San Antonio has issued a heartfelt statement recognizing the late singer's unique place in the site's history — one that evolved from infamy to redemption over four decades. While Ozzy Osbourne will forever be known as the pioneering frontman of Black Sabbath and a reality television icon, his story is also inextricably tied to a notorious moment in 1982 that caused a firestorm in Texas. During a night of heavy drinking before a performance at HemisFair Arena, Ozzy was arrested for public intoxication after urinating on the Alamo Cenotaph, a 60-foot monument honoring those who died in the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. Though he did not urinate on the main mission structure itself, the act was perceived as a profound insult to a deeply sacred Texas landmark. In the years that followed, Ozzy made multiple attempts to make amends with the city and the site's caretakers. In 1992, he personally apologized to then-San Antonio Mayor Nelson Wolff, expressing genuine remorse. His effort to right past wrongs extended even further in 2015, when Ozzy returned to the Alamo grounds alongside his son Jack while filming a History Channel show. That visit was marked by respect, reflection, and a deeper understanding of the mission’s cultural and historical significance. Now, in the wake of Ozzy’s passing on July 22, 2025, at the age of 76, the Alamo’s official Facebook page shared a powerful tribute that captures the essence of Ozzy’s journey from scandal to reconciliation. \"We at the Alamo are saddened to hear of the passing of legendary musician Ozzy Osbourne. His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982. This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. \"However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding. \"At the Alamo, we honor history in all its complexities. Today, we acknowledge Ozzy Osbourne's journey from regret to reconciliation at the historic site, and we extend our condolences to his family, friends, and fans around the world. May he rest in peace.\" Ozzy’s death follows what is now known to be his final performance with Black Sabbath at Villa Park in Birmingham, UK, on July 2, 2025 — a historic reunion with original members Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward. For Texans, and especially the city of San Antonio, Ozzy Osbourne will not only be remembered as the Prince of Darkness but also as a man who made things right. Want More Metal?
