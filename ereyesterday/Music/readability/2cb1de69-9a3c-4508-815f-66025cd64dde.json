  "text": "Netflix has officially announced Beef Season 2, revealing the cast and details of the upcoming second installment, which will span eight 30-minute episodes. No premiere date has been announced. As previously reported, Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan will star as one feuding couple opposite another played by rising actors Charles Melton and Cailee Spaeny. “A young couple witnesses an alarming fight between their boss and his wife, triggering chess moves of favors and coercion in the elitist world of a country club and its Korean billionaire owner,” reads the official logline. Series creator Lee Sung Jin is returning as the showrunner for Beef, now billed as an anthology series. He will also executive produce alongside Season 1 stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, as well as Jake Schreier. Coming from A24, the first installment of Beef cleaned up during awards season in the limited series category, including an Emmy win for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series and acting nods for Yeun and Wong. Read why we named Beef one of the best TV shows of 2023.",
