  "text": "The power couple was surprised with the Black Love Award during the event in Los Angeles. Shante Broadus and Snoop Dogg accept an award onstage at the 2024 Give Her FlowHers Presented By Live Nation at The Beverly Hilton on November 8, 2024 in Los Angeles. Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for Femme It Forward Snoop Dogg and his wife, Shante Broadus, were honored with the Black Love Award at the 2024 Give Her FlowHERS Awards Gala. The legendary hip-hop artist and his spouse accepted the award during Femme it Forward’s third annual gala, held on Friday (Nov. 8) at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. In his acceptance speech, Snoop reflected on the significance of the award. “This is beautiful because throughout my career I’ve been nominated and won a lot of awards, but there’s nothing like an award that brings you back home to the stage to let people know that this is the reason why you are so successful,” the rapper shared, standing beside Shante, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

And to the couples out there tonight, it’s always going to be rocky, it’s always going to be hard, but if it’s true love, and it’s meant to be, it’s going to always be good news. That’s real love. Black love.” The 2024 Give Her FlowHERS Awards Gala, hosted by Saweetie, also honored other musical artists, including Jill Scott, Chloe Bailey, Halle Bailey, GloRilla, Doechii, Lady London and Nija. Trending on Billboard Saweetie, who was also presented with an award, expressed gratitude in her speech. “I’d like to thank God because without prayer and faith, I would have lost my mind a long time ago,” the rapper said. “We all know this because we know how crazy this industry can get, but tonight this room is safe. Thank you all for allowing us to be vulnerable.” Femme it Forward founder Heather Lowery, in her opening remarks, seemed to acknowledge the emotional impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election results, particularly among supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris. “To the women and girls who are overqualified and undervalued, can you all stand if you’ve felt this way at any point in your journey?” Lowery said, according to THR. “We want to hold space for you tonight and remind you we see you, we honor you, and you are more than enough. You are the reason why we are here tonight. I know we’ve all been overwhelmed with so many emotions over the last few days. I want you to treat your grief the same way you would treat your garden. Nurture it. Give it space, give it time, let it bloom.” Other notable honors during Friday’s gala included the My Sister’s Keeper Award presented to siblings Chloe and Halle Bailey; the Visionary Award for Doechii; the Big Femme Energy honor for GloRilla; and the Muse Award for Jill Scott.
