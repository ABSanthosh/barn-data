  "text": "Dave Grohl made a surprise appearance during weekend two of Coachella, joining Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to perform renditions of Foo Fighters’ “The Sky Is a Neighborhood” and “Everlong.” The set also featured guest appearances from Cynthia Erivo, who covered Prince’s “Purple Rain,” Laufey, Natasha Bedingfield, and Ca7riel \u0026 Paco Amoroso. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Venezuelan-born Dudamel called Coachella a “dream” gig, adding that it “represents a journey of making music accessible to everybody, but also creating a culture where people don’t feel that classical music is far away, not part of their lives.” It also marked the culmination of Dudamel’s 17-year tenure as conductor of the LA Phil, as he’ll be departing to lead the New York Philharmonic next year. As for Grohl, his appearance with the LA Phil marked his first time performing Foo Fighters songs since August 2024. Editor’s Note: Head here for more coverage of Coachella 2025.
