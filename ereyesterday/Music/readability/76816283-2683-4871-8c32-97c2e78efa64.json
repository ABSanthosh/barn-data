  "text": "The producer's credits feature a who's who of rock stars over the past half-century, including Journey, Yes, The Cars, Cheap Trick, Guns N' Roses \u0026 Smashing Pumpkins. Roy Thomas Baker at the Village Recording Studio in Los Angeles, California on December 9, 2005. Jim Steinfeldt/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Roy Thomas Baker — the producer behind some of rock’s biggest hits, including Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” — has died at age 78, his family announced Tuesday (April 22). Baker died at his home in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, on April 12. No cause of death has been revealed. The producer’s credits feature a who’s who of rock stars over the past half-century, including Journey, Yes, Foreigner, The Cars, Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Devo, Mötley Crüe, Guns N’ Roses and Smashing Pumpkins. Baker worked with Queen on five of the band’s 1970s albums, including on their bombastic A Night at the Opera lead single “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which is reportedly the most-streamed song recorded in the 20th century. The 1975 single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1976 but didn’t hit its No. 2 peak on the chart until its inclusion in the film Wayne’s World in 1992. Born in Hampstead, London, in 1946, Baker’s career began as second engineer to Gus Dudgeon and Tony Visconti at London’s Decca Records. He graduated to chief engineer in the ’70s and moved to Trident Studios to begin working with the then-unknown Queen. Columbia Records later asked him to relocate to the U.S. to work with Journey and others. Trending on Billboard “We did [1978 album] Infinity with the infamous Roy Thomas Baker,” recalled Journey’s Neal Schon, “and we did so many different things on that record that I’d never tried, or even thought about doing. I learned a lot from Roy.” Elektra Records, Queen’s U.S. label, connected Baker with Lindsey Buckingham, Dokken and The Cars — for whom he produced their first four albums, from 1978 to 1981. “Bohemian Rhapsody” and The Cars have both been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Recording Registry, two of the most prestigious honors for classic recordings. In addition, Queen’s A Night at the Opera album, which houses “Bohemian Rhapsody,” was separately inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Baker is survived by his wife, Tere Livrano Baker, and his brother, Alan Baker. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
