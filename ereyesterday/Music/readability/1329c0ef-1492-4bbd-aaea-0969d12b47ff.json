  "text": "There’s apparently still plenty of money to be made in crypto because The Black Keys have signed on to play the final show of “The America Loves Crypto Tour,” which is a not-at-all ridiculously named concert series hosted by the (we kid you not) Stand with Crypto Alliance political action committee. The “intimate show” goes down next Friday, October 25th at the Akron Civic Theatre in The Black Keys’ hometown of Akron, Ohio. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney are just the latest musicians to play in support of the PAC. Previous shows featured performances from Black Pumas, 070 Shake, Big Sean, Jessie Murph, Lauv, and of course, The Chainsmokers. So while the music industry’s NFT boom is long gone, it appears crypto’s big bet on the 2024 elections has offered a new set of opportunities. Stand with Crypto Alliance’s endorsements in the upcoming election include notorious Republicans like Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, and Marsha Blackburn, but there are some crypto-friendly Democrats on their list, too, including Jim Costa, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Pat Ryan. It’s not surprising that The Black Keys in particular would sign up for any gig that lines their pockets. In May, they quietly canceled a planned arena tour of North America — reportedly due to low ticket sales. One month later, the duo canned their managers, Irving Azoff and Steve Moir. Shortly following the tour’s cancellation, The Black Keys issued a statement promising to book a “revised set” of “intimate” shows. Though they recently announced a brief run of Latin America dates, there’s been no word on a new North American tour. The Black Keys released their most recent album, Ohio Players, in April.",
