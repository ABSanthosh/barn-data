Which album is your favorite from a Canadian woman? Let us know in the comments below! Tate McRae: This is my time. Tetris Kelly: Tate McRae just grabbed her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with ‘So Close To What,’ also becoming the first Canadian woman to lead the list during the 2020s. But what other Canadian women have led the list? We’re taking this Women’s History Month to break it down. ‘4+4’ — Tate McRae ate that, and she sat with us to chat all about her new No. 1 album. Tate McRae: Feeling like a woman for the first time, feeling sexualized for the first time, and feeling like people weren’t really receiving my work how I wanted it to be received. Tetris Kelly: But she follows in the footsteps of many other Canadian queens. Of the five other women from up north to sit at the summit, Celine Dion has the most No. 1s with five total. Alanis Morissette has three chart-toppers, including ‘Jagged Little Pill.’ Avril Lavigne from Belleville has two No. 1s from 2004 and 2007. Who could ever forget Shania Twain, who has gone up to the summit twice. And lastly, Nelly Furtado from Victoria topped the chart with ‘Loose’ in 2006.
