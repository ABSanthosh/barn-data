  "text": "Swift posted 13 days before the physical release of 'The Anthology,' and her official 'Eras Tour Book,' both of which will be available at Target on Black Friday. Taylor Swift performs onstage during \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Rogers Centre on Nov. 14, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario. Emma McIntyre/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management Taylor Swift gave fans a sneak peek at the Target-exclusive, Black Friday version of The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology on vinyl and CD, posting an image showing what appears to be the back cover of the vinyl on Instagram. Swift, whose official The Eras Tour Book is also coming to Target the same day as the vinyl/CD release, made the post on Instagram during the first of two weekends of The Eras Tour in Toronto. “Just 13 days til The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology on vinyl and CD AND The Official Eras Tour Book are all available for the first time ever at @target!” Swift wrote in her post Saturday (Nov. 16). “International info coming soon,” the pop star added, along with the heart hands emoji. Trending on Billboard Swift tagged Beth Garrabant on her post, giving the photographer credit for the Tortured Poets shoot. The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology was previously available as a digital release only. The 35-track album is being issued on vinyl ($59.99) and CD ($17.99) for the first time — with four bonus acoustic songs — on Black Friday. It’ll be in Target stores on Nov. 29 and at Target.com the next day, Nov. 30. Swift’s Instagram post on Saturday shows the track list of the Target-exclusive album release, including the acoustic song titles: “Fortnight (Acoustic Version) (feat. Post Malone),” “Down Bad (Acoustic Version),” “But Daddy I Love Him (Acoustic Version)” and “Guilty as Sin? (Acoustic Version).” All four bonus tracks are acoustic versions of songs from the standard, 16-track The Tortured Poets Department album. The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book ($39.99) will also be in Target stores on Nov. 29, and available to order on Target’s website Nov. 30. The 256-page hardcover book features personal reflections written by Swift and more than 500 images, including never-before-seen performance photos, rehearsal photos and behind-the-scenes photos from tour.
