  "text": "Acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh is embracing horror with his next project. The film stars Lucy Liu alongside Julia Fox and Chris Sullivan, and a full-length look at the moody movie has now arrived. Watch the Presence trailer below. The trailer expands on the mood of utter dread established in the first teaser, which dropped in August. After landing as a surprise addition to the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, Presence was picked up by Neon, who saw success with other horror projects this year in the form of Longlegs and Immaculate. First reactions out of Sundance hailed Presence as a movie that “flips the haunted house subgenre on its head” and “expands the possibilities of cinema.” While the full trailer shows Liu and her family moving throughout a house, there’s still very little revealed by way of plot. The logline for the film simply reads: “A family moves into a suburban house and becomes convinced they’re not alone.” IndieWire revealed that the film was shot from the perspective of the ghost, making Presence a particularly interesting entry into POV filmmaking. Presence already seems to be faring better than Full Circle, Soderbergh’s twisty Max series that fell flat. Revisit our review of Full Circle here.",
