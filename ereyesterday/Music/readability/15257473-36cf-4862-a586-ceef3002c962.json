Narrator:  Frontera had everyone in their feels last night at Billboard’s The Stage at SXSW in Austin, and we have all the details! The guys were a total vibe in all black. Love was in the air, and couples were slow dancing as Payo rocked the mic, leaving absolutely no crumbs with hits like “No Se Va” and “Hecha Pa’ Mi.” Backstage, the band smiled as they signed their Billboard cover, and back on stage, rising regional star Majo Aguilar crushed it as the opening act in a mint two-piece with mariachi, setting the scene for an unforgettable night of tejanas, boots and fire Música Mexicana.
