  "text": "In his first-ever stadium headlining show in his hometown, the Colombian superstar delivers a show filled with star-studded cameos, deep cuts and relentless energy. Feid performs at Medellín's Estadio Atanasio Girardot on Friday, Dec. 6, 2024. Luis Gomez Español You could understand if Feid were to get nervous or emotional at his first-ever headlining concert at his hometown stadium in Medellín on Friday (Dec. 6). Only a select few local artists have headlined Estadio Atanasio Girardot on their own.  And in the case of Ferxxo, who spent years waiting for his big break while Medellín peers J Balvin, Karol G and Maluma became Latin household names, it was a moment that seemed like it may never come. But there would be no tearful reflecting or nervous slip-ups in front of the crowd of around 70,000 on this night. Ferxxo (real name: Salomón Villada Hoyos) was his usual fun-loving self from the moment he emerged from the towering scaffold-like structure in the center of the stadium, just like producer Sky Rompiendo predicted backstage before the show. “I bet he’s not nervous,” Sky (real name: Alejandro Ramírez Suárez) told Billboard. “He’s like an athlete. It’s like LeBron on the Lakers. He’s focused no matter the stage. I’m more emotional [than he is]. We were 14 when we first started doing music together. I’ve seen his struggle and development through the years. This is a really big moment for him.” Luis Gomez Sky was one of several artists who came out to support Feid at the first of his three sold-out concerts at the stadium. Feid’s all-but-confirmed girlfriend Karol G was backstage before the show shaking hands and wearing a pink version of Feid’s trademark black vest while fellow reggaeton star Becky G played air hockey in the game room. None of the three artists appeared on stage (at least not that night), but the FERXXOCALIPSIS tour homecoming show wasn’t exactly lacking in star power. Here are some of the highlights from the spectacle that was night one. Famous Faces You knew Feid would bring out surprise guests. You just wouldn’t have guessed he would bring out so many. Miky Woodz and Juhn started the celebrity parade when they came out to perform “Enemigos” with Feid. Maisak was next, followed by Sech, who Feid endearingly called “gordo” (fat) before correcting himself due to the Panamaian’s recent weight loss: “Ex-gordo.”  Ryan Castro would add to the local flavor when he performed “Monastery” with Feid and earned the lone “Otra! Otra!” chant of the night.  Arguably the biggest onstage cameo belonged to Rauw Alejandro, who sang his new duet with Feid, “Revolú,” live for the first time. But it was Yandel who easily spent the most time on stage with Feid, performing songs from his joint album with Feid (including “Yandel 150”) and a medley of his classics. Lastly, ATL Jacob was given the honor of closing out the show, fireworks and all. He and Feid performed their song “Luna,” which the crowd had been begging for towards the end. Deep Cuts Feid somewhat stuck to the same setlist that he has followed during his FERXXOCALIPSIS tour, kicking off with “Alakran” and “50 Palos,” and wrapping up with “Luna.” But he did throw in some deep cuts for the hometown crowd, such as “Tengo Fe” and “Quiero.” “Here I can sing songs that I haven’t sung on the tour because we’re in Medellin,” Feid told the crowd. Afterward, he thanked the fans (many of whom were wearing his favorite color: green) for allowing him to take a walk down memory lane. Stage Complexity The first thing you notice about the stage setup is its massive height and complexity. The structure was a mixture of beams, platforms, stairs and more than a dozen screens of different sizes. You could only have a clear direct view of Feid when he was on your side of the stage, which led to a bit of “Where’s Waldo?” during the night depending on where you were sitting. But you usually didn’t have to wait long for Feid and his white Oakley glasses to reappear. Skipping Meme Feid became a meme on TikTok due to his never ending skipping around the stage at concerts (Yandel said he brought special running shoes to keep up), but rarely if ever has he covered so much ground. Ferxxo spent much of the three hour and 20 minute show circling the large scaffold, almost never staying on one side of the stage for too long. I don’t know if Feid ate the fried arepas con huevo that were served backstage in his game room after the show, but if he did, he definitely earned it.

Ferxxo spent much of the three hour and 20 minute show circling the large scaffold, almost never staying on one side of the stage for too long. I don’t know if Feid ate the fried arepas con huevo that were served backstage in his game room after the show, but if he did, he definitely earned it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.billboard.com/\" title=\"Billboard\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 455.133 94.711\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M70.107 28.859h21.318V93.69H70.107zM95.834 3.51h21.312v90.18H95.834zm25.723 0h21.312v90.18h-21.312zm250.711 32.035v-6.686h-21.315V93.69h21.315V62.792c0-7.949 4.154-12.237 11.728-12.237h2.522V28.229c-6.432.253-11.1 2.271-14.25 7.316zM80.764 0c-6.822 0-12.359 5.535-12.359 12.361 0 6.826 5.537 12.363 12.359 12.363 6.828 0 12.361-5.537 12.361-12.363S87.592 0 80.764 0zm244.457 33.795c-2.996-3.268-9.967-5.965-15.26-5.965-16.098 0-27.646 10.613-30.473 26.389-3.082-15.135-16.273-26.78-32.359-26.78-16.24 0-29.537 11.781-32.444 27.2-2.822-16.026-15.428-26.648-31.061-26.648-5.801 0-10.596 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521h-21.312V93.7h20.938v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.467 6.812 17.154 6.812 14.398 0 26.52-11.271 29.113-26.807 3.055 15.203 16.169 26.76 32.373 26.76 16.065 0 28.949-11.312 32.228-26.125 2.711 16.18 15.531 26.301 30.854 26.301 5.293 0 11.099-1.771 15.009-4.668V93.7h21.312V65.327c0-1.164-.008-2.298-.031-3.406.023-1.108.031-2.241.031-3.405V28.969h-21.312v4.826zM181.355 73.948c-6.826 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.533-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.824 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358.001 6.828-5.534 12.363-12.359 12.363zm65.774-.99c-6.822 0-12.361-5.539-12.361-12.363 0-6.823 5.539-12.358 12.361-12.358 6.824 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.823-5.532 12.363-12.359 12.363zm64.047.392c-6.826 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.363 0-6.823 5.527-12.358 12.354-12.358 6.832 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.824-5.527 12.363-12.359 12.363zM433.815 3.5v28.631c-4.156-2.9-8.949-4.16-14.757-4.16-17.782 0-31.654 13.746-31.654 33.55 0 18.664 13.368 33.043 29.642 33.043 6.68 0 12.103-2.146 17.152-6.811v5.928h20.938V3.5h-21.321zm-12.553 70.288c-6.817 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.358 0-6.828 5.535-12.365 12.354-12.365 6.828 0 12.363 5.537 12.363 12.365 0 6.819-5.535 12.358-12.363 12.358zM36.072 27.99c-5.803 0-10.594 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521H0V93.7h20.936v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.469 6.812 17.156 6.812 16.268 0 29.637-14.383 29.637-33.047 0-19.797-13.874-33.545-31.657-33.545zm-2.269 45.958c-6.824 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.535-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.826 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358 0 6.828-5.533 12.363-12.359 12.363z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cp\u003eGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.email.billboard.com/signup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\n\tSign Up\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
