  "text": "Tool have announced a December 19th concert in Honolulu, marking their first show in Hawaii in nearly 15 years. Get Tool Tickets Here The gig will take place at the Blaisdell Arena, the same venue Tool played back on January 14th, 2011, when they last performed in the “Aloha State.” In addition to the Hawaii date, Tool also recently announced shows in Yokohama (December 11th) and Kobe (December 13th), which will be their first concerts in Japan since 2013. A pre-sale for members of the band’s Tool Army fan club will begin Wednesday (July 23rd), while a general on-sale starts Friday (July 25th) via Ticketmaster. The three new shows are Tool’s only gigs of 2025 other than their recent performance at Black Sabbath’s “Back to the Beginning” concert, where they played two originals and a cover of Sabbath’s “Hand of Doom.”",
