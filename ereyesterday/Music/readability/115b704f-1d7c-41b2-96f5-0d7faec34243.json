Asher HaVon winner of the \"The Voice\" Season 25 Tyler Golden/NBC The Voice wrapped up its 26th season, welcoming first-time coaches Michael Bublé and Snoop Dogg to the panel, as Sofronio Vasquez was crowned the winner on Tuesday (Dec. 10).  The 31-year-old singer from the Philippines emerged as voters’ favorite on Bublé’s team following jaw-dropping performances of Sia’s “Unstoppable” and The Greatest Showman showstopper “A Million Dreams.” “Your mentorship is a blessing to me, my family and to all the dreamers out there,” Vasquez told Bublé before the final results were read. The “Haven’t Met You Yet” singer was also the only coach to have two contestants make it into the top five, with his other contestant, Shye, coming in as runner-up. Over the reality singing competition’s history, Shelton remains the statistically best coach in terms of winning seasons — having crowned a champ from his team in nine of the show’s 23 seasons. When The Voice premiered as NBC’s answer to American Idol, the inaugural cast of coaches consisted of Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, Shelton, and CeeLo Green. (Shelton was the only coach to have stayed on the rotating panel for 23 seasons, since the beginning of the hit show.) Apart from Shelton’s reign as king of The Voice, a plethora of star-studded musicians have appeared as coaches to try their hand at the crown, including Ariana Grande, Shakira, Pharrell, Gwen Stefani, Camila Cabello, Alicia Keys, Miley Cyrus, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Nick Jonas. Below is a complete list of which coach won at the end of each season. Season 1 The first season of The Voice featured a group of coaches that would remain the same until the third season. Hosted by Carson Daly, the first season, which was filled with performances from amateur contestants as well as the coaches, saw Adam Levine’s team crowned as neo-soul singer Javier Colon beat out Dia Frampton to win the competition. Coaches: Adam Lavine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green Winner: Javier Colon Winning Coach: Team Adam (1) Season 2 This season would be the beginning of the Shelton era as New York R\u0026B singer Jermaine Paul claimed The Voice championship. Paul proved his musical talent prior to appearing on the show: the soul singer was co-nominated with future Voice coach Alicia Keys at the 48th Grammys for best performance by a duo or group with vocals. Paul crowning moment would bring coach Blake Shelton to his first of a three consecutive wins in the next few seasons. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green. Winner: Jermaine Paul Winning Coach: Team Blake (1) Season 3 28-year-old Florida country singer Cassadee Pope became the first female winner of The Voice in season 3, coached by none other than the previous year’s champion. Advantage Team Blake. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green Winner: Cassadee Pope Winning Coach: Team Blake (2) Season 4 Season 4 saw the first change in the show’s coaching lineup, as Christina and CeeLo were replaced with R\u0026B crooner Usher and Latin pop star Shakira. The change in coaches did not seem to cause any disturbance for the Blake Shelton train, which churned on and landed its third consecutive Voice victory. Danielle Bradbery, a country singer from Houston, won the season 4 title, which at the time made the 16-year-old the youngest winner in Voice history. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Usher, Shakira Winner: Danielle Bradbery Winning Coach: Team Blake (3) Season 5 The fifth season saw the coaching roster return to its original cast. Along with the OG cast, Team Levine made its way back to the top for the first time since Season 1, as Jamaican soul artist Tessanne Chin took the crown over Team Christina’s Jacquie Lee, performing a beautiful rendition of soul great Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing.” Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green Winner: Tessanne Chin Winning Coach: Team Adam (2) Season 6 Usher and Shakira made their way back to the spinning red chairs in season 6. The Confessions singer did more than just return, however: he claimed his first victory for Team Usher, coaching Josh Kaufman, a performer from Florida to the crown. At 38, Kaufman became the oldest contestant to ever win The Voice. After being dropped by original coach Adam Levine, the soul singer was picked up by Usher. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Usher, Shakira Winner: Josh Kaufman Winning Coach: Team Usher (1) Season 7 The seventh season saw two new additions to the coaches table: N.E.R.D. frontman and super producer Pharrell and former No Doubt frontwoman turned pop star Gwen Stefani. However, it was business as usual for Shelton, who claimed his fourth win in six years thanks to Texas country singer Craig Wayne Boyd over floppy-haired singer-songwriter Matt McAndrew of Team Adam. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Winner: Craig Wayne Boyd Winning Coach: Team Blake (4) Season 8 Season eight saw Gwen Stefani replaced by Christina Aguilera, who returned for the first time since Season 5. Pharrell nabbed his first victory after having been on the show for only two seasons with folk singer Sawyer Fredericks, who tied Season 4 champ Danielle Bradbery as the youngest winner of The Voice at 16. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, Pharrell Winner: Sawyer Fredericks Winning Coach: Team Pharrell (1) Season 9 Gwen Stefani made her return in season nine, and Team Adam shortened the gap behind Team Blake. Gospel singer Jordan Smith carried Adam’s team to both the top of The Voice and the top of the iTunes charts: Smith became the first contestant in the show’s history to reach No. 1 in sales of pop songs in the iTunes Store. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Winner: Jordan Smith Winning Coach: Team Adam (3) Season 10 Third time was the charm for Christina Aguilera, as her third return to the coaching panel saw the “Fighter” singer win her first title as coach since the inaugural season. Former child star Alisan Porter performed an original song in the finale, as well as a duet version of “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” alongside coach Aguilera. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, Pharrell Winner: Alisan Porter Winning Coach: Team Christina (1) Season 11 Two new coaches entered the fray for the eleventh season: soul singer Alicia Keys and pop sensation Miley Cyrus. But it would be one of the original coaches who would take the crown, as Team Blake emerged victorious for the first time since season seven, ending a four-season drought with Texas country crooner Sundance Head‘s victory over former child prodigy Billy Gilman. The Season 11 champ had previously appeared on Season 6 of American Idol, but was eliminated just one week shy making the Top 12. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Alicia Keys, Miley Cyrus Winner: Sundance Head Winning Coach: Team Blake (5) Season 12 Gwen Stefani subbed in for Miley Cyrus but it was Alicia Keys who would win as coach in season 12. The “Raise A Man” singer took home the crown in her second season, helping soul musician Chris Blue reach the pinnacle over Team Blake’s Lauren Duski. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani Winner: Chris Blue Winning Coach: Team Alicia (1) Season 13 Season 13 featured a roundtable formed by veteran coaches Levine and Shelton, Miley Cyrus, and first-time coach Jennifer Hudson. After facing elimination in the earlier rounds, winner Chloe Kohanski was dropped by coach Miley Cyrus, but was quickly picked up, receiving offers from Shelton and Hudson. Kohanski eventually sided with Shelton and together the two were crowned The Voice champions. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson Winner: Chloe Kohanski Winning Coach: Team Blake (6) Season 14 Alicia Keys returned for the show’s fourteenth season along with a brand new coach: America’s original Idol Kelly Clarkson. In her inaugural season, the pop star and former reality champ rode all the way to victory by coaching 15-year-old Brynn Cartelli, who would go on to serve as an opener for Clarkson’s Meaning Of Life tour. Season 14 was also the first season in the show’s history not to feature a member of Team Blake or Team Adam in the final two. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson Winner: Brynn Cartelli Winning Coach: Team Kelly (1) Season 15 Fresh off her first victory, Kelly returned for another season by welcoming back fellow Idol veteran Jennifer Hudson to the spinning chairs. The “Since U Been Gone” hitmaker’s hot streak continued with her second consecutive win thanks to 16-year-old country singer Chevel Shepherd. Clarkson’s back-to-back victories marked the first time any coach had taken the crown in consecutive seasons since Team Blake’s three-peat back in Seasons 2 through 4. Also for the first time in the show’s history, Season 15 saw the addition of a fifth coach, as Kelsea Ballerini mentored contestants who had failed to turn any chairs in the blind audition as part of the brand-new Comeback Stage. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Clarkson, Kelsea Ballerini Winner: Chevel Shepherd Winning Coach: Team Kelly (2) Season 16 John Legend took over one of the show’s famed spinning chairs for Season 16, joining as a first-time coach after serving as a Battle advisor for Team Adam back in Season 12. The EGOT winner’s inaugural season led to sweet success as he coached 26-year-old Maelyn Jarmon to victory against three members of Team Blake in the finale. Season 16 also saw Bebe Rexha replace Kelsea Ballerini as coach of the show’s Comeback Stage. Following Legend’s first win, OG coach Adam Levine unexpectedly announced he would be exiting the series after 16 consecutive seasons — leaving Blake Shelton as the last remaining coach from the show’s original line-up. Coaches: Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, John Legend Winner: Maelyn Jarmon Winning Coach: Team John (1) Season 17 Season 17 marked the first installment of the competition series without OG coach Adam Levine. Gwen Stefani returned to take his place, and the season was full of cute banter between the pop star and her now-boyfriend Shelton. Tennessee native Jake Hoot became only the second winner (after Chris Blue in season 12) to have been just a one-chair turn in the blind auditions, giving Clarkson her impressive third win. Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Jake Hoot Winning Coach: Team Kelly (3) Season 18 Season 18 found the judge’s panel shaken up again, with Stefani out and Nick Jonas in alongside Clarkson, Legend and Shelton. With the first five-artist finale, like almost everything else on TV, the winter/spring 2020 season of The Voice was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, resulting in the live shows turning into remote shoots for everyone’s safety. Mississippi native Todd Tilghman, 42, went from being the first audition aired to the winner’s circle on Shelton’s team, marking Blake’s seventh win as a coach with the oldest winner in the show’s history. Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Nick Jonas, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Todd Tilghman Winning Coach: Team Blake (7) Season 19 For Season 19, The Voice returned for a fully socially-distanced season in the midst of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Tagging out Jonas, Stefani returned for her fifth season as a coach, and marked her team’s first-ever win thanks to Long Island native Carter Rubin, who became the youngest male winner in the show’s history at just 15 years old. (He tied with past winner Brynn Cartelli as the show’s youngest champion ever.) Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Carter Rubin Winning Coach: Team Gwen (1) Season 20 Jonas returned once more for Season 20, replacing Stefani. 19-year-old Cam Anthony was crowned winner — in person this time, thanks to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The Los Angeles-based, Philadelphia native was initially blocked by joining Legend’s team during the blind auditions by Jonas, leading him to ultimately choose Shelton as his coach. Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Nick Jonas, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Cam Anthony Winning Coach: Team Blake (8) Season 21 Pop superstar Ariana Grande joined the coaches panel for season 21 of The Voice, joining Shelton, Clarkson and Legend. Girl Named Tom, consisting of siblings Bekah, Caleb and Joshua Liechty, was crowned the winner of this season, marking Clarkson’s fourth win as a coach and the first time a group has won the show. Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Girl Named Tom Winning Coach: Team Kelly (4) Season 22 Camila Cabello brought the “Havana” heat to the judges panel this season, and almost took home the crown, as her contestant Morgan Myles made it to the finals. However, country singer Bryce Leatherwood took home the winning trophy, extending Shelton’s winning record. Coaches: Camila Cabello, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton Winner: Bryce Leatherwood Winning Coach: Team Blake (9) Season 23 While season 23 marked Blake Shelton’s final season as coach, newcomer and the country crooner’s honorary “son” Niall Horan took home his first-ever win thanks to 19-year-old contestant Gina Miles. Coaches: Kelly Clarkson, Niall Horan, Chance the Rapper, Blake Shelton Winner: Gina Miles Winning Coach: Niall Horan (1) Season 24 Niall Horan took home his second win as a coach when rocker Huntley was crowned the winner over second-place finisher Ruby Leigh, who was on Team Reba and Mara Justine (also Team Niall) in third. Coaches: John Legend, Reba McEntire, Gwen Stefani and Niall Horan Winner: Huntley Winning Coach: Niall Horan (2) Season 25 Following performances of Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” on Monday night, then, on Tuesday’s final, a rendition of Donna Summer’s “Last Dance” and a duet with his coach Reba McEntire on Patti LaBelle’s “One My Own,” Asher HaVon (Team Reba) was the last competitor standing. He trumped a top 5 ahead of Karen Waldrup (Team Dan + Shay in 5th place), Nathan Chester (Team Legend in 4th), Bryan Olesen (Team Legend in 3rd) and Josh Sanders (Team Reba in second). Coaches: John Legend, Dan + Shay, Chance the Rapper, Reba McEntire Winner: Asher HaVon Winning Coach: Team Reba Season 26 Sofronio Vasquez, the 31-year-old singer from the Philippines emerged as voters’ favorite on Bublé’s team following jaw-dropping performances of Sia’s “Unstoppable” and The Greatest Showman showstopper “A Million Dreams.” Coaches: Reba McEntire, Gwen Stefani, Michael Bublé and Snoop Dogg  Winner: Sofronio Vasquez Winning Coach: Team Michael (1) Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
