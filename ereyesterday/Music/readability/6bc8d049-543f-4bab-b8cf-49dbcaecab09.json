  "text": "The Oscars are getting a best stunt design category. The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced the creation of an annual competitive Academy Award for Achievement in Stunt Design, which will launch at the 100th Academy Awards for films released in 2027. As Variety reports, director and producer David Leitch (John Wick, Deadpool 2, The Fall Guy) led the push for an official Oscar category to recognize the work of the stunt community. Leitch began his career as a stunt performer and coordinator before moving behind the camera lens. “Since the early days of cinema, stunt design has been an integral part of filmmaking,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang in a joint statement. “We are proud to honor the innovative work of these technical and creative artists, and we congratulate them for their commitment and dedication in reaching this momentous occasion.” Rules for eligibility and voting for the inaugural award will be announced in 2027. The last new award category was Achievement in Casting, which was established in 2024 and will launch with the 98th Academy Awards for films released in 2025.",
