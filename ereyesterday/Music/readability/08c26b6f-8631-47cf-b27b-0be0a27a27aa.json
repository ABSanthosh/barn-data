  "text": "Wet Leg have announced their sophomore album; Moisturizer is out July 11 via Domino. Today (April 1), the UK five-piece have revealed the cover art and tracklist for the new LP, as well as the music video for lead single “Catch These Fists.” Check it out below.Wet Leg comprises founding members Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers as well as bassist Ellis Durand, drummer Henry Holmes, and guitarist/synth player Joshua Mobaraki. The band directed the video for “Catch These Fists,” which was shot in their native Isle of Wight. They drew inspiration from filmmakers like Ti West and Cameron Crowe while conceiving the visual, which also nods to their previous clip for “Wet Dream.”Moisturizer follows Wet Leg’s 2022 self-titled debut, which took home a handful of Grammys in 2023. Both albums were produced by Dan Carey. The band wrote the new LP while living together in the remote seaside town of Southwold in Norfolk, England, where they would work by day, and watch horror movies by night. “We were just kind of having fun and exploring,” Chambers said in press materials. Teasdale added: “We focussed on: Is this going to be fun to play live? It was very natural that we would write the second record together.”Read our new track review of “Catch These Fists.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
