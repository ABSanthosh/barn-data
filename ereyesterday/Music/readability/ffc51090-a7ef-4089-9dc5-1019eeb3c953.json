  "text": "Kenia Os, Elena Rose and Mon Laferte share their beauty icon inspirations, what they listen to when they get ready and more at Latin Music Week 2024. Mon Laferte  I can take off my shoes. Elena Rose  Thank you God for giving me another day where I can do what I love.  Kenia Os  Sometimes also my songs, but I don’t like to listen to myself so much because I get annoyed of myself.  Question: What do you like to listen to during glam?  Mon Laferte  Lily Allen, Amy Winehouse, Lana Del Rey, Mitski and, well it was kind of random. But it depends on the day, like the mood I’m in.  Elena Rose  My glam session? Today I was listening to a song called “Veneka” which is by Rawayana and Akapellah. It is my favorite of the moment.  Kali Chis  I start with something more chill and I really like Kali Uchis and, then I play something more upbeat like Anitta or Bad Gyal. Always.  Question: Who is your beauty icon in music and why?  Elena Rose  My best friends are my artists. Favorites: Danny, Rawayana, Mau y Ricky.  Mon Laferte  The first image I have in my grandmother, because my grandmother was a singer. And she was a composer, and she was an artist with a red dress with flowers in her hair, red lips and blue eyelids. So for me, I think she is the one that inspired me the most aesthetically. When I started it was her, she was the first.  Kenia Os I think I have a lot but I love Ariana Grande’s and Rihanna’s trajectory. I love what they are doing. I think Rosalía is also a great artist and I use them as a references.  Watch the full video above!",
