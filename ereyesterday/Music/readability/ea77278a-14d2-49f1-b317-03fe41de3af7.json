  "text": "Nonpoint cut their January 12 show at the Mercury Ballroom in Louisville, KY short after drummer Robb Rivera's heart rate suddenly elevated to a dangerous level. Rivera was rushed to a local hospital and Nonpoint was not able to play their final song. Rivera has now checked in with fans letting everyone know he's doing better, and denying any substance abuse playing a part (as apparently he was accused of). \"What's up? Robb here, sitting here on the riser here at Hangar 1819 in Greensboro, North Carolina,\" wrote Rivera. \"We're about to load in because we're playing tonight. I want to thank everybody at the George Hospital in Louisville that took care of me, and they just looked out after me. It was a very stressful 24 hours — overwhelming and emotional, 24 hours — and scary, and I never want to go through that again. \"I had an elevated heart rate, they were able to bring it down within five seconds, which is crazy. Did a bunch of tests, everything was clear. And I'm here to rock out and continue the Painful Statements Tour, but I do have something that I need to get off my chest: To the people that said that this was due to drugs. Shame on you. If anybody knows me out there, [they know] that I do not use drugs at all or drink alcohol. \"Back in the day, I used to drink little sips. I never been alcoholic, never been a drug addict. To those people that said that, I could easily go off on you, I'm not stopping down to your level. So anyway, to the people that have reached out to me. I love you tonight, Painful Statements. Greensboro, North Carolina, Florida, coming home to you, see ya.\" Nonpoint is currently on the road celebrating both their 2000 album Statement and 2005 album To The Pain.
