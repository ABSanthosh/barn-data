To coincide with Commonwealth Day in the UK on March 10th, Charles will launch the first episode of The King‚Äôs Music Room on Apple Music. Recorded in Buckingham Palace, the episode promises ‚Äúexclusive insight into His Majesty King Charles III‚Äôs relationship with music from around the Commonwealth ‚Äî including artists stretching from 1930s crooners to Afrobeats stars, as well as disco divas and reggae icons.‚Äù The playlist apparently spans legends like Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue, and Grace Jones, alongside contemporary talents such as Davido and RAYE. The episode ‚ÄúThroughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me,‚Äù Charles said in a statement. ‚ÄúI know that is also the case for so many others. It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places. But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration.
