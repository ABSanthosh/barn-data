  "text": "Alan Sparhawk has announced his second solo album since the end of Low. Alan Sparhawk With Trampled by Turtles is, as the name suggests, a full-length collaboration with fellow Duluth musicians Trampled by Turtles—a reunion that follows Sparhawk’s production of their 2014 album, Wild Animals, and their many concerts together. The first single from the record is “Stranger”; watch the video for that below, ahead of the album’s May 30 release via Sub Pop.Sparhawk explained in a press release that the collaboration—a follow-up to Sparhawk’s White Roses, My God—was long on the cards. “When the opportunity seems right, you jump,” he said, adding, “When playing together is that powerful an embrace, why stop there?”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
