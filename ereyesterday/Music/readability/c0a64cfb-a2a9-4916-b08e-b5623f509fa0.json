  "text": "The new Medellín anthem — produced by Ovy on the Drums and co-penned by Keityn and DFZM — includes Blessd and Ryan Castro. From left: Maluma, DFZM, J Balvin, Blessd, Ovy on the Drums, Feid, Karol G and Ryan Castro. Felipe Orvi Colombia has a new reggaeton anthem at the helm of genre giants Karol G, J Balvin, Maluma, Feid, Blessd, and Ryan Castro titled “+57” out Thursday (Nov. 7). Named after the area code in Colombia, the sensual, mid-tempo futuristic perreo finds the Colombian powerhouses singing about a girl from Medellín who’s all-that, fierce, unstoppable, and the center of attention—even though she’s in a relationship. “They ask her if she has a boyfriend, it depends,” says part of the lyrics. Helmed by Latin Grammy-winning hitmaker and Karol’s longtime producer, Ovy on the Drums, “+57” was co-written by all of the artists alongside Keityn and newcomer DFZM, who’s signed to Keityn’s management hub, La Creme. It was recorded in one session in Los Angeles after Ovy presented the song to Karol and she ultimately gathered her colleagues for the statement-making collab—none of them aware of the song until they met at the recording studio. Trending on Billboard “It’s a dream that I assure you that neither I, nor my team, nor my family could have imagined. We always saw ourselves as super big but we never imagined it would happen so quickly,” singer-songwriter DFZM, who originally penned the track with Keityn before presenting it to Ovy, tells Billboard exclusively. “For me it’s very important to be representing the Valle del Cauca, Buenaventura, those young people with dreams and talent. Representing black people, the culture, it’s very nice for me to be able to be part of history.” Ovy was the first to tease the track, posting a short video on Instagram where fans can hear Balvin shouting out all the collaborators. Meanwhile, Ovy and Karol are dancing along to the reggaetón beat. A couple of days later, a group photo in the recording studio was shared by each of the artists on social media, hinting that something major was dropping on November 7. The title was also revealed in the description. Listen to “+57” below: Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
