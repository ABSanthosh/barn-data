  "text": "Unreleased music and other sensitive materials connected to Beyoncé were stolen from a rental vehicle belonging to her choreographer and one of her dancers after it was broken into in an Atlanta parking lot. According to WSB-TV, the break-in occurred on July 8th around 8:00 p.m. local time inside a parking deck at Krog Street Market. The thieves also apparently made out with footage plans for Beyoncé’s “COWBOY CARTER TOUR” as well as past and future setlists. On Monday, July 14th, Atlanta police issued an arrest warrant for a suspect after following up on multiple leads, including pinging a pair of Apple AirPods that were stolen and reviewing surveillance footage that captured the break-in.",
