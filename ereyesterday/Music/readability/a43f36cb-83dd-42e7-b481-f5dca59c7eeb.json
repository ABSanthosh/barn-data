  "text": "Fire From The Gods have revealed that Myke Terry of Volumes will now be stepping in as the band's vocalist. This comes after the departure of AJ Channer who was in Fire From The Gods for over a decade. No explanation has been offered by the band or Channer as for the reason for his departure, but industry rumours have run wild with the possibility that Channer was fired from his role as frontman. Myke Terry's addition to the lineup was announced during a gig with the band Traitors in Fire From The Gods' hometown, Austin, Texas, this past Saturday. The Scandalous Podcast also broke the news online, posting a photo with the podcast host Ashley Steinmetz and Myke Terry, with the caption: \"You heard it here first, this is history ????@myketerryble of @volumesla is the new vocalist of @firefromthegods ???? first performance with the band tonight at @comeandtakeitlive • Terry’s first interview as FFTG’s new frontman to follow ????\" You can check out the announcement below.
