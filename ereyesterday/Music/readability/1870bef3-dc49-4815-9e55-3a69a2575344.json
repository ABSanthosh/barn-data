  "text": "Just three artists have won the new artist prize at both shows. Megan Moroney is just 27, but she already knows all about the ups and downs of awards shows. On Nov. 8, she learned that she had been passed over for a Grammy nomination for best new artist. Just 12 days later, she won the CMA Award for new artist of the year. Moroney’s situation isn’t unique. Since 1981, when the Country Music Association introduced its horizon award (renamed new artist of the year in 2008), most of their winners haven’t received Grammy nods for best new artist. Even such giants as Randy Travis, Garth Brooks, Keith Urban, Rascal Flatts and Morgan Wallen were passed over for Grammy best new artist nods. The situation has improved markedly in recent years, as the graphic below shows. But the Recording Academy still has work to do to make sure that country artists are getting a fair shake in the marquee categories. Here is every CMA winner for the horizon award and new artist of the year, divided into four categories – those who also won the Grammy for best new artist; those who were nominated for the Grammy for best new artist but didn’t win (and who won in that category!); those who were not eligible for a new artist Grammy nomination that year (because of prior Grammy nods or wins); and those who were eligible for the Grammy, but were simply not nominated. The year shown is the year of the CMA ceremony where the artist won. We cap this discussion by showing the four CMA winners for the horizon award/new artist of the year who have yet to win a Grammy in any category. (Moroney has lots of time to move off this last list.) One lesson from this list is that we need a variety of awards shows – all-genre shows like the Grammys and genre-specific shows like the CMA Awards and their country brethren. What one show misses, hopefully, the other catches.
