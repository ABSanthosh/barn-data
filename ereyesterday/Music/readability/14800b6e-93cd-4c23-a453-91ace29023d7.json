  "text": "For years, Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan has embraced a range of flamboyant looks during his live performances, from painted blue bodies and prosthetic enhancements to riot gear and punk-inspired mohawks. His close friend and Primus bassist/vocalist Les Claypool has similarly made a name for himself with elaborate masks and theatrical costumes, such as the pig mask in the \"Mr. Krinkle\" video and the many other headpieces he's donned over time. While it might seem like these outfits are simply part of the show, the reality behind them is more personal. During a recent joint interview on Kyle Meredith…, Keenan and Claypool opened up about how costumes and masks were initially born out of a need to ease their own insecurities about performing in front of a crowd. Claypool reflected on his early career, saying (via ThePRP), \"For me, my whole singing career started as — and for many years — it was me doing nothing but playing characters. Because I was so not confident in my vocals, that I would just take on all these characters; pretend I was Mel Blanc, for lack of better explanation.\" He explained that only in the early 2000s did he begin to feel comfortable with his own voice, particularly after working with Sean Lennon. However, he still finds stepping into a character gives him an edge during performances. \"I still enjoy stepping into characters. It just makes it easier for me. And I think it's a better performance. And I've always been attracted to, like, a lot of country music, and a lot of folk music, that tells some sort of tale. You know, whether it's ‘John Henry' or ‘Amos Moses'. Those songs made me listen a little harder. And so I wrote these songs with these characters, and subsequently became the characters because I didn't know…\" Claypool also added that seeing audiences engage with costumes (like the recent trend of fans dressed as bananas) inspires him to bring more energy to the stage: \"The masks have just become such a staple over the years. It's just, it's like anything else, that's the wonderful thing about being able to go do any shows. Whether it's Sessanta or Primus shows, or Frog Brigade shows, is, to me, it's like, I get to have Halloween multiple days a year. Whether it's me putting on something or seeing people in the audience. You know, lately, we've had all these bananas in the audience. I love it. You know? We've got all these bananas running around the audience. And I just think it's the greatest. It makes me happy and inspires me to do… to step it up a notch on stage.\" Keenan, too, shared how his experimentation with wigs, makeup, and costumes — especially prominent in his Puscifer project — allowed him to navigate his own self-doubt. \"It's a different voice, but it's also — you know, as Les had said — it stems initially from an insecurity of just being able to express yourself and having some kind of a something to hide behind a little bit while you're trying to figure out who the f*ck you are on that stage. So, you know, then it just kind of becomes a thing you do, because you end up finding that… We're trying to work some shit out as musicians or artists, but we're also up there to entertain. So I think it helps to put the costume on to remind myself I'm there to entertain and not just work through some weird daddy issues.\" However, when it comes to performing with Tool, Keenan's stage presence contrasts his flamboyant appearance. Rather than taking center stage, he often stays at the back, perched on a riser. He clarified the choice by pointing to technical reasons: \"With Puscifer, I'm always down in front. And a lot of that is just that is just logistics for sound, like, having all those amps and Danny‘s octopus drums and, you know, Justin‘s massive bass. To be down in front of the mix for the front of the house is almost impossible. So being up near the drums, and behind the guitar amps, actually ends up helping, just from a technical standpoint, to separate sound. And you know, it's such a big show, like, I'm only… We're only talking about another an extra six or eight feet so I'm not sure what the big deal is.\" Both Keenan and Claypool will hit the road again next year for another leg of the Sessanta tour, featuring A Perfect Circle, Primus, and Puscifer performing together. Though there's no word yet on whether they'll record another collaborative EP, fans are undoubtedly eager to see what new characters and looks they'll unveil next.
