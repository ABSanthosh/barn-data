  "text": "Drake has released a new song called “What Did I Miss?” On the track—co-produced by DJ Lewis, Elyas, FNZ, Gyz, London Cyr, O Lil Angel, Oz, Patron, and Tay Keith—the Toronto musician reflects on his beef with Kendrick Lamar and the people who did and did not stand by him in the feud. Listen to the song below.Drake opens “What Did I Miss?” by reflecting on the beef and the way it affected those around him: “Askin’ me, ‘How did it feel?’ Can’t say it didn’t surprise me/Last time I looked to my right, you n****s was standing beside me/How can some people I love hang around pussies who try me?” Later, in his first verse, Drake raps, “It’s love for my brothers and death to a traitor, let’s go.”In his second verse, Drake references Kendrick Lamar’s massive Drake-taunting Pop Out concert, in Inglewood, California, that featured performances and appearances from former Drake collaborators, such as YG, Mustard, and Ty Dolla $ign. “I saw bro went to Pop Out with them, but been dick-riding gang since ‘Headlines,’” he raps.The beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was reignited when Lamar took some subtle shots at Drake on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.” Importantly, Future and Metro Boomin were both, at one point in time, prominent Drake collaborators, and their turn against the Canadian artist led to other former friends taking sides in the feud. The Weeknd, for example, appeared on Future and Metro Boomin’s We Still Don’t Trust You—a potential sign of where his loyalties lied—and Rick Ross shared his own diss track against Drake, “Champagne Moments.”“What Did I Miss?” is a rare solo single from Drake, since he shared his suite of anti-Lamar tracks in 2024. The new song is released via Drake’s OVO Sound. Like all of Drake’s recent solo music, it is licensed to Republic Records, a label owned by Universal Music Group (UMG). Drake is federally suing UMG for defamation, claiming that the corporation “waged an unrelenting campaign” to promote “Not Like Us,” Kendrick Lamar’s mega-hit that Drake believes is filled with falsities.",
