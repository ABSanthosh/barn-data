  "text": "Sometimes jokes become reality, and sometimes that gets real weird. Case in point – there was a joke about Pig Destroyer buttplugs and now Pig Destroyer is making buttplugs. Or at least they are specifically for this Bandcamp Friday. So if you want some grindcore up your backdoor, get 'em here. \"When bad jokes become good ideas. You assed and we listened,\" wrote the band. \"Pig Destroyer butt plugs are available now for Bandcamp Friday, limited supplies! Available in the Ass \u0026 Volume Bundle or separate for your pleasures.\" Pig Destroyer will briefly hit the road this June for a few shows with Cephalic Carnage, Author \u0026 Punisher, and Sex Prisoner. The shows begin on June 5 in Denver, CO and ends June 8 in Phoenix, AZ. I'm also hoping this means Cephalic Carnage is reactivating and working on their first new record in 15 years. That band fucking rips. Anyway, get your tickets here. \"We're ready to make you some table side hate-a-mole with Cephalic Carnage and it's been a long time coming,\" said Pig Destroyer of the trek. Alongside us will be the mastermind that is Author \u0026 Punisher, as well as the most violent band on the planet, Sex Prisoner to stir up the madness. See ya in a tumbleweed soon!\" 6/5 Denver, CO Gothic Theatre6/6 Albuquerque. NM El Rey6/7 Tucson, AZ 191 Toole6/8 Phoenix, AZ The Nile Want More Metal?
