  "text": "\"I see what he did there,\" she wrote on Thursday. Inductee Mary J. Blige poses in the press room during the 2024 Rock \u0026 Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony streaming on Disney+ at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on October 19, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Seems like Mary J. Blige has given Travis Scott‘s new snippet from Jackboys 2 — which mentions her — her stamp of approval. In the two-and-a-half-minute, Harmony Korine-directed trailer that Scott posted on his socials Wednesday night, he raps, “I blige bumping Mary.” “I see what he did there,” the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul wrote on X with laughing and smiling emojis. Scott has been steadily teasing the Jackboys 2 compilation project over the last month, hinting that he could drop it on his 34th birthday on Wednesday (which didn’t happen). The Cactus Jack boss linked up with his signee Sheck Wes on “ILMB” last month, but it hasn’t been confirmed if the single will appear on the upcoming album. He also previewed a pair of unreleased songs during his headlining Coachella set (Goldenvoice was fined $20,000 by the City of Indio because he went three minutes past the 1 a.m. curfew). Scott updated his online store with a digital Jackboys 2 pre-order, CDs with alternative covers, vinyl and various box sets. The first Jackboys compilation album was released in December 2019, featuring the label’s stars Wes and Don Toliver as well as collaborations with Rosalía and Lil Baby on the remix of his Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Highest in the Room,” Quavo and Offset on “Had Enough,” Young Thug on “Out West,” and the late Pop Smoke on “Gatti.” Jackboys debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 at the top of 2020 and also topped Top R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Albums.
