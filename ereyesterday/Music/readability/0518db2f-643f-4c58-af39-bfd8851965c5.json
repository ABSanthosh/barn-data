  "text": "Note: This article contains references to alleged sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter and Sean “Diddy” Combs are no longer facing a lawsuit from a woman who claimed that the rappers drugged and raped her, in 2000, when she was 13 years old. The woman, a Jane Doe plaintiff, voluntarily dismissed her complaint with prejudice, meaning she cannot refile the case. Doe was represented by Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer who is representing many people who accuse Diddy of abuse.In a statement, Jay-Z called the dismissal “a victory” and said that the case “was without merit and never going anywhere.” He added that the judicial system “must protect victims.”Diddy’s legal team also celebrated the dismissal and cast doubt on the countless other lawsuits against the musician. “We will continue to fight these baseless claims and hold those responsible,” the legal team stated.In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, Tony Buzbee offered no comment.Jane Doe filed her original complaint against Diddy in October. She initially claimed that Diddy and another “male celebrity” assaulted her at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty. It was not until December that she refiled the case to name Jay-Z as the alleged co-assailant.The day the lawsuit was refiled, Jay-Z’s management company, Roc Nation, posted a lengthy statement on X casting doubt on the claims and alleging that Buzbee sent his lawyer a blackmail attempt. “These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?” the statement read. “My heart and support goes out to the true victims in the world, who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit.”In the weeks that followed, Jay-Z and his lawyers continued to speak out against the lawsuit. Alex Spiro, one of Jay-Z’s attorneys, also argued that the accuser’s name should be made public in case it could prompt people with valuable information to come forward. On December 16, Spiro held a press conference to poke holes in Jane Doe’s filing and to say he believed Jay-Z would be cleared of any wrongdoing. “When something isn’t real, when something doesn’t happen, you’re going to get the details wrong because you weren’t really there,” said Spiro. “[It’s] not possible. It’s because this never happened.”Diddy remains incarcerated on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty, and he is due to stand trial on May 5, 2025. Diddy is also facing numerous lawsuits for alleged abuse. He has broadly denied allegations of wrongdoing.If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual assault, we encourage you to reach out for support:RAINN National Sexual Assault Hotlinehttps://rainn.org1 800 656 HOPE (4673)Crisis Text LineSMS: Text “HELLO” or “HOLA” to 741-741",
