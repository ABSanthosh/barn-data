  "text": "Dolven – the project featuring Nick Wusz (Travellers Rest), Jason Walton (Agalloch, MoonBladder, Sculptured), Hunter Ginn (Agalloch, Canvas Solaris, Radical Research), and Jori Apedaile (Eneferens, Hyalithe) – is set to release their third record In My Grave… Silence on June 13 via Fiadh Productions and Winding Stair Records. I'm more than thrilled to present the band's newest single \"Sun Bleached Stones\" in all its acoustic doom glory. Now if the weather could just get about 20 or 30 degrees cooler, that'd really fit this song. \"This song is about the sorrow I feel every year visiting my father's grave,\" said Wusz. \"As the years go by, the tombs and stones surrounding my father's plot are being absorbed by moss, bleached by the sun, and yet it is exactly the same as it is every time I visit. \"I am struck by how, in the very near future, I will be in the ground too. The cycle repeats itself. Musically, this is an emotional, powerful song, evoking grandeur and the oppressive nature of passing time. Jori's vocal style deeply and softly brings out the emotions I feel in these visitations of the dead. Another year gone by. Another emotional Dolven record.\" In My Grave… Silence was engineered by Walton, mixed and mastered at Unisound by the legendary Dan Swanö (Edge Of Sanity, Katatonia, Opeth, Bloodbath), and is completed with medieval cover artwork and logo by Alexandr with additional illustrations by Thaumaturge Artworks.
