  "text": "Liam Gallagher has mocked Saturday Night Live for a sketch parodying he and brother Noel Gallagher. During Weekend Update on the latest episode of SNL, Sarah Sherman and James Austin Johnson portrayed the Oasis co-founders as they discussed their upcoming reunion and whether they’ll be able to avoid breaking up before the tour officially kicks off next summer. Get Oasis Reunion Tickets Here “I’m cool if he’s cool,” Johnson’s Noel said. Sherman’s Liam replied, “I’m cool, I’m cool, I’m cooler than you are.” Johnson’s Noel then sang into an amended version of ‘Wonderwall’, with lyrics including: “I said maybe, if Liam doesn’t act like a baby.” Liam Gallagher responded to the sketch on Sunday morning when a fan sent him a link to the video on social media. In response, he wrote, “Are they meant to be comedians.” Aside from the fact that the sketch wasn’t particularly funny (can anyone be funnier than the actual Gallaghers?), Liam seems overly sensitive about his relationship with Noel following their years-long public fallout. In the wake of their reunion, he recently said the brothers wouldn’t be doing any joint interviews because “we scared of the media asking us intrusive questions and trying to pick holes in our relationship.” Last night’s SNL did feature some worthwhile highlights, including a pair of musical performances from Stevie Nicks, and episode host Ariana Grande impersonating Céline Dion.
