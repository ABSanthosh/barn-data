  "text": "Clairo has shared the dreamy new music video for her song “Terrapin,” which features “Weird Al” Yankovic in one of his greatest roles yet: Clairo herself. The visual was directed by The Bear breakout, actress-comedian Ayo Edebiri. Watch it below. In Edebiri’s music video directorial debut, Weird Al delivers the heartfelt lyrics with tender care, shimmying through a series of nostalgic vignettes. The glittering set welcomes backup dancers to support the cause, and, later, offers a glimpse of Clairo. While the video is new, “Terrapin” appeared on Clairo’s 2024 album, Charm, which was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the recent 2025 Grammys. Get Clairo Tickets Here As Clairo preps for a European tour (grab tickets here), Ayo Edebiri is gearing up to release Opus, a star vehicle for the actress set on a mysterious compound for a reclusive musician. Meanwhile, Weird Al has “The Bigger \u0026 Weirder 2025 Tour” waiting on the horizon, set to kick off in June following a string of shows in Las Vegas.",
