  "text": "It's shaping up to be a weird year for Foo Fighters. The band just announced their first show since taking a break after frontman Dave Grohl fathered a child outside his marriage for this October in Singapore… and apparently they've got another new drummer. According to drummer Josh Freese, he was fired by Foo Fighters on Monday with no reason given. Which is wild considering Freese joined Foo Fighters in 2023 after the death of Taylor Hawkins, and the band made a pretty big deal of it. So who knows what the hell is going on there – Foo Fighters hasn't commented on the situation yet. \"The Foo Fighters called me Monday night to let me know they've decided 'to go in a different direction with their drummer.' No reason was given. :( Regardless, I enjoyed the past two years with them, both on and off stage, and I support whatever they feel is best for the band,\" wrote Freese. \"In my 40 years of drumming professionally, I've never been let go from a band, so while I'm not angry—just a bit shocked and disappointed. But as most of you know I've always worked freelance and bounced between bands so, I'm fine. Stay tuned for my 'Top 10 possible reasons Josh got booted from the Foo Fighters' list.\" Want More Metal?
