  "text": "A dump truck driver plowed into the legendary Los Angeles music venue Whisky a Go Go music on Friday afternoon, just hours before the band Boy Hits Car was set to take the stage. According to Fox 11 LA, the truck barreled into power poles and multiple vehicles in the parking lot before smashing into the building itself. No injuries were reported. In an Instagram post, Boy Hits Car said the crash left Whisky a Go Go without power, and it was unclear whether their show would be able to proceed as planned.",
