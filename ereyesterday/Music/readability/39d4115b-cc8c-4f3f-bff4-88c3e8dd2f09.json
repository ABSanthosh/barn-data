  "text": "The mostly one-sided feud between Eminem and Mariah Carey, which centered on their alleged romantic relationship in the 2000s, has a bizarre new chapter. A former producer for Carey has claimed Eminem once pitched her on the role of his mother in 8 Mile — despite her only being four years his senior. Damion “Damizza” Young, who collaborated with Carey on “I Still Believe” and “Crybaby,” told the story during a recent episode of the TFU Podcast. According to Young, he had been advising Carey against doing the movie Glitter when he received a call from Eminem’s team about setting up a meeting between the two artists. Get Mariah Carey Tickets Here “They said, ‘He’s got this movie called 8 Mile and he wants her to be in the movie,” Young recalled. Though he was hesitant to get “in the middle,” he passed along the opportunity to Carey, who was initially uninterested. According to Young, she only changed her mind and asked for Eminem’s number once he explained it was for a movie role. Young then claimed he called Eminem first and begged the rapper not to mistreat Carey like Christina Aguilera. “I’m managing this girl, and it’s gonna cause me a problem,” he recalled telling Eminem, who purportedly replied, “No, I genuinely want her in the movie.” Once they all connected on a three-way call, however, Eminem immediately blurted out, “I want you to play my mother.” Understandably, Carey did not take this offer well. “She did not like that shit at all,” Young said. “Her insecurities kicked in big time.” Kim Basinger ultimately landed the role of Eminem’s mother in 8 Mile, the semi-autobiographical film in which Eminem mirrored his rise in the underground battle rap scene while playing the character B-Rabbit. Elsewhere in the interview, Young made the further claim that it was Carey who pursued Eminem after that initial phone call. “It was her chasing him, not him chasing her,” he alleged. “Next thing I know, we are at Eminem’s house… and they disappear.” Young said he then washed his hands of the situation to avoid issues with Eminem and Dr. Dre. This included avoiding calls to “come fix this” after Em allegedly “had done this and that and all of this.” Carey has long denied rumors that she and Eminem ever dated. “I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times,” she told Larry King in 2002. “And I don’t consider that dating somebody.” However, Eminem fueled the speculation on his 2002 album The Eminem Show, played purported voicemails from her during the supporting tour, and discussed their alleged relationship on the radio. This led to a few back-and-forth diss tracks, with Carey releasing “Obsessed” in 2009 and its music video of her dressed as Eminem. In response, Eminem went scorched earth on his scathing diss track, “The Warning,” putting an end to the lyrical beef.",
