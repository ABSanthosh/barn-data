  "text": "An unlikely bromance between Bob Dylan and Machine Gun Kelly is brewing, as the folk legend has apparently narrated a trailer for MGK’s upcoming album, Lost Americana, set to arrive on August 8th. Back in February, we reported on Dylan randomly posting a video on his official Instagram account of Machine Gun Kelly rapping in a record store, with MGK commenting, “you having a phone is so rad,” and singer Mod Sun declaring, “This is my favorite thing that’s ever happened on the internet.” Perhaps there was a method to Dylan’s madness, as the music icon’s voice guides the new teaser for MGK’s forthcoming LP. Get Bob Dylan Tickets Here “Lost Americana is a personal excavation of the American dream,” begins Dylan’s voice. “A journey to find what’s been lost. This album is a love letter to those who seek to rediscover — the dreamers, the drifters, the defiled.” It goes on from there, but the voice is unmistakably Dylan’s. In this day and age of AI, one can never be too sure, but MGK himself posted a photo of Dylan on his Instagram story, and also captioned the teaser, “lost americana the album. 8-8 trailer narrated by … .” Dylan’s Instagram post from February is still up, and is approaching 60,000 likes, so it’s now looking more and more like the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Famer posted the video of MGK with intention, and not by accident. Maybe it’s only a matter of time before we hear the two of them collaborate on a new version of “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”: “Mama put my machine guns in the ground/ I can’t shoot them anymore …” Fans can catch Bob Dylan in person with Willie Nelson and others on the extensive summer leg of the “Outlaw Music Festival Tour,” which kicks off June 20th in Clarkson, Michigan, and runs through September 19th in East Troy, Wisconsin. Tickets are available here. See the Dylan-narrated trailer for Machine Gun Kelly’s upcoming album, as well as Dylan’s original post spotlighting MGK, below.",
