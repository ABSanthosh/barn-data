  "text": "Mk.gee was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live last night, where he played his new single “Rockman” and the Two Star \u0026 the Dream Police cut “Alesis.” Mk.gee didn’t appear in any of the episode’s sketches, but Burr did star in one about a fictional ‘80s hair-metal band called Snake Skin. Scroll down to watch both performances, plus Mk.gee’s promotional video with host Bill Burr and cast member Sarah Sherman, during which he does not crack a smile the entire time.Last night’s episode of SNL was the first since the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with Burr tapped instead of Dave Chappelle—who hosted the 2016 and 2020 post-election episodes. Charli XCX is set to pull double duty as host and musical guest next week, November 16.Mk.gee released his debut album, Two Star \u0026 the Dream Police, in February. The guitarist and Dijon collaborator has since shared the non-album singles “Lonely Fight” and “Rockman.” Revisit the track review for \"Rockman,” and see where Two Star \u0026 the Dream Police fell on Pitchfork's Best Albums of the 2020s So Far.Season 50 of Saturday Night Live has featured appearances from Jelly Roll, Coldplay, Ariana Grande, Stevie Nicks, Billie Eilish, and most recently, Chappell Roan, who sang “Pink Pony Club” and an as-yet unreleased country song called “The Giver.” These were the SNL debuts for both Roan and Mk.gee.",
