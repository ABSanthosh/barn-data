  "text": "Volbeat frontman Michael Poulsen recently joined Side Jams with Bryan Reesman for a candid conversation about his love of boxing – and how the sport ultimately helped him overcome alcoholism and get his life back on track. Boxing has been part of Poulsen's life since childhood. He recalled how, when his father wasn’t spinning classic '50s rock, the television would be tuned to old boxing matches. His dad had even stepped into the ring himself as a younger man, and Poulsen dabbled in the sport as a teenager before ultimately choosing music as his path. But years into the rock lifestyle, the physical toll began to mount. \"It came to a point during Volbeat's career where I was drinking way too much,\" Poulsen admitted. \"I can honestly say that I became an alcoholic.\" The turning point came through an unlikely source: Danish boxing champion Mikkel Kessler, a personal friend of Poulsen. The two had previously collaborated when Volbeat wrote the track \"A Warrior's Call\" in honor of Kessler. But this time, Kessler stepped in with some much-needed tough love. \"Mikkel Kessler, the Danish boxing champion, who was my friend at that time… he said to me, 'Michael, it's time for you to put that booze on the shelf and get in good shape. You're drinking too much. You're getting fat, and mentally it's destroying you.'\" With Kessler's guidance, Poulsen overhauled his lifestyle. \"So I was training a lot with Mikkel. He put up a plan for me how to eat and how to recover, and I became a more sober and clean and happy man. He took it very seriously because he was concerned, and he saw all the alarms going on. So I can only thank him.\" The physical transformation was dramatic – Poulsen lost 25 kilos (about 55 pounds) – but the mental clarity proved equally important. When asked about fighters he admires, Poulsen didn’t hesitate to name boxing icons such as Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, as well as celebrated Danish boxer Gert Bo Jacobsen. He also praised more contemporary champions, including the Klitschko brothers and Ukraine’s Oleksandr Usyk. \"I'm so happy that Oleksandr Usyk from Ukraine is the new undisputed heavyweight champion,\" Poulsen said. \"He's pretty much been mopping the floor with all the cruiserweights. And now he's been mopping the floors with the heavyweights. Not only is he very talented and crafted, he's also a great ambassador for the sport. What he's doing for his country in Ukraine is amazing. He's a great human being. He's very, very inspiring to listen to. So him becoming the undisputed champion and beating Tyson Fury was something that I really enjoyed. It's always great to see great people with great results.\" Even as he celebrates personal growth, Poulsen is still fully immersed in music. Volbeat's ninth studio album, God Of Angels Trust, arrives June 6 via longtime label Vertigo/Universal. Want More Metal?
