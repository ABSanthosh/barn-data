From fans sharing their favorite tracks to singing songs from his discography, keep watching to experience the fun! What’s your favorite track from Chromakopia? Let us know in the comments below! Tyler, the Creator: So can I do a song I’m probably only gonna do in California on the stage? Tetris Kelly:  From Tyler himself to the fans that love him. Fan 1: ‘Chromakopia,’ he’s real. He’s about that s—.  Tetris Kelly:  And everything crypto.com did to celebrate the icon. We’re taking you with us for a night with Tyler, the Creator in Billboard All Access. We arrived at the ‘Chromakopia: The World Tour’ at Crypto.com Arena and LA Live was lit up in green, and even had a statue of Tyler out front. And by the time we made it up to the VIP suite, there was a ‘Chromakopia’ drink that, yes, was green and also very strong. And you can expect a guy like Tyler to have merch with swag, and he delivered, and fans lined up all over the arena for the chance to take some home.  Fan 2: We’re at the Chromakopia Tour. Got that ‘Chromakopia.’ He had to get the hat in both colors. He’s annoying, but they’re really cute.  Fan 3: Big Tyler fans. Fan 4: Day one.  Fan 3: I’ve known him since like ‘Cherry Bomb.’  Fan 5: I really love the marching band inspiration, really big stadium energy.  Fan 6: It’s such a good album. No skips on that album.  Fan 7: The moment it came out, we were at the listening party. We got the Postmates grub.  Fan 3: “Like Him” really finishes off the story about his dad. Listening to that song made me talk to my dad again. Fan 1: He came out with that “Hey Now” remix, that L.A. West Coast, like I’m about this s—. I’ve been here. I’ve been doing that.  Keep watching for more!",
