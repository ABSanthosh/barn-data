Welcome to the Las Vegas Weekend Guide. Kraftwerk: Multimedia Tour 2025 When: April 4, 2025 | 8 p.m. Where: Wynn Las Vegas Get Tickets It’s the weekend before legendary German electronic wizards Kraftwerk return to light up the Coachella Valley, so naturally, they’re getting show-ready a safe distance away from Goldenvoice’s infamous radius clause. Tonight, they’re debuting their groundbreaking Kraftwerk 3-D show at the Encore Theater – because when you’re Kraftwerk, you don’t just perform, you put on a whole damn spectacle. The immersive audiovisual experience initially premiered at MoMA in 2012 and has since traveled across the world’s most iconic cultural stages such as Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). Smokey Robinson: Legacy Tour When: April 4-5, 2025 | 8:30 p.m. Where: The Venetian Get Tickets The one and only “King of Motown” returns to Vegas, bringing his signature smooth sounds to The Venetian stage for a residency that’s bound to captivate your soul. Prepare yourself for an unforgettable night of timeless classics like “My Girl,” “Cruisin’,” and “Just to See Her” – an ideal outing for a night out with your parents or a date night that’ll definitely earn you some brownie points. Either way, Smokey’s got the suave energy and timeless tracks to set the mood right. Carrie Underwood: REFLECTION When: April 4-12, 2025 | 8 p.m. Where: Resorts World Las Vegas Get Tickets American Idol alum turned multi-platinum country powerhouse Carrie Underwood will grace the stage on the Las Vegas Strip tonight with REFLECTION – a dazzling spectacle led by one powerhouse vocalist. The residency serves as an homage to Underwood’s illustrious career, packed with a decade’s worth of career defining anthems such as “Jesus Take the Wheel” and “Before He Cheats.” As Resorts World inaugural headliner, she will be sure to bring the electricity of a quintessential Vegas spectacle, infused with that unmistakable country twang. Aziz Ansari: Hypothetical Tour When: April 5, 2025 | 7 p.m. Where: The Colosseum at Caesars Palace Get Tickets Prepare to laugh till you cry when Aziz Ansari stops by The Colosseum at Caesars Palace for his Hypothetical Tour. It’s sure to be a night jam-packed with his sharp wit and sarcastically hilarious takes on modern life, the dating scene, and maybe even some playful jabs at the current Administration. 2025 Great Vegas Festival of Beer When: April 5 Where: Downtown Las Vegas Events Center Get Tickets Sure, Vegas is all about the hard alcohol, but let’s not sleep on its flourishing craft beer scene. The Great Vegas Festival of Beer is Nevada’s largest craft beer party, featuring over 500 varieties of beers from more than 60 craft breweries, paired with gourmet eats from over 15 local chefs and restaurants. Come thirsty, come hungry – and leave with a buzz and a happy belly. The College Basketball Crown When: April 5-6 Where: T-Mobile Arena Get Tickets Bummed to see your favorite March Madness team get eliminated? Worry not, The College Basketball Crown has arrived to fill that basketball-shaped hole in your heart. This all-new post-season tournament is designed to host the top 16 teams from powerhouse conferences (think Big Ten, Big 12, and Big East) and a few wild cards to shake things up. The event will give teams that didn’t qualify for the NCAA Tournament another shot at securing some street cred on a national stage. Don’t miss the grand finale, with the semi-finals and finals slated for this weekend. Beyond Books: The Library District 60th Anniversary When: April 6-11 Where: All 25 Las Vegas-Clark County Library locations Learn More If you’re looking for something a bit more family-friendly and community-oriented, be sure to visit your favorite Las Vegas-Clark County Library location to celebrate 60 years of serving the region. Beginning this Sunday and running through the end of the week, each of its 25 branches will host exciting days of games, crafts, and prizes. It’s the perfect excuse to pick up another book on your reading list, and stay for the fun.",
