  "text": "The musician passed away from natural causes, according to his manager and assistant. Brenton Wood performs onstage during the Summertime in the LBC festival on August 5, 2017 in Long Beach, California. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images Brenton Wood, the soul singer best known for his 1967 hit “The Oogum Boogum Song,” has died at the age of 83. Wood passed away on Friday (Jan. 3), at his home in Moreno Valley, Calif., surrounded by family and friends, according to his manager and assistant, Manny Gallegos, TMZ reports. Gallegos confirmed to The New York Post that Wood died of natural causes. “He went in his sleep peacefully. The love that he gave us, God took him the same way,” Gallegos said. Explore Explore Billboard See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news The manager also shared a final message from Wood to his fans: “He said, ‘Catch you on the rebound,’” referring to a 1967 song and the title of his final tour, which wrapped up over Valentine’s Day weekend in 2024. Wood began feeling ill shortly after the tour and was hospitalized last May. Born Alfred Jesse Smith in Shreveport, La., Wood relocated with his family to San Pedro, Calif., in the 1950s. He later attended college in Southern California, where he began nurturing his passion for music, drawing inspiration from artists like Jesse Belvin and Sam Cooke. A self-taught pianist, Wood wrote songs and harmonized with neighborhood friends. He adopted the stage name Brenton Wood, drawing inspiration from the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Trending on Billboard After signing with Double Shot Records in 1967, Wood released three of his biggest hits that same year: “The Oogum Boogum Song” (which reached No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100), “Gimme Little Sign” (peaking at No. 9 on the Hot 100) and “Baby You Got It” (hitting No. 34 on the Hot 100). “The Oogum Boogum Song” and “Gimme Little Sign” both peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard‘s Hot R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while “Baby You Got It” reached No. 30 on that chart. In 1972, he founded his own label, Prophesy Records, and later released music under Mr. Wood Records. Over the years, “The Oogum Boogum Song” has reached new audiences through its inclusion in popular TV shows and movies such as The Umbrella Academy, Almost Famous and Don’t Worry Darling, among others. “It’s hard to be in a bad mood after you hear the ‘Oogum Boogum Song,’” NPR wrote in 2023. “Probably not worth the effort.” “It’s a silly title and has silly lyrics, too. But there’s something about the feeling. That almost playful falsetto, the drums bouncing along, the jangly guitar hits.” During his career, Wood believed in “giving back” and frequently performed at schools and community outreach events throughout Southern California, according to his website. During these appearances, the musician would share his personal and professional challenges and successes, offering a message of empowerment with an emphasis on education and a “can do” attitude to inspire youth, the site states.
