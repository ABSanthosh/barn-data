  "text": "Eilish unveiled the news during her concert in Manchester, England, Saturday (July 19). Billie Eilish Henry Hwu A 3D project is underway from Billie Eilish and acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron, the singer announced Saturday night (July 19) in Manchester, England, where she performed the first of a four-show run at the city’s Co-Op Live. While details remain under wraps, Eilish let the cat out of the bag to the U.K. crowd as they’ll apparently be a component of the release that’s in the works. “You may have noticed there’s more cameras than usual here,” she said from the stage Saturday. “I can’t say much about it, but what I can say is I’m working on something very, very special with somebody named James Cameron, and it’s gonna be in 3D.” “So, take that as you will,” she teased. “These four shows here in Manchester, you and me, are part of the thing that I am making.” Trending on Billboard “And also, I’ll probably be wearing this exact outfit for four days in a row,” she said with a laugh. Eilish, currently in the midst of her ongoing Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour, was wearing black-and-blue plaid bottoms and a “Hard and Soft” jersey. Spanning two years, the world tour in support of her Hit Me Hard and Soft studio album (which reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200) began in fall 2024 and runs through November 2025. Several dates were added to the itinerary in May, including the trek’s last two nights in San Francisco. James Cameron Robert Ascroft Cameron, most recently immersed in the Avatar universe — 2009’s Avatar; 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water; 2025’s Avatar: Fire and Ash, opening in theaters Dec. 19, plus an upcoming fourth installment expected in 2029 — is a three-time Academy Award winner, notably taking home a trio of Oscars (including best picture and best director) for Titanic in 1998. For Eilish, the presently untitled project — presumably involving live performance footage in some way, based on her Saturday night comments in Manchester — follows the 2021 concert movie Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles.
