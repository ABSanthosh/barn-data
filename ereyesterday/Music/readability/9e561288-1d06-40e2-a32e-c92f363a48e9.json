  "text": "Pioneering Louisiana sludge metal act Acid Bath are set to reunite in 2025, having just been announced as part of the Sick New World festival lineup. The Las Vegas performance will mark the band’s first show in 28 years. Acid Bath formed in 1991, releasing two influential albums — When the Kite String Pops (1994) and Paegan Terrorism Tactics (1996) — before breaking up in 1997 after bassist Audie Pitre and his parents were tragically killed by a drunk driver in a car crash in January of that year. Sadly, another onetime member of the band, keyboardist Tommy Viator, died earlier this year. For the reunion, Acid Bath will feature three classic members: lead singer Dax Riggs, guitarist-vocalist Sammy “Pierre” Duet (now of Goatwhore), and guitarist-vocalist Mike Sanchez. The lineup will be rounded out by drummer Zack Simmons and bassist Alex Bergeron. “The Bath will return April 12, 2025 at Sick New World Festival,” wrote Riggs via Instagram. “Our heads are literally EXPLODING! We’ll be playing select songs from our two full length LPs. See you there fiends, let the blackness roll on.” Duet also confirmed the reunion via a video message on his Instagram account (see below). Sick New World will be headlined by Metallica and Linkin Park, and also feature Queens of the Stone Age, Evanescence, Gojira, AFI, Tomahawk, Ministry, Mastodon, and more. The Acid Bath reunion news comes just a day after Dax Riggs announced his first solo album in 15 years. The LP, titled 7 Songs for Spiders, will arrive on January 24th, and is available for pre-order here. It features the lead single “deceiver,” which can be heard below.",
