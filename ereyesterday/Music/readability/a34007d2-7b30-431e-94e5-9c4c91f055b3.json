  "text": "Mantar is back with a new record called Post Apocalyptic Depression due out Febraury 14, and a driving new single \"Halsgericht\" streaming right now! If you needed a proper kick in the ass to get things going today – or you just wanna punish your speakers a little – here's your chance. On the single itself, guitarist and vocalist Hanno Klänhardt said: \"The title means something like 'the right to impose extra heavy punishment.' Mantar style. Old fashioned darkness. It's fun to not only finally work with a German song title but also introduce some German lines to the song. It makes it weird and sinister. Just what we like. Especially in the US, people seem to love these kinda vibes. Fine by us. Celebrating it with the most epic hook of the whole album.\" And if you like just how gross and dirty the new single sounds, good news! The whole friggin' album is like that. \"Quick and dirty,\" said Hanno of the recording process. \"We didn't even bring our own gear to the studio, and just used the equipment that we would find there. There was zero planning involved in the making of this album. We wanted to keep it as primitive as possible. \"We were bolder this time and literally cut any shit off the songs that we didn't think was necessary. I think you can hear that and playing these new songs is more fun. I feel very connected with my punk roots on this album. Very punk rock production and next to our first album definitely the most raw sounding one.\" Pre-orders for Post Apocalyptic Depression are available here. Want More Metal?
