  "text": "Snoop Dogg and wife Shante Broadus also made a surprise appearance at the third annual event, presented by Femme It Forward and Live Nation. Doechii receives The Visionary Award, celebrating her fearless creativity and vision for shaping the future of women in music, on Nov. 8, 2024. Pamela Garcia-Agurre “To be a visionary, not only do you have to have a vision but you have to have an unwavering belief and faith in that vision to make it happen. Don’t accept no. Understand that you are not too difficult. The job is just too difficult for them. God will put you in a position and connect you with people who are able to do the job.” So declared newly minted four-time Grammy nominee Doechii as she accepted the Visionary Award from her mother Celesia Moore at the Give Her FlowHERS Awards Gala Friday evening (Nov. 8). Her empowering speech — in which Doechii also shared that she’s “recently sober … with a truly renewed spirit” — was just one of many inspirational moments that drew hearty cheers and shout-outs inside the Beverly Hilton Hotel’s packed ballroom at Femme It Forward’s third annual gala and fundraiser, presented by Live Nation. Additional sponsors included Spotify. Also among the evening’s honorees were GloRilla and Jill Scott. GloRilla, who was also announced as a two-time Grammy nominee earlier in the day, was presented with the Big Femme Energy Award by actress LisaRaye McCoy. Trending on Billboard GloRilla attends the Give Her FlowHERS Awards Gala, receiving the Big Femme Energy Award, on Nov. 8, 2024. “Shout out to God. Shout out to you all. Shout out to me,” GloRilla said in part. “I always live out of the three D’s: determination, dedication and diligence. And don’t let nobody tell you all what you all can’t do because at the end of the day, their sun won’t shine.” Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Jill Scott, recipient of the Muse Award, was paid tribute beforehand by gala host Saweetie — who was honored with the Give Her FlowHERS Award, recognizing an artist who embodies empowerment, resilience and cultural influence — and singer-songwriter Alex Isley. Jill Scott receives The Muse Award at the Give Her FlowHERS Awards Gala on Nov. 8, 2024. Pamela Garcia-Agurre “I have an office at my house where I write and read; I believe in inspiration,” said Scott. “So there’s literally a cacophony of extraordinary women, artists and entertainers on my wall. I look at them all the time because sometimes I get scared, sometimes I get paranoid to the point of paralysis where I don’t think I have enough. So I’m looking at these powerful entertainers and how brave, devoted and passionate [they are] about what they do. And I think, ‘I can do this just another day, maybe just another hour … It’s OK to be scared as long as you walk forward in the thing.” Making a special surprise appearance at the top of the evening were Snoop Dogg and his wife Shante Broadus. They were presented with the Black Love Award by Femme It Forward president/CEO Heather Lowery. “There’s nothing like an award that brings your family, your backbone to the stage. This one here feels better than a Grammy,” noted Snoop, who’s had multiple Grammy nominations but no wins. The evening’s additional honorees included Chloe + Halle (My Sister’s Keeper), Lady London (Self Love) and artist-songwriter Nija Charles (Pen It Forward). Also among the presenters was Grammy-winning singer-actress Andra Day. Integrated throughout the awards ceremony were segments honoring music and media executives who have served as mentors to young women through Femme It Forward’s sister organization Next Gem Femme.  That circle of honorees — paid tribute by their Next Gem Femme mentees — featured COLTURE co-founder Jayne Andrew, Vydia/gamma. vp Lynne M. Scott, Tri-Star CEO Lou Taylor, MVD Inc. president/CEO Miatta Johnson, Amazon Music head of hip-hop and R\u0026B Sierra Lever and CAA music agent Cheryl Paglierani. Funds donated to Next Gem Femme by audience members during the evening will go toward improving equity in the workplace and accelerating career opportunities and trajectories for young women of color.   Explaining the mission behind Give Her FlowHERS in her opening remarks, Lowery — who also founded Next Gem Femme — told the room, “We see you and honor you. You are the reason we’re here tonight.” Quoting the message on notecards found at each place setting (“No rain, no flowers”), she added, “This is also about weathering the storm and planting your flowers. We can’t change the past, but we can rewrite the future.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",

You are the reason we’re here tonight.” Quoting the message on notecards found at each place setting (“No rain, no flowers”), she added, “This is also about weathering the storm and planting your flowers. We can’t change the past, but we can rewrite the future.”\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.billboard.com/\" title=\"Billboard\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 455.133 94.711\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M70.107 28.859h21.318V93.69H70.107zM95.834 3.51h21.312v90.18H95.834zm25.723 0h21.312v90.18h-21.312zm250.711 32.035v-6.686h-21.315V93.69h21.315V62.792c0-7.949 4.154-12.237 11.728-12.237h2.522V28.229c-6.432.253-11.1 2.271-14.25 7.316zM80.764 0c-6.822 0-12.359 5.535-12.359 12.361 0 6.826 5.537 12.363 12.359 12.363 6.828 0 12.361-5.537 12.361-12.363S87.592 0 80.764 0zm244.457 33.795c-2.996-3.268-9.967-5.965-15.26-5.965-16.098 0-27.646 10.613-30.473 26.389-3.082-15.135-16.273-26.78-32.359-26.78-16.24 0-29.537 11.781-32.444 27.2-2.822-16.026-15.428-26.648-31.061-26.648-5.801 0-10.596 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521h-21.312V93.7h20.938v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.467 6.812 17.154 6.812 14.398 0 26.52-11.271 29.113-26.807 3.055 15.203 16.169 26.76 32.373 26.76 16.065 0 28.949-11.312 32.228-26.125 2.711 16.18 15.531 26.301 30.854 26.301 5.293 0 11.099-1.771 15.009-4.668V93.7h21.312V65.327c0-1.164-.008-2.298-.031-3.406.023-1.108.031-2.241.031-3.405V28.969h-21.312v4.826zM181.355 73.948c-6.826 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.533-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.824 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358.001 6.828-5.534 12.363-12.359 12.363zm65.774-.99c-6.822 0-12.361-5.539-12.361-12.363 0-6.823 5.539-12.358 12.361-12.358 6.824 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.823-5.532 12.363-12.359 12.363zm64.047.392c-6.826 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.363 0-6.823 5.527-12.358 12.354-12.358 6.832 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.824-5.527 12.363-12.359 12.363zM433.815 3.5v28.631c-4.156-2.9-8.949-4.16-14.757-4.16-17.782 0-31.654 13.746-31.654 33.55 0 18.664 13.368 33.043 29.642 33.043 6.68 0 12.103-2.146 17.152-6.811v5.928h20.938V3.5h-21.321zm-12.553 70.288c-6.817 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.358 0-6.828 5.535-12.365 12.354-12.365 6.828 0 12.363 5.537 12.363 12.365 0 6.819-5.535 12.358-12.363 12.358zM36.072 27.99c-5.803 0-10.594 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521H0V93.7h20.936v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.469 6.812 17.156 6.812 16.268 0 29.637-14.383 29.637-33.047 0-19.797-13.874-33.545-31.657-33.545zm-2.269 45.958c-6.824 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.535-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.826 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358 0 6.828-5.533 12.363-12.359 12.363z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cp\u003eGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.email.billboard.com/signup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\n\tSign Up\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
