  "text": "Ireland is known for its vibrant music scene, yes (firsthand knowledge) – but, only as of recently has the country been reaping the rewards of a currently thriving international alternative music scene. Now, the Irish can further rejoice as Coheed and Cambria and ALEXISONFIRE are the latest to announce dates on the Emerald Isle. Playing in The National Stadium in Dublin, Ireland on the 9th of July and The Telegraph Building in Belfast, Northern Ireland on the 8th, Coheed and Cambria and ALEXISONFIRE are set to provide a double headliner for only €60 (roughly $62.27) for general admission with booking fees, and €171.25 ($177.71) for the VIP package. The VIP package includes a meet and greet with full band (which appears to be Coheed and Cambria only), a professional photo with the band, an exclusive one song performance from the Coheed and Cambria members, an exclusive cassette copy of the band's latest album, The Father of Make Believe, demos, a collector pin, a MAGES VIP laminate and lanyard, early entry to the venue and access to merchandise. Tickets went on sale last night with tickets going fast with both The National Stadium in Dublin and The Telegraph Building in Belfast having a maximum capacity of 2,000 people each.
