  "text": "Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" music video was uploaded to YouTube in 2009. In 2019, it hit one billion views. This past week, within just six years of the first billion views, the \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" music video hit two billion views. One of the best selling songs of all time with over 13 million units sold, Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has become a piece of modern music culture with its careless attitude and future influence on the grunge scene. Music, and culture, is cyclical, and just like clockwork, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" always finds it way back to the mainstream. And it seems like it's coming back around. You can add to the two billion views by checking out the music video below. Want More Metal?
