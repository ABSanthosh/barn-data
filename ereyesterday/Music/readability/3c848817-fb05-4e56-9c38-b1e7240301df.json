  "text": "Argentinian police have charged three people in connection with the death of Liam Payne. The former One Direction member fell to his death at a Buenos Aires hotel on October 16th. A toxicology report subsequently revealed that Payne had a number of drugs in his system at the time of his passing, including cocaine, benzodiazepine, and alcohol. According to La Nación, two of individuals who were charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including one person who worked at the hotel where the singer was staying. A third individual, described as a friend of Payne’s, is accused of abandonment of a person, which carries a possible sentence of five to 15 years behind bars. That person allegedly presented himself as a Payne’s manager, although he was not, failed to tell Payne’s family that he was having issues with drugs, and did not respond to investigators’ call on the day that Payne died. Payne was 31 years old at the time of his death. In light of his passing, numerous celebrities have spoken out about the music industry failing the young artist. Notably, Bruce Springsteen said the business puts “enormous pressures on young people,” adding, “Dying young – good for the record company, but what’s in it for you?”",
