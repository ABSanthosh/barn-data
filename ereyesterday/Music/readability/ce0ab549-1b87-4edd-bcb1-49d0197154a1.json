  "text": "Each week, our Songs of the Week column highlights the best new tunes from the previous seven days and takes a look at notable releases. Find our new favorites and more on our Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, you can listen to our New Sounds playlist. This week, Young Thug and Future flex like madmen on “Money on Money.” You know you’re rich when you can afford to own a Rolls Royce. You know you’re really fucking rich when owning a Rolls Royce is so pedestrian within the scope of your luxurious life that you don’t even bother learning its model. Those trivial details are below your pay grade, after all. That’s the level of flexing that Young Thug and Future engage in on their new single “Money on Money,” Thugger’s first major release since his high-profile legal troubles. Though, you’d never know it, as the rapper presents like he hasn’t missed a beat. Forget conspicuous consumption, these two present themselves as Scrooge McDuck or Pablo Escobar types — they have so much cash flow they literally don’t know what to do with it (other than spend it on “my bitch and my kids.”) Of course, Young Thug does seemingly address his case, if in a somewhat indirect way. It doesn’t take all that much analysis to put the pieces together when he disses rats and fake friends, especially when the video features the two burning a tapestry that bears the name of Thugger’s label, YSL. He seems ready to blow it all up and burn the slate clean. The beat matches the ice in their veins and (presumably) the ice on their wrists; devious, expensive, and boasting the type of trap hi-hats and synth lines that make you stank face like you’re a blues rock guitarist ripping a solo. Then there’s the beat change, which finds the track momentarily taking a turn towards the darkness before returning to the slightly glossier status quo. Put all together, it’s a cold-ass fucking package, one that makes you feel like a baller even if you’ve been keeping tabs on the fluctuating price of eggs.
