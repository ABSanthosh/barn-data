  "text": "Human drum machine Eloy Casagrande is showing off his inhuman chops once again, this time thanks to some live footage of Slipknot playing \"Eyeless\". The footage is entirely drums-only, so you can really dig into what Casagrande is up to (and subsequently feel bad about yourself as a drummer). Dude's playing is totally insane – he hits hard, his timing is solid, and those ghost notes on the snare are just groovy as fuck. So when can we heard Casagrande on some new Slipknot material? All we know is that according to percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan in an interview with Knotfest, there's a new Slipknot record in the works. Though it's probably not coming out anytime in the near future. \"2025 I'm going to work on 'No Complaining',\" said Clown. \"Just not going to do it anymore. I realized my expectations are never going to be met. So I need to give myself a break. It's probably the last part of ego I need to work on. That way I can just float. Nothing will bother me. I can just work on positive potential. We got a new album. We're gonna start at some point. I just want to roll into that with an energy like it's all starting again. That's how I want to approach it.\" Slipknot appeared to have new music coming \"very soon\" back in June, but now it seems the wait might be a little bit longer. In an interview with Alternative Press prior to that, Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor said he feels Casagrande might push the band toward a sound they haven't had in a while, which is great news considering how damn good old Slipknot is: \"Eloy is such a natural writer. I think he's going to take us to some places we haven't been in a while. I've got a lot to say, and I'm looking forward to expounding on a lot of different things.\" Want More Metal?
