  "text": "Linkin Park kicked off their festival circuit last week at this year's Rock For People. Performing to 50,000 attendees, one attendee in particular caught frontwoman Emily Armstrong's eye with a massive sign that said, \"EMILY, CUT MY HAIR.\" Armstrong pretty much said, 'fuck it,' and welcomed the fan to the front of the crowd where he produced clippers out of nowhere. She ended up giving him a hell of a mullet, saying, \"We gotta keep some at the back for the party, baby!\" This comes right after Linkin Park was announced as the first headliner for 2026's Rock In Rio Lisboa on the 21st of June in Lisbon, Portugal. You can check out the footage of Armstrong shaving the fan's head below, and tickets for Linkin Park's set at Rock In Rio Lisboa are available here.
