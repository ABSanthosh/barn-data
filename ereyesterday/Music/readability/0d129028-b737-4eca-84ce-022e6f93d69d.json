  "text": "Well holy shit, Nevermore is coming back in 2025! Details are scarce right now, but what we do know is that Nevermore guitarist Jeff Loomis just broke the news on his Instagram about an hour ago. A reel posted by Loomis scrolls through all of Nevermore's album art from over the years before landing on a new one, followed by the band's logo and the phrase \"A new chapter arises\" and the year 2025. There's also mention of a new website, which you can check out right here. It's not clear who's going to be in Nevermore 2025 outside Loomis and drummer Van Williams, who also posted the same reel. It's also not clear who's going to sing in Nevermore upon their return, as classic vocalist (and only Nevermore vocalist) Warrel Dane died in 2017. It's worth noting that Loomis and Williams both quit Nevermore in 2011, leaving Dane and bassist Jim Sheppard as the two remaining members. We'll keep you all posted as we know, but holy shit!
