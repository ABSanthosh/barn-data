  "text": "Sony Music Central America and the Caribbean (CAC) has struck up a strategic alliance with Alofoke Music, the label founded by prominent Dominican Republic-based media personality Santiago “Alofoke” Matías.Under the agreement, Sony Music CAC says it will serve as the exclusive distributor of all forthcoming releases from Alofoke Music.Sony has also acquired a portion of the label’s catalog. Billboard reports that Sony has “acquired the majority of the more than 700 tracks released under Alofoke Music for over a decade”.According to the official press release announcing the deal, the “long-term partnership reflects a shared vision for nurturing the next generation of Latin urban talent and expanding their presence across international markets”.The deal also allows for “strategic collaborations” on select tracks with potential for what Sony described in its press release as a “global rollout under a shared rights model”.The first two releases under the Sony Music CAC banner are already in development, with official release dates to be announced soon.Alofoke Music is a subsidiary of Alofoke Media Group, founded in 2006 by Matías in the Dominican Republic. The label oversees the group’s recorded music ventures, including the ‘Alofoke Music Sessions’ — live studio performances during Alofoke’s radio/YouTube broadcasts that spotlight emerging and established urban artists.Originally launched as a digital platform to spotlight local artists, Alofoke Music has grown into what Sony describes as “a powerhouse in music production, A\u0026R, and cross-platform content” with a “vast digital footprint” across platforms including YouTube, social media, and all major global DSPs.Alofoke Music has helped launch viral hits like Que Linda by Lomieel, Donaty, and Papera (35m+ streams globally), Con Sonido by Bulin 47 and Ceky Vicini, and Baje Con Trenza by El Cherry Scom and Ozuna.Sony adds that Alofoke’s cultural impact extends beyond the Dominican Republic into “major” diaspora hubs such as New York, Miami, and Madrid — “making it a cornerstone of the global urban scene”.To date, Alofoke Music has generated over 762 million global audio and video streams across platforms.“We’re thrilled to join forces with Alofoke, who is a monumental figure in the music and media space in the Dominican Republic and beyond.” Melissa Exposito, Sony Music CAC“We’re thrilled to join forces with Alofoke, who is a monumental figure in the music and media space in the Dominican Republic and beyond,” said Melissa Exposito, President, Sony Music CAC.“What he represents in terms of community, culture, and championing talent aligns perfectly with our vision. This partnership is about elevating regional voices in key international markets and building bridges for emerging artists to thrive globally.”“This alliance is the result of a shared vision rooted in innovation and legacy, with our eyes firmly set on the future of music.”Santiago “Alofoke” Matías,  Alofoke MusicSantiago “Alofoke” Matías, Founder of Alofoke Music, added: “This alliance is the result of a shared vision rooted in innovation and legacy, with our eyes firmly set on the future of music.“Partnering with Sony Music not only validates the years of work we’ve poured into building a platform for talent—it also opens the door for new generations to break barriers and take their sound to global audiences.”Sony’s partnership with Alofoke marks the company’s latest move in one of the emerging markets highlighted by Rob Stringer, the Chairman of Sony Music Group and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, during an update to investors last month.Stringer revealed during the presentation that Sony has “completed more than 60 investments in the past year alone” and spent “over $2.5 billion for frontline, catalog, as well as creative and service ventures with outside entrepreneurs across a vast number of territories”.He also highlighted Sony Music’s expansion in high-growth markets across Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.“In our central local companies, we have forged new ventures in the Czech Republic, Greece,  Saudi Arabia, and all across Southeast Asia,” said Stringer.He added: “Our appetite for this is endless in its potential.”Earlier this month,  Sony Music France and Sony Music Publishing France acquired Lusafrica and Africa Nostra, a long-established label and publishing house dedicated to promoting Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) and African artists worldwide.Music Business Worldwide",
