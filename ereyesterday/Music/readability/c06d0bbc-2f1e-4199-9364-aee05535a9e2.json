  "text": "The singer was nominated for favorite female country artist at the annual awards ceremony. Lainey Wilson performs onstage during the 2025 American Music Awards at BleauLive Theater at Fontainebleau Las Vegas on May 26, 2025 in Las Vegas. Ethan Miller/Getty Images She may not have been “Defying Gravity” on Monday night (May 26), but country superstar Lainey Wilson proved why she’s so “Popular” during the 2025 American Music Awards. Taking to the stage at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas decked out in an all-white outfit complete with cowboy hat and flowing cape, Wilson performed a stirring rendition of her latest single, “Somewhere Over Laredo,” which takes some melodic influence from Judy Garland’s classic Wizard of Oz ballad “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Surrounded by white smoke on all sides with a full band playing in the wings, Wilson let her voice take center stage during her moving performance. “Couple wrong for each other, lone star-crossed lovers/ Born to get gone from the get-go,” Wilson belted on the track’s chorus. “But you′re on my mind every time I′m chasing this neon rainbow/ Somewhere over Laredo.” Wilson wasn’t just at the AMAs to deliver a performance. The country star was also nominated alongside Beyoncé, Ella Langley, Kacey Musgraves and Megan Moroney for favorite female country artist at the annual ceremony. Kendrick Lamar led all nominees at the 2025 AMAs with a whopping 10 nominations, followed closely by Post Malone with eight nods, and Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish and Shaboozey with seven each. Meanwhile, Wilson took home her second consecutive entertainer of the year award at the 2025 ACM Awards earlier this month, making her the first woman to do so since Taylor Swift won the award back-to-back in 2009 and 2010. The American Music Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Eldridge Industries and Billboard parent company Penske Media.
