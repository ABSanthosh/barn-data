  "text": "Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson proposed to his girlfriend Kelly Osbourne in Birmingham, England, on Saturday (July 5th) backstage at the “Back to Beginning” concert featuring the final performances of Kelly’s dad Ozzy Osbourne and his band Black Sabbath. In a video posted to Kelly’s Instagram page, Wilson, in front of Ozzy, Sharon, and Jack Osbourne, begins, “Kelly, you know I love you more than anything in the world,” as Ozzy jokingly tells him, “Fuck off! You’re not marrying my daughter!” Wilson, after laughing at Ozzy’s interruption, gets down on one knee and continues, “Nothing would make me happier than to spend the rest of my life with you. So, in front of your family and all of our friends, Kelly, will you marry me?” Kelly, in shock, nods yes, as Wilson slips an engagement ring on her finger to loud applause from the Osbourne family and others in the room. In late 2022, Sid and Kelly welcomed a son named Sidney, who was Ozzy’s 10th grandchild at the time.  Watch the proposal in the Instagram video below.",
