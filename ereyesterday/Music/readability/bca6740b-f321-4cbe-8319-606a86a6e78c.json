  "text": "TikTok has come back online just 12 hours after the social video platform went dark over the threat of a nationwide ban in the US. Users were able to access TikTok again starting around 12:00 p.m. ET on Sunday. TikTok’s decision to restore access in the US followed an announcement by President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday morning, in which he revealed his intention to issue an executive order on Monday to delay the platform’s ban in the US by 90 days. Trump also said his executive order would shield app stores and services providers from liability for hosting TikTok. “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,” the company said in statement on Sunday. “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.” “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,” the statement added. “We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act—passed overwhelmingly by Congress, signed into law by President Joe Biden, and upheld by the US Supreme Court last week— required TikTok to divest from its Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance by January 19th, 2025, or face a ban in the US. The law grants the president—Donald Trump, in this case as of January 20th—the authority to delay the ban by 90 days if TikTok demonstrates progress in divesting from ByteDance. While Trump himself was initially at the forefront of calling for a ban of TikTok as far back as 2020, his success on the platform during the 2024 presidential election seemingly changed his views on the app. He has vowed to find a “political resolution” that would “save TikTok”— though both the Chinese government and TikTok have shown an unwillingness to sell. On Sunday, Trump proposed a 50% “ownership position” between the US and China. “By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.  Without US. approval, there is no TikTok.  With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions.” “Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.” Trump could also instruct his Department of Justice not to enforce the PAFFCAA or refrain from collecting fines from US app stores that continue to make TikTok accessible, but those options are legally questionable and would likely face court challenges.
