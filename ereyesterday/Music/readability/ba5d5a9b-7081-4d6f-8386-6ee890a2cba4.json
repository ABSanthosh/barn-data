  "text": "Flogging Molly frontman Dave King is “battling a very serious health condition,” according to a statement from the band. As a result, the Celtic-punk band has canceled all 2025 tour dates. The band shared the news on its social media accounts Wednesday (February 5th), without specifying King’s specific health condition. In addition to the canceled tour dates, King will miss Flogging Molly’s 2025 Salty Dog Cruise, which sets sail in 12 days. However, the cruise will go on, with the other bands on the lineup as well as select members of Flogging Molly. King is married to Flogging Molly violinist and vocalist Bridget Regan, with the couple asking for privacy during this difficult time. The full statement from the band reads as follows: “To our family, friends and fans, Our fearless leader, the inimitable Dave King, is currently battling a very serious health condition. Dave and Bridget ask everyone to respect their privacy at this time, we will share as we can. Any good thoughts or prayers you can send Dave’s way, he and we would appreciate it. Unfortunately Flogging Molly will be unable to perform shows in 2025. With the Salty Dog Cruise 12 days away, the boat will sail as planned with 18 bands, and members of Flogging Molly, on board to celebrate the cruise, the community and our captain, Dave King. Thank you, Flogging Molly *For the headline dates after the cruise, please contact your point of purchase for refund instructions” Flogging Molly had been slated to embark on a US tour on February 24th in St. Petersburg, Florida. The outing was set to lead up to the band’s three-day “Shamrock Rebellion” celebration in three cities (Las Vegas, Tempe, and Los Angeles) over St. Patrick’s Day weekend. The Dublin-born King formed Flogging Molly in Los Angeles in 1994. He previously had been in the band Fastway with “Fast” Eddie Clarke (Motörhead) and Pete Way (UFO). Our best wishes go out to Dave King for a full recovery. See Flogging Molly’s social media post below.",
