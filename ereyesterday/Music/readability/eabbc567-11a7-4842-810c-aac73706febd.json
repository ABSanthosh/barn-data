  "text": "In a recent interview with Samuel Acevedo of El Planeta Del Rock, Atreyu bassist Marc \"Porter\" McKnight opened up about one of the band's most challenging performances, a show in Monterrey, Mexico, over 15 years ago that remains unforgettable. The gig, supporting Iron Maiden in February 2009, also featured Morbid Angel, Carcass, and Lauren Harris's band, drawing a sold-out crowd of 35,000 fans. Reflecting on the experience, McKnight explained (via Blabbermouth): “One of the toughest shows we've ever had to play was in Monterey, Mexico with Iron Maiden in, I think, February 2009. And it was us in direct support to Iron Maiden… And the first 5,000 people at that show did not want fucking anything to do with any band but Iron Maiden. And because we were right before Iron Maiden, they hated us the most. Or maybe because we had tight pants and weren't as heavy.\" McKnight humorously noted the contrast between Iron Maiden’s theatricality and their intense fanbase, commenting, \"Isn't it funny that Iron Maiden's not that heavy, actually, but they have, like, the gnarliest fanbase on earth? They're so theatric and triumphant, and then every fan is, like, beating shit out of each other. It's hilarious. I love it. I fucking love it \" The show took a dangerous turn when McKnight was struck by a metal spike thrown from the crowd, nearly injuring his eye. “They threw a lot of stuff at us. There was a lot of physical violence. There were pesos being thrown at us. I actually got hit right here below my right eye. I have a dent in my skull from it… It almost put my eye out. I was headbanging really fast. And it hit me right below the eye. I was bleeding everywhere. It was fucking wild,” he shared. Despite the initial resistance from fans, the tour had a positive outcome: That show was difficult, but past those 5,000 people that were ravenous for Iron Maiden, we had circle pits, people singing along, we sold all of our merch — they fucking loved us. We had a blast.\" Want More Metal? Subscribe To Our Daily Newsletter Enter your information below to get a daily update with all of our headlines and receive The Orchard Metal newsletter.",
