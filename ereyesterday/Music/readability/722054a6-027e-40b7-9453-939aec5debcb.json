  "text": "The Waterboys have joined forces with Fiona Apple, Bruce Springsteen, Steve Earle, and other artists to make a concept album about the late, great actor Dennis Hopper. Life, Death and Dennis Hopper is out April 4, via Sun, and will be led by the single “Hopper’s on Top (Genius)” on Friday (January 10). In the meantime, find the album artwork and tracklist below.As the Waterboys’ Mike Scott put it in press materials, “The arc of his life was the story of our times. He was at the big bang of youth culture in Rebel Without a Cause with James Dean; and the beginnings of Pop Art with the young Andy Warhol. He was part of the counter-culture, hippie, civil rights, and psychedelic scenes of the ’60s. In the ’70s and ’80s, he went on a wild 10-year rip, almost died, came back, got straight and became a five-movies-a-year character actor without losing the sparkle in his eye or the sense of danger or unpredictability that always gathered around him.” The record, he added, concerns not only Hopper’s life, but also “the whole strange adventure of being a human soul on planet earth.”Other guests on the follow-up to 2022’s All Souls Hill include Sugarfoot, Dawes’ Taylor Goldsmith, Kathy Valentine of the Go-Go’s, Patti Palladin, Barny Fletcher, and Anana Kaye.Read Mark Richardson’s recent Sunday Review of the Waterboys’ 1985 landmark, This Is the Sea:Life, Death and Dennis Hopper:01 Kansas [ft.
