  "text": "In the high-stakes world of electronic music, where the demands are as relentless as the rewards are exhilarating, Kompass Music Group is charting a course in artist management grounded in mental wellbeing and community.Founded by industry stalwarts Blake Coppelson, Jay Rogovin, Alec Donkin and Jade Gaines, Kompass, which was named EDM.com's best artist management firm of 2023, is redefining success by prioritizing artists' creative freedom and growth from a holistic perspective. With a roster as diverse and dynamic as Vintage Culture, Of The Trees, UZ, Carola and more, the team understands that nurturing mental health is essential for sustaining lasting careers.Integral to this mission is Kompass' collaboration with 4 O’clock Consulting, a partnership with mental health advocates Kristin Karas and Stacey Forrester. Together, they bring a thoughtful, structured approach to support the individuals behind the music, helping to fortify a culture of care and responsibility. Their alliance echoes recent findings on the power of electronic dance music to enhance mental health, underscoring the genre’s unique capacity to uplift and provide solace.Kompass manifested this ethos in a spectacular way at the 2024 Amsterdam Dance Event, where the company hosted an intimate boat party alongside NOISIA's influential label, VISION Recordings. Transforming a decommissioned industrial vessel into a floating warehouse, the atmospheric event featured What So Not, Opiuo, Skeler and more, whose performances resonated with the visceral, authentic energy that Kompass cultivates so well.David Giovannini, Mouna Dif and Franz Hilberath, three of the seasoned members of Kompass' team, share a vision for artist management that transcends the traditional to champion careers marked not only by achievement, but also by resilience, purpose and community.EDM.com: Kompass is all about shaking up the status quo—what was the moment you realized the traditional artist management model wasn’t working, and how did that spark the creation of Kompass?David Giovannini: I wouldn't necessarily say that the traditional artist management model wasn't working, as much as the model wasn't working for those of us who came together to form KMG. The formation came together by us managers collectively pulling from personal experiences, both on the business and community involvement sides. All of us have a deep relationship with music, and we have actively participated in the creation and curation of music communities based amongst genres we love. Approaching business with the knowledge and experience as passionate event-attendees, as well as, having formed deep, life-long relationships due to music, has allowed us to navigate the artist/management relationship from a place of commonality.Mouna Dif: When I joined the company a little over a year ago, I was drawn to its mission of shaking up the traditional artist management model. I’ve always felt that the old ways of managing artists didn’t fully support their creative freedom or adapt to the ever evolving industry. Kompass stood out because it embraces innovation and puts the artist at the center, helping them take control of their narrative and explore new ways to connect with their audience.Franz Hilberath: I really connected with Kompass' commitment to inclusivity in building a management team, the genuine care for artists and team members as individuals, and the overarching goal to champion authentic, unique artistry. This inclusive and caring approach was a game changer for me—it highlighted that the traditional, often transactional management models were no longer sufficient in supporting true artistic freedom and personal growth.EDM.com: Kompass has partnered with 4 O’clock Consulting, known for their work in areas like risk reduction and mental health. What led you to collaborate with experts from outside the music industry, and how has that shaped Kompass’ approach to artist management?David Giovannini: Our collective experiences as participants within the \"music scene\" has given us insight as to why conversations around harm reduction, mental health, and the music industry are imperative. In life, we have all gained so much through the sub-communities within electronic music. Those experiences led us to understand that these communities function best when we lean onto and learn from one another. 4 O'Clock helped us collectively form Kompass' core values, which we believe are the five most-important pillars to how we operate as artist managers. They're an integral branch of KMG that offers direct consultation and stewardship with every artist and manager involved with the company.Mouna Dif: Our partnership with 4 O’clock Consulting goes beyond supporting artists—it extends to the people working behind the scenes, like managers, who play a crucial role in shaping an artist’s career. As a woman manager pushing boundaries and advocating for women artists, their support has been vital to my well-being and that of the artists I represent. In a male-dominated industry where preconceptions still exist, the battles we face are tougher and can be a real strain. 4 O’clock Consulting has been instrumental in helping both my artists and myself navigate these challenges and continue to move forward.Franz Hilberath: The collaboration with 4 O'clock Consulting reflects our approach to providing more comprehensive resources for managers, who often have thankless, exhausting, and sometimes maddening roles. They check in on us not just as professionals but as people, fostering a holistic workplace environment where I feel supported both personally and professionally. This partnership has been crucial in nurturing a supportive, team-oriented culture at Kompass.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesEDM.com: If Kompass could design the future of live events, what would that look like? How do you envision your artists connecting with fans in more meaningful ways beyond just the music?David Giovannini: As managers, we are diplomats of the creative vision. If the artist dreams it, our mission is to build it to the highest caliber of our ability. Whether it be a dark, intimate room with sweat dripping from the ceilings, or an over-the-top production meant to tingle every human sense - we want to make it happen.Artist-fan connection has to be consensual on both sides. An artist has to want to take that interaction \"beyond just the music,\" and the fans have to want to engage and participate with what the artist puts out there. In the end, authenticity is key.Mouna Dif: My vision for the future of live events involves creating intimate and unique experiences in memorable locations. I imagine smaller-scale gatherings where artists and audiences can connect authentically, allowing fans to form lasting memories. Offering exclusive merch and unique elements would make each event special, ensuring these experiences go beyond just the music and foster meaningful connectionsFranz Hilberath: Building on what Mouna mentioned, I see a future where underground acts create more unique, personal experiences. While commercial, mainstream events are at a peak, there’s a growing demand for authenticity and less commodified experiences. The future lies in intimate, memorable events that allow fans and artists to connect on a deeper level.EDM.com: Success in the music industry can be fleeting. How does Kompass help its artists build not just a momentary buzz, but a career that withstands the test of time?David Giovannini: Everything I've mentioned - shared experience, deep passion, creative vision, community engagement, mental health checks. All of these elements are the kindling to the fire one needs to take on \"the industry.\" Pair all of that with a trusted team that is in place to understand/refine/accomplish, and ideally, that will lead to a long, fruitful career. Also, sometimes you just have to ride the ride.Mouna Dif: We focus on long-term success by nurturing each artist's unique creativity. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, we develop customized plans that cater to each artist individual needs \u0026 wishes. We also understand the importance of a balanced career and avoid relying solely on revenue streams like touring. Most importantly, as the music industry evolves with AI and algorithms and new technologies continue to erode artists' streaming revenue, while touring becomes increasingly costly in the current economic crisis post-COVID, we guide our artists in diversifying their work to build sustainable careers that can withstand the test of time.Franz Hilberath: We focus on fostering long-term brand and business health. Our approach helps create a sustainable brand and artistry that supports artists in using their careers as a vehicle to progress through life and achieve personal milestones, much like others in more traditional careers. We actively audit, manage, and improve their brand, business, and personal lives—these are the pillars of our long-term support strategy.EDM.com: What’s an unconventional lesson you've learned from managing artists that most people wouldn’t expect, and how has it shaped how Kompass operates today?David Giovannini: The nature of our work allows us the freedom to travel, visit venues, connect with teams and explore new cities around the world. KMG encourages our managers to accompany our clients at important/unique events and connect with our peers beyond that next Zoom call. This has allowed us to form a global web of resources and relationships. Also - airtag your luggage and equipment!Mouna Dif: An unconventional lesson I've learned is the power of embracing vulnerability. Many assume artists should always project confidence, but authenticity creates deeper connections with fans. This has shaped Kompass by encouraging our artists to share their true selves in their music and interactions. We foster an environment where vulnerability is seen as a strength, leading to genuine engagement and lasting relationships.Franz Hilberath: An unconventional lesson has been the power of flexibility. In a field where rigidity can be the norm, learning to adapt to the unexpected—whether it's changing industry trends, personal artist needs, or even global events like the pandemic—has taught us the value of being nimble and responsive. This flexibility has shaped Kompass to be resilient, ensuring that we and our artists can thrive in any circumstance.",
