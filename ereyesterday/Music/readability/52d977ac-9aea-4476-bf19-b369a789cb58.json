The superstar is set to return for her second year as host of NBC’s annual Christmas in Rockefeller Center telecast. Explore See latest videos, charts and news She announced the exciting news during Tuesday’s (Nov. 5) episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show. “Let’s talk about this incredible time of year. The city is so magical. I love the holidays in New York,” she told the audience. “Living here during Christmas is like you’re in a movie. There’s nothing like it in the world, especially the tree lighting ceremony, which is an iconic tradition.” She continued, “I got to host it last year, and I thought, ‘Oh, this will be fun.’ […] Then, the tree lit up, and you would’ve thought, like, I don’t know, I found out I was going to survive something. I bawled. It’s so beautiful when you’re standing there. I’m especially excited though, because for the second year in a row, I’m going to host Christmas in Rockefeller Center.” Trending on Billboard Besides hosting, Clarkson is also set to perform some festive hits at the tree-lighting ceremony. The three-time Grammy winner will have a host of holiday tracks to choose from for her performance, including beloved holiday classics and originals from her two Christmas albums: 2013’s Wrapped in Red and 2021’s When Christmas Comes Around… Additional performers for the special will be announced at a later date. Christmas in Rockefeller Center will air Wednesday, Dec. 4, at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream on Peacock. Watch Clarkson’s announcement in the video above.
