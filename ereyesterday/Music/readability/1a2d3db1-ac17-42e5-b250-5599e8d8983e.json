  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Music | More Platforms When people say they want ska music to come back, what they’re really saying is that they want ska music to once again be a part of the pop music world. If that were to happen, though, it likely wouldn’t sound anything like ’90s ska-pop (Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, Mighty Mighty Bosstones). Simply put, pop music has changed. So, what kind of ska would fit into the current landscape of pop? To answer that question, Catbite and producer Sarah Tudzin join In Defense of Ska to muse over ska’s path back into the mainstream, as well as their new EP, Doom Garden. Listen above, or wherever you get your podcasts. As it happens, Doom Garden works as a pretty fitting example of how ska might be able to fit into contemporary pop. It honors the traditions of the former, while summoning the joy of the latter. The In Defense of Ska crew loves it, and while they’re not certain whether or not it’ll reach a pop audience, they think it’s definitely worth discussing. Tudzin is also a former guest of the podcast, plays in the band Illuminati Hotties, and has handled production for big indie artists like Weyes Blood, Boygenius, and Speedy Ortiz. So, with her experience in mind, there’s even more angles from which to view Doom Garden. Plus, the gang talks about Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy’s feature on “Tired Of Talk,” how they nearly got rapper Tierra Whack on the record, and the influence of Ashlee Simpson and “Jingle Bell Rock.” Listen to Catbite and Sarah Tudzin chat about all this and more above, and make sure to like, review, and follow the series wherever you get your podcast. Don’t forget to check out all the Consequence Podcast Network series here. Additionally, you can support the In Defense host Aaron Carnes by purchasing a copy the new expanded, 2nd edition of his book, In Defense of Ska. Meanwhile, Davis’ Omnigone released their latest record, Feral, last year.",
