  "text": "Check out what else the St. Louis rapper had to say in her latest profile. Sexyy Red Chris Allmeid Sexyy Red could’ve been a wrestler in the WWE universe. During a profile with Dazed, it was revealed that the St. Louis rapper was offered “a permanent role as wrestler.” However, Sexyy’s busy schedule didn’t allow for proper time to train and she ultimately settled for cameo instead. And when talking about the subject, she compared her current occupation with sports entertainment. “Rapping and wrestling are pretty much the same,” she explained. “It’s not quite acting, but it’s kind of acting too, right? Because when we go home and take off all our jewels and gold and remove the costumes we wear, we then have to go right back to reality with our families.” Sexxy made her WWE debut last May when she hosted NXT where she unveiled the brand new NXT North American Women’s Championship belt and sang Shawn Michael’s iconic “Sexy Boy” theme song with the legend himself. She then hosted NXT Battleground in Nevada a couple months later.

So they don’t have to steal it no more, because it’s too expensive right now. Food should be free! No one should ever be homeless.” Trending on Billboard Adding, “The people at the bottom are my favorite kind of people, period. I like people that wear True Religion jeans, even though they’re [seen as being] too ghetto. I’ve got like 600 pairs! I represent the people with no airs and graces.”  She also talked about the hardships of fame and how she’s still racially profiled when she goes back home. “Trying to live a normal life is difficult when you’re famous,” she admitted. “Sometimes y’all be so annoying. If you see me with my babies bagging up groceries, then get the f—k away from me. No photos!” She continued by saying the more famous she gets, the more she feels unsafe. “I feel like with me, the more famous I get, the more people will see me as a threat,” she added. “As I get bigger and more viral, there’s going to be more and more people who want to harm me, 100 percent.” Sexyy then brought up her dealing with law enforcement in her hometown. “The police in St. Louis just shot another Black kid dead the other day. That sh—t’s so wrong,” she said. “When I go back home, there are usually two outcomes [when I am stopped in traffic]: they either like your music and want to tell you about their kids being fans, or they choose to mess with you even more [now you’re this celebrity]! Sometimes they pick on me or just fuck with me for fun. They like to remind you of where you are. It’s all about reinforcing their position [of power].” Her song with Bruno Mars “Fat Juicy \u0026 Wet” currently sits at No. 34 on the Hot 100 where it peaked at No. 17 and has been on the chart for two weeks.
