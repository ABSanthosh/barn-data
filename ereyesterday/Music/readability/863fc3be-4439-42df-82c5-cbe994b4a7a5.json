  "text": "Turnstile have announced a new visual album to accompany their upcoming studio LP, Never Enough. The companion film, titled Turnstile: Never Enough, will debut at Tribeca Festival 2025. Directed by singer Brendan Yates and guitarist Pat McCrory, the 50-minute visual includes all 14 songs from the record. Watch a trailer for the film below.This year’s Tribeca Festival lineup also includes the world premiere of Miley Cyrus’ visual album Something Beautiful, the premiere of concert film-turned-cultural analysis Depeche Mode: M, and screenings of the new documentaries Wizkid: Long Live Lagos, Billy Joel: And So It Goes, Billy Idol Should Be Dead, and many more. The festival takes place June 4–15 in New York.Never Enough—the highly anticipated follow-up to Turnstile’s breakout album, Glow On, and their first LP with new guitarist Meg Mills, following Brady Ebert’s departure—arrives June 6 via Roadrunner. Leading the full-length are the title track, “Birds,” and “Seein’ Stars.” The latter song features vocals by Paramore’s Hayley Williams and Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes, and all three tracks have music videos directed by Yates and McCrory, which are presumably part of the Turnstile: Never Enough visual album.Read about Glow On at No. 29 in “The 100 Best Albums of the 2020s So Far.”",
