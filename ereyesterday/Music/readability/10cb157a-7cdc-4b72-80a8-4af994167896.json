Keep watching to see how he dominated the Hot 100, Billboard 200 and so much more! Tetris Kelly: With 13 Billboard Hot 100 No.1’s, 13 No.1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and 39 Billboard Music Awards, who ranks No.4 on the greatest pop stars of the 21st century list? Drake! The Canadian superstar first made his name playing Jimmy Brooks in ‘Degrassi: The Next Generation.’ Drake’s music career quickly rose after catching the attention of Lil Wayne, who signed him to his label “Young Money” Records. That led to Drake’s first appearance on the Billboard charts in 2009 with “Best I Ever Had.” As music streaming platforms like Spotify began to rise in popularity, so did Drake. He became the leader of hip-hop for the 2010s mixing his rap verse with more personal R\u0026B style singing, like his frequent collabs with Rihanna during this time. His album ‘Take Care’ not only won his first Grammy in 2013, it continued to show his influence in pop culture. Drake continued to produce No.1 albums like ‘Nothing Was the Same,’ and ‘If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.’ He also began working with another frequent collaborator “Future” with projects like ‘What a Time to Be Alive.’ 2016 was a huge year for Drake, his album ‘Views,’ debuted at No.1 and is his longest running No.1 album at 13 weeks. The album spanned some of the biggest hits of the decade like “Hotline Bling.” Another collab with Riri on “Too Good” and his first No.1 as a lead artist on the Hot 100 with “One Dance.” Keep watching for more!",
