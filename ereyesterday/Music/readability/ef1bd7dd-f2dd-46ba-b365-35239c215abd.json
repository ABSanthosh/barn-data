  "text": "Bieber also posted photos from the studio over the weekend. Justin Bieber was seen on June 23, 2024 in New York City. Ignat/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images Justin Bieber made a surprise stage appearance over the weekend, joining Don Toliver for his performance of “Private Landing” at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena. Toliver welcomed the singer to the stage on Friday (Oct. 18), a moment that was captured and shared in an Instagram Story by Bieber’s wife, Hailey. Bieber vibed with the crowd for “Private Landing,” the the pair’s 2023 track that also featured Future. Based on fan clips from the show, it seems Bieber was just on stage to hype Toliver, not sing. Trending on Billboard “Private Landing” was released as a single from Toliver’s album Love Sick and peaked on Billboard‘s Rhythmic Airplay chart at No. 8 in 2023. On Sunday, Bieber surprised fans with something else: photos that appear to be from either a studio or rehearsal space. One photo slideshow shows the singer-songwriter at a keyboard. In another photo set, he has a mic in hand in one image and is singing into a mic in a closeup shot. Both photo posts credit photographer Rory Kramer, who thanked Bieber “for having me into your home these last 4 days” and complimented the “amazing energy” he felt spending time with the singer, and his family and friends. Are the photos a sign that new music is on the way? Last month, Mk.gee revealed he’s been in studio sessions with Bieber. In an interview with The New York Times, Mk.gee said, “He’s searching. Anything that comes out of his mouth: That’s pop music. You can really do pretty wild stuff behind that, just because it represents something.” Bieber’s most recent full-length studio album, Justice, was released in 2021 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. He welcomed a baby with Hailey over the summer. The new parents announced the birth of their first child, Jack Blues Bieber, on Instagram on Aug. 23.
