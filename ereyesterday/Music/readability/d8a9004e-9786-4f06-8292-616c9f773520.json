  "text": "Bruce Springsteen has paid tribute to the late Brian Wilson in a new statement praising The Beach Boys co-founder’s legacy and influence on his own music. “Brian Wilson was the most musically inventive voice in all of pop, with an otherworldly ear for harmony,” the Boss wrote on Instagram. “He was also the visionary leader of America’s greatest band, The Beach Boys,” Springsteen continued. “If there’d been no Beach Boys, there would have been no ‘Racing In The Street.’ Listen to ‘Summer’s Gone’ from The Beach Boys’ last album That’s Why God Made The Radio and weep. Farewell, Maestro. Nothing but love and a lovely lasting debt from all of us over here on E Street.” Springsteen is the latest artist to honor Wilson since his passing, joining surviving Beach Boys Mike Love and Al Jardine, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, and Sting.
