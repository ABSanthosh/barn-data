  "text": "Transatlantic deathcore band Face Yourself have just dropped a brand new music video for their track, \"Primal,\" alongside the release of their new EP, Martyr. American-native drummer Eric DiCarlo, bassist Kyle Muenzner, and guitarists Dave Ricco, Corey Doremus, and Thomas Cadone craft roaring soundscapes for French-native frontwoman Yasmine Liverneaux to rage over through emotionally charged lyrics throughout the EP. The focus track, \"Primal,\" talks \"about the shift that happens in someone, when they realize they've been wronged for so long, and decide to finally stand up for themselves,\" with the overarching themes of the EP exploring \"different mental health battles through the struggles, and the strength it takes to heal.\" The brand new EP, Martyr, features five tracks that sail through the highs and lows of ferocious metal melodies and breakdowns. And \"Primal\" is no different. Check out the music video for \"Primal\" above, or check out American tour dates for Face Yourself below as they join VCTMS and Crystal Lake on the Summer of Rampage Tour.
