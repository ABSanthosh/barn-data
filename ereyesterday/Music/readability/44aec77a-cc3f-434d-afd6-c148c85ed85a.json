  "text": "The three-day event will take place at Crypto.com Arena. P1harmony Courtesy of FNC Entertainment The first wave of acts locked in to perform at this year’s KCON Los Angeles has been announced. As unveiled Monday (April 28), the 2025 performer lineup will feature, in alphabetical order: CRAVITY,SEVENTEEN subunit HxW, IS:SUE, IVE, izna, JO1, LEE YOUNGJI, NMIXX, P1Harmony, Roy Kim and ZEROBASEONE. Organizers of the three-day event are expected to announce several more batches of artists in later weeks. Taking place Aug. 1-3 at Crypto.com Arena in L.A., 2025’s KCON LA will also have a theme: “KLOVER’S CLUB FAIR.” Drawing inspiration from lucky four-leaf clovers, the event will feature different stages and activities that cater specifically to K-pop fans while promising the good fortune of access to their favorite artists. And those who love Korean culture as a whole will have much to experience in addition to music, with stations focusing on fashion, beauty and food. The L.A. installment of KCON is just one of many that take place annually around the world, with the festival also hosting iterations in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, United Arab Emirates, France, Mexico, Australia, Thailand and Saudi Arabia since first kicking off in the United States in 2012. In 2024, KCON LA attracted more than 5.9 million fans from 170+ countries, both on-site and through virtual opportunities to join in. The 2025 KCON LA will be extra special for the guys of P1Harmony, who will return this year after performing at last year’s festival as well. “It’s really a convention to show off Korean culture and what’s hot and upcoming in Korean culture, like K-beauty, music, food,” band leader Keeho told Billboard backstage at the 2024 event. Trending on Billboard He added at the time: “To be able to go there and just be part of that wave of representation, and showcase what’s new, I feel like it’s really really good to take part.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
