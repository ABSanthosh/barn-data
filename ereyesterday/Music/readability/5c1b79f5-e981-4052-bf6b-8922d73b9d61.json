  "text": "It's no secret that Nine Inch Nails is coming back. The band has been plotting a new record amid a myriad of soundtrack work, and now it seems there's a tour announcement coming very coon! It all started back in December when a rumor broke out of Nine Inch Nails potentially announcing a world tour in January. While no official announcement has yet been made, ticket sales and advertisements have begun showing up for a tour dubbed the Peel It Back World Tour. One such date – a September 10 show at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, FL – has an on-sale date of January 17. So it seems the announcement is likely coming this week In a April 2024 interview with GQ, Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross revealed that they were starting to think about a new Nine Inch Nails record. In part, Reznor said: \"Let's try some stuff. We're bored. We are. You know what I mean? We're grateful. We enjoy doing films. We can write a better Nine Inch Nails record, I think. We can put on a cooler tour. We are aimed to do that. But man, what if we try to do that? \"What if we could take what we're good at, like we did with film? We identified something I think we're good at and we figured out how to apply it to something else. What if we take that theory and try it on some other things? And that's led us into: We're not beaten down completely yet. And it feels exciting. That's what matters to us right now.\" Reznor re-confirmed the new material in a December 2024 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, saying that Nine Inch Nails is actively working on new material and that they're excited to be back. \"We're taking the inspiration we've garnered and funneling it into a Nine Inch Nails project, which we're working on now. We're ready to be back in the driver's seat.\" The next Nine Inch Nails record will be their first since Bad Witch in 2018, or their first since the double ambient project of Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts in 2020.
