  "text": "Exodus – now fronted by Rob Dukes – is celebrating 40 years of their debut album Bonded By Blood this April with two Bay Area shows! The shows feature Death Angel and Nukem as the openers for both nights, with Blind Illusion as a guest on the first night and Hirax on the second night. \"We could not be more excited for this show announcement!\" wrote Exodus of the shows. \"The 40th anniversary of our debut only happens once, and to fall on Paul Baloff's birthday, on a Friday, we KNEW we had to crush the Bay Area. Bonded By Blood. Played in its entirety. Only Baloff era songs. Once in a lifetime moment for us. So killer that we added a second show in Southern California to show our appreciation to both regions. Joining us our some dear friends, especially Death Angel. Don't miss this. Posers must die!\" Death Angel added: \"Death Angel are so proud to have been asked to be a part of the Exodus Bonded By Blood 40th Anniversary shows in April. A record that changed and inspired the entire thrash metal scene and community! And us in the biggest way! I expect both shows to be nothing less than an extreme outpouring of violent celebratory energy from all of the bands and fans to honor an album that absolutely defined and still does the genre known as thrash Metal!\" 4/25 Berkeley, CA UC Theatre4/26 Anaheim, CA House of Blues Want More Metal?
