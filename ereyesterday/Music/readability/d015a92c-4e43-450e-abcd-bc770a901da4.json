  "text": "The upcoming bundle of joy is her and husband Cam Arnold's first child. Lauren Alaina Katie Kauss* Congratulations are in order for Lauren Alaina, who is expecting her first child with husband Cam Arnold! The country star revealed the exciting news with People, and showed off her new baby bump in her music video for “Those Kind of Women,” released on Wednesday (Jan. 22). In the clip, the 30-year-old American Idol alum watches in awe as her mother raises her, from pregnancy to present — ultimately revealing that she’s going to be a mom herself, cradling her growing belly. “I was raised by those kind of women/ Rocked to sleep on Dolly and Dylan/ Set ya straight with a fly swatter whippin’/ You can always smell love cookin’ in the kitchen,” she sings in the chorus with her characteristically sweet country twang. Alaina told People of her pregnancy, “[I didn’t know] I can love something that I haven’t even really held yet. I feel the baby inside me, and it’s kicking me and doing all of the things. It’s like I was the Grinch or something, and my heart grew.” Explore See latest videos, charts and news She added, “I’m looking forward to watching my husband be a dad. He is so obsessed with our animals; he’s a big nurturer in general. In fact, when I was getting ready to marry him, that was something that I knew would be one of the best things about being his wife, was being able to parent with him.” Trending on Billboard Watch Alaina’s “Those Kind of Women” music video below.
