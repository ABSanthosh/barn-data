  "text": "Spooky Season is rolling right along into Halloween week, but those who have been tuned in to Agatha All Along know there’s nothing to fear about how fun this limited series about a coven of witches has been. The show is anchored by Kathryn Hahn, reprising her WandaVision role as the clever and wicked Agatha Harkness, fully stepping into the spotlight. Agatha All Along marks Agatha’s  debut as the focus of the story in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and that’s not the only critical first the program has provided. In the first episode of Agatha All Along, Kathryn Hahn became the first woman to embrace some serious nudity in the MCU, baring her naked butt onscreen, a topic she spoke about during a recent appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show. “When we see Agatha at the beginning, she’s completely without her powers,” Hahn told Hudson. “She has to bust out of a spell with help from some mysterious characters. When she first realizes it, I think the description was, ‘She puts on a robe and goes outside.’ I was like, ‘I wonder if she would put on a robe? Because she’s in a feral state.’ I think she was just feral. She wouldn’t even be thinking of who she is.” With her booty debut, Hahn joins an elite club in the MCU: Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk — albeit in classic green Hulk form — are the only other two figures to get this cheeky on camera throughout the many years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s the first display of major female nudity within the many franchises that have graced screens both big and small. “It’s like I walked on the moon!” Hahn joked as she accepted a plaque from Jennifer Hudson titled “First Woman to Show Her Butt in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.” Watch the full interview below, and navigate to 4:30 for Hahn’s comments about stripping down. Then, revisit our review of Agatha All Along here, and dig into our ranking of every project in the ongoing MCU.
