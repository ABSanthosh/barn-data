  "text": "Lucifer's Hammer vocalist Andrés \"Hades\" Adasme has died at 38 years old. Hades fronted Lucifer's Hammer since their inception in 2012, and sang on all four of their studio albums. According to a statement from Lucifer's Hammer (translated form Spanish), it appears Hades was murdered \"by a criminal.\" We extend our condolences to Hades's friends and family at this time. \"It is with deep sorrow that we announce the sensitive passing of our friend and band leader, Andrés Adasme (Hades). It fills us with pain the unjust way our brother who was valiantly murdered by a criminal leaves us. We are left with an immense void in our soul, but also with the legacy of his passion, talent and friendship, which will live forever in our hearts and in his music. \"We want to express our sincerest thanks to all the bangers who, over the years, enjoyed the music of Lucifer's Hammer and shared this passion with us. Your support and love have been crucial during this difficult time. We inform you that the wake of our dear Andrés will be held in Las Petunias street #335, Huechuraba commune, Metropolitan Region. \"Let's accompany his farewell with respect and love, always remembering his energy, his art and the legacy he leaves us. Thank you for your understanding and for keeping his memory alive.\" Want More Metal?
