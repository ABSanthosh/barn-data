  "text": "Megadeth released their Youthanasia album on November 1, 1994. Prior to the release, Megadeth began utilizing the brand-new Internet to do some promotion with the first official website for a band. Should you never have seen that site – headed up with the slogan \"WHERE THE HELL IS MEGADETH, ARIZONA?\" – good news! Megadeth has completely relaunched the website in all its 1994 glory, which you can check out right here. \"To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Youthanasia, Megadeth invites you to revisit the Internet World Wide Website that locals know as Megadeth, Arizona,\" wrote Megadeth on the site. \"But hold onto your horses… 'cuz once you get exploring, you may never want to go home. During your stay, you can visit local hotspots including the Megadiner, the Digital Drive-In and Vic's Cactus Hut and Souvenir Shop. Enjoy some familiar town activities, like reading your Horrorscope and listening to K-DETH 101. Just strap on your spurs, jump on the info superhighway, make a left at the cowskull… and you're there. Youthanasia spawned the live staple \"A Tout le Monde\" for Megadeth, as well as two other singles – \"Train Of Consequences\" and \"Reckoning Day\". Youthanasia featured Megadeth mastermind Dave Mustaine alongside longtime members bassist David Ellefson, guitarist Marty Friedman, and drummer Nick Menza. Want More Metal?
