  "text": "Stoners and riff-enjoyers, rejoice! Electric Wizard is slated to release their first new studio album since 2017's Wizard Bloody Wizard sometime this year. Details remain murky about the release, though Electric Wizard guitarist and vocalist Jus Oborn revealed the album's existence in a recent interview with It's Psychedelic Baby Magazine. The new record follows Electric Wizard's 2024 live album Black Magic Rituals \u0026 Perversions Vol. 1, which was released in December. \"Well, we actually have a new album coming next year. Yes, this live LP was just an 'offering,' a 'gift' (maybe even a contractual obligation, haha) to you while you patiently await our new recordings,\" said Oborn \"I can't see us doing more than one LP ever again, so we are making sure it's bloody good. And bloody heavy.\" On what he's been listening on recently, Oborn also revealed he's been largely into the heavier side of krautrock. Though I'm not sure we can expect a krautrock-flavored Electric Wizard record – that might get a little weird. \"Fuck, since the pandemic I went crazy rediscovering and digging new shit. These days, a lot of krautrock. I love Jeronimo, Birth Control, Asterix, Silberbart, Wind, Scorpions, etc.—well, mainly the heavy guitar stuff. I don’t really like the spacey hippy stuff, haha, except Amon Düül II. They are fucking evil and weird. My tastes never run far from ’70s heavy metal, really, haha, with some black metal or ELP every now and again.\" Want More Metal?
