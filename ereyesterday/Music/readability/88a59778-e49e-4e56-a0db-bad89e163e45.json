  "text": "Sony Music Labels, the recorded music division of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, has acquired the “full rights” to the popular Spookiz animated series.This marks the first time that Sony Music Labels, which primarily focuses on music recording business, has come to acquire animated character content.The deal gives Sony Music Labels control over the globally distributed content that has accumulated 6.1 million YouTube subscribers and more than 3.1 billion total views.The agreement also includes rights to existing Spookiz social media channels across Instagram, TikTok, X, and Facebook, along with the official website.Spookiz centers on five monster characters who come to life at an elementary school after hours. The series features short-form, non-verbal animations typically running one to three minutes.Each character maintains distinct personality traits: Cula, a mischievous vampire; Frankie, a food-obsessed Frankenstein; Kebbi, an unpredictable goblin; Kongkong, a Chinese ghost; and Zizi, a zombie character.“Building on the expertise cultivated in the music business and with the support of creators and  partners, Sony Music Labels will aim to transform these monsters into stars, much like the way artists are developed.”Manubu Tsujino, Sony Music LabelsThe content has gained a following across international markets including the US, Philippines, Singapore, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and the UK.Following the acquisition, Sony Music Labels will collaborate with Keyring Co. Ltd., the South Korean animation studio that created the original content, as Sony plans to produce new Spookiz animations and launch a new season this year.The acquisition represents a strategic shift for Sony Music Labels, which operates primarily in music production and distribution. The company says it plans to leverage its artist development expertise and to integrate music to expand the Spookiz brand across new markets and demographics as it plans to develop and introduce new characters.Manubu Tsujino, Representative Director \u0026 President, Sony Music Labels, said: “Sony Music Labels is embarking on a new challenge. As a record company, Sony Music Labels has acquired the globally beloved Spookiz.”“The characters will engage in even more heartfelt activities through animation, music, and other mediums. So please stay tuned for the exciting developments ahead.”Manubu Tsujino, Sony Music Labels“Building on the expertise cultivated in the music business and with the support of creators and  partners, Sony Music Labels will aim to transform these monsters into stars, much like the way artists are developed.“The characters will engage in even more heartfelt activities through animation, music, and other mediums.
