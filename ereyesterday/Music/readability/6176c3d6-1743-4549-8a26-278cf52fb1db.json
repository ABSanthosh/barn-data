  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Music | More Platforms Well, folks, this is it. You’ve made it to the end of the In Defense of Ska podcast. Nobody can say it wasn’t a great four-and-a-half-year run of interviews, discussions, laughs, and hard-hitting ska journalism. Hosts Aaron Carnes and Adam Davis certainly had a blast, so join them as they celebrate the end of the series with special guest Mike Park. Listen above, or wherever you get your podcasts. Will there ever be more episodes of In Defense of Ska? It could happen, say Carnes and Davis. Though, for now, there’s not a soul on this planet that knows what the future holds. Don’t cry ’cause it’s over — skank ’cause it happened. In the meantime, Carnes is working on a new book, a novel called Little Black Book of Death, as well as a few other super cool projects. Make sure to follow him on Substack for updates and insights into his creative process. He’ll also make sure to make frequent updates on all of his and Davis’ upcoming projects on the In Defense of Ska Patreon. Meanwhile, Davis is going to be working his ass off on more Omnigone goodness. Fans can rest easy knowing new records and tour dates are on the way. Follow the band on social media for updates. At last, In Defense of Ska leaves you by saying, “Ska Now More Than Ever.” Listen to the final episode of In Defense of Ska featuring Mike Park above, and make sure to like, review, and follow the series wherever you get your podcast. Then, check out all the Consequence Podcast Network series here. Additionally, you can support the In Defense host Aaron Carnes by purchasing a copy the new expanded, 2nd edition of his book, In Defense of Ska. Meanwhile, Davis’ Omnigone released their latest record, Feral, last year.",
