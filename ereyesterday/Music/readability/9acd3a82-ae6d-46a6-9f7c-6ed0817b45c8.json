  "text": "First New England, then the Mediterranean — now, London. No matter the location, private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is ready to solve another murder for writer/director Rian Johnson. At Netflix’s Tudum fan event on Saturday, Johnson and the film’s cast offered a first look teaser of Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery and confirmed its release date: December 12th, 2025. Plot details for the third movie in the Knives Out series are sparse, though filming began in June 2024, something Johnson teased then with a photo of Craig looking slightly shaggier than usual. The cast also includes Josh O’Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church — more than one of whom might be playing priests. Currently, Johnson also created and executive produces the Peacock mystery series Poker Face, now in the middle of its second season. While both projects revolve around an individual cunning detective, there are some key differences: Poker Face is much more Columbo-inspired, while Johnson draws more inspiration from the works of Agatha Christie for the Benoit Blanc mysteries. The most important distinction is that an episode of Poker Face reveals its killer initially, while Benoit Blanc doesn’t figure out whodunnit until the end. Check out the new teaser below, and also revisit our review of Glass Onion, Consequence’s number one movie of 2022.",
