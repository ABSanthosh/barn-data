  "text": "Nightwish manager Ewo Pohjola has been charged with assault over an incident that occurred in October 2023. According to a report by the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE), Pohjola strangled a woman during a Music x Media event held in Tampere. The woman claims she was approached by a \"visibly drunk\" Pohjola and a second, unidentified man at a bar during the event. Pohjola left the bar and, after the woman spoke with the second man for a period of time, Pohjola returned and put his hands around her neck in \"a tight stranglehold.\" Pohjola allegedly said \"it felt exciting\" before leaving. A second woman had also come forward with a similar accusation against Pohjola, but did not press any charges. The second woman claims that Pohjola approached her at a bar and forcefully pulled her close to him by her hair. Pohjola was allegedly ejected from the bar shortly thereafter. Loudwire reports that Music x Media CEO Jani Jalonen has since acknowledged the incident. Jalonen said: \"We are aware that, unfortunately, there has been inappropriate behavior at our event. We cannot comment on the details. Every participant in our event is required to commit to the event's values and respect others. We have a process for potential harassment situations, according to which we act.\" Pohjola has not commented to YLE on the charges and has previously denied any wrongdoing, saying in February \"I have no idea about the whole thing.\" MetalSucks has reached out to Nightwish about the charges, to which they replied: \"The band will not comment on the ongoing situation until the case has been closed.\" Want More Metal?
