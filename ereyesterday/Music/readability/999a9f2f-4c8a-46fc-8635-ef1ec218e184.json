  "text": "K. Dot has collabs with everyone from Beyoncé \u0026 Taylor Swift to Travis Scott \u0026 SZA. But who might join him in New Orleans? Special guest appearances have long been prevalent when it comes to the Super Bowl halftime show. So when Kendrick Lamar was announced as the Super Bowl LIX headliner over the weekend, fans started speculating what might be on the Compton MC’s potential setlist and what guests might join him. Lamar is gearing up to hit the Caesars Superdome stage in New Orleans on Feb. 9, 2025. “Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,” Kenny said. “And I’ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.” Ever since Jay-Z and Roc Nation struck a partnership with the NFL in 2019 to help co-produce the halftime show, hip-hop and R\u0026B have had their presence felt. “Kendrick Lamar is truly a once-in-a-generation artist and performer,” Hov said in a statement. “His deep love for hip-hop and culture informs his artistic vision. He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendrick’s work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come.” Lamar had his first taste of the Super Bowl during the West Coast’s invasion at the 2022 Super Bowl in Los Angeles alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige. Whittling down Lamar’s discography to a 15-minute performance is sure to be a tough proposition. He already announced that his upcoming tourmate SZA will join him onstage as a special guest during the show, but he’s racked up some fan-favorite collaborations over the years with Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and many more.
