  "text": "Marty Friedman, known for his iconic work with Megadeth and Cacophony, and a diverse and eclectic solo career, recently revealed a surprising influence behind his legendary guitar style. While many associate Friedman with thrash and shred, a lesser-known inspiration comes from the early '80s New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM). During an interview with Eddie Trunk, Friedman shared how John Sykes and the Tygers of Pan Tang's album Spellbound left a lasting impression on his development as a guitarist. This conversation occurred not long after Sykes' passing, making the reflection all the more poignant. \"John Sykes was a big influence to me when I was developing when you're a teenager, and you're developing your sound and what it is you want to do in music,\" Friedman began (transcribed by Ultimate Guitar). \"When I heard the Tygers of Pan Tang, I was really into the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. And as you know, it was very innovative as far as heavy metal and rock rhythm guitar went, and that was kind of the big signature of it.\" Friedman went on to describe what made Sykes' playing stand out in the NWOBHM scene. \"And somebody could maybe correct me, but I think that John Sykes was the first guy as a lead guitarist, at least the first guy who was under my radar, who was just playing mind-boggling guitar in that context. I mean, at that time, it was, like, really cool rhythms, and the solos were kind of like just your basic, regular solos that fit the songs fine.\" Although bands like Iron Maiden and Def Leppard found global success, Friedman emphasized that the Tygers of Pan Tang were a major force in the NWOBHM movement, especially with their second album. \"When John Sykes came out on Tygers, on the Spellbound album, it was like, 'This was a game changer for me.' So, he was the first guy in that genre that I heard that was like, 'Wow, these lead guys can really take an exciting part of the band's sound.' And he was an extremely important influence to myself and a lot of the people that I've met over the years playing metal.\" While Sykes would go on to greater fame with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder, Friedman believes his work on Spellbound remains a high-water mark. Reflecting on the guitarist's legacy, Friedman added, \"Everybody in the world of heavy metal and hard rock and guitar owes a lot to him.\" Want More Metal?
