  "text": "Ozzy Osbourne was inducted into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday night (October 19th) in Cleveland with a rousing and highly entertaining speech by Jack Black. The Prince of Darkness was also honored with a three-song performance fronted by Maynard James Keenan, Jelly Roll, and Billy Idol. Jack Black gave an all-time Rock Hall speech, with his face turning beet red as he hilariously screamed his way through a highly animated rundown of Ozzy’s various achievements. Ozzy himself followed, sitting in a giant leather bat-design chair. The metal icon singled out his late guitarist Randy Rhoads and his wife Sharon during his brief speech. The all-star performance was next, as Tool’s Maynard James Keenan sang “Crazy Train” alongside Wolfgang Van Halen on lead guitar, with a backing band of Chad Smith on drums, Robert Trujillo on bass, Andrew Watt on rhythm guitar, and Adam Wakeman on keyboards. Next up, Jelly Roll and Zakk Wylde took the spotlight for “Mama, I’m Coming Home.” Wylde then made his way into the audience as he shredded his guitar leading into “No More Tears” fronted by Billy Idol, as Osbourne and Black looked on from the side of the stage and mouthed along to the words. The Ozzy segment was no doubt a highlight of the ceremony, coming four hours into the evening and injecting some life into the festivities after a number of longwinded speeches had zapped a good deal of energy out of the crowd. The enshrinement marked the second time Ozzy has made his way into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame, having been inducted with Black Sabbath in 2006. The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony streamed live on Disney+ and will also be available to replay on Hulu.",
