  "text": "Yames Radek Andersven – better known to some as graphic designer GRIMGRIMGRIM – suffered an extremely serious head injury during War Hungry's set on December 15 at Preserving Underground in Philadelphia, PA. According to a post from Andersven, he almost died from a brain bleed after hitting the floor and required 50 stitches alongside literal brain surgery. A GoFundMe has since been launched to help Andersven with his medical bills. Donate to that here. \"My name is Colleen Crank and I'm a friend of Jim's (aka GRIMGRIMGRIM),\" reads a description on the GoFundMe page. \"On 12/15/24 Jim suffered a head injury at a show and ended up needing emergency brain surgery at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia, PA and now has 50 staples in his head. Jim is resting at the hospital now, and has been alert and FaceTiming with his friends, even giving a 'GO BIRDS!' to end the call. Jim will need our help, now, however as he will be out of work both from his 9 – 5 and from vending. \"If you've been around the Philly art/metal/hardcore/wrestling scene over the last 10+ years you've probably seen Jim around, if not you've definitely have seen his art on show fliers or at Philly sporting events on shirts. Jim has done a lot for a lot of people, and I hope we can do something big for him. \"I'm starting the goal at 10k and will take it from there.
