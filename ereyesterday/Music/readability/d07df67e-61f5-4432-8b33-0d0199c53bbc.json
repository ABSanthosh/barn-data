  "text": "Duane “Keffe D” Davis has given his first major interview since being arrested and charged, in 2023, with first-degree murder in connection with the 1996 killing of Tupac Shakur. Speaking with ABC News, Davis said he’s “innocent” and that he “ain’t killed nobody.” Davis also expressed remorse in giving interviews and writing about Shakur’s death, claiming that he did so to make money. Find the ABC News video below.Davis has not been accused of shooting Shakur. Instead, Nevada prosecutors claim that the former gang leader was the ringleader of the group that shot the rapper in a drive-by shooting.Davis is the only suspect ever to have been charged in connection with Shakur’s death, and he has pleaded not guilty to murder. Davis’ attorney, Carl Arnold, has also sought to have the case dismissed, arguing that his client never should have been charged with a crime due to prior immunity agreements. Davis’ trial is due to begin on Monday, February 9, 2026.",
