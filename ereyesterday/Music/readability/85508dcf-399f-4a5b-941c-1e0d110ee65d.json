  "text": "Molotov Solution is back for the first time since their 2011 album Insurrection with a brand new single, \"Devour The Children\". The video was written and directed by Dylan Hryciuk at Versa Films, while the single itself draws inspiration from both Francisco Goya's infamous painting Saturn Devouring His Son and the revolutionary phrase \"la révolution dévore ses enfants.\" \"With the resurrection of Molotov Solution, we're excited to release 'Devour the Children,' our first single since the 2011 album Insurrection,\" said Molotov Solution of the single. \"Drawing inspiration from Goya's haunting painting Saturn Devouring His Son and the revolutionary phrase 'la révolution dévore ses enfants,' this track explores the dark themes of sacrifice and betrayal in the relentless pursuit of power. \"It's a brutal reflection on how the ideals of change can consume those who dare to challenge the status quo. 'Devour the Children' brings our signature deathcore assault whilst also exploring new sonic elements, that we hope will resonate with new listeners and longtime fans alike.\" Molotov Solution in 2024 is vocalist Nick Arthur, guitarist Robbie Piña, and drummer Jacob Durrett.
