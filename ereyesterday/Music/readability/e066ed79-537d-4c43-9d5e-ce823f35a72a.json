  "text": "It's to be expected – hell, the entire gig is a farewell to Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, but it still feels surreal when it's over. Black Sabbath have just played their last show with Ozzy Osbourne tonight (5th July) in Birmingham, England at their Back To The Beginning celebration. Taking to the stage after Osbourne's five-track solo performance, Black Sabbath also performed four tracks of their own. You can check out each song below. Thank you, to the grandfathers of metal.
