  "text": "Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson has boarded the upcoming Street Fighter movie reboot, joining a stacked cast that already includes Jason Momoa as Blanka, Andrew Koji (Warrior) as Ryu, Noah Centineo as Ken, and masked country singer Orville Peck as Vega. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the rapper-turned-actor will play the disgraced boxer Balrog in the film. The trade magazine’s sources add that 50 Cent is already “deep into training” for the part and will do his own stunts in the movie. Kitao Sakuri (The Eric Andre Show) is directing the project, which begins production in Australia this August. Other members of the cast include Callina Liang (Presence) as Chun-Li and Joe Anoa’i (aka Roman Reigns) as Akuma. Editor’s Note: See where the 1994 Street Fighter movie landed on our list of Worst Video Game Movies Ever Made.",
