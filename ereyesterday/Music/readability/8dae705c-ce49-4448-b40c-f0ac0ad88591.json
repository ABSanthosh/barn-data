  "text": "As Dua Lipa continues her 2025 “Radical Optimism” tour, which touched down in Australia earlier this week, she’s been paying tribute to some local icons. After delighting audiences in Melbourne with a cover of AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell,” she followed it up with her take on Natalie Imbruglia’s classic “Torn” for her second show in the city. Watch it below. With a fuzzy white scarf trailing dramatically behind her, the pop star went all-in on the angsty track popularized by Imbruglia in 1997. While the song was initially released in 1991, the version recorded and released by the Australian vocalist eclipsed the success of the original and became a staple of Imbruglia’s discography. Get Dua Lipa Tickets Here Dua Lipa is set to hit a number of European cities over the next several months before the tour touches down in North America in September. Though named for her third album, the “Radical Optimism” tour also features cuts from her chart-topping 2020 release, Future Nostalgia, as well as other early favorites like “One Kiss” and “New Rules.” With the five-year anniversary of Future Nostalgia on the horizon, the vocalist announced a special-edition vinyl release of the quarantine soundtrack.
