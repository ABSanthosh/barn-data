  "text": "Feminism means believing that women can do anything, including be the central killer of a Ryan Murphy murder series. Deadline reports that the next season of Murphy’s Monster series for Netflix will focus on the notorious Lizzie Borden, who was accused of murdering her parents with an axe in 1892. The first season of Monster, released in 2022, focused on serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer (played by Evan Peters), while last fall’s Monsters depicted Lyle and Erik Menendez’s infamous case. The upcoming third installment will feature Charlie Hunnam as Ed Gein, a.k.a. “The Butcher of Plainfield.” Casting is now underway, and without question, it’s going to be exciting to find out who gets tapped for the lead role here — Lizzie Borden has previously been depicted several times on screen, including by Ryan Murphy semi-regular Chloe Sevigny in the 2018 movie Lizzie. For more, look back on where this began with our review of Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.",
