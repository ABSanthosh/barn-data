  "text": "Alejandro Sanz is on the cover of Billboard, and the Spanish singer shares how his new song with Shakira, “Bésame,” came to life.  Read the full story here. Narrator: How do Alejandro Sanz and Shakira write a song? Alejandro Sanz, the Spanish idol, reunited with his friend Shakira to write “Bésame,” the lead single from his new album ‘¿Y Ahora Qué?’ Shakira and Sanz were unable to meet in the studio to record the song because both have incredibly busy schedules. As a result, the composition and recording process took place long-distance. Given that both artists are perfectionists, the WhatsApp conversations were “intense,” says Sanz. Sanz spoke exclusively with Billboard for the cover story of Billboard Español and shared how it was to work with Shakira, Grupo Frontera and Manuel Turizo. He also talked about his new tour and the process of creating an album that has reignited his enthusiasm and passion, making him feel great again.
