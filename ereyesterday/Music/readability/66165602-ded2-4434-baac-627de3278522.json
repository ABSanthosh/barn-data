Brad Arnold of 3 Doors Down performs during The Better Life 20th Anniversary Tour at Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre on August 07, 2021 in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Scott Legato/Getty Images Brad Arnold, singer and drummer of the Mississippi-based rock band 3 Doors Down, announced Wednesday (May 7) that he’s been diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. “Got some not-so-good news for you today,” Arnold said in a video posted to social media, revealing that he’s fighting clear cell renal cell carcinoma and that it’s metastasized into his lung. Due to Arnold’s diagnosis, the band is canceling its upcoming summer tour, with dates that were set to begin next week in Florida and continue through August. Arnold said that he’s leaning on his faith through the medical battle (“I have no fear. I really, sincerely am not scared of it at all.”) and asked for prayers from his fans. “I’d love for you to lift me up in prayer any chance you get. And I think it’s time for me to go and listen to ‘It’s Not My Time’ a little bit.” Trending on Billboard He also referenced the 2008 3 Doors Down song “It’s Not My Time” in his Instagram caption, writing: “Thank you for all the memories so far. Now, I believe ‘ITS NOT MY TIME’ is really my song. This’ll be a battle so we need our prayers warriors! Thank y’all for being the best fans in the world. We love y’all!” Arnold’s comments section was filled with a who’s who of his musical peers, with Creed’s Scott Stapp writing, “If anyone has the FAITH and STRENGTH to face this fight, it’s YOU brother. … I think I can speak for all of us, we are lifting you up in prayer right now believing without doubt for your total healing! I love you bro.” Stapp and his band Creed were set to hit the road with 3 Doors Down in July and August for the “Summer of ’99” North American tour, also including Daughtry, Big Wreck and Mammoth. Chris Daughtry also hit Arnold’s comments section, writing, “Sending you love my brother,” while Gavin McGraw added: “May God bless you brother. Showing us how to conquer the darkness with light.” “Man I hate to hear that Brad. Praying for ya brother,” Jason Aldean wrote, with Sara Evans saying, “Will be praying for you every day!” During their early 2000s heyday, 3 Doors Down scored 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including three top 10s: 2000’s “Kryptonite” (No. 3 peak), 2003’s “When I’m Gone” (No. 4) and 2003’s “Here Without You” (No. 5). They also scored two No. 1 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart: 2005’s Seventeen Days and a self-titled project in 2008. Arnold has received three Grammy nods for his work with 3 Doors Down: best rock song for both “Kryptonite” and “When I’m Gone” and best rock performance by a duo or group with vocal for the latter song.
