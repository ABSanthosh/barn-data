  "text": "Last week, Beyoncé had numerous items stolen—including USB drives with her unreleased music, video footage for her concerts, and past and future set lists for her ongoing tour in support of Cowboy Carter—when thieves allegedly broke into a vehicle used by the pop star’s choreographer and one of her dancers in Atlanta, Georgia, reports local news station WSB-TV 2. The break-in took place on the evening of July 8, and Atlanta police have since issued an arrest warrant for a suspect, according to a spokesperson for the local police department.Christopher Grant and Diandre Blue told Atlanta police that they parked a rental black Jeep Wagoneer in the Krog Street Market parking deck just after 8 p.m. When they returned to the SUV, they noticed that the back lift gate was broken and their two suitcases had been stolen, the incident report states. In addition to their personal belongings like laptops, Apple earbuds, and designer clothing, the report notes that some of Beyoncé’s tour materials were taken during the break-in.“Mr. Grant advised he was also carrying some personal sensitive information for the musician Beyoncé,” reads the incident report. “He advised he was her choreographer and Mr. Diandre Blue was a dancer for her and that her hard drives for her upcoming show in Atlanta were stolen also. The hard drives contained watermarked music, some un-released music, footage plans for the show, and past and future set lists.”Detectives at the scene dusted the SUV for fingerprints, and reported that surveillance cameras captured the break-in. Investigators also used the Apple app Find My to locate the missing AirPods, which led them to an undisclosed location where the earbuds were pinging from.Beyoncé is still scheduled to wrap up her multi-night run at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium tonight. It’s the last of her originally scheduled tour dates behind Cowboy Carter, although she’s since added two concerts at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium on July 25 and 26. Each night of the tour has featured an extensive stage setup and setlist.Read about Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter cut “II HANDS II HEAVEN” in “The 100 Best Songs of 2024.”",
