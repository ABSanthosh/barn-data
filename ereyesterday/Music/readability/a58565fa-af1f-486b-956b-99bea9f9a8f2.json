Photo: Kathy Thomas Photo: Kathy Thomas WME has added veteran music agent Lance Roberts as a partner in its Nashville-based country music division. In addition to more than three decades of experience in the business, he brings artists including Chris Janson, Craig Morgan, Parmalee, Easton Corbin, Ian Munsick and Sammy Kershaw to the WME fold. Roberts began his career at the Bobby Roberts Company in 1992, where he worked with artists including Country Music Hall of Fame members John Anderson, Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Waylon Jennings. Trending on Billboard Following the acquisition of the Bobby Roberts Company by The Agency Group (TAG) in 2014 (TAG was acquired by UTA the following year), he spent nearly a decade building and expanding his clients’ touring opportunities. “I’m very grateful for the opportunity to join the amazing team at WME,” Roberts said in a statement. “They have been extremely supportive of this next chapter in my career, and I am looking forward to working with the most talented agents in our industry.” “Lance is known in our industry as an agent with a keen eye for talent and a commitment to nurturing and growing artists’ careers,” added Joey Lee, co-head of WME’s Nashville office. “We are excited to have his expertise at WME.” “Most of us have known and respected Lance’s work for many years and are thrilled he is joining our team,” added Becky Gardenhire and Jay Williams, co-heads of WME’s Nashville office, in a joint statement. “He’s creative, strategic, and passionate and his knowledge will benefit all of our artists.” Daily newsletters straight to your inbox Sign Up More From Pro",
