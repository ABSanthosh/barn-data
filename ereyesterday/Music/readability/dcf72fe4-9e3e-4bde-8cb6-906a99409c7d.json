  "text": "Before officially hitting tonight’s prestigious carpet, Rihanna revealed that she’s pregnant with her third child with A$AP Rocky, her partner, at the 2025 Met Gala. The pop singer showed off her baby bump in a matching gray set while holding an umbrella and fur stole in a photograph by Miles Diggs, as shared over Instagram. When an interviewer on Met Gala carpet asked Rocky what outfit Rihanna would wear tonight, the rapper replied, “Rihanna’s outfit tonight is... I don’t know, whatever’s just gonna really cover her baby bump, you dig?”Rihanna and Rocky welcomed their first child, RZA Athelston Mayers, in 2022 and their second kid, Riot, that following year. It seems the celebrity couple have a penchant for breaking the big news at high-profile events; Rihanna revealed her previous maternity status while headlining the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show, taking a moment to grin wildly while showing off her sophomore baby bump.A new album has been on the back burner for Rihanna for nearly a decade now, as Anti came out back in 2016. However, she swears her still-unreleased LP is on the way. In that interim, she did perform her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever single “Lift Me Up” at the 2023 Oscars and earned a nomination for Best Original Song. (The Academy Award went to M. M. Keeravani and Chandrabose for RRR’s “Naatu Naatu” instead.)Technically, new Rihanna music is coming soon to a theater near you. She voices Smurfette in the upcoming animated movie Smurfs, which includes a Rihanna cover of Belinda Carlisle’s 1987 pop classic “Heaven Is a Place on Earth” and promises more “new music” from her, too. That hits theaters on July 18.Turns out Rocky’s got his eyes on the silver screen as well. Earlier today, news broke that he was cast in the upcoming Spike Lee film Highest 2 Lowest. That crime thriller, which also stars Denzel Washington and Jeffrey Wright, is a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa’s classic High to Low and is set in modern-day New York. Rocky’s most recent studio album, Testing, came out back in 2018.Read about Anti in “The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s.”",
