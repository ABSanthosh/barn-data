  "text": "Unk, the Atlanta rapper known for the hits “Walk It Out” and “2 Step,” has died, according to social media posts from his wife, Sherkita Long-Platt, and one of his former labels, Big Oomp Records. A cause of death was not provided. Unk was 43 years old.Unk, or DJ Unk, was born Anthony Leonard Platt in Atlanta, Georgia. He broke out, in the early 2000s, as part of his city’s snap music scene. His first hit, “Walk It Out,” stood alongside other totemic snap and crunk tracks like “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” Lil Jon’s “Get Low,” Yung Joc’s “It’s Goin’ Down,” and D4L’s “Laffy Taffy.”“Walk It Out” and follow-up single “2 Step” both featured on Unk’s debut album, 2006’s Beat’n Down Yo Block! Both tracks got all-star remixes, too, with Jim Jones and Outkast’s André 3000 and Big Boi hopping on “Walk It Out (Remix),” and Jones, T-Pain, and E-40 featuring on “2 Step (Remix).”Unk released just one more major album in his lifetime, 2008’s 2econd Season. Project Pat, Ray J, Ying Yang Twins, Sean Kingston, and more featured on the album, and it performed well commercially. It did not, however, have the same cultural impact as Unk’s debut, with its single “Show Out” not reaching the heights of “Walk It Out” or “2 Step.”“Please respect me and my family,” wrote Sherkita Long-Platt on social media. “I just lost my husband and my kids just lost their father. Our life will never be the same. I LOVE YOU ANTHONY FOREVER.”“DJ Unk was not just a legendary DJ, rapper and producer, but a true cornerstone of our label and the imprint that he left globally will be cherished forever,” Big Oomp Records shared. “Hit songs such as ‘Walk It Out’ and ‘2 Step’ have left an indelible mark on the industry, and his legacy will continue to inspire artists, DJs, and fans alike for years to come. His energy, creativity, and commitment to the craft will never be forgotten.”",
