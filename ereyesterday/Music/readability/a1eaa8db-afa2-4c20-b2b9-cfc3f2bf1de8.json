  "text": "Copenhagen’s own hardcore outfit Eyes (feat. members of LlNN) seems to be marking a new era. Recently signed to Prosthetic Records, the band is set to release their third album, Spinner, on April 25, and the album's lead single, \"Better\" is out now. \"Better\" is described by vocalist Victor Kaas as a declaration of growth and resilience: \"‘Better’ is in many ways a statement of intention for the album. It’s short and intense. The song is about wanting to improve as a musician, as a band, as a person. But no matter what your intentions are, there will always be someone who will put you down. Sometimes that person is yourself.\" Spinner finds Eyes moving away from the noisy edges of their earlier work, they aimed to embrace a more structured and dynamic approach in the studio and capture a punchier and groovier sound. However, just judging by this track, the music feels equally suffocating and gutpunching. According to Kaas, the record unfolds like a \"fictional early 80's anime episode,\" interweaving a cast of characters that reflect different facets of his own experiences. In his own words: \"Spinner tells a loose story through the lens of a fictional early 80’s anime episode and introduces a cast of various characters throughout the 10 songs, all based on situations, states of mind, and personality traits of myself.\"\" \"The album is heavily inspired by manga author Asano Inio and his works Goodnight Punpun and Dead Dead Demon’s De De De Destruction. Spinner was written as a way to process traumas throughout youth and early adulthood and leave them behind in a world similar to what I used to escape to,\" he added. Preorder the album here.
