  "text": "Sade Adu has unveiled a new music video for “Young Lion,” her recently-released single from the compilation album, TRAИƧA. Marking her first new song in six years, “Young Lion” is a heartfelt tribute to Sade’s trans son, Izaak, celebrating who he is with loving lyrics like, “Run down the hills of your dreams/ Arms open wide, feel the light/ Shine like a sun.” Accordingly, the new music video features footage of Sade and Izaak during Izaak’s youth, eventually cutting to modern-day footage of the two together. Watch it below. The single first arrived in September, and was included on the sample EP of TRAИƧA tracks, TRAИƧA: Selects. The full project was put together by the label Red Hot, and features contributions from many artists, including André 3000, Sam Smith, Jeff Tweedy, Faye Webster, Moses Sumney, Adrianne Lenker, Allison Russell, Fleet Foxes, Beverly Glenn-Copeland, Green-House, Clairo, Bartees Strange, and many more. It was released this past Friday and can be streamed below. Prior to this, Sade has kept a low profile in recent years. According to a press release, she agreed to participate in TRAИƧA after one of the project’s organizers, Massima Bell, wrote her a letter thanking her for her longtime public support of her son. In other Sade news, she announced the vinyl reissue of all six of her albums this past April.",
