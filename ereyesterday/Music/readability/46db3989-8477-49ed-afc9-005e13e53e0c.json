  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Podcasts | More Platforms Chris Diamantopoulos isn’t your average actor. He’s a human chameleon with a penchant for playing charismatic rogues who shouldn’t win but somehow make you root for them anyway. Speaking with Kyle Meredith, Diamantopoulos is as animated in conversation as he is on screen, riffing on everything from his latest project, The Sticky — a darkly comedic take on Canada’s infamous maple syrup heist the premieres December 6th on Prime Video — to his unexpectedly costly adoption of a 130-pound tortoise. Listen above or wherever you get your podcasts. “The Sticky has got everything — crime, comedy, and a weirdly gooey underbelly of Northern Canada,” Diamantopoulos says with a grin. Based on a real 2011 heist involving millions of dollars’ worth of maple syrup, The Sticky is a quirky, Coens-esque series where Diamantopoulos plays a bumbling Bostonian trying to outwit fate. “He’s a guy who walks around like he’s the leading man in his own movie,” Christopher explains, “but that thin veneer cracks fast, and hilarity ensues.” Co-starring Margot Martindale and a pitch-perfect Jamie Lee Curtis, the show’s oddball ensemble and sepia-toned vibe make it a must-watch holiday binge. Beyond The Sticky, Diamantopoulos reflects on a career spanning 40 years, from his turn as Robin Williams in Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork \u0026 Mindy to voicing Mickey Mouse. “I’m obsessed with finding a character’s voice — it’s the gateway to everything,” he says. Listen to Chris Diamantopoulos talk about The Sticky, becoming the voice of Mickey Mouse, and lots more in the new episode above or by watching the videos below.
