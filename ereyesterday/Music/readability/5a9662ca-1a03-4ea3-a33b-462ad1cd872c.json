  "text": "Ready for the wildest story of the week? The wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner was shot by police and charged with attempted murder after firing her gun during a manhunt for three individuals involved in a high-speed chase in Los Angeles on Tuesday. According to TMZ, officers were searching for three suspects in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon when they encountered Shriner’s wife, Jillian Lauren, who reportedly emerged from her home with a gun in hand and began firing. It’s unclear why exactly she was firing, but TMZ speculates that she may have been targeting one of the suspects. After Lauren disregarded multiple commands to drop her weapon, officers fired at her, striking her in the shoulder, TMZ reports. She retreated into her house and remained inside for 30 minutes before eventually surrendering to police. She was subsequently charged with attempted murder. As for the actual suspects, one individual was apprehended, while the other two remain at large. Shriner’s band Weezer is currently scheduled to play Coachella this weekend.",
