  "text": "Iron Maiden will hit the road in 2025 (and 2026) for their Run For Your Lives tour, and apparently it's gonna feature some pretty deep cuts. According to Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson in a brand new video update, Iron Maiden is planning on \"doing stuff we've never, ever done before\" live. It's also worth mentioning again that Iron Maiden's 2025 and 2026 treks will be their first without drummer Nicko McBrain, who stepped down from the band's live shows earlier this month. McBrain has been replaced live by Simon Dawson of British Lion, the side project of Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris. \"Hello folks. This is my tour pass for 2024. That'll get me anywhere in 2024, but I don't need that anymore now because 2025 is gonna be something special,\" said Dickinson. \"Not just because of the tour pass. Honestly, we are pushing the boat out with the tour. Not that I need to tell anybody, 'cause basically the tour is sold out already. \"So for those of you who have bought tickets, which is like all of you, it's gonna be really, really cool. I'm really looking forward to it. We're gonna be doing stuff we've never, ever done before, and it'll be a setlist for the ages. So, I'll see you there. And it's not gonna stop in 2025. It's gonna roll into 2026 'cause there's parts of the world that we need to get to that we can't get to in 2025. So there you go.\" Want More Metal?
