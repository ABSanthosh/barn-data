  "text": "Country icon Waylon Jennings passed away in 2002, but even two decades later, his legend lives on. Today, Son of Jessi/Thirty Tigers proves as much, as the label has announced the release of a previously unheard album from Jennings, Songbird, which is due out October 3rd. Stream the first single, a cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “Songbird,” below. Songbird boasts recordings from sessions that took place between 1973 and 1984, all produced by Jennings and his longtime drummer and co-producer Richie Albright. The included cuts also feature the country superstar’s famed backing band, The Waylors. Shooter Jennings, Waylon’s son and three-time Grammy Award winner, ultimately compiled the songs and mixed their final versions. Pre-orders are available now. “What became very apparent to me was that my dad was recording constantly with his band The Waylors between tours,” Shooter said in a statement. “Just having won the David-and-Goliath battle against RCA for creative control and artistic freedom, Waylon was awarded the ability to record his music on his terms in his own studios, with his touring band, and without label oversight and without any outside influence [and] there was just so much inside, my mind was blown! These weren’t demos, these were songs that were cut with the intention of releasing, and as time went on, not all of them found places on the albums that Waylon and the Waylors were releasing at the time.” The project serves as the first of three newly unearthed albums from Jennings, though further details about the two forthcoming releases have yet to be revealed. “Songbird is the beginning of Waylon’s return to the modern world,” Shooter added. “This is the first of three gifts from me to you: the fans that have kept my father’s voice, songs and legacy alive all these years. The next few years are going to be full of some of the most exciting musical moments that the world never knew they were going to hear. I hope that these records bring the kind of joy to you that they have brought me.” Jennings’ rendition of “Songbird” puts a honky-tonk spin on Fleetwood Mac’s original tune. Complete with wailing (or Waylon-ing) pedal steel lines, a plotting rhythm section, and pretty harmonies, Jennings’ powerhouse voice ultimately brings the whole thing together. Watch the music video for the newly released song below. Songbird Artwork:",
