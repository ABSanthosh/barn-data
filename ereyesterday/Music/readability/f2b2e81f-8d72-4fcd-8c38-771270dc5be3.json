  "text": "Colombia’s Bomba Estéreo have joined forces with Venezuelan band Rawayana to form the new group Astropical. They’ve released their debut single, “Me Pasa (Piscis),” along with a nautical music video that finds the supergroup partying on a boat—until it sinks. Watch the visual, directed by Edgar Esteves, Paola Ossa, and Ana Peralta Chong, below.Astropical consists of Bomba Estéreo’s Liliana “Li” Saumet and José Castillo on keyboards and guitars, alongside Rawayana’s singer Alberto “Beto” Montenegro and drummer and multi-instrumentalist Andrés “Fofo” Story. The new group is gearing up for a yet-to-be announced international tour. Until then, Astropical will perform at the Vive Latino festival, in Mexico City, on March 16.“Astropical embodies an energy that already preceded us and needed to materialize,” Saumet said in a press release. “This is a very important time on a political, cultural, and environmental level. We need melodies and lyrics such as these ones as a way of shepherding the moment.”Montenegro added, “Musically, I feel like I’m the son of Bomba Estéreo. When Li called us, it was like a dream come true. I’ve been thinking for so long that I treasure the sonic universe that Bomba Estéreo navigates.”Rawayana recently won their first Latin Grammy, and they are currently nominated for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album at the 2025 Grammy Awards. They are set to perform at Coachella this April.",
