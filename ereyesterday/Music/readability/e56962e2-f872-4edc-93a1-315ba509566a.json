The sequel to 2010’s Tron: Legacy and third film in Disney’s Tron franchise “follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings,” according to a press release. Jared Leto and Greta Lee appear in the trailer, which also includes the first taste of Nine Inch Nails’ score for the film. Watch it below.Directed by Joachim Rønning, Tron: Ares stars Evan Peters and Jeff Bridges alongside Leto and Lee, and will hit theaters October 10. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have scored over a dozen films as a duo—including their recent work on the Luca Guadagnino films Queer and Challengers, the latter of which won them a Golden Globe—but this represents their first work for film under the Nine Inch Nails moniker. The movie will also feature new original songs from the band, who are set to hit the road this June for their first headlining tour in three years.Revisit our reviews of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ The Social Network OST and Daft Punk’s Tron Legacy OST.",
