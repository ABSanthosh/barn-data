  "text": "Actor Mickey Rourke has been kicked off Celebrity Big Brother UK after making a series of inappropriate comments and engaging in unacceptable behavior towards fellow contestants. Rourke, 72, was initially issued a warning earlier this week after using a homophobic slur towards pop singer JoJo Siwa, who is gay. Now, he’s been booted from the series outright after using language that was considered “threatening and aggressive” following a disagreement with reality TV personality Chris Hughes. “Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior,” a spokesperson for Celebrity Big Brother UK confirmed in a statement. The incident with Siwa also prompted actress Bella Thorne to come forward with her own allegations against Rourke, revealing details of her troubling experience working with him on the 2020 film Girl. Thorne described it as “one of the all-time worst experiences,” accusing Rourke of multiple on-set misconducts, including a disturbing incident involving a metal grinder that allegedly caused injury. “I had to work with this man — in a scene where I’m on my knees and with my hands zip tied around my back. He’s supposed to take a metal grinder to my knee cap and instead he used it on my genitals through my jeans. Hitting them over and over again. I had bruises on my pelvic bone,” Throne alleged. Rourke’s representatives denied Throne’s claims in a statement, writing: “We are aware of the deeply troubling statements made by Bella Thorne regarding her experience on set with Mr. Rourke during the production of a past film. These allegations are extremely serious. Mr. Rourke adamantly denies any intentional misconduct. He has not been contacted previously with any claims of this nature and was unaware of any discomfort expressed by Ms. Thorne at the time. Out of respect for all parties involved and in light of the gravity of the claims, Mr. Rourke will refrain from commenting further at this time. He is prepared to cooperate fully with any appropriate inquiry. We extend our support to all professionals who deserve to feel safe and respected in their workplace.”",
