  "text": "A statement from Nationals Park says \"Shakira's full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time\" after Fenway Park \"complications.\" Shakira performs during the 2025 Sueños Festival at Grant Park in Chicago on May 24, 2025. Courtesy of Sueños/@sflynnphoto On Friday (May 30), a day after her show at Boston’s Fenway Park was canceled, Shakira has called off her WorldPride Welcome Concert set for Saturday night at Washington, D.C.’s Nationals Park. The news was shared on social media accounts for Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball’s Washington Nationals. “Due to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira’s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park on Saturday, May 31,” the ballpark statement reads. “As a result, the D.C. show has been canceled. Despite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.” Trending on Billboard The statement says refunds will be “issued automatically for Ticketmaster and Nationals.com purchases,” while anyone who bought tickets through third-party resellers should contact their point of purchase directly. The original post on Nationals Park socials included a separate statement from Shakira in both English in Spanish, reading: “Due to circumstances beyond my control, I am sad and heartbroken that I will not be able to be in Washington, D.C. with you tomorrow. I hope that I can come back to D.C., as soon as I am able. Meanwhile, please know that I am eternally thankful for your unconditional support.” That Shakira statement has since been deleted from the Nationals Park accounts and does not appear on any of Shakira’s social channels. Shakira‘s show scheduled for Thursday night at Boston’s Fenway Park was canceled just hours before it was set to start “due to unforeseen circumstances,” the stadium announced on social media. Live Nation later told Billboard in a statement: “During a routine pre-show check, structural elements were identified as not being up to standard, so the shows were canceled. All team members are safe.” While Shakira’s WorldPride Welcome Concert has been canceled, the WorldPride D.C. website assures that all other events will continue as planned.
