  "text": "Trapt frontman Chris Taylor Brown pretty much tanked his band about five years ago when he simply could not stop making dumb comments on the Internet – look no further than his views of pedophilia. Instead of just saying \"hey, I kinda goofed,\" Brown and Trapt have gone harder on their opinions, which hasn't been going great. This includes being booted from Louder Than Life 2024, at which point Brown commented: \"So Trapt being invited to play Louder Than Life festival in Louisville in Sept made some extreme leftist troll's heads explode. How pathetic are these people? I wonder how many of these accounts who run these ops are paid by the US govt in some way? \"All along the media (govt propaganda mouthpiece) has tried to 'destroy trapt' after 2020 and they have failed miserably. We went from 5 million monthly listeners to over 8 million now, 150 million plus streams a year for 2 years in a row and about 250 shows since early 2022. Shows have been amazing! Let's hope the people at Louder Than Life stay strong in the face of these lying trolls and their operation…\" Trapt also quietly got booted from their upcoming tour with Powerman 5000, but fear not! Trapt is still out there on the road, playing to any venue that doesn't participate in \"cancel culture\" apparently. Are you seeing a trend here? You should be seeing a trend here by now. In a new video, Brown said some of Trapt's shows were cancelled due to \"cancel culture\" but… I mean, look at the size of the crowd they're playing to in the below video. Surely this had nothing to do with ticket sales, right? \"What's up? Trapt is in Pittsburgh tonight, and we had a couple venues cave to cancel culture in the last few weeks, and it was going to be really hard to do the show. But we decided we're doing it no matter what. So we got a stage together. We got this venue, called The Building For Arts And Culture. We got some Bud Lights, White Claw, you know, and just everything that our fans are going to need to have a great time with us tonight. \"And I want to thank all the venues out there — it's probably about 35 out of like 39 shows that didn't cave to cancel culture. The couple venues that did in Pittsburgh… You know, they, trolls, they say… they lie about things I said five years ago and the joke I made — I did apologize for that, for my insensitivity, for anybody who was who's hurt by that. But, yeah, we moved on. Our fans have moved on. There's a few people who haven't, but yeah, we did this show… We were, we were gonna do this show no matter what. \"And I just want to thank Chase — he helped us put this together — and he also was like, 'We're doing it no matter what.' They're not stopping the show. It's gonna be a great night tonight, and we'll show you all the footage after we get done.\" Want More Metal?
