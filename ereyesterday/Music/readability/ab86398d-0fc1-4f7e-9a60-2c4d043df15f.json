  "text": "Billboard just confirmed suspicions an hour ago that Sleep Token is #1on the US Billboard Top 200 this week with the debut of their fourth record, Even In Arcadia. When considering streaming and physical record sales, Sleep Token achieved the equivalent of 127,000 album units, setting a record for the amount of vinyl sold by a hard rock band. A service named Luminate has been used to track album and vinyl sales since 1991, and Billboard reports that Sleep Token's Even In Arcadia beat the record for most vinyl sold by a hard rock band with 47,000 vinyl sold in the US. The record they beat was only set a mere two weeks before with theatrical-metal band Ghost's Skeletá which sold 44,000 vinyl. And Billboard writer Keith Caulfield also included that Sleep Token also broke the record for \"largest streaming week ever for a hard rock album.\" Yes, it's the band's first release on a major-label, so many would have expected the record to do well. But, the mainstream reception has been rather staggering as the record appears to be reaching outside of the metal sphere while also solidifying their rapidly growing metal-fanbase. So, you've gotta give credit where it's due. Even In Arcadia has not only pushed boundaries and shattered barriers, but broke records, and whether or not you're a fan of the new Sleep Token record, it's a helluva feat for an anonymous modern metal band.
