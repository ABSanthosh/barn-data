  "text": "Morgan Wallen has announced a new three-day music festival taking place on the Gulf Shores of Alabama dubbed Sand in My Boots, and excitement is so high that when tickets went on sale, they sold out in just two hours. But if you’d still like to head to sandy, sunny Alabama in May to hear sets from Wallen, Post Malone, Brooks \u0026 Dunn, Diplo, and more, you’re in luck. There are still ways to get tickets to the festival. Read on for more details. Get Sand in My Boots Fest 2025 Tickets Here How Can I Get Sold-Out Tickets to Sand in My Boots 2025? Organizers of Sand in My Boots said they were “blown away” with how quickly tickets sold-out. However, tickets can still be purchased via StubHub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. StubHub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. What Is Sand in My Boots Festival?

In addition to cross-genre musical performances, the festival will also feature a number of “experiences curated by Wallen himself that reflect the things he loves and highlight the one-of-a-kind white sand beaches of Gulf Shores, AL,” including beach clubs, a tailgate, a hair salon, a graduation ceremony, a wedding chapel, and more. Read more here. Who Is Headlining Sand in My Boots Fest 2025? Top-billing for Sand in My Boots festival 2025 will include Wallen himself, who’s 2021 hit, “Sand in My Boots,” serves as the festival’s eponym. Joining him will be Post Malone — who released his first country album, F-1 Trillion, this past August — as well as Brooks \u0026 Dunn and Wallen’s longtime collaborator, Hardy.
