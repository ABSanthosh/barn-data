  "text": "The hitmaker equals Lil Wayne's count for the silver medal. Chris Brown Courtesy of Live Nation Chris Brown bags a milestone 20th No. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with “Residuals.” The single crowns the list dated Dec. 7 and was the most-played song on U.S. monitored mainstream R\u0026B/hip-hop radio stations in the tracking week of Nov. 22 – 28, according to Luminate. “Residuals” ascends from the runner-up spot after a 4% gain in weekly plays. As the track rises, it knocks GloRilla’s “TGIF” to No. 2 after the latter completed a 10-week nonconsecutive reign, including the last nine straight frames. The new champ is Brown’s second chart-topper on the radio ranking in 2024, after “Sensational,” featuring Davido and Lojay, ruled for one week in March. With a 20th No. 1, Brown matches Lil Wayne’s career count for the second-most among all acts since the chart began in 1992. The pair trail only Drake, who sits in first place with 46 leaders. Here’s a recap of the artists with the most No. 1s on Mainstream R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Airplay: Trending on Billboard 46, Drake20, Chris Brown20, Lil Wayne17, Usher13, Beyoncé “Residuals” appears on the deluxe edition of Brown’s latest studio album, 11:11, and became a fan favorite, with many clips shared of Brown performing the track during spring and summer tour stops. Rising attention sparked its debut on the multi-metric Hot R\u0026B Songs chart in April before its official push to radio began in mid-August. The single received a Grammy Award nomination for the upcoming ceremony for best R\u0026B performance. Brown first topped Mainstream R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Airplay when he and Johnta Austin featured on Bow Wow’s “Shortie Like Mine” on the Dec. 9, 2006, chart. His first champ in a lead role came exactly a year later – on the Dec. 8, 2007, ranking – when “Kiss Kiss,” featuring T-Pain, captured the summit.
