  "text": "Yaeji has returned with the new song “Pondeggi,” featuring E Wata. The title is a nod to beondegi, the Korean street food comprised of silkworms, and inspired its Andrew Thomas Huang–directed music video in which she transforms into that very bug. Through a series of hand claps—a reference to the schoolyard game that influenced the track’s beat—with co-producer E Wata, Yaeji’s silkworm self tries to “save the metamorphosis cycle from being disrupted by a techno-witch,” played by Uhm Jung-hwa. Watch it below.Yaeji has been on a roll with new songs lately. She teamed up with Girl Talk and T-Pain for the single “Believe in Ya” this past January, and collaborated on the track “Pink Ponies” with Teddy Geiger in November. She also shared two other solo songs, “Booboo” and “Easy Breezy,” that arrived with their own videos.Revisit Pitchfork’s 2023 profile “Yaeji Gets Ragey,” plus the review of the artist’s debut studio album, With a Hammer.",
