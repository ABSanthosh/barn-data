  "text": "The new song from the Adam Levine-fronted band and BLACKPINK star received nearly 58% of the vote. Adam Levine and Lisa Art Streiber/NBC via Getty Images; Cindy Ord/VF25/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Maroon 5 and LISA‘s “Priceless” tops this week’s new music poll. In a poll published Friday (May 2) by Billboard, music fans chose the collaborative song from the Adam Levine-fronted band and BLACKPINK star as their favorite new release of the week. “Priceless” brought in nearly 58% of the vote, beating out new releases from artists like KATSEYE (“Gnarly”), TOMORROW X TOGETHER (“Love Language”), Ed Sheeran (“Old Phone”), Key Glock (Glockaveli), and more. Released after days of teasing from both Maroon 5 and LISA, the funk-infused pop track sets the stage for the band’s upcoming eighth studio album, while also serving as a bold punctuation mark on the BLACKPINK member’s debut solo project, Alter Ego. Trending on Billboard “Priceless” marks Maroon 5’s first collaboration with a K-pop artist and features a guitar-driven sound that nods to the band’s early 2000s roots, complemented by LISA’s confident rap verse. The accompanying music video, shot on 35mm film and directed by Aerin Moreno, takes visual inspiration from the movie Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Smith. “It’s just a guitar-based song, which we haven’t really done in so long,” Levine said in a statement. “It happened first for us while recording the album. I think it’s the purest, and we’re so happy to have LISA on it.” He added, “The guitar intro is literally me playing into an audio message on my iPhone with an unplugged guitar. I actually got a little emotional recording it because it felt like reconnecting with our roots — which a lot of our fans have been asking for. It’s been over 20 years, so I think it’s time for that sound to return.” “Priceless” follows Maroon 5’s 2021 album, Jordi, which peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. For LISA, the track builds on her expanding portfolio of international collaborations as a solo artist, following the success of her 2021 debut single “LALISA,” and her continued work with BLACKPINK. This week’s poll runner-up was KATSEYE’s experimental pop anthem ‘Gnarly,’ which earned 23% of the vote. It marks the group’s first new release since 2024’s “Touch.” Check out the full results of this week’s poll below and visit Billboard’s Friday Music Guide for more must-hear releases.
