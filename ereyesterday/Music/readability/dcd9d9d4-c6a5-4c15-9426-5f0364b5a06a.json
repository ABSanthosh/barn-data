  "text": "Carrie Underwood’s love for heavy music was front and center on Sunday’s episode of American Idol, where she joined in on a couple of nu-metal classics from Korn and Drowning Pool. Underwood, a former American Idol champion and first-time judge on the singing competition, is no stranger to the hard rock scene, as the country-pop superstar previously shared the stage with Guns N’ Roses and recorded a song with Papa Roach. When an 18-year-old contestant that just went by the name Insite auditioned with Korn’s “Freak on a Leash,” Carrie was shown mouthing and singing along to the words. Insite’s pitchy impression of Korn singer Jonathan Davis didn’t wow the judges, so Underwood asked if there was something softer he could sing. Of course, Insite offered up Drowning Pool’s “Bodies,” which prompted Underwood to get up out of her chair and join the young metalhead. Underwood delivered the song’s famous count-off as Insite screamed his way through the chorus. Meanwhile, Underwood’s fellow judges got into it, as Lionel Richie played air guitar while Luke Bryan engaged in some serious headbanging. When it was all said and done, Insite won over the judges, who all voted “yes” to sending him on to the Hollywood rounds. Drowning Pool must’ve taken notice, because the band just posted a new lyric video for “Bodies” roughly 24 years after its release. Check out the American Idol performance and the lyric video below.",
