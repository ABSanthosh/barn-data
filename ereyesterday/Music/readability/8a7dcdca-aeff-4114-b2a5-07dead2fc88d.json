  "text": "Welcome back to Fan Chant, a weekly column for K-pop fans, stans, and newbies alike. This week, yet another record from the one and only Park Jimin . If you enjoy what you’re reading, feel free to subscribe to my companion newsletter to get Fan Chant delivered right to your inbox each week! Jimin of BTS has secured another major Billboard milestone. Despite being mid-military enlistment (under 100 days to go, people!) Jimin has now become the record-holder for K-pop soloist with the longest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. His 2024 release, “Who,” has sat on the famed chart for 32 consecutive weeks, passing the stretch of 31 weeks held by PSY’s  “Gangnam Style.” As “Who” continues its reign, it ties the record held by BTS as a whole — “Dynamite” danced along the Billboard Hot 100 for 32 weeks, too. After all, Jimin is no stranger to Billboard success, both within BTS and as a soloist; in 2023, he became the first K-pop soloist to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100, a feat repeated by Jung Kook with the release of “Seven” with Latto. “Who” was the focus track off Jimin’s incredibly bright sophomore album, MUSE, which was part of another remarkable chart moment of its own: Upon release, even with Jimin already enlisted, the project sailed to No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. This marked the first time that two albums out of South Korea notched the top two slots in the chart’s 80-year history. Revisit the accolade Jimin earned for “Who” in the 2024 K-Pop Yearbook, and stream the video below if you’ve never witnessed the leather jacket greatness on display.
