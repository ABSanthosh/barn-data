Matty Healy performs with The 1975 on Day 3 of Leeds Festival 2023 at Bramham Park on Aug. 27, 2023 in Leeds, England. Matthew Baker/Getty Images Glastonbury headliners The 1975 have a new live album that’s now streaming and available to pre-order on limited edition vinyl. Still… At Their Very Best (Live From The AO Arena, Manchester, 17.02.24) was released without promotion on Friday, March 7, a day after the Glastonbury 2025 lineup was announced with The 1975 in the Friday night headliner slot at the U.K. festival in June. The vinyl version of the live album, recorded during one of the band’s hometown shows in Manchester last year in the midst of their Still… At Their Very Best Tour, is pressed on triple clear vinyl, according to its listing on The 1975’s website. It has an estimated May 30, 2024 release date via Dirty Hit. Trending on Billboard The Still… At Their Very Best live set from Manchester follows the 2023 release of a live recording from The 1975’s prior tour, At Their Very Best, recorded at New York City’s Madison Square Garden in 2022. Still… At Their Very Best kicks off with a smooth opening of songs performed from the band’s latest studio album, 2022’s Being Funny in a Foreign Language. “Don’t be nostalgic. Do not. Don’t do it,” frontman Matty Healy says to the crowd as the set list shifts to “A Change of Heart,” from The 1975’s No. 1, and highest-charting, album on the Billboard 200, 2016’s I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It. With Friday’s unveiling of Still… At Their Very Best live, The 1975 also debuted a band logo that’s stylized in an updated font on social media. They’ve seemingly been working on new music for an album that might be called God Has Entered My Body, with fans hopeful for a preview at Glastonbury, if not ahead of their performance at the fest. “Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know anything about legacy, or the future. I don’t know if anyone’s gonna remember us. But if we are remembered, I hope it’s for this,” Healy says on the newly-released live set, during a heartfelt introduction to one of the band’s early standouts, the carthatic “Robbers,” from their 2014 self-titled debut. The first half of the 30-track album culminates on romance from the mainstage, with the gut-punch trio of “Fallingforyou,” “About You” and “When We Are Together,” before moving on to the “Consumption” section of the concert, an acoustic B-stage performance that starts with media noise and, at this show in Manchester, had Healy singing “I Like America \u0026 America Likes Me,” and 1975 tourmate Polly Money taking lead on the group’s Phoebe Bridgers duet “Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America.” “Hello,” Healy says here. “I haven’t really planned what to say. But I suppose this bit is supposed to be a bit awkward, ‘cause it’s just me under a spotlight.” “You shouldn’t feel sorry for me, I’m a nepo baby,” he jokes. “My mum [Denise Welch] was on Coronation Street so they gave me a No. 1 album in America. That’s the way it works! That’s the way it works, baby!” He tells the Manchester audience, “We’re very proud to be from here, and, um, sorry if I ever let you down or whatever.” The latter half of the live album has The 1975 letting loose — “Let’s play a banger and then we can start taking requests, all right?” Healy says in banter with fans ahead of “It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You) — and celebrating being there together, with the singer voicing sentiment for bandmates/best friends Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald and George Daniel. “I’m gonna be serious right now for a second,” Healy says at one point. “There’s so many f—ing solo artists, and the reason is, is because all media is now individualized. So you won’t watch the TV with your mates or your mum and dad, you’ll watch your own media. So like every band, when they start with young people, they all have an Instagram, so there’s always this incentive of the individual behind this kind of group. Whereas we started when we were 13, so the idea of the individual wasn’t even a thing. Trust me. Bind together and make something bigger than yourself. That’s my advice — in all stuff. I’d be f—ed without them — I mean you know that! I’d be f—ing selling roses on Brent Cross Roundabout.” The 1975’s latest live release closes with anthemic sing-alongs “Love It If We Made It” and “Sex,” leading to the high, screaming energy of “People.” See the full track list below: “The 1975”“Looking for Somebody to Love”“Happiness”“Part of the Band”“Oh Caroline”“I’m In Love With You”“Change of Heart”“An Encounter”“Robbers”“Me”“You”“Fallingforyou”“About You”“When We Are Together”“Consumption”“I Like America \u0026 America Likes Me”“Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America”“If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know)”“TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME”“It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You)”“Menswear”“Chocolate”“The Sound”“Somebody Else”“Guys”“I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)”“Love It If We Made It”“Sex”“People” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
