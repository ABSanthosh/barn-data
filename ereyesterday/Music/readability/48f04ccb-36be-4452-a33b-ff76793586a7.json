  "text": "Julien Baker, producer and multi-instrumentalist Calvin Lauber, Northern Irish folk artist Soak, and Alaskan singer-songwriter Quinn Christopherson have released a new cover of the Belle and Sebastian favorite “Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying.” They recorded the cover for the Red Hot Organization’s star-studded Transa compilation. Listen to the new song below.“J.B. approached me with the idea to do this cover, and to bring in Soak and Quinn Christopheron, both friends of ours and people we’ve played shows with, as guest features on the song,” Calvin Lauber explained of the new cover’s creation. “However, we found ourselves all on opposite sides of the country (J.B. in L.A.; myself in Nashville; QC. in Alaska; and Soak in the UK) so this song ended up being produced totally remote Postal Service–style, sending ideas back and forth over email. J.B. sent me her draft of the song and a rough arrangement and asked me to do my thing with it. I ended up playing drums, guitar, synth, pretty much everything laying around my studio. It’s a pretty dense track; I think we both wanted it to feel dynamic but big at the same time. We were both pretty inspired by ’80s new wave and, like, Interpol for this one.\"Transa is out November 22. It features contributions from Sade Adu, Lauren Auder, Beverly Glenn-Copeland, and many others.",
