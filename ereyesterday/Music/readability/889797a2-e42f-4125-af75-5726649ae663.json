  "text": "Unk, the Atlanta rapper best known for his mid-2000s hit singles including “Walk It Out” and “2 Step,” has died at the age of 42. News of Unk’s passing was shared by his family on social media Friday afternoon. A cause of death was not immediately known. Born Anthony Leonard Platt and hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Unk got his start spinning records as part of a DJ crew called the Southern Style DJs. He was eventually signed to Big Oomp Records, where he found success as a solo artist. His 2006 debut album, Beat’n Down Yo Block!, boasted the snap hit “Walk It Out,” which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on the US rap charts. Another album track, “2 Step,” touched No. 24 on the Billboard 200 and No. 4 on the US rap charts. Unk’s second album, 2008’s 2econd Season, featured the the top 20 rap hit “Show Out” and collaborations with Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat, and Ying Yang Twins, among others. His musical output slowed after a heart attack in 2009, but he continued touring and releasing singles until 2015.",
