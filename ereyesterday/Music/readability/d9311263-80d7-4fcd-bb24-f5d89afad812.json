According to an SEC filing, McCarthy sold 15,033 stock options for $9.49 million on Monday (February 10).The filing shows that, in all, he cashed out just upwards of $49 million in Spotify shares in six transactions over the past three months.McCarthy served as CFO of Spotify until early 2020, when he stepped down after five years at the Sweden-headquartered company, taking a seat on the board at the time.He served as CEO of exercise equipment and media company Peloton from 2022 to 2024, ushering it through a difficult post-pandemic period for the company.Spotify’s share price closed at USD $623.15 on Tuesday (February 11), up over 165% over the past 12 months. SPOT’s closing price the previous day (Monday, February 10) was $637.69, an all-time high.SPOT’s market cap value as of 4pm ET on Tuesday (February 11) was around $125 billion. By comparison, Universal Music Group, the largest of the three major music companies, is currently valued at around $51 billion. Spotify’s latest spike in shares came after the company reported its first full year of profitability in 2024, with an operating income of $1.5 billion.In November, MBW reported that Spotify leadership had sold some $1 billion in company stock year-to-date. That included $556.8 million sold by co-founder Martin Lorentzon, who remains the company’s largest shareholder.As of that point, co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek had sold $283 million in Spotify stock. In December, Ek sold another $93 million in shares, and just since the start of the year, SEC filings show he has cashed in another $94.4 million in shares, including some $37 million last week (February 5). Ek has been selling shares in tranches of 60,000, with each tranche garnering a higher selling price than the last.Here are the other directors and execs who have sold Spotify shares since the start of 2025, according to SEC filings:Gustav Soderstrom, Chief Product and Technology Officer, sold 52,031 stock options on February 7 for $32.68 million.Katarina Berg, Chief Human Resources Officer, sold 19,656 stock options on February 5 for $11.89 million.Alex Norstrom, Chief Business Officer, sold 12,000 stock options on February 7 for $7.52 million.Mona Sutphen, a director on Spotify’s board, sold 3,031 stock options on February 5 for $1.89 million.Christopher Marshall, a director on Spotify’s board, sold 2,520 shares on February 10 for $1.57 million.Eve Mothner, Spotify’s General Counsel, sold 1,019 stock options on February 5 for $632,000.Music Business Worldwide",
