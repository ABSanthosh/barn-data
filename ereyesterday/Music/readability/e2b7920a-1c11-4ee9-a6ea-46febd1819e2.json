  "text": "After Joey Jordison was fired from Slipknot in 2013, he went on to launch a few new musical projects including Vimic – a band featuring Jordison, Kalen Chase on vocals, Jed Simon and Kris Norris on guitar, Kyle Konkiel on bass, and Matthew Tarach on keyboards. As the Kickstarter campaign to finally release Vimic's debut album winds down (you can still pre-order here), Vimic has announced a special tribute show to Jordison happening later this year. Vimic will play the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles, CA on October 3 and will be hosted by the oey Jordison Charitable Fund. The show also features Jordison's Murderdolls bandmate Wednesday 13 opening plus some very special guests. Tickets go on sale on June 6. As for Vimic and their unreleased album, that story goes pretty far back. Vimic released their first single \"Simple Skeletons\" on May 6, 2016, followed by a second single \"She Sees Everything\" on May 16 and a third called \"My Fate\" on June 3. Norris eventually left the band, Steve Marshall joined, and Vimic was set to release their debut album Open Your Omen in 2019. Then Open Your Omen producer Kato Khandwala died in 2018, everyone else in the band got busy, and Jordison died in 2021. \"After years of working to secure the rights to the music, the Jordison Family Estate is releasing Open Your Omen independently to get the album into the hands of the fans that have been asking for it for years,\" reads a description on the Kickstarter via Jordison's estate. \"Joey didn't do anything small. We want to release this album the way he would have wanted; with the designs he was so actively involved with creating for the CD, double LP, merch, and with the support of his fans to make the biggest splash we can upon release. We have added personal items of Joey's to help raise the money needed to manufacture and distribute physical product, market the album, and host a night to remember as VIMIC reunites to perform an event honoring Joey's legacy.\" Want More Metal?
