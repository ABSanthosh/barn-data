  "text": "RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan celebrated his 56th birthday in style, spending it at a Phish show in Boulder, Colorado. Phish, who took the stage on Saturday, July 5th at Boulder’s Folsom Field after a rain delay, were playing a cover of Talking Heads’ “Crosseyed and Painless” when drummer Jon Fishman shouted out the Wu-Tang leader with a hearty “Happy birthday, RZA!” Get Phish Tickets Here Trey Anastasio added to the festive mood by playing a quick rendition of “Happy Birthday” on his guitar, calling out “Wu-Tang forever” in celebration of RZA’s big day. RZA received the VIP treatment after the show, going backstage to spend time with Phish, where he got to check out Anastasio’s guitar up close and take a photo with the band. See the Instagram shots (including Anastasio quoting Wu-Tang’s “7th Chamber – Pt. II” for the caption) and a fan-shot video of Phish wishing RZA a happy birthday below.
