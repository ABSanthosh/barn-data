  "text": "Fieldy isn't going back to Korn anytime soon, but he also doesn't seem to be strictly ruling it out either. For those unaware, Korn bassist Fieldy stepped down from the band in 2021. Fieldy was replaced by Ra Diaz in a live setting and hasn't returned to the band since. Despite being on hiatus from Korn, Fieldy did record bass on the band's 2022 record Requiem. Then after a period of silence, Fieldy all of a sudden surfaced earlier this year in an interview with Basement Talk. Fieldy revealed that has hasn't spoken to his Korn bandmates since 2019 – which is odd considering he stepped down in 2021 – and added \"They're truckin'. They're a machine. They're going. It's insane. It's dope that they can keep on going like that. It's cool to see them keep on going, but I need to chill.\" Now in a new interview with The Dr. Greenthumb Show, Fieldy was asked by a fan if he was going back to Korn anytime soon. Fieldy didn't completely rule it out, but said: \"I won't be playing any shows, but we'll see what tomorrow brings. You never know. But for now, no. I've got plenty to do.\" At this point, who knows what's going on behind the scenes with Korn and Fieldy. Though the real question is if and when Korn does another record, will Fieldy or Diaz play bass on it? I guess we'll find out. It'd be a huge shame if Korn and Fieldy officially parted ways, as Fieldy's bass playing and super clanky tone is iconic (despite being pretty divisive among bassists). Want More Metal?
