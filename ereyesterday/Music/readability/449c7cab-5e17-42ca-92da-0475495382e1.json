Chappell Roan performs on Day 3 of Outside Lands Festival 2024 at Golden Gate Park on August 11, 2024 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/FilmMagic Chappell Roan is offering a playful apology after criticizing a past holiday-themed episode of Glee. On Monday (Dec. 23), the 26-year-old pop star shared her thoughts on the musical comedy’s season 3 episode “Extraordinary Merry Christmas” in a series of posts on an Instagram account run by Roan and her creative director, Ramisha Sattar. “This is the worst episode of Glee I’ve ever seen,” Roan said, holding back a laugh while the 2011 episode played in the background. “I’m turning it off. I hate it,” she added, hitting pause on the remote. “Next.” Explore See latest videos, charts and news Shortly after, Roan returned with another video, this time sitting in front of a brightly lit Christmas tree. In the playful clip, she jokingly apologized to Glee fans while someone off-camera pointed a pair of sharp scissors at her. Trending on Billboard “This is my apology video for the Gleeks that I offended. I am so sorry,” Roan began. “I love every episode of Glee, and I love Kurt and Blaine,” the singer-songwriter added, referencing Chris Colfer and Darren Criss’ characters on the Fox series. This isn’t the first time Roan has shared her thoughts on Glee, which aired from 2009 to 2015. In fan-captured video from a live performance earlier this year, the Grammy-nominated artist revealed she had recently started watching the show. “I just started watching Glee. I’m on season 2,” Roan told the audience. “It took me like three full times to try to watch Glee, ’cause I was like, ‘This is stupid as f—.’ And then I was like, ‘Lean into it.’” Meanwhile, Roan is closing out 2024 at No. 1 on Billboard‘s Top New Artists chart, marking a year of breakout success on both the Billboard 200 albums chart and the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. Her debut full-length album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in August. Additionally, she scored seven entries on the Billboard Hot 100, including her first top 10 hit with “Good Luck, Babe!” which reached No. 4. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
