  "text": "Architects is back with a new record called The Sky, The Earth \u0026 All Between due out February 28, and a violent-as-hell new single \"Whiplash\" streaming right now. The single was produced by ex-Bring Me The Horizon keyboardist Jordan Fish, while the video was shot in Slovenia and directed by Specter Berlin. \"We've long admired Director 'Specter' for his work with Rammstein so it was a pleasure to bring him in for this song to create something for us,\" said Architects drummer Dan Searle. \"His visual concept gave life to the words in a unique way that may create more questions than answers, but sometimes that's the beauty in art. \"'Whiplash' marks the beginning of a new era for Architects. It is a song that speaks of tribalism, of a deepening chasm that lies between human beings based simply on opinions and beliefs. It gave us the opportunity to explore these concepts in a way that we haven't before and for the first time in a while it gave us fuel to write something truly ferocious.\" Vocalist Sam Carter added: \"We're so happy to be back and to be releasing a song that we love so much, it's us at our very best and we think it'll be a fan favourite.\" Once you get your head back on straight after that end breakdown, you can pre-order The Sky, The Earth \u0026 All Between here.
