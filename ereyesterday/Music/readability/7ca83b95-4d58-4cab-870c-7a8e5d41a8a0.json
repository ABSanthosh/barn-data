  "text": "\"I don't believe in retirement. Retirement is something that's been forced onto people; I don't believe musicians are allowed to retire,\" Kirk Hammett told Metal Hammer in their newest print issue. And that's understandable given his outlook on his career and the fact that \"playing music is a gift, a blessing and a privilege. I love what I do and it's magic. It helps people.\" And Hammett feels like he \"can't walk away from that.\" Having joined the band over 40 years ago, the question of retirement feels only natural. Hammett is creeping up on what would usually be retirement age – he's 62 – but that isn't stopping him: \"Leaving Metallica is not an option,\" Hammett said when also speaking to the The Telegraph, because he's still fired up. And when talking to Rolling Stone this past March, he addressed the query about his age creeping towards that of retirement, and he simply brushed it off: \"I'm 62 years old, and a lot of artists, when they're 62 years old, they're winding things down. I feel like I'm still climbing the summit. Haven't reached the top of the mountain yet. Haven't reached the capstone of the pyramid. Still going up, man. I still feel like I'm improving and I still have a lot of creative momentum and energy in me. And that was clearly evident when Hammett confirmed that he had \"767 new [riffs] for the next [Metallica] album,\" but that he didn't \"foresee [them] starting the next album for at least another year,\" due to their current touring commitments in 2026.
