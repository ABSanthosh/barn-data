Marcus Ingram/Getty Images Rick Ross visited Graceland recently and was left both impressed and inspired as he realized he and the King of Rock and Roll had a lot in common. He posted a series of videos on his Instagram Story as he narrated the footage in proper Rick Ross fashion. “Elvis Presley’s own Graceland is behind me,” he said in his signature voice. “I just went on a tour throughout the crib. Very enlightening. Elvis was a legend, an icon.” In another video, as he walked towards the late rocker’s private planes named after his late daughter Lisa Marie and his song “Hound Dog” in another video, the talked about the similarities between himself and Presley, saying, “As we all could see, me and Elvis had a lot of things in common. His ranch is Graceland, mine is Promise Land. I love the planes; I love he was a hustler. He was a man amongst the people.” Adding, “I’m just doing something different today.” Explore Explore Rick Ross See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Promise Land, the Miami’s rapper’s home located in Fayetteville, Georgia and previously owned by boxing legend Evander Holyfield, is a 45,000 square foot mansion that sits on 235 acres of land that Ross famously tends to himself. The former champ notoriously spent around $1 million a year on upkeeping the grounds. Graceland, on the other hand, is 17,552 square feet on about 14 acres of farmland, according to the estate’s website. Elvis purchased the property in 1957 for $102,500. In turn, Ross paid $5.8 million for Promise Land back in 2014. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
