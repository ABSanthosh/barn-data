  "text": "The song is the band's fourth No. 1 in a row and 11th in all. Papa Roach Bryson Roatch Papa Roach extends its career-best streak of No. 1s on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Airplay chart, lifting a place to No. 1 on the March 22-dated survey with “Even If It Kills Me.” The track is the band’s fourth No. 1 in a row and 11th overall. The group’s streak dates to the one-week reign of “No Apologies” in 2022, followed by triumphs for “Cut the Line” in 2023 and “Leave a Light On” in 2024. The Jacoby Shaddix-led band takes over sole possession of the 10th-most No. 1s in the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart’s 44-year history. The act first reached the chart with the No. 4-peaking “Last Resort” in 2000 and first led with “Lifeline” in 2009. Trending on Billboard Most No. 1s, Mainstream Rock Airplay:20, Shinedown18, Three Days Grace15, Five Finger Death Punch14, Foo Fighters14, Metallica13, Godsmack13, Van Halen12, Disturbed12, Linkin Park11, Papa Roach Concurrently, “Even If It Kills Me” holds at its No. 4 high on the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock \u0026 Alternative Airplay chart with 3.6 million audience impressions, up 7%, in the week ending March 13, according to Luminate. It’s tied for the band’s best placement on the ranking (which began in 2009), alongside “Kill the Noise” (2021) and “No Apologies.” The song is also bubbling under Alternative Airplay, where the band boasts 20 career entries, including the No. 1 “Last Resort.” On the most recently published, multimetric Hot Hard Rock Songs chart (dated March 8, reflecting data Feb. 28-March 6), “Even If It Kills Me” ranked at No. 7, after hitting No. 4 in February. In addition to its radio airplay, the song earned 634,000 official U.S. streams in that span. “Even If It Kills Me” is currently a standalone single. The band’s most recent album, Ego Trip, debuted at its No. 6 peak on the Top Hard Rock Albums chart in April 2022 and has earned 180,000 equivalent album units to date.
