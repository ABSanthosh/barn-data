  "text": "Rosie O’Donnell has followed the lead of fellow talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and moved overseas following Donald Trump’s return to the White House. In a new video posted to TikTok, O’Donnell confirmed that she and her son, Clay, recently moved to Dublin, Ireland. “Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that’s what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child. And here we are,” she said. “I miss many things about life there at home and I’m trying to find a home here in this beautiful country and when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she added. “It’s been heartbreaking to see what’s happening politically and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know.” A longtime critic of Trump, O’Donnell has repeatedly sparked his ire over the years. As he returned to his presidency, O’Donell said, “I just felt like we needed to take care of ourselves and make some hard decisions and follow through.” She concluded her video by encouraging her followers to “protect your sanity as much as you can, and try not to swim in the chaos if possible… And I am hoping that we can turn things around, counting on you, all of you, to do what’s right. And I think deep down inside, we all know what that is.” @rosie hello all – here’s whats been going on folks – sending love ❤️- follow me on substack – link in my bio #bewell #speakkindlytoyourself #dourbest ♬ original sound – Rosie ODonnell",
