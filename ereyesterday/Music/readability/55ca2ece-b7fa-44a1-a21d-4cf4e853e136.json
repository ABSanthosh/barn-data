  "text": "Krysten Ritter is returning to the role of Jessica Jones in the upcoming second season of Daredevil: Born Again, Variety reports. “I’m so excited to bring back this iconic character, and without giving too much away, there is much more in store for Jessica Jones. This is going to be an incredible season!” the star said at Disney’s upfront presentation to advertisers on Tuesday. Ritter first played Jessica, a hard-boiled private detective who’s more than a little ambivalent about her superpowers, in Marvel’s Jessica Jones. The series, along with the original Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, was part of the Defenders universe originally produced for Netflix (and now streaming on Disney+). Most recently, Ritter starred in the Orphan Black spinoff series Orphan Black: Echoes, which was canceled after Season 1. Read our interview with her here.",
