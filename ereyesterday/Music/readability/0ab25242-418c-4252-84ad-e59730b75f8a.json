  "text": "Slaughter To Prevail has finally announced their highly anticipated new album Grizzly, due out July 18. Alongside the announcement comes a new single \"Russian Grizzly In America\" featuring a towering animatronic bear and UFC heavyweight fighter Alexander Volkov… because of course it is. \"I think this is the best album we have ever written,\" said Slaughter To Prevail vocalist Alex Terrible. \"We put so much effort into it. We spent a lot of time on every detail and really poured our souls into the songs. In the past, we were always rushing to finish albums and just releasing whatever we had. This time, we took our time, worked carefully on each track, and made sure everything was exactly how we wanted it. Hopefully it was all worth it.\" Grizzly features previously Slaughter To Prevail singles \"Conflict,\" \"Viking,\" \"1984,\" \"Behelit,\" and \"Kid of Darkness.\" Grizzly's tracklist is: Banditos Russian Grizzly In America Imdead (feat. Ronnie Radke) Babayka Viking Koschei Song 3 (feat. BABYMETAL) Lift That Shit Behelit Rodina Conflict Kid of Darkness 1984 Pre-orders are available here.
