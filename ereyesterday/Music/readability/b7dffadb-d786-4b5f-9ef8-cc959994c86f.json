  "text": "Beyoncé has mapped out a major world tour in support of her Grammy-winning country album, COWBOY CARTER. The 22-date run will be Bey’s first outing since her 2023 “Renaissance World Tour” and will see the superstar playing stadiums throughout the US as well as stints in London and Paris. Find more details below, including how to get tickets, as well as the full list of Beyoncé’s tour dates, pre-sale information, and other details.

In the US, there will also be exclusive pre-sales for Citi and Verizon Up customers beginning February 12th at 12:00 p.m. local time. Tickets will go on sale to the general public beginning Friday, February 14th at 12:00 p.m. local time via Ticketmaster.

StubHub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. What Is Beyoncé’s “COWBOY CARTER” Tour? The 2025 “COWBOY CARTER” tour serves as Beyoncé’s seventh solo headlining tour and arrives in support of her expansive 2024 album, COWBOY CARTER. The outing begins with a quartet of opening shows at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium from April 28th to May 7th. She’ll continue with a pair of shows in Chicago and four shows in East Rutherford, New Jersey throughout the month of May before heading across the pond for four London shows beginning on June 5th. After two dates in Paris in late June, Bey will make her way back stateside for two shows in Houston followed by two performances in Washington D.C. on July 4th and 7th. The tour will end with a pair of concerts in Atlanta on July 10th and 11th. See Beyoncé’s full list of tour dates below. Though the album was released back in March, Bey held off on live shows until her hometown NFL Halftime Performance at the Houston Texans vs. Baltimore Ravens game on Christmas Day. There, she debuted several tracks from COWBOY CARTER for the first time and teased an announcement for January 14th. However, the 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles forced her to postpone the announcement to Saturday, February 1st, when she then confirmed the tour. She provided details and tour dates for the “COWBOY CARTER” run just hours after winning her first-ever Album of the Year award at the 2025 Grammys; Bey also won Country Album of the Year for COWBOY CARTER, making her the first Black artist to ever win in the category. Meanwhile, we were also big fans of COWBOY CARTER, naming it one of the best albums of 2024. Who Is Opening for Beyoncé on Her “COWBOY CARTER” Tour? No openers have been listed yet for Beyoncé’s “COWBOY CARTER” run, but we’ll update this post as soon as she announces support acts. What Is the Setlist for Beyoncé’s “COWBOY CARTER” Tour? The tour hasn’t properly began yet, so Bey’s setlist for the tour is still unknown. However, she debuted “16 CARRIAGES,” “BLACKBIIRD,” “YA YA,” “My House,” “JOLENE,” “LEVII’S JEANS,” and “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM” at her Christmas Day NFL Halftime Show performance, along with a medley of COWBOY CARTER tracks “SPAGHETTII,” “RIIVERDANCE,” and “SWEET ★ HONEY ★ BUCKIIN'” with Shaboozey. Her “Renaissance World Tour” featured almost the entirety of RENAISSANCE on the setlist each night, but she still peppered in beloved older tracks like “Crazy in Love,” “Love on Top,” “I Care,” “Partition,” “Drunk in Love,” “Diva,” and “Formation.” What Are Beyoncé’s 2025 Tour Dates?
