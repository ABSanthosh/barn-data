  "text": "Swift was shown on the stadium screen at the Superdome, seated next to Ice Spice. Ice Spice and Taylor Swift attend the Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jamie Squire/Getty Images Taylor Swift showed up to the 2025 Super Bowl and seemingly faced a rude reaction from the crowd. The pop star arrived at New Orleans’ Superdome on Sunday (Feb. 9) in a white blazer over a tank and denim shorts, and white over-the-knee boots. She held a small red handbag serving as a pop of “Chiefs” red, in support of the Kansas City team and Travis Kelce. By her side was her friend Ice Spice, making it the second year for the rapper to attend the big game with Swift. While the two were seated at the game, which was broadcast on Fox, the Jumbotron camera panned toward Swift and other celebrities seen at the stadium. When the shot stopped on Swift, an apparent wave of “boos” could be heard — perhaps from Eagles supporters. Swift’s reaction: a side eye, and a slight wince and laugh. In other words, she knew to shake it off. See it here. Trending on Billboard Plenty of fans had her back, including tennis pro Serena Williams, who wrote on X, “I love you @taylorswift13 dont listen to those booo!!” Swift’s attendance at the Super Bowl for the second year in a row was expected, as she’s dating Kelce, tight end for the Chiefs. This year’s game has the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Philadelphia Eagles. Though Kelce is the NFL star, the football player says he looks up to Swift’s athleticism. “Her work ethic, what I saw on that tour last year, was pretty remarkable,” he said at a pre-Super Bowl press conference. “It was the dancers, the band, the singers, it was everybody involved, and it was an absolute machine. It was something I could admire watching and take a lot of notes from.” The night before the Super Bowl, Swift was spotted in New Orleans rocking a Penny Lane-style coat while going out to dinner with Danielle and Alana Haim, as well as Kylie Kelce. Swift’s parents were also seen at the restaurant. The Haim sisters were also seen at the game Sunday. Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department finished 2024 as the most popular album of the year in the U.S., according to music data tracking company Luminate. Her record-setting Eras Tour, which wrapped in December, grossed more than $2 billion and sold over 10 million tickets.
