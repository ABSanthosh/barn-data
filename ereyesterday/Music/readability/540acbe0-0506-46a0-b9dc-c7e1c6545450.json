  "text": "Oli Sykes of Bring Me The Horizon took to social media just a few hours ago (11th of May) with a video post with the simple caption 'dois' to announce he and his wife were expecting for the first time. In the video, we see Oli Sykes and his wife, Alissa Salls, sitting at a dining table with their dog, opening two cardboard containers. Within those containers are cupcakes, which revealed that Sykes and Salls are expecting both a girl and a boy. Salls bit into the pink cupcake and Sykes bit into the blue. Salls also took to her social media to post a photo with her new pregnancy bump, which is coming only a few short months after the release of her first single in three years earlier this year, \"CONCRETE.\" Her three-year absence was due to what what Alissic, Salls' artist name, described as a \"corporate curse\" that she fell under after the viral success of her string of solo singles in 2022, which she is now \"free\" of. Alissic followed up \"CONCRETE\" four weeks ago with \"MOONBEANS.\" Sykes appears to be taking some time off before Bring Me The Horizon hits the road in September for their US tour as things remain quiet on the BMTH front. Congratulations to the happy couple, and wishing a safe and healthy for Salls' pregnancy. Want More Metal?
