  "text": "As we approach the release of Something Beautiful, the ninth studio album from Miley Cyrus, the singer has unveiled her next single. Titled “End of the World,” the escapist tune is an invitation to relinquish responsibilities and dance it out in the face of inevitable apocalypse. “End of the World” follows two existing looks into Something Beautiful; last week, Cyrus shared the album’s title track, along with a cut called “Prelude,” both of which were accompanied by glossy music videos. The visual for “End of the World” continues the sparkled showgirl aesthetic established in “Something Beautiful,” “Prelude,” and the album’s cover art, showing the singer rolling and dancing in a glitzy green stage-ready dress. “Reinforcing the project’s immersive, operatic approach, these songs mark the beginning of a carefully structured journey,” she confirmed in a statement posted to social media. “End of the World” is certainly closer to pop than the explosive, horn-laden “Something Beautiful” or the minimalist spoken word offering “Prelude.” “Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world,” she sings over a bright, upbeat chorus. We’ll do our best, Miley, but it is a little difficult, considering the everything around us everywhere all the time. So far, these three offerings confirm the expansive, operatic angle Cyrus said she was targeting with this project, dipping into different sub-genres and embracing the diverse nature of her skill set. Something Beautiful arrives in full on May 30th and is now available for pre-order.",
