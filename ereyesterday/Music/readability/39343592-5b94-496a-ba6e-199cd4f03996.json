However, the DJ is retaining a prominent role as Founding Partner and Creative Advisor, Pophouse tells us, and he \"will remain very involved in supporting Axtone’s talent as well as continuing to release new material.\"Axtone has released many celebrated songs that are now considered generational dance anthems, including \"Tell Me Why\" by Supermode, a side project of Hedfors and Swedish House Mafia's Steve Angello; and \"In My Mind\" by Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl, which received an Axwell remix and garnered the producer a 2011 Grammy nomination. These cultural touchstones, part of a broader catalog spanning over 200 tracks, have cemented the imprint as a cornerstone of progressive house music.Pophouse's move to acquire Axtone is part of its broader mission to grow and invest in brands with global potential and deep ties to dance music culture. The company in 2022 purchased a majority stake in Avicii's music catalog and is now developing a musical about the late EDM icon, whose life was recently explored in a high-profile Netflix documentary.Follow Axtone Records:X: x.com/axtoneSpotify: open.spotify.com/user/axtoneFacebook: facebook.com/axtoneTikTok: tiktok.com/@axtonerecordsSign up for our NewsletterSign up for the latest news, exclusive giveaways \u0026 more.",
