Billboard is launching its inaugural ‘Global No. 1s’ series, an initiative to spotlight top-charting artists from around the world. Billboard has partnered with its ten-plus global editions to showcase distinct voices topping their local charts around the world in exclusive interviews. Stay tuned throughout the week to discover who’s No. 1 in the UK, Brazil, Korea, and more! KUN: Hi everyone, I’m KUN. First of all, I want to thank everyone who loves this song. For me, it’s more of an encouragement. It makes me want to work harder to create a better next piece. To produce better work to give back to everyone. Actually, at the beginning, I wanted to connect time and space and relate it to art and fashion. So I thought for a long time about what kind of word could represent this kind of imagery, this kind of artistic conception. In the end, the word “Afterglow” appeared in my mind. Also because during different flights, in the process of traveling, including during drives, we often see such scenery. It also represents a momentary feeling. So in the end, I used this theme, and it combined it with imaged in my mind of models walking the runway, with lights flashing continuously, time changing, people changing. This general feeling of my own imagined sensation, so I created this song. The process was actually quite fun and quite fast. We first decided on this theme. Then we played around freestyle, and the concept came together quickly. Actually, with “Afterglow,” I have started incorporating some soul elements and rock elements. For the production, we used a blend of modern and classic elements. So basically, this song marks the beginning of a creative approach I really resonate with. Keep watching for more!",
