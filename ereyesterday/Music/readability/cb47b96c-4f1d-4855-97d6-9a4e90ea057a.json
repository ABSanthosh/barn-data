  "text": "Soundgarden's surviving members guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist and vocalist Ben Shepherd, and drummer and vocalist Matt Cameron played a benefit show for the Seattle Children's Hospital on December 14 at the The Showbox in Seattle, WA. The trio played the show as Nudedragons, an anagram of Soundgarden they've previously used, along with vocalist Shaina Shepherd. You can check out the full show above, of which two songs also featured Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan! The set was: \"Hunted Down\" \"Outshined\" \"Flower\" \"Kickstand\" (w/ Duff McKagan) \"Kick Out The Jams\" (MC5 cover) (w/ Duff McKagan) This isn't the first time Soundgarden has reunited in a post-Chris Cornell world, either. Soundgarden played a Chris Cornell tribute show in 2019, as well as performed \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\" with Brandi Carlile in 2021. As it stands right now, Soundgarden's final material with Cornell is gridlocked as the band dukes it out with Cornell's estate. Want More Metal?
