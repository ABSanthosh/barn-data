  "text": "Tory Lanez is in the midst of a 10-year prison sentence after being found guilty of shooting Megan Thee Stallion. Earlier this month, Lanez was stabbed 14 times at a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi. The attack has led to renewed interest in Lanez’s situation, with some suggesting there is new evidence to be heard in the case and others—including Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Drake—pushing for his pardon.Alex Spiro, an attorney for Megan Thee Stallion, recently rejected the idea that the trial was unfair, and Megan herself has now released a new statement about Lanez. “At what point are yall gonna stop making me have to re live being shot BY TORY,” she wrote on TikTok. “Ain’t no new fucking evidence yall been saying the same shit for years.” Find her full statement below.Megan Thee Stallion testified in the 2022 trial of Tory Lanez that resulted in the Canadian rapper and singer being found guilty of felony assault with a semiautomatic handgun; carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle; and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. As she noted in her statement, Lanez declined to testify, something he apparently regrets.Prior to her testimony, Megan Thee Stallion wrote a New York Times op-ed about the situation, and she also discussed the shooting in an interview with Gayle King. Additionally, she previously called out Drake for lyrics that suggested she lied about being shot.Drake and Tory Lanez are both natives of Ontario, Canada, and the musicians feuded for a number of years before reconciling in 2017. Since Lanez’s conviction, Drake has continued to support his compatriot’s release from prison.Megan Thee Stallion:At what point are yall gonna stop making me have to re live being shot BY TORY !? At what point are Tory and yall FANS gonna stop lying ? Like how much is the check to keep harassing me? Why is this happening EVERY DAY?? One min him/ yall said I was never shot now yall letting him play in yall face AGAIN and say I was shot but it wasn’t him oh okay… ?! I’m sick of this shit LEAVE ME TF ALONE!!!!
