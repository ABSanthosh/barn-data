  "text": "Looking for a relaxing way to kick off your Saturday evening? Look somewhere else. Looking for a track to ruminate in some unaddressed feelings? GHOST BATH might be a good soundtrack for your evening. GHOST BATH's newest single, \"Vodka Butterfly,\" is a rather harrowing track with its deathcore vocals, bleak lyrics, ferocious blast beats, and impressive ability to incorporate some aspects of melody and electronics into their work. Definitely for fans of Deafheaven, GHOST BATH are no strangers to crafting a gut-wrenching track. And their newest single off Rose Thorn Necklace – the band's newest record, as of yesterday – is absolute proof of that.
