  "text": "It appears that the common belief that Snoop Dogg will do anything for a check is true. On Friday night, the rapper performed at the Crypto Ball ahead of Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The ‚Äúexclusive social event‚Äù was held in Washington DC and was intended to praise Trump‚Äôs embrace of cryptocurrency, with tickets allegedly going for upwards of $5,000 a pop. Notably, the event coincided with Trump‚Äôs launch of his own meme coin. Press supposedly wasn‚Äôt allowed at the Crypto Ball, but videos of Snoop DJing at the event have surfaced online, showing him rapping to a tuxedo-clad MAGA crowd. In addition to his own songs, Snoop appeared to have performed several covers, including Journey‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô.‚Äù Watch videos of the moment below. Of course, many have responded online with dismay that Snoop ‚Äî who was once such a critic of Trump that he depicted himself shooting a clown resembling the President-elect in a music video ‚Äî has now cozied up with the incoming administration. But if you look at Snoop‚Äôs track record, it doesn‚Äôt come as a huge surprise. Last year, he even told The Times that he had ‚Äúnothing but love and respect for Donald Trump,‚Äù explaining, ‚ÄúHe ain‚Äôt done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me.‚Äù Snoop isn‚Äôt the only musician who has signed on to Trump‚Äôs inaugural celebrations, following news from earlier this week that Carrie Underwood, Village People, and Nelly would all perform at events. In other Snoop news, he recently teamed up with Dr. Dre for the duo‚Äôs first full-length collaborative album, Missionary, which arrived last month.
