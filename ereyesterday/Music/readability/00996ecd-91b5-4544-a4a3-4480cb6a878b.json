  "text": "The new trailer for Zach Cregger’s Weapons, told from the point of view of a child, sets up an eerie tale about a small community thrown into turmoil after 17 schoolchildren from a single class go missing one night. No one knows what happened, or who’s to blame — though their teacher Miss Gandy (Julia Garner) is immediately under suspicion. Cregger (who got his start as a founding member of the Whitest Kids U’ Know comedy troupe) madea big splash with the critically acclaimed Barbarian — in his review for Consequence, Clint Worthington declared it “your new bonkers horror favorite of 2022.” According to Deadline, the competition around acquiring Weapons was so intense that when Jordan Peele’s production company lost the bidding, Peele fired his long-time management team. Cregger, meanwhile, will be moving onto a new take on Resident Evil with his next movie, due out in 2026. With a cast also including Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan, Weapons looks poised to be a spooky summer treat. The new movie is set to premiere August 8th, 2025 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.",
