  "text": "On the heels of headlining sets at Coachella 2025, Green Day will be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The unveiling ceremony is set for May 1st at 11:30 a.m. PT and will be streamed live on the Walk of Fame’s website. “The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is honored to welcome Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool to the Hollywood Walk of Fame,” Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said. “Green Day’s music has not only inspired generations but also served as the soundtrack to our lives.” Ryan Reynolds and Serena Williams (the latter who is a massive fan) are set to speak at the event, with Matt Pinfield hosting. Get Green Day Tickets Here After the star is revealed, fans and tourists can find Green Day’s at 6212 Hollywood Boulevard, conveniently outside of record store Amoeba Music, and near fellow Californian alt-rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers’ own star. Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool will head out on tour soon, mostly playing festival slots in Europe, though a handful of shows are happening in the US, Canada, and Brazil. Their next show is on May 16th at Daytona Beach’s Welcome to Rockville. Green Day’s 14th album Saviors was released in 2024 via Reprise. It was nominated for three awards at the 67th Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album. On May 23rd, the band will release a deluxe edition of Saviors, which includes seven extra tracks.
