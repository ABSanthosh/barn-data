  "text": "The pair's March 21, 2026, show will mark the first stadium comedy show since 2022, amid a recent boom in the live comedy space. Courtesy Image Comedians Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias and Jo Koy are playing SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on March 21, 2026, officials with the stadium announced earlier this week. Titled One Night Only, the show is produced by comedy promoter Icon Concerts and is anticipating a paid attendance of up to 55,000 fans. “We’ve been wanting to do this show for a number of years but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve been able to make everyone’s schedule work,” explains Mike Bernal, vp of Icon Concerts. “Gabriel [Iglesias] is an L.A. hometown hero and Jo is nearby in Seattle and has a huge following in Southern California and sold thousands of tickets in the market.” Bernal says initial presales have been strong, noting “they are selling evenly across all price points, which is what we like to see.” Ticket prices start at between $69 to $113 for the 500 section, $138 to $170 for the midlevel 300 section and $326 for floor seats. Trending on Billboard One Night Only will mark a rare feat in the live comedy business; in the last decade, only a handful of comedians have headlined stadiums, including, most recently, Iglesias, who headlined Dodger Stadium in 2022. In 2015, Kevin Hart performed before an audience of more than 53,000 fans in Philadelphia, and last year, comedian Nate Bargatze became one of the first comedians to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single year, earning $82 million from an impressive 148 shows. Comedy is a bigger business than ever in the live space. The top 10 comedy tours generated a combined $397.3 million from 4.3 million fans last year, according to Billboard Boxscore. That’s up 52% from 2023, when the top 10 generated $260 million from 2.9 million fans. Iglesias came in at No. 3 on Billboard’s Top Comedy Tours chart for 2024, grossing $42.8 million with 603,000 tickets sold from 124 shows. Koy ranked No. 10 on the chart, grossing $26 million from 83 shows in front of 368,000 fans. “Since day one, I wanted to bring comedy to the stadium,” explains Adolfo Romero, vp of programming and booking for SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, which is home to a number of smaller venues, including a new Belgian spiegeltent built for CineVita, the cinema live experience first announced in December. “We’re at a 750-person capacity in the spiegeltent,” Romero said. The complex also includes the 6,000-capacity YouTube Theater, which has played host to a number of comedy events, including the 2024 Black Comedy Festival. “We want to make sure that when people go out to see comedy, it’s not just the Laugh Factory or in Hollywood,” says Romero, adding that he hopes One Night Only “showcases the stadium in a different way,” noting SoFi’s carefully designed sightlines and visual technology designed to enhance the live experience. “Sound is really important to them, and we have the five levels of LED screen as well at the stadium [that] they can also use as part of the show,” Romero said. “Their production team is working with our team to ensure that the sound and the sidelines for fans coming in are going to be the best for comedy.” Tickets for the show are now on sale at Ticketmaster.com.
