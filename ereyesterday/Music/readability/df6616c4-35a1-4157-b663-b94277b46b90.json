  "text": "After more than a decade, Tool will make their long-awaited return to Hawaii, performing live at Honolulu's Blaisdell Arena on December 19. The band's announcement marks their first Hawaiian appearance since the early 2010s and adds another milestone to their ever-expanding global tour legacy. In addition to the Hawaii performance, Tool has also revealed two rare appearances in Japan, marking their first shows in the country since 2013. The band will play K-Arena Yokohama on December 11 and Glion Arena Kobe on December 13, giving Japanese fans a long-overdue opportunity to witness Tool's mesmerizing live experience. Tool's shows are: 12/11 K-Arena, Yokohama, Japan12/13 Glion Arena, Kobe, Japan12/19 Blaisdell Arena, Honolulu, HI As for a new Tool album, that saga continues on. According to Tool bassist Justin Chancellor in a recent interview with Summa Inferno, the band’s instrumental members planned to lock themselves in the studio for three months following their festival appearance in Mexico this March to work on new material. \"When we get back from [our] trip — I think it's only three weeks we're gonna be [there] — but we have already shared with each other a lot of these new ideas, but when we get back, we're actually gonna dedicate the next three months after that in the studio to organizing our ideas.\" Looking ahead, Chancellor suggested that new Tool material could arrive within the next two years, though he admitted that it’s still unclear what form that release might take. \"Yeah, well, the other thing is the climate of releasing music has completely changed… We've talked about releasing a single, just one song — we could do that. We could also release an EP… Or you could release a single and then another single, another single, and then after a year of releasing singles, you could put them all together on a record and make that an album.\" While no official timeline or format has been confirmed, Chancellor emphasized the band’s drive to move forward creatively rather than rely on their existing catalog. \"We're just kind of making it up. But I can tell you that we absolutely have to write new music to continue doing what we're doing… So it's coming. Trust me.\" Want More Metal?
