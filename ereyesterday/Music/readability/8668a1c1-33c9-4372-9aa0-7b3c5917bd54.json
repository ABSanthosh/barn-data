  "text": "Matty Matheson – who you know as Neil Fak on The Bear – and Wade MacNeil of Alexisonfire have teamed up for a brand new band called Pig Pen. The band features Matheson on vocals, MacNeil on guitar, and then Daniel Romano on guitar, Ian Romano on drums, and bassist Tommy Major. Pig Pen is set to play their first show on April 25 in Sneaky Dee's in Toronto, ON, which makes me annoyed I am not Canadian (for a variety of reasons). \"Just when you thought I couldn’t possibly join ANOTHER band. WE GO AND START PIG PEN,\" wrote MacNeil. \"Featuring Matty Matheson, Daniel Romano, Ian Romano, Tommy Major \u0026 Myself.\" In the meantime, you can check out a brief teaser of Pig Pen below.
