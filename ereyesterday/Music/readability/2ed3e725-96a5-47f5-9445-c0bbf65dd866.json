  "text": "No spoilers for the end of The Bear Season 4, but the last episode of the critically-acclaimed FX series left things unclear as to whether we’d ever see Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), Syd (Ayo Edebiri), and Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) back in the kitchen again. Now, FX has confirmed that The Bear will return for a fifth season in 2026. The fact that FX is promising a 2026 return is impressive given the busy careers of the cast, including White starring in a Bruce Springsteen biopic and Moss-Bachrach playing Ben Grimm in not just this month’s The Fantastic Four: First Steps but also the upcoming Avengers movies. FX Chairman John Landgraf said in a statement that “The Bear continues to be a fan favorite worldwide and their response to this season—as seen through incredibly high viewership—has been as spectacular as any of its previous seasons. Year-in and year-out, Chris Storer, the producers, cast and crew make The Bear one of the best shows on television, and we are excited that they will continue to tell this magnificent story.” Where the story of this struggling Chicago restaurant might go next — but based on the past seasons, it seems like a safe bet that Season 5 will have no shortage of great needle drops. Season 4 is currently streaming on Hulu; check out our full review of the show’s efforts to battle burnout.",
