  "text": "This coming Wednesday, a slew of all-star artists will gather at Carnegie Hall in New York City for People Have the Power: A Celebration of Patti Smith, a tribute to the work of (you guessed it) legendary songwriter Patti Smith. As if the lineup wasn’t stacked enough, The Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, is now set to join in on the fun. The tribute concert is the latest installment of City Winery founder and CEO Michael Dorf’s “Music Of” benefit series, with all net proceeds going to music education for underserved youth. Tickets for the event are currently sold out (except for select VIP tiers), though secondary tickets are available via StubHub. Get Patti Smith Tickets Here In addition to Springsteen, the tribute show will feature the likes of R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe, Kim Gordon, The National’s Matt Berninger, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Karen O, Angel Olsen, Sharon Van Etten, Ben Harper, Courtney Barnett, Alison Mosshart of The Kills, and The Kronos Quartet, as well as Jim Jarmusch, The Kills’ Alison Mosshart, and Chrissie Hynde, among others. Tony Shanahan, a frequent calibrator of Smith’s, will serve as the event’s musical director and house band leader. Equally high-profile musicians will round out his band, including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, The Rolling Stones drummer Steve Jordan, former Bob Dylan guitarist Charlie Sexton, and Tom Petty \u0026 The Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench. The concert coincides with the 50th anniversary of Smith’s landmark album Horses. Smith is also set to celebrate the anniversary of Horses with a tour of her own. See Patti Smith’s 2025 tour dates and get tickets here. For his part, Springsteen and his famed E Street Band have a slew of tour dates in the UK/Europe set for this summer. Tickets can be purchased here.",
