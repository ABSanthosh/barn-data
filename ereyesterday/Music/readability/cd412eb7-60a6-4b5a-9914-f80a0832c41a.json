He said: “I just felt so strongly about the project and about her that I was like, ‘This needs an outlet’.“We basically started making songs, just her and I, and when we felt the songs were good and ready, we would just release them ourselves. It was really empowering to A\u0026R a record together.”The album was released in September 2023. As of March 2025, it had peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart and No.1 on the Billboard Artist 100, with more than 4.3 billion streams worldwide.“After 6 years of working almost exclusively with the various labels/artists under Universal, it made perfect sense to make the relationship more formal.”Daniel NigroThis month, five years after its initial release in April of 2020, Roan’s Pink Pony Club climbed to Top 5 of the US Top 40, Top 10 on the Hot 100 and has spent two weeks at No.1 on the UK Singles Chart.UMG notes that Chappell Roan’s 2024’s single, Good Luck, Babe!  became “one of the most successful singles of the year,” hitting No.1 at US Top 40 Radio selling more than 12 million copies worldwide to date.Nigro was recently named Producer of the Year at the 67th Grammy Awards for his work last year with Roan, Rodrigo and the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds \u0026 Snakes.
