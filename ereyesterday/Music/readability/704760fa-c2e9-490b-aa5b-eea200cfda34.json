  "text": "Miki Berenyi Trio has announced that they are heading to North America this fall. Throughout October, the trio will tour through the US and Canada to support their debut album Tripla. Along with the tour announcement, they’ve released “Kinch,” the latest single from Tripla, which you can check out below. MB3’s 2025 North American tour will kick off on October 10th in Washington, DC before hitting stops in Brooklyn, Montreal, Chicago, and San Francisco. The final show is on October 28th in West Hollywood, CA. Get Miki Berenyi Trio Tickets Here Tickets go on sale Friday, April 4th at 12:00 p.m. local time via the group’s website. The band is about to kick off their UK and European tour later this week as well, also on April 4th in London. After that, they’ll play shows in Paris, Bristol, Leeds, and more. Like much of her output with Lush, “Kinch” is capital-D dream pop, and Berenyi describes the track as “inspired by love and loss, and how those people never leave you, and how it makes you think about the nature of love.” Miki Berenyi Trio is composed of Miki Berenyi, KJ ‘Moose’ McKillop, and Oliver Cherer. Their debut album, Tripla, is out this Friday, April 4th via Bella Union. Berenyi, the co-founder of Lush, released her memoir Fingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me from Success in 2022.
