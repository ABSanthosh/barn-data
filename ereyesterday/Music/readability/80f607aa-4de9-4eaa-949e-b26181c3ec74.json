  "text": "Soundgarden's surviving members – guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist and vocalist Ben Shepherd, and drummer and vocalist Matt Cameron – will return to the stage on December 14 at The Showbox in Seattle, WA for a show benefitting the Seattle Children's Hospital. The trio will go on stage as Nudedragons, an anagram of Soundgarden they've previously used, along with vocalist Shaina Shepherd. \"Nudedragons will be returning to the stage, and the Showbox, for the first time in 14+ years as part of the SMooCH benefit for Seattle Children’s Hospital on Saturday, December 14,\" wrote Soundgarden (or Nudedragons) regarding the performance. \"Shaina Shepherd will be featured on vocals for their brief encore performance. For tickets and more info visit https://smoochforkids.com.\" This isn't the first time Soundgarden has reunited in a post-Chris Cornell world, either. Soundgarden played a Chris Cornell tribute show in 2019, as well as performed \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\" with Brandi Carlile in 2021. As it stands right now, Soundgarden's final material with Cornell is gridlocked as the band dukes it out with Cornell's estate. Want More Metal?
