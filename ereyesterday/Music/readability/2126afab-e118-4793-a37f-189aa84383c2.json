  "text": "Timothée Chalamet made the ultimate “one of us” gesture for Bob Dylan fans while delivering a powerful message to Oscar voters with two incredible musical performances on Saturday Night Live. Marking his first-ever public performance, the 29-year-old actor, who stars in the Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, began with a medley of “Outlaw Blues” and “Three Angels.” The latter number is a particular deep cut, a gospel-hued song appearing on Dylan’s 1970 album New Morning. Later, Chalamet returned to sing “Tomorrow Is a Long Time,” a beloved Dylan bootleg dating back from the early 1960s that didn’t properly receive a studio release until it was included in 2010’s The Bootleg Series Vol. 9. For both performances, Chalamet was joined by a full band that included James Blake on keyboard. Chalamet hinted at his left-field song choices during his opening monologue, saying: “You might not know the Bob Dylan songs I’m performing, but they’re my personal favorites.” None of the songs appear on the soundtrack to A Complete Unknown. Chalamet is nominated for Best Actor at the 2025 Academy Awards. If he wins, he’ll be the youngest actor to ever receive the award.",
