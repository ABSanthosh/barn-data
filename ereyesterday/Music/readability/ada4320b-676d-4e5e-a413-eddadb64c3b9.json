  "text": "In a recent conversation with the Everblack podcast, Mayhem bassist Jørn \"Necrobutcher\" Stubberud offered an exciting update for fans of the Norwegian black metal legends. When asked about the possibility of new material from the band, Necrobutcher confirmed their ambitious plans, saying: \"Yes, you can. Teloch [Mayhem guitarist Morten Bergeton Iversen] and Charles [Edward Alexander Hedger, Mayhem guitarist] have presented some demos — both of them presented over 10 songs or 10 skeletons — so they have presented almost 20 songs. And I listened to everything and some of it is really fucking good,\" he revealed. \"So, after the Australian tour, I guess — no, some of us are gonna go on some tours with some other bands. But in March 2025, I think, we're gonna get together and start to hammer out this thing. By 2025 we should have been able to enter the studio. And then, hopefully, it would be cool to have it out in 2025. That would be a goal, but we'll see. But definitely 2026. And then, of course, we'll be heading out on a new world tour to promote it, I guess.\" The band's most recent studio album, Daemon, was released in October 2019 under Century Media, marking a significant chapter in their storied career. Following that, fans were treated to Daemonic Rites, a live album that arrived in September 2023. However, 2023 hasn't been without its challenges for the group. Earlier this month, Mayhem canceled their North American 40th-anniversary tour due to a medical emergency affecting one of the members. The band revealed that the required surgery and subsequent recovery period forced them to make the difficult decision to postpone the tour. Want More Metal?
