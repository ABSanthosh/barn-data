From interviewing some of the stars slated to perform to bringing you highlights from the day’s shows, keep watching as we recap everything you may have missed on day one! What did you think of Rolling Loud day one? Let us know in the comments below! Tetris Kelly: Billboard is at Rolling Loud Los Angeles, and from the vibes to the interviews with the artists and seeing them on stage, we take you there in “Billboard All Access.” Cash Cobain: Rolling Loud is from California. I see the palm trees. It’s beautiful. It’s amazing. I’m about to go perform right now, so, you know what I’m saying, it’s feeling good right now.  Tetris Kelly: Before making it to the headliners, we had to check out the vibes at Hollywood Park, and fans were taking advantage of actual carnival rides, in addition to getting their hair and looks on point at multiple activations with tattoos and more. And don’t forget karaoke. There were also real artists backstage before their big sets.  DDG: I just want to be one of the ones that come out here one day. And you know, I’m not pulling up at three o’clock, I’m pulling up at the SoFi Stadium doing — hell out of my own s—. You know what I mean? Tetris Kelly: Also you’re on the track with headliner Playboi Carti, man. Billboard ranked it the eighth best song out of the 30 songs. So how was it to work with my boy?  Cash Cobain: Shout out to “FINE S—” man. For sure. Tetris Kelly: How is it to see, like, your peers out in the crowd and stuff at performances?  Derrick Milano: It’s like you see them in the elements, and you see all the work and the hard work that’s put in, and you just appreciate who they are as artists and what you do. Tetris Kelly: And do you actually care about any of the other headliners that’s played, like anybody’s set you are trying to see before you bounce out tonight? Keep watching for more!",
