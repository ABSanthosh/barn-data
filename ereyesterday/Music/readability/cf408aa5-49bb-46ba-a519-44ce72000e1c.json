  "text": "Dolly Parton hasn’t become one of America’s most beloved musicians by accident. In a recent interview with E! News, the 79-year-old country star was asked if she would ever consider serving as a judge on a competition singing show such as American Idol or The Voice. After revealing that she has actually turned down multiple offers to do so, Parton added, “It’s too hard for me. That’s why I don’t accept it, because I know how sincere everybody is. Even if they’re not that good, they believe they are. And I just can’t hurt people.”",
