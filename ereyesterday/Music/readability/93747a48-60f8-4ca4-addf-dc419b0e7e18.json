  "text": "In 2014, following the dissolution of WU LYF, Ellery James Roberts launched a new band with Ebony Hoorn called LUH. The duo, which eventually became known as Lost Under Heaven, is now also breaking up. “We can never know where life will lead us, but for the foreseeable future we won’t be collaborating together anymore as Lost Under Heaven,” Roberts and Hoorn shared on social media. “Only love remains between us, but after 12 years of sharing so much of our lives—living, working, and spending most of our time together— it feels necessary to create space between us to both reconnect with ourselves and fully embrace our individual expression.”Ellery James Roberts and Ebony Hoorn met in 2012, and they shared their first Lost Under Heaven song, “Unites,” in 2014. The duo’s debut studio album, Spiritual Songs for Lovers to Sing, arrived two years later, via Mute. Reviewing the album, for Pitchfork, Jazz Monroe called it “a revelatory experience that requires no legible revelations: vocals of ecstatic defiance matched to music seemingly composed of pure magnitude; melancholic synths, sparse guitars, and bombastic strings and drums.” He continued, “The overall feeling is of an all-hands, against-the-odds triumph against staggering forces.”Lost Under Heaven shared one more album via Mute, Love Hates What You Become, in 2019, before issuing Something Is Announced by Your Life!, in 2023, via their own LUH*International label.Lost Under Heaven released their latest song, “Farhang,” in May 2024. They plan to share one final single, “Creation Song,” on Friday, February 28.",
