  "text": "A Killer's Confession is joined by yet another former Mushroomhead member, as their drummer just quit mid-tour. According to a statement from the band, drummer Kegan King \"decided to leave on his terms mid tour\" and is replaced by ex-Mushroomhead percussionist Daniel Fox. Which is great considering A Killer's Confession is fronted by ex-Mushroomhead vocalist Waylon Reavis, and the band also features ex-Mushroomhead members Jason \"J Mann\" Popson and Rick \"St1tch\" Thomas for their current throwback tour. \"ITS BEEN A CRAZY 24 hours,\" wrote A Killer's Confession. \"Our van broke down and may not be able to get fixed but the show must go on!!! We have temporary transportation and we are moving forward with the tour! That being said Kegan has decided that he no longer wants to tour with us. He decided to leave on his terms mid tour. Please welcome Daniel Fox on drums for AKC for the rest of the tour and here forward. LETS GO!!!!! AKC IS A MACHINE!! Please welcome Danny!!!!\" A Killer's Confession's remaining tour dates with VentanA and Aeternum are as follows. 4/16 West Hollywood, CA Whisky a Go Go4/19 Salt Lake City.
