  "text": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again was pardoned by Donald Trump on Wednesday, months after pleading guilty to federal weapons charges. Last December, the 25-year-old rapper was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison followed by 60 months of probation for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Due to time already served, he received an early release last month. “I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building – as a man, as a father, and as an artist,” NBA YoungBoy wrote in a statement. “This moment means a lot. It opens the door to a future I’ve worked hard for and I am fully prepared to step into this.” On Wednesday, Trump also commuted the sentences of Death Row Records co-founder Michael Harris and Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, and pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley.",
