  "text": "Live Nation has announced the discontinuation of its popular lawn pass program but assures concertgoers that a new program will replace it. Endearingly named the “Lawnie Pass,” the program provided lawn tickets to every summer concert at participating Live Nation amphitheaters for a flat rate of $239 (as of 2024). Now, individual lawn tickets will still be sold, but the all-show pass itself will be replaced by “new and exciting programs,” according to a statement from the Lawnie Pass Instagram page. Further details on the new program are unknown at this time, but the statement indicates that previous lawn pass holders “will be the first to hear about these new offerings.” Read the full statement below. In the past, the lawn pass was offered at 25 Live Nation amphitheaters across the US. According to a Spotify Wrapped-style post on Instagram, the program claims that the lawn pass was used at 811 shows in 2024, including concerts by Chris Stapleton, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Post Malone, and more. The reasoning for the programs discontinuation is unclear, but Billboard reported this week that Live Nation is expecting to host even more shows in their amphitheaters this year compared to last.",
