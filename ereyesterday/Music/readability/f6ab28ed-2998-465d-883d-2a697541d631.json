Below, listen to Toro y Moi’s take on “Stars and Sons” and Miya Folick and Hand Habits’ cover of “Almost Crimes.”Anthems: A Celebration of Broken Social Scene’s You Forgot It in People is out June 6. The 13-song album features You Forgot It in People covers by Hovvdy, Mdou Moctar, Spirit of the Beehive, and others.“I remember first hearing about BSS when I was a sophomore in high school.” Toro y Moi stated in a press release. “You Forgot It in People especially caught my ear; I thought the production was so ahead of its time—the intros and outros, the interstitials… so much of it informed how I like to make records. I’m so happy to be included in this project.”Regarding her cover, Folick said, “You Forgot It in People is one of my favorite albums, and I feel very honored to be part of this compilation. Meg [Duffy of Hand Habits], Sasami, and I made this song in Stinson Beach, taking long breaks for walks and meals. It’s long, meandering, and meant for headphones.”Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy added, “This record led me to deep musical consumption and discovery. Despite being nearly 25 years old, it’s an honor to be included in the commemoration of this collective of musicians. I truly think that, without BSS, I wouldn’t have made the records I’ve made today, wouldn’t have sought out community in the way I do today, wouldn’t be so addicted to collaboration and reinvention.”Revisit the 2017 interview “Broken Social Scene Are (Somehow) Still Friends After All These Years.”",
