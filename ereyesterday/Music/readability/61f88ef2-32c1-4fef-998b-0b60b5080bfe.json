  "text": "Praise be to Buddy Christ, because Kevin Smith’s Dogma is going to France. Kevin Smith’s acclaimed religious satire will be playing at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival as an official selection in the Cannes Classics situation, screening May 22nd at the Palais des Festivals. Dogma screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, before its theatrical release later that year. Now, its arrival at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival comes during the movie’s ongoing Resurrection Tour, which began on Easter Sunday in Los Angeles and sold out its 20-city tour in the first 24 hours, with additional shows being added in every market. “Sold out screenings, standing ovations, and now Cannes? This is beyond divine,” Kevin Smith said in a statement. “To see Dogma honored as a Cannes Classic is a true blessing… We made this movie with humor, heresy and a hell of a lot of heart. And somehow, it’s still finding new audiences 25 years later. That’s a miracle in my book.” Dogma, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Chris Rock, and Alan Rickman, has been remastered in 4K for this tour. And we can potentially look forward soon to Smith’s proposed Dogma sequel, which would star both Affleck and Damon. Check out the (very funny) trailer for the re-release below.",
