  "text": "On March 29th, a benefit concert featuring the artists behind the Garden State soundtrack will take place at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. For those who can’t make it in-person, Veeps has announced that the one-off show will be available to stream starting on April 6th. Announced last fall, the concert (get tickets here) is bringing the soundtrack’s featured artists together for the first time ever. The Shins, Iron \u0026 Wine, Frou Frou, Thievery Corporation, Remy Zero, Men at Work’s Colin Hay, and Cary Brothers are set to perform at the show, plus special guests are expected to drop in. Get Garden State Benefit Concert Tickets Here Braff has also teased that they will screen some behind-the-scenes footage from the movie. The concert is raising funds for the Midnight Mission, a Los Angeles homeless shelter and service provider. You can now buy a 48-hour access ticket on Veeps for $19.99 before the stream becomes available on April 6th at 9:00 p.m. ET. Find more information here. “Recording the show enables us to share the special night with people all over the world,” Zach Braff told Rolling Stone. “Most importantly, it’s another huge way we can give back to the community by supporting the Midnight Mission and all they do for the unhoused and those affected by the Los Angeles fires.” Directed, written, and starring Zach Braff, Garden State follows a 20-something named Andrew who heads back home to New Jersey following his mother’s death. Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, and Ian Holm star in the film as well, with the former actress being labeled as one of the earliest examples of the manic pixie dream girl archetype. Last summer marked 20 years since Garden State’s initial release. The cult film’s soundtrack, which Braff curated and produced, won the Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture in 2005. Pick up your vinyl copy here.
