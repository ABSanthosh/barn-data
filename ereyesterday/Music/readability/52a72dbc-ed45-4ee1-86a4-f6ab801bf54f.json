  "text": "Indie music distribution platform DistroKid has announced that artists can now upload music videos to Spotify via its DistroVid service – but the videos can only be viewed in the markets where Spotify has rolled out its music video feature.Spotify has made music videos available in beta to Premium users in 98 markets. The US and Canada aren’t among them, although the service is available in a number of other major markets, including the UK, Japan, Germany, France, and South Korea.To get their videos on Spotify through DistroKid’s service, artists have to sign up for DistroVid at USD $99 per year (or the equivalent in their local currency). For that fee, artists get an unlimited number of music video uploads. DistroVid, which launched in 2022, also offers music video uploads to Apple Music, Vevo, Tidal, and Boomplay, and – like its music distribution service – it doesn’t charge a commission and remits 100% of earnings to the artist.“DistroVid makes it easy for independent artists to get their music videos everywhere, with unlimited uploads and zero commission. We’re excited to now include Spotify as a destination,” DistroKid President Phil Bauer said in a statement on Wednesday (June 25). Spotify rolled out music videos initially in 11 markets in March 2024, expanding it by another 85 markets last October. The move was widely seen as an attempt to challenge YouTube, which dominates the music video market among digital service providers.Music tracks with an accompanying video appear on Spotify with a “switch to video” toggle that allows users to jump between the audio track and the video even in mid-stream.“I’m so impressed by how seamlessly video has been integrated – listeners can instantly switch between the music video and audio track with a single tap, making it feel like a native, fluid part of the Spotify experience.”Phil Bauer, DistroKid“I’m so impressed by how seamlessly video has been integrated – listeners can instantly switch between the music video and audio track with a single tap, making it feel like a native, fluid part of the Spotify experience,” Bauer said.“As an independent artist, growing my career is all about finding authentic mediums for discovery,” New York-based hip-hop artist Marlon Craft added. “DistroVid and the ability to add music videos to Spotify creates an opportunity – if the visuals can live where people discover and listen to the music, it can allow visual art to market the music itself in a way that is super direct and impactful.”DistroKid bills itself as “the world’s largest distributor of independent music,” claiming to distribute 30%-40% of all new music in the world. The company says it has processed more than 60 million songs and built a roster of 4 million artists, including “hobbyists, up-and-comers, top influencers, and international stars.”Spotify took a minority stake in DistroKid in 2018 before selling most of it in 2021.Based on Spotify filings, MBW estimates that Spotify owned around 17% of DistroKid (aka DK Holdco LLC) before the 2021 sale, and has owned around 4% of the distribution company subsequently.Music Business Worldwide",
