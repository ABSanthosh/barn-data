  "text": "It hits No. 1 for the first time on both the Classical Albums \u0026 Classical Crossover Albums charts. Keira Knightley in Pride and Prejudice. Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection Following its 20th-anniversary reissue on vinyl, the soundtrack to the 2005 Pride \u0026 Prejudice film hits No. 1 for the first time on both Billboard’s Classical Albums and Classical Crossover Albums charts (dated July 12). It jumps 6-1 on the former, and 5-1 on the latter. The soundtrack, composed by Dario Marianelli and performed by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and the English Chamber Orchestra, was reissued June 27 in a number of vinyl variants — some in expanded packaging. Collectively, the album earned 9,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending July 3 (a gain of 974% compared to the previous week), according to Luminate, with album sales comprising a little over 8,000 of that sum (up 14,105%). The latter sum marks the album’s largest sales week ever in the U.S. Further, vinyl purchases comprise essentially all of that 8,000 figure. The album additionally hits a new peak on Billboard’s Soundtracks chart (No. 3) and debuts on Vinyl Albums (No. 5), Top Album Sales (No. 9) and the overall Billboard 200 (No. 180). Trending on Billboard Billboard’s Classical Albums, Classical Crossover Albums and Soundtracks charts rank the week’s most popular overall classical, crossover classical and soundtrack albums, respectively, in the U.S., by equivalent album units earned. The Billboard 200 tallies the country’s most popular overall albums of the week, across all genres, by units. Vinyl Albums and Top Album Sales rank the week’s best-selling vinyl albums and overall albums, respectively, by traditional album sales. Pride \u0026 Prejudice was directed by Joe Wright and stars Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. The film earned four Academy Award nominations: actress in a leading role (Knightley), art direction (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer), costume design (Jacqueline Durran) and original score (Marianelli). Equivalent album units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.
