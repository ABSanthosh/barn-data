  "text": "As promised, Bon Iver have shared a new song. “Everything Is Peaceful Love” is the first music from Justin Vernon since announcing the new album SABLE, fABLE earlier this week. The single comes with a smile-filled music video directed by John Wilson of HBO’s How To with John Wilson. Watch it below.In a statement, Vernon said: “I knew what kind of record I wanted to make the day we made ‘Everything Is Peaceful Love.’ I always knew that would be the feeling I wanted to share first. I wanted the video to just be people smiling uncontainably. Luckily, Eric Timothy Carlson suggested getting in touch with John Wilson from How To With John Wilson. Simply the most poignant and hilarious program in all of Television. We were extremely fortunate that John liked the idea. He went out, shot a bunch of fun stuff, and edited it all to the song. It gives me what I want for this album, all in one video. The idea that happiness and joy are the highest form and the true buoyancy of survival, and even taking yourself less seriously could heal the world.”SABLE, fABLE is out April 11 via Jagjaguwar. Vernon worked on his i,i follow-up with producer Jim-E Stack and guests Dijon, Flock of Dimes, and Danielle Haim.Read “What Offbeat Documentarian John Wilson Is Listening To.” Plus, check out the new review of “Everything Is Peaceful Love.”",
