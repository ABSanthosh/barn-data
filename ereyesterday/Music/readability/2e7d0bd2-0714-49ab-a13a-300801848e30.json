The Weeknd’s “After Hours Til Dawn” 2025 tour celebrates Hurry Up Tomorrow, The Weeknd’s new album, as well as the conclusion of a trilogy that began with his 2020 album After Hours. He originally launched the “After Hours Til Dawn” tour after the release of 2022’s Dawn F.M., the second installment of the trilogy. The Weeknd (A.K.A. Abel Tesfaye) has hinted that Hurry Up Tomorrow will be his last project under the name The Weeknd, making the “After Hours Til Dawn” run a mini “Eras Tour” for the pop star. The tour kicks off on May 9th in Phoenix and continues sporadically throughout the summer. The Weeknd will play stadiums in Detroit, Chicago, East Rutherford, Minneapolis, Denver, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle, Vancouver, Montréal, Toronto, Philadelphia, Nashville, Miami, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, and more; the tour concludes with a September 3rd show at the Alamodome in San Antonio. See the full list of The Weeknd’s tour dates below. Update: Due to overwhelming demand, The Weeknd has added additional shows in Chicago, East Rutherford, Los Angeles, Montreal, and Toronto. The “After Hours Til Dawn” tour was originally meant to be previewed at a special, one-night-only concert at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles on January 25th, but the show was cancelled due to the California wildfires this month. For the tour, The Weeknd is partnering with Global Citizen, and $1 of every ticket sold will be donated to support children from vulnerable communities around the world. Who Is Opening for The Weeknd on His 2025 Tour? The Weeknd will be joined by Playboi Carti for all dates except the pair of Los Angeles shows on June 25th and 26th, while regular collaborator Mike Dean will open each show. Does The Weeknd Have a New Album Out? Yes, Hurry Up Tomorrow was released on January 31st. It was originally set to be revealed on January 24th, but the album was postponed by one week out of respect for the Los Angeles communities devastated by wildfires. With a nostalgic synth-pop sound akin to his prior two albums, The Weeknd worked on the LP with a sprawling list of producers and collaborators, including Pharrell Williams, Oneohtrixpointenver, Max Martin, Metro Boomin, Justice, Travis Scott, Oscar Holter, Lana Del Rey, and more. Read our review of the album here. He’ll be accompanying the album with an upcoming psychological thriller film, also titled Hurry Up Tomorrow, set for release on May 16th. The Weeknd will star alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan, and the film will feature music by Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrixpointnever) as well as unreleased songs from the making of Hurry Up Tomorrow. It marks The Weeknd’s latest foray into film and television, having previously produced and starred in the maligned HBO show The Idol in 2023. What Are The Weeknd’s 2025 Tour Dates?
