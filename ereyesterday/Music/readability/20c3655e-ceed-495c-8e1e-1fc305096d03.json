  "text": "Slipknot are taking it all the way back to where it began. In celebration of the 25th anniversary of their iconic 1999 debut, the masked metal juggernauts have announced Slipknot (25th Anniversary Edition) — a deluxe reissue that digs deep into the chaotic creative explosion that gave birth to one of heavy music's most influential records. Arriving September 5, 2025 via Roadrunner Records, the reissue offers a rare look into the making of an album that changed everything for the Iowa nine. This isn't just a re-release — it's a full-blown excavation. The 25th Anniversary Edition includes the original Ross Robinson-produced debut along with a trove of unreleased recordings, test mixes, alternate takes, and raw versions that only the band and their closest collaborators had heard until now. Pulled directly from original sources at SR Audio, Indigo Ranch, and other studios, these sessions reveal the evolution of Slipknot's earliest material and how their distinct sound and identity were forged in fire. As of today, fans can hear an early version of the track \"Prosthetics,\" in the form of a never-before-released demo recorded before the band entered Indigo Ranch with Robinson. The haunting, visceral demo gives a glimpse into the song's raw framework before it was shaped into the brooding album cut that would become a fan favorite. Earlier this week, Slipknot launched a fan-exclusive edition of the box set via their 742617000027.net. Limited to just 100 blood-filled vinyl copies, the ultra-rare edition sold out instantly (likely to bots), crashing the site in the process. For those who missed out, pre-orders are now available for several other formats, including a 6LP blood-splattered vinyl box set (limited to 1,899 copies), standard 2LP, 2CD, and digital versions across all major platforms. Pre-orders are available here. Included in the set are soundboard recordings from their breakout year on the road: a feral 1999 performance in Hartford, CT that documents the band's uncontainable energy on smaller stages, and a 2000 set from the UK that shows how they translated that power to massive festival crowds. Both recordings have been meticulously remixed and mastered from the original digital audio tapes and handpicked by the band to best represent the force of early Slipknot in full bloom.
