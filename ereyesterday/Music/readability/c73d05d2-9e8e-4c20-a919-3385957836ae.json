  "text": "The prolific producer, James Ford, has revealed that he has been diagnosed with acute leukemia, and began “aggressive chemo to treat it” this week. Sharing news of the diagnosis on Instagram, the 2023 Producer of the Year wrote that he felt “pretty rough in the run up to Christmas,” but only considered it a symptom of “burnout.” After his condition worsened, though, he sought medical attention, and received the diagnosis. “It’s a huge shock and while it’s very clear in my mind how serious this is, it is curable, and as of today I’m starting pretty aggressive chemo to treat it,” Ford wrote. “I’m very aware that it’s gonna be a bumpy road ahead but I’m confident, upbeat, and ready to fight and I hope to be out the other side of the initial treatment in 6-8 months time.” Ford also acknowledged that he was forced to pull out of several upcoming production commitments. “Needless to say, I’ve had to clear my work diary which has meant putting on hold a lot of very exciting musical projects I was eager to get stuck into,” he wrote. “Whilst this is a massive shame, I know they will go on to deliver great records with whoever takes the reins, and I wish them all the best.” Ford first rose to prominence as a member of Simian and its spinoff, Simian Mobile Disco, and has producer credits on iconic albums like Florence + the Machine’s Lungs, Arctic Monkeys’ AM, HAIM’s Days Are Gone, Depeche Mode’s Memento Mori, Blur’s The Ballad of Darren, Fontaines D.C.’s Romance, and many, many more. Now, he is at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, and is “really looking forward to getting back into the studio in my own time so that I can once again work on the music that is dear to me.” He concluded his Instagram post by expressing his gratitude for his “family, friends, and colleagues who have been so supportive at this difficult time, particularly my wife Sereen and all the NHS staff who’ve looked me so brilliantly.” Read his full post below. In the comments, artists like Jessie Ware, Carly Rae Jepson, Pet Shop Boys, Mystery Jets, and more expressed their support.",
