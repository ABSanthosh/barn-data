  "text": "Trivium and Bullet For My Valentine are currently wrapping up the North American leg of their 20th anniversary tour, where each band is playing their Ascendancy and The Poison albums. The tour was slated to hit the rest of the world throughout 2025, but something happened behind the scenes and now this leg is the last leg. Over the weekend, Trivium began billing the remaining North American dates as The Poisoned Ascendancy Farewell Tour. That came shortly after footage surfaced of Trivium bassist Paolo Gregoletto calling out Bullet For My Valentine's Matt Tuck on a livestream as being the sole reason the rest of the tour will not carry on. Those rumors are fueled by Mexican tour promoter Evil Metal saying the tour will not come to Mexico, writing: \"Matt Tuck from Bullet For My Valentine has decided not to continue with the 'Poisoned Ascendancy Tour' alongside Trivium, they will only fulfill the last dates already agreed on in North America. So plans for Australia and Latin America (including Mexico) are cancelled, although there is a possibility that Trivium may hit the country solo with the anniversary celebration of their album Ascendancy.\" It's worth noting that both Trivium and Bullet For My Valentine have unfollowed each other on social media. Neither band has issued a definitive statement on exactly what happened just yet, but I'm sure something will surface given the rumors. As we bring The Poisoned Ascendancy Tour to an end, with just 4 SHOWS LEFT, make sure you don’t miss your chance to come out and celebrate this 20 year anniversary with us! ???????? pic.twitter.com/gSJhfptgAp— Trivium (@TriviumOfficial) May 11, 2025 Want More Metal?
