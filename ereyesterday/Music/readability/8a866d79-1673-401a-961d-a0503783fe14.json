  "text": "At least 66 people were killed and 160 others were injured when the roof of a well-attended Dominican Republic nightclub collapsed early Tuesday morning, according to the New York Times. Rubby Pérez, a popular merengue singer, was performing at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo at the time of the roof collapse. Pérez was among those killed, along with former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel and a member of the Dominican Republic’s Congress. As of late Tuesday, rescue crews were still searching for survivors. “Our city wakes up to a terrible tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. My deepest sympathy goes out to the families still waiting for news of their loved ones,” Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, the mayor of Santo Domingo, wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
