  "text": "The first trailer from the long-awaited sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, has arrived, offering a preview of the star-studded guests who join legendary mock-rockers Spinal Tap in the movie. Unfortunately, the band is still searching for a drummer.  Watch the full clip below. Opening 41 years after the original mockumentary, This is Spinal Tap, the trailer begins with director Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner) taking us back to highlights from the first film, including the notorious “These go to 11” amplifier scene with Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest). A clip of the band performing “Big Bottom” cuts to Di Bergi talking to Paul McCartney in the present day, who refers to a song lyric about “pink torpedo” as “literature, really.” It goes on to reveal what the members of Spinal Tap are doing today, with David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) performing with a mariachi band, Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) hawking cryptocurrency, and Tufnel as a cheese maker who also sits in with a traditional Irish pub ensemble, adding wildly out of place distorted guitar power chords to their quiet folk music. The estranged trio is seen preparing for a forced reunion show in New Orleans and looking for yet another drummer to play with them during the concert. That’s when we see them recruiting Questlove of The Roots to fill the spot, who replies with “I don’t want to die,” since all of the band’s previous drummers have suffered untimely and bizarre deaths. When the clip finally shows the reunited Spinal Tap taking the stage, it’s revealed that Elton John joins them as a special guest. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues will be released in theaters nationwide on September 12th. A new 4K Ultra HD restoration of This Is Spinal Tap is out now on Prime Video and Apple TV, with a physical release following on September 16th (pre-order here). A new behind-the-scenes book on the making of the original film is also set for release in September.",
