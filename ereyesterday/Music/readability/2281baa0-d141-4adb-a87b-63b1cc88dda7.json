  "text": "There’s a portion of Usher’s concerts in which the R\u0026B singer walks through the crowd, feeding cherries to female fans in the front row. As of late, however, the segment has proved to be more trouble than it’s worth: there was a rumor earlier this year that a female concert-goer got dumped by her husband after being fed by Usher, while the singer opted to skip the segment entirely during his concert in the UAE due to decency laws. More recently, he recreated the moment with Sabrina Carpenter at the Met Gala, much to the dismay of Carpenter’s father. This past week in London, Usher’s cherries came close to anaphylactic shock after the singer repeatedly attempted to feed the fruit to the woman who was allergic. It took a moment for him to either hear or fully understand her warning, but once he fully grasped the situation, he joked, ‘Does anybody have an Epipen in this bitch?'” Usher came close to feeding a fan cherries during his concert in London, until she stopped him and revealed she was allergic. pic.twitter.com/OGq7Ml2v0q — The Art Of Dialogue (@ArtOfDialogue_) May 10, 2025",
