  "text": "Earlier this week, it was reported that Lord Buffalo drummer Yamal Said was detained by Customs and Border Patrol in the US when the band were on their way to Europe to start their EU leg of the tour. Lord Buffalo said in an original statement that, \"\"We are heartbroken to announce we have to cancel our upcoming European tour. Our drummer, Yamal Said, who is a Mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States (green card holder) was forcibly removed from our flight to Europe by Customs and Border Patrol at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday May 12. He has not been released, and we have been unable to contact him.\" Since May 12th, various updates had been offered by the band, Said has been located and has been in touch with proper legal representation, but the reason for his detainment is apparently not due to his immigration status or the fact that he is a Mexican citizen with a U.S. green card. It reportedly due to the fact that there was an active warrant out for Said's arrest. KUT, a Texas news outlet, reported that online records indicated that Said had been arrested for violating a restraining order – \"at least\" twice in the past year. Considered a felony in Texas, a warrant was issued for Yamal Said's arrest by the local sheriff's office. Bodycam footage was obtained by Daily Mail, which shows Said being questioned about the violations to the restraining order. Said, himself, acknowledged that he had sent his daughter birthday and Christmas packages, and that may be the reason he is viewed as seen as violating his restraining order, and therefore, the subsequent warrant for his arrest. Daily Mail also reported that he is in jail and being held on a $40,000 bond in Tarrant County, Texas. That has yet to be confirmed by other sources. As of now, there is no more information from Lord Buffalo or Yamal Said, but that has been at the request of Said's legal team. Want More Metal?
