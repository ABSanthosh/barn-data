  "text": "Green Day are developing a new coming-of-age comedy film called New Years Rev. Inspired by their early days touring in a sprinter van, New Years Rev stars three best friends (played by Mason Thames, Kylr Coffman, and Ryan Foust) who mistakenly believe they’re set to open for Green Day at a New Year’s Eve concert in Los Angeles. The film follows the trio as they pile into a van and hit the road to California, embarking on a journey that promises to be “rowdy, mischievous, and full of adventure.” Get Green Day Tickets Here In addition to Thames, Coffman, and Foust headlining the film, The Office’s Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey co-star in the film. Fischer’s husband, Lee Kirk (Ordinary World), is on board to write and direct New Years Rev, while Green Day’s Billy Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool serve as producers in tandem with Live Nation. “Van days rule,” Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong said in a statement. “You will drive all night on no sleep then play a show for 10 kids in a basement of a friend of a friend’s house 50 miles east of anywhere you’ve ever heard of. But you’ll do it again the next day, and the one after that. Because you’re doing it with your bandmates who become your family and it’s unlike anything you’ve ever known. It’s electric. Let the music and mischief ensue.” New Years Rev marks Live Nation Productions’ latest music-centric film project; in late 2024, the company confirmed a new comedy film called Rolling Loud, which stars Owen Wilson as a father who sneaks his 13-year-old son into the eponymous music festival. The company also produced the 2018 A Star Is Born revival that starred Lady Gaga. Green Day, meanwhile, are keeping the momentum going after releasing their 2024 album Saviors. They’ve got a slew of festival dates coming up, including appearances at Coachella, BottleRock, Welcome to Rockville, and more. They also recently appeared at the FireAid benefit concert in Los Angeles, where they performed their song “Last Night on Earth” alongside Billie Eilish.",
