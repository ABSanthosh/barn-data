  "text": "Eclectic rock heroes Ween are currently on a touring hiatus, but the children of founding members Dean Ween (aka Mickey Melchiondo) and Gene Ween (aka Aaron Freeman) are set to play a gig together this Saturday (March 29th) in New Jersey. Michael Melchiondo and Ashton Freeman will perform together at the The Soupcon Gallery (located in the back of Bucks on Bridge coffee shop) in Lambertville, New Jersey. The news was revealed by Michael in an Instagram post, writing the following message: “My good friend Ashton Freeman has asked me to join them in playing a show this Saturday in Lambertville. We’ve come up with a very unique collaborative set. So come and witness the genetic duo merge our sounds… We are Not Ween.” He also shared an image of the show flyer, which lists Ashton Freeman on the bill along with Hover and Rubix Pube. As Live for Live Music points out, both Michael and Ashton are seasoned musicians in their own right. Michael’s musical endeavors include his band Veal Marsala and a one-man noise project called Bugger. Ashton, meanwhile, studied music at Goucher College, and has released a couple of singles and a 2016 EP titled You Make Me Happy. Last week, Michael shared a photo of himself in the studio with his father, Dean Ween, writing, “In the studio with dad, feeling great and making music. Tomorrow I’m driving to upstate NY to play Lovefest at @wayside_cider with the homies @glockabelle and @idmtheftable Excited to meet Reeves Gabrels who shredded for David Bowie.” Ween announced a touring hiatus in August of last year, citing Dean’s mental health struggles. The band has not booked any shows since then. See Michael Melchiondo’s recent Instagram posts and the show flyer below.",
