  "text": "Steel Panther is celebrating 15-plus years of their debut album Feel The Steel not only with a ton of tour dates, but an ongoing documentary looking at their illustrious past. This first episode tackles the band's early days as they went from a cover band to one playing originals. And for those unaware, yeah – Steel Panther used to be a cover band called Metal Shop and then eventually Metal Skool starting in 2000. They released an EP of originals called Hole Patrol in 2003 which actually featured the future hit \"Death To All But Metal\". Metal Skool would change their name to Steel Panther in 2008 and the rest is history. \"You didn't think we were done celebrating, did you?!\" wrote Steel Panther. \"Join us as we take a look back at the album critics hailed as 'An exercise in taking a joke too far!' Let's take a deep dive on all things Feel The Steel! In this episode, Michael, Satchel and Stix reflect on making the transition from cover band to writing original music.\" Steel Panther will hit the road starting this March for the second leg of their Feel The Steel 15th anniversary tour (which will now be the 16th anniversary, but whatever).
