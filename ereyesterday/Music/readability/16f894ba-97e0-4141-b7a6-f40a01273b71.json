  "text": "Doechii accepts the Woman of the Year Award at Billboard Women In Music 2025. Doechii: Hello! Where’s the swamp? Do I have any fans in here? I cannot believe this. It was just two years ago that I stood on this very stage and accepted Billboard’s Rising Star Award. I had literally performed so hard that I danced my shoes off, and I had to hop up to this mic. And now, here I am—right back at the mic. That moment really reflects how I’ve approached my entire career: always go full out, always go hard, and always be fab. Okay? Always. So now, as I thank God and my family, I’m standing in a full-circle moment as Billboard’s Woman of the Year. But more importantly, I stand here as a fierce ally. And that word, ally, is a key reason why there is a Billboard Women in Music. At the time of the award show’s launch in 2007, women working in the music business were tired—tired of not getting their fair share of seats at the table, tired of not getting the credit they deserved, or the roses they absolutely earned for their contributions to the industry. Because y’all, stop cutting up! My point is that this event was created out of a necessity. And that word, necessity, is important. It hits me because my mixtape, Alligator Bites Never Heal, was a space that I created out of necessity—a necessity for a place where I could feel seen, where I could feel heard, and where I could connect with other people through shared experiences. Keep watching for more!",
