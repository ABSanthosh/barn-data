Brantley Gilbert performs at his World's Largest Album Release Party on Sept. 13, 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee. Jason Kempin/Getty Images Brantley Gilbert was pulled off the stage Friday night in Tupelo, Mississippi, for his baby’s birth — on his tour bus. Gilbert’s wife, Amber, went into labor during the Oct. 11 concert and delivered the couple’s third child on the bus. “So last night might have been the craziest night of my life,” the country singer revealed in a post on Instagram the next day (Saturday, Oct. 12). “Watching such an amazing woman do such an amazing thing is something I’ll never forget.” Gilbert’s update included a video that captured the wild birth story, beginning with the singer’s rush from the stage just after the concert started. He’s currently on the road for his Off the Rails Tour. Trending on Billboard The proud parents shared a glimpse at the newborn in their first photos with the baby, which were added to the video, and the phone call Gilbert had with his mom: “How are you?” she asked, to which he replied, “Not as good as you are about to be. You got a new grandbaby.” “She’s a freaking savage,” he said of Amber. Gilbert, who just released his new album Tattoos last month, went back inside and finished the show, but not before relishing in cheers from the crowd when he announced, “We got a baby!” The “Over When We’re Sober” singer added a note of gratitude in his Instagram post: “Thank you to our road family for rallying around us, Brittany Thornton for helping us bring this little dude into the world, Tupelo, Mississippi for showing us mad love and support, and most of all… Amber Gilbert, for letting me love you and showing me EXACTLY how incredibly strong a woman can be. I love you.” Brantley and Amber announced they were expecting on Mother’s Day. The new addition to the family joins two big siblings, Barrett and Braylen.
