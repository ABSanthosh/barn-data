  "text": "Alfa Anderson, the one-time lead vocalist of Chic who sang on classic disco songs including “Le Freak,” “Good Times,” and “I Want Your Love,” has died at the age of 78. Nile Rodgers, the leader of Chic, shared news of Anderson’s passing on social media on Saturday. A cause of death was not disclosed. After getting her start as a backing vocalist for artists such as Dionne Warwick and Roy Buchanan and vocal work on The Wiz soundtrack, Anderson auditioned for a role in Chic in 1977. She assumed co-lead vocalist following the departure of Norma Jean Wright in 1978 and went on to sing on some of the group’s biggest solo hits. She was also featured on Chic’s collaborations with artists including Sister Sledge (“We Are Family”), Diana Ross (Diana), and Johnny Mathis (I Love My Lady). Following Chic’s initial disbandment in 1983, Anderson toured internationally with Luther Vandross. She also become a go-to session vocalist for artists such as Mick Jagger, Bryan Adams, Teddy Pendergrass, and Billy Squier, among others. Anderson briefly reunited with Chic in 2015 to sing on a song called “I’ll Be There.”",
