  "text": "The corridos tumbados pioneer offers new genre-defying LP featuring collaborations with Myke Towers, Gabito Ballesteros \u0026 more. Corridos tumbados pioneer Natanael Cano is pushing boundaries for música mexicana once again with his new album Porque La Demora, which he released on Tuesday (July 1). While Cano has veered from his signature corridos in other albums — including the trap-leaning Nata Kong (2022) — this one goes a step further offering a bold collection of songs that go from Afrobeat to reggaetón and Caribbean-infused trap beats. Porque La Demora — out via Los CT Records and Rancho Humilde — kicks off with the song that gives the set its name, and it serves as an explanation as to why it’s taken him two years to release a new album. “The streets are sad because they don’t see me,” the 24-year-old star spits over a moody hip-hop beat. “They’re asking when I’m coming back, well I’ve returned/ I was in the air, enjoying/ I’m that 19-year-old kid that no one could defeat but everyone talked about,” he adds quickly, a nod to his hustle and rebellious spirit that has catapulted his career. Cano is joined by a handful of fellow hitmakers for riveting collaborations, including Gabito Ballesteros (“Perlas Negras”) — who is signed to Cano’s Los CT Records — Myke Towers (“El Juez”), FloyyMenor (“Mary Poppins”) and Eladio Carrión (“Como Tony”). Trending on Billboard Porque La Demora follows Cano’s 2023 Nata Montana, which peaked at No. 5 on the Top Latin Albums chart and earned him his first Latin Grammy nomination. On the Regional Mexican Albums chart, he’s placed a total of five top 10 albums, two of which hit No. 1: Corridos Tumbados (2019) and A Mis 20 (2020).
