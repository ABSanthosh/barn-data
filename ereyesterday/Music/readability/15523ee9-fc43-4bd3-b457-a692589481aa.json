Among those affected are actors such as John Goodman, Anthony Hopkins, Billy Crystal, and Eugene Levy, who all lost their homes in the fires. According to Page Six, homes owned by Goodman, Hopkins, Crystal, and Levy in the Pacific Palisades were all destroyed over the last day. Other celebrities who lost their homes in the Los Angeles area include Miles Teller, Paris Hilton, Anna Faris, Adam Brody and Leighton Meester, Cameron Mathison, as well as Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt.
