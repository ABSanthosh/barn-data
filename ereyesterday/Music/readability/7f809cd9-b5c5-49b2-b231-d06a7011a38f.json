  "text": "Genre-defying hardcore collective The Armed are gearing up to release their highly anticipated new album THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED on August 1, and today they've unleashed its final single: the caustically hook-laden \"Sharp Teeth.\" A perfect showcase of their talent for marrying chaos with melody, \"Sharp Teeth\" also marks the return of the elusive Dan Greene, who appears in the song's paranoid, surveillance-themed music video. Directed with The Armed's signature meta-artistic flair, the \"Sharp Teeth\" video features nods to performance art icon Marina Abramović's \"The Artist Is Present\", a helicopter, and a series of cryptic visual easter eggs that will likely keep fans dissecting long after the first watch. \"It's music for a statistically wealthy population that somehow can't afford food or medicine – endlessly scrolling past vacation photos, gym selfies, and images of child amputees in the same feed. It reflects the dissociation required just to exist in that reality,\" said The Armed frontperson Tony Wolski. The single follows previous tracks \"Kingbreaker\" and \"Well Made Play,\" both of which introduced fans to the new sonic and thematic direction of THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED. True to The Armed's form, the album leans into their unrelenting exploration of cultural collapse, dystopia, and the unreality of modern life. The album features a staggering list of contributors, including Ken Szymanski, Patrick Shiroishi, Urian Hackney, Kurt Ballou, Troy Van Leeuwen, Meghan O'Neil, Cara Drolshagen, Tony Wolski, Brian Wolski, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Ben Chisholm, Prostitute, Zach Weeks, Mark Guiliana, Kayleigh Goldsworthy, and Derek Coburn – blending brutalist noise with thoughtful nuance, art-rock theatricality, and relentless experimentalism. Pre-order THE FUTURE IS HERE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED here.
