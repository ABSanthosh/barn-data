  "text": "The legendary hype man who got bounced on Wednesday night (March 11) said his status as \"King Swiftie\" helped get \"Bad Blood\" cleared. Space Ranger on the 'THE MASKED SINGER.' Michael Becker. ©2025 FOX Media LLC. The following story contains spoilers about the celebrity revealed on Wednesday night’s (March 12) episode of The Masked Singer. Space Ranger made his debut on last week’s Masked Singer, bounding out with his neon-tinged swagger and a silver space suit topped by a glowing, planet be-decked cowboy hat. It was a fitting ‘fit for what came next: an electrifying performance in which he bounced around, dropped to his knees and flashed finger guns with so much rizz that judge Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg was convinced he must be a famous comedian. If you were paying any attention at all, the clues (and his one-of-a-kind voice) made it pretty obvious: He’s futuristic, lives on his own planet and a childhood report card included an A+ in, ahem, “PE.” Oh, also, sometimes, he said, you have to show them all that you’re “worth the hype,” as he showed off a belt that appeared to have a clock face on it. His debut performance, of a track by his “bestie,” was a spirited run through Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” that left judge Ken Jeong dumbstruck, while host Nick Cannon knew right away that it was one of his “favorite people” on the planet. Trending on Billboard Both Robin Thicke and Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg agreed that it could be comedian/actor Tracy Morgan, while always-wrong Jeong — who said he’s opened for Morgan on the road — thought the space case was retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., and Rita Ora suggested a showman like actor/comedian Marlon Wayans. Wednesday night’s Ghostbusters-themed episode was back with more super obvious clues, including one about his gig “schlepping furniture” in New York as a young man before he and his partner came up with a crazy idea for a career change with help from a “beastly band of boys” who boosted their career. For his second song, he went in another direction with the swinging Busboys’ Ghostbusters soundtrack album tune “Cleanin’ Up the Town,” which further showcased his showmanship and vocal dexterity. The second performance made Jeong think it was DJ Jazzy Jeff, even as Thicke doubled down on his Morgan guess, while Ora and McCarthy-Wahlberg totally figured out that it was none other than Public Enemy hype man rapper Flavor Flav. Before his elimination, Billboard spoke with Flav, who described the joy of getting the special dispensation to cover Swift, his shock at the judges’ guesses, and why he wanted to hang around just a bit longer. You said being on the show has been on your bucket list for years. Why? What took you so long? I don’t know what took it so long ’cause I’ve been wanting to do this show for years! So when I was asked to be on the show, I said, “Wow! Finally? OK, let’s go!” One thing about me is I love surprising people, I love amusing people, and I love keeping people in suspense. So this show put me on that platform to do all of these things. People know you as the hype man from PE, but were you nervous to try singing on national TV, especially a Taylor Swift song? One thing about Flav — Flav is never, ever nervous. I always love being the center of attention. I love being the most positive, talked-about. I’m the biggest hype man, I’m the original hype man, so I could not wait to get out there on that stage and hype up the world. You are the self-proclaimed “King Swiftie” and there’s never been a Taylor song on Masked Singer. Was that an extra layer of pressure? Nah, I wasn’t nervous at all, and I was honored that Taylor Swift and them did clear the song for me to do. Because Masked Singer been trying to get a Taylor Swift song cleared for years and they could not get one cleared, until Flavor Flav, King Swiftie, came on their show. [A spokesperson for the show confirmed that it was the first-ever Swift cover on the series.] They cleared it for King Swiftie. I’m honored and proud that Taylor Swift and them cleared me to do “Bad Blood.” I said, “I’m gonna have fun with this song and I know I’m gonna do a good job with it.” I ain’t gonna lie, I am my biggest fan and I do amuse myself and I love watching me on TV. Did she approve it because she knew you were going to do it? They knew I was going to do it, that’s why the song got cleared. They only cleared it because of me! They weren’t clearing it for nobody else! And you know what? I don’t think they’re gonna get another Taylor Swift song after this. You have an iconic, signature look. So how did it feel to be in that ridiculous costume? Did it help you relax to be covered up? It was real fun jumping in and out of that costume. When I first seen the costume, I was like, “Wow, how am I gonna pull this off?” But, you know, I can make anything work, I can pull this off. I really had fun… but it was a little hot and muggy up in there and I was running out of fresh air. But I said, “Keep it going. KIM — keep it movin’ Flav, you got this!” Not gonna lie, I’ve been covering you for 30 years and so this was the easiest mystery to guess in the history of the show. From the way you walked out , to the super obvious clues and your one-of-a-kind voice it seemed almost too easy.  What do we say when we pick up the phone? “Heloooooooo?” C’mon now, it was the biggest, easiest giveaway! My voice is distinctive like James Earl Jones, like Samuel L. Jackson, like Morgan Freeman. I have the most sampled voice in the history of music and my voice is very, very recognizable. So when you take my voice and match it up with them easy-ass clues… the easiest clues! The first one was “PE.” C’mon now, everybody knows Flavor Flav is Public Enemy! Everybody knows that I’m famous for my hardware that I wear around my neck [holds up giant clock pendant]. It’s clocks. And also the other easy giveaways was the clock belt and they showed the belt twice! I’m like, “C’mon man, everybody knows that’s Flav!” I was trending number 3 on Twitter [after his first episode] and everybody on Twitter was like, “Man, that was the most easiest giveaway ever!” I think they should have did me better. Be honest: Did you want to win? I didn’t go on that show to win. I went on that show to have fun. Did I expect to win? No. But I did want to last a little longer than I did and last as long as I can. At least I could say I had fun. At least I could say I was onstage with one of my favorite people on the planet too, Nick Cannon. I’ve always been a Nick Cannon fan and when Nick said “I know who this is! This is one of my favorite people on the planet!” When he said that, you don’t know how honored I was and how proud I was to hear those words come out of his mouth. ‘Cause before Nick Cannon was Wildin’ Out, I was wildin’ out first, since 1986! The surprising thing was when the judges were trying to guess me… where the hell did they get Tracy Morgan from? [Laughs] The weirdest one was Floyd Mayweather.
