  "text": "Turnstile have shared a double music video for two new songs from Never Enough, “Seein’ Stars” and “Birds,” the first of which features vocals by Paramore’s Hayley Williams and Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes. Watch the new video below.Singer Brendan Yates and guitarist Pat McCrory directed the new Turnstile video. The visual opens on a pair of leather-clad people embracing under a disco ball and slowly zooms backward to reveal kids jumping in white outfits, two elder people dancing by a radio, a family nursing their infant by a game of pool, and more. Halfway through, it cuts to a shot of drummer Daniel Fang holding his sticks in the air on a remote, scenic stage before the rest of Turnstile joins him for a raucous hardcore performance.Never Enough is Turnstile’s long-awaited follow-up to their breakout album, Glow On. It arrives June 6 via Roadrunner. Leading the full-length is the title song, which came with a music video that was also directed by Yates and McCrory. Recorded in Los Angeles and Baltimore, Never Enough was produced by Yates and is the band’s first LP to feature guitarist Meg Mills, who replaced founding guitarist Brady Ebery following his departure.",
