  "text": "Gomez might have been inspired by Swift on \"Younger and Hotter Than Me.\" Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards held at Prudential Center on Sept. 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey. Christopher Polk Selena Gomez dropped her new joint album with fiancé Benny Blanco, I Said I Love You First, on Friday (March 21), and fans believe the superstar took a lyrical page out of her best friend Taylor Swift‘s book on one of the tracks. In the track “Younger and Hotter Than Me,” in which Gomez reflects on getting older and the insecurities that, at times, come along with it. “We’re not gettin’ any younger/ But your girlfriends seem to,” she sings in the chorus. Upon hearing the song, fans called out that the line may be in reference to Swift’s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version),” in which she sings, “And I was never good at tellin’ jokes, but the punch line goes/ ‘I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.'” Trending on Billboard “woah. the subject matter of this song is reminiscent of all too well a bit, especially with the ‘we’re not getting any younger, but your girlfriends seem to’ line. sonically it’s perfect for selena’s voice as well,'” one fan wrote on X, with another echoing the same sentiment, noting, “younger and hotter than me by Selena reminds me of All Too Well (10 Min Version) by Taylor.” “All too well [hand shake emoji] younger and hotter than me,” another wrote, alongside side-by-side comparisons of the lyrics. Gomez hasn’t confirmed that the lyrics were inspired by Swift, making it just a fan theory for now. Gomez has previously opened up about sharing her music with Swift. Back in 2019, she recalled showing her first Hot 100 No. 1 hit, “Lose You to Love Me,” with her pop superstar bestie, noting that it made her and her mother Andrea Swift cry. It’s gonna make me cry thinking about it,” Gomez said. “Because it wasn’t just about how great the song was, which is a lot coming from her, it was just that they had been on that journey with me, intimately. And they were crying because of how proud they were for me stepping into a whole new era of my life, and it not involving the horrible things, the abuse, the emotional chaos, it felt like I had a huge sigh of relief.” Swift has also been a massive supporter of Gomez’s music and beyond, often sharing her new releases to her Instagram Stories.
