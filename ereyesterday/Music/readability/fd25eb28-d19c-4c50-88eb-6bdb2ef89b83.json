  "text": "It's well known that Sepultura is coming to an end – hell, they're on their farewell tour. Originally starting at the end of 2024, the \"Celebrating Life Through Death\" tour began in Chicago, but the band are hoping to do a \"very big show in São Paulo, Brazil, or in Belo Horizonte.\" But, the big takeaway from guitarist Andreas Kisser's interview with Germany's Metal Hammer is that \"at the end of 2026, we'd like to do this last show.\" Sepultura have been around for 40 years – they've released 15 records – and have inspired bands such as Alien Weaponry, Bullet For My Valentine, Gojira, Korn and Slipknot, so it's natural that a band with such a vast legacy is ready to preserve it in all of its integrity. With plenty of material to craft a setlist from, the band announced they plan on recording a \"massive compilation of our best, most energetic moments on stage\" of 40 songs in 40 different cities back in 2023, ahead of the commencement of their farewell tour. And – Sepultura don't sound like a band that will be doing multiple farewell tours, rather Kisser said that \"it would be boring to stop Sepultura and do something else that is Sepultura-like.\" So, if you want to see the band now – you're going to have to go abroad. The band wrapped up the North American leg of the tour back in October. Spring break trip, anyone? As for that final Sepultura show, guitarist Andreas Kisser would still love it if former frontman Max Cavalera and former drummer Igor Cavalera could be there. Kisser previously invited the Cavalera brothers to come jam at the final show, though Max has made it clear that he has zero intention of doing so. Still, Kisser said in a recent interview with Reality Check TV that he hopes the Cavalera brothers and other former members can come out and make one final appearance with Sepultura. \"I hope so. The idea is to do a very last show [in 2026] in São Paulo, Brazil, where we have all the guests, friends to celebrate our history,\" said Kisser. \"There's no reason to be fighting. We just go on stage, enjoy ourselves. We know how to play the songs. It's gonna be a party for the fans. Forty years of history, it's a lot — many albums, many different changes and different styles of music. And it's gonna be an amazing party — I hope so — and hopefully everybody will be a part [of it].\" When asked in a 2024 interview with Metal Injection, Max Cavalera said the only reunion that mattered to him was one with Igor. Which has been happening quite extensively as the Cavalera brothers revisit their early Sepultura material. \"The more the time passes by, the more I feel that I don't need to. Like I said, the real reunion is between myself and Igor, and I did that,\" said Max. \"It's pure magic and amazing what we're doing right now. You kind of have to realize if we end up doing a Sepultura reunion, it's almost like we can't go back to the Cavalera thing, You know? It won't really make sense. \"People probably will be like 'I don't want to go watch Cavalera if they're doing a 'real' reunion.' To me, I don't want to do that because I love what we have here in Cavalera now. It's so bad ass. So yeah, it's definitely out of the question. You can ask Igor the same question. He doesn't want to do it either. I think people can just give up, it's not gonna happen man. It's not gonna happen.\" Want More Metal?
