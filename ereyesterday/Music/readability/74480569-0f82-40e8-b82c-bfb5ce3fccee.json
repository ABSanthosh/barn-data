Olivia Rodrigo attends Netflix's \"Olivia Rodrigo: GUTS World Tour\" Los Angeles Premiere at NYA EAST on October 25, 2024. Emilio Madrid/Getty Images for Netflix Olivia Rodrigo is celebrating the release of her new concert film. During the premiere of Olivia Rodrigo: Guts World Tour in Los Angeles on Friday (Oct. 25), the 21-year-old pop star walked the red carpet in support of her forthcoming movie, which was filmed over two shows at L.A.’s Intuit Dome in August. The singer-songwriter, who graces the new cover of Billboard, took a moment to reflect on the Guts World Tour film, reminisce about her recent Billboard photoshoot, and the discuss the support she’s received from friends like fellow musician Chappell Roan, who was in attendance at Friday’s premiere. “I love all my friends who make music and it was so sweet that some of them came by to support me. It means the world,” Rodrigo told Billboard News‘ Tetris Kelly. Other stars in attendance at the L.A. event included singer-songwriter Laufey, actress Xochitl Gomez, and alt-pop artist Remi Wolf. Trending on Billboard Asked what type of advice she’s given to Roan, who’s been outspoken about her mental health issues, Rodrigo said: “She actually gives me so much advice on taking care of myself and being me in an industry that’s so overwhelming sometimes. I really appreciate her. If I give her any advice, I’m not so sure. But I get a lot from her.” Rodrigo also reflected on the photoshoot for her recent Billboard cover. “It was incredible. We shot that whole cover right before a show. I was worried, ‘Like, I don’t have a lot of time,’ but I love the photos. It turned out great. Your team killed it, thank you,” the “Vampire” singer said. Guts World Tour premieres through Netflix on Tuesday (Oct. 29). The film documents Rodrigo on her trek in support of her sophomore album, Guts, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2023. Over the past year, the Guts World Tour has traveled through North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. “I’ve never actually gotten to watch the Guts World Tour,” Rodrigo said on the red carpet. “It’s a really fun experience and I just love everyone that’s involved with the show so much — all my band and all my dancers. I’m just such a fan of them, so I was just watching it admiring them the whole time.” And what’s her favorite part of the new concert film? “I’m so excited for everyone to watch ‘All-American B—-,'” she said. “That was my favorite one to perform.” Watch Billboard‘s interview with Rodrigo at the Guts World Tour L.A. premiere on Instagram below.
