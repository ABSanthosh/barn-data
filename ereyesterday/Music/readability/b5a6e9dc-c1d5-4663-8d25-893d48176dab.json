  "text": "Lex Luger, a hip-hop and trap music producer, has released his own AI-powered music model in partnership with BeatStars and Lemonaide.The launch, available through BeatStars’ Collab Club, offers music creators royalty-free WAV and MIDI loops generated in Luger’s signature style for a limited-price of $49.99.The Lex Luger AI Model includes a library of 4- and 8-bar WAV and MIDI loops, a bonus sound pack for early buyers, and entry into a global production challenge with prizes and mentorship.It is cleared for use in projects up to 1 million streams or with a major placement.Luger, a co-founder of 808 Mafia, is known for co-producing tracks like Hard in Da Paint by Waka Flocka Flame, and Jay Z and Kanye West’s H•A•M.The AI model marks the latest partnership between BeatStars and Lemonaide. In 2023, the pair struck a strategic alliance “to establish a precedent for ethical AI business models in the music industry.”Michael “MJ” Jacob, CEO \u0026 Co-Founder of Lemonaide, said: “AI in music is at a turning point. Creators are asking for tools that honor their sound, protect their rights, and elevate their ability to be creative. Collab Club is the answer.”Luger said: “The reason I love this Lemonaide piece is because it’s a genius enhancement for my production.”“I can take their MIDI, drop it in, flip it, and turn it into a whole different melody if I want. That’s what we need. Being able to customize it the way I like is how you get more creative.”“I’m thankful Lex not only embraced the Lemonaide team’s vision of introducing AI models that respect the value of creators’ art, but also partnered with us to bring it to life.”Abe BatshonThe partnership arrives amid growing collaborations between AI companies and artists. Last month, Grammy-winning artist and producer Timbaland launched an AI-focused entertainment venture, called Stage Zero, after he partnered with AI music company Suno. Stage Zero launched with its first AI artist, TaTa.This isn’t the first release under the Collab Club series. The series previously featured producers like Kato On The Track, KXVI and DJ Pain 1.Abe Batshon, Founder \u0026 CEO of BeatStars, said: “The opportunity for this generation of Trap producers to collaborate legally and ethically with a Hip Hop pioneer who helped shape the sound of an entire era in music is insane.”“I’m thankful Lex not only embraced the Lemonaide team’s vision of introducing AI models that respect the value of creators’ art, but also partnered with us to bring it to life.”Music Business Worldwide",
