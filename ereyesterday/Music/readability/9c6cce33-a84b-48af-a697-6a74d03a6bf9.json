Watch it below.As previously reported, “From” features additional guitar by Mk.gee and vocals by Jacob Collier. As part of the rollout for its music video, Vernon is encouraging listeners to call 1-888-FROM-BON and leave a voicemail; both Vernon and Weisberg will be responding to select messages left by fans in the days to come.“From” is the fourth single to be released from SABLE, fABLE, Bon Iver’s fifth studio album and the follow-up to 2019’s i,i.
