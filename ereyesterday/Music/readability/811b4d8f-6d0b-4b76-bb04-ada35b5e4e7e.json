  "text": "Yesterday (December 17), Megan Thee Stallion filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court for a restraining order against Tory Lanez, reports The Associated Press. She claims that Lanez—who shot her multiple times in 2020 and is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence after being found guilty of felony charges of assault with a semiautomatic handgun, carrying a concealed gun in a vehicle, and discharging a firearm in a negligent manner—has been harassing her from prison through third-party surrogates. A court hearing about the order is scheduled for January 9.The Houston rapper’s petition claims prison call logs at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that Lanez, born Daystar Shemuel Shua Peterson, has been coordinating attacks on Megan’s credibility. It points to multiple bloggers allegedly acting her on Lanez’s behalf to make false claims online about the case, including that the gun he used and bullet fragments are missing.“Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,” the petition reads. “Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.” The petition also states that the protective order originally issued to prevent any previous harassment has since expired, and suggests it’s a loophole that exposes victims to further difficulties.After the three-year-long legal battle against Lanez came to an end in 2023, Megan Thee Stallion wrote an op-ed in Elle detailing her thoughts on his guilty verdict. “It was a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them,” she wrote. “As I reflect on the past three years, I view myself as a survivor, because I have truly survived the unimaginable. Not only did I survive being shot by someone I trusted and considered a close friend, but I overcame the public humiliation of having my name and reputation dragged through the mud by that individual for the entire world to see.”",
