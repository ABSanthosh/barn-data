  "text": "She shared teaser art and a pre-save link on Saturday (April 19). Megan Thee Stallion performs at the Coachella Stage during the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival at Empire Polo Club on April 13, 2025 in Indio, California. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella Megan Thee Stallion‘s “Whenever” is arriving in less than a week. The rapper just announced the new song title, along with its scheduled release date of April 25. The reveal came Saturday (April 19) on Meg’s social media accounts, where she posted movie poster-style art — featuring the promo “It’s whatever b—-, it’s whenever h–!” — to tease the upcoming release. The poster depicts her in a two-piece and a cowgirl hat, with a chessboard, a car and a pair of folks with fish heads in the background. The imagery will surely make more sense on Friday. “PRE-SAVE NOW HOTTIES,” she wrote on her post. Fans can pre-save “Whenever” on various music streaming services here. Trending on Billboard The announcement dropped in the midst of Coachella weekend two, for which Megan’s on the lineup Sunday night. Last weekend she surprised the Indio, California, festival crowd with guests including Queen Latifah, Victoria Monét and Ciara during her performance; the show went on even as her mic got cut as she appeared to go over her allotted set time. Meg recently gave an update on her next album. “Act III is being made,” she revealed live on TikTok last month, confirming a single and music video were in the works. “I’m really just trying to figure out who do I want to do features with at this point in life. I only want to do features with people that … one, I haven’t done a feature with yet, and two, that I listen to on my own time — people that I actually, you know, f— with.” She didn’t spoil anything, but did agree that Doechii is “on my album wish list” when she saw her name suggested on the live. Her next LP comes after Megan: Act II, which was released in October as the follow-up to Megan, which debuted just a few months prior, in July.
