  "text": "The festival was able to open the entirety of its site to all attendees Friday (July 18) in Boom, Belgium. People attend the first day of the Tomorrowland electronic music festival, Friday 18 July 2025, in Boom. The first weekend of the 18th edition of the festival takes place at the 'De Schorre' terrain in Boom, from 18 to 20 July. Marius Burgelman / BELGA MAG / Belga via AFP Tomorrowland 2025 opened the entirety of its site to attendees earlier Friday (July 18) in Boom, Belgium, just two days after a fire destroyed the dance festival’s mainstage. The development occurred after the festival announced Thursday (July 17) that it might either sequester a portion of its day one attendees to a stage in the festival’s camping area for sets by the Friday headliners, or open the entire site to all day one guests. Workers on site at the event were able to clear the mainstage area and then construct a new stage setup to host the event’s headlining acts, which on Friday included Nervo, Axwell, Martin Garrix, Alok, Artbat \u0026 Kolsch and Meduza. As seen in the stream and photos shared by the festival on social media, the quickly constructed new mainstage is built from a DJ booth and a wall of LED panels, behind which the remains of the massive structure that burned are visible, along with heavy machinery. Trending on Billboard The set-up can be seen in the event’s livestream, which is being broadcast from several of the festival’s roughly 16 stages. The mainstage lineup is available here and the rest of the performances are available here. No one was injured in the fire, and its cause has not yet been announced. The current situation at Tomorrowland is arguably the best possible outcome following the unprecedented fire. On Wednesday (July 16), the festival advised that there was a chance it might not open at all if the site was determined unsafe by the authorities, but that go-ahead came and the event managed to construct a new mainstage in time to open the entirety of the site. In the hours before the festival opened for its first day on Friday, organizers posted a statement announcing, “Dear People of Tomorrow, WE ARE READY FOR YOU! Our teams are working day and night, with heart and soul, to turn the impossible into reality: Tomorrowland Belgium 2025 will open doors at 14:00. An alternative setup for the beloved Mainstage is planned to open at 16:00, pending any last-minute changes. All artists will perform as scheduled on all other stages as from 14:00. Tomorrowland will unite, stronger than ever!” The first weekend of Tomorrowland 2025 continues until Sunday (July 20), while its second weekend is happening July 25-27.
