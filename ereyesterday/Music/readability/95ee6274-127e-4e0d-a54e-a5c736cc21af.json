  "text": "j-hope of BTS is back, and he’s set to hit the road in 2025 for his very first solo tour. Titled “Hope on the Stage,” the trek will see the rapper and dancer hitting the road just months after the completion of his service period in the South Korean military. Get j-hope Tickets Here j-hope will become the second member of the record-breaking group to tackle a solo tour, following the footsteps of his bandmate SUGA who completed his “D-DAY Tour” in the spring of 2023. Read on for details about j-hope’s 2025 upcoming world tour, and grab tickets for “Hope on the Stage” here. What Is j-hope’s 2025 Tour? Marking the first solo tour for the BTS member, “Hope on the Stage” will kick off at the end of February in Seoul with three shows at the KPSO Dome. The North American leg of the tour begins in March with two nights in New York, which will be followed by shows in Chicago, Mexico City, San Antonio, Oakland, and Los Angeles. From there, the rapper will move on to The Philippines, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Bangkok, Macau, and Taiwan. The tour is currently set to wrap with another set of shows in Japan. “Hope on the Stage” will be a showcase for j-hope, who dropped his first full-length solo album in 2022 with Jack In the Box. In addition to the many tracks he can pull from within the vast BTS discography, j-hope also has two mixtapes and special albums to build out the set list: 2018’s Hope World and the more recent HOPE ON THE STREET VOL.1. While this tour marks the first major outing for j-hope, he’s no stranger to taking the stage on his own. He successfully kicked off his solo chapter by headlining Lollapalooza in 2022 — revisit our review of the performance here. How Can I Get Tickets to j-hope’s “Hope on the Stage” US Tour? The only way to access pre-sale code for j-hope’s US tour will be by confirming membership for the BTS ARMY fan club on Weverse. Registration is now open and will close on Sunday, January 19th at 8:00 p.m. ET. Tickets for the US tour will then become available for those who registered via ARMY pre-sale on Wednesday, January 22nd at 3:00 p.m. ET via Ticketmaster. Should any tickets remain, the general on sale will then take place on Thursday, January 23rd at 3:00 p.m. ET. Note: Ticketing information for the Los Angeles shows at BMO Stadium will be released at a later date due to the ongoing wildfires. Once tickets are on sale, fans can look for deals or get tickets to sold-out j-hope concerts via StubHub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. StubHub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. Who Is Opening for j-hope for “Hope on the Stage?
