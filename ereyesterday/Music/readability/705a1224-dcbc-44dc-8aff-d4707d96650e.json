  "text": "Memories are fleeting, as are live performances, but a feeling can last forever. LSDREAM and CloZee conjured more than enough to share when they took over Seattle's WAMU Theater June 13-14, the penultimate stop on their one-time-only LSZEE tour.To call LSZEE greater than the sum of its parts discredits their individual excellence. Still, they’ve created something most partnerships dream of.It doesn’t sound like pandering when LSDREAM and CloZee reference each other as \"best friends.\" Their chemistry onstage and over wax is palpable. It’s organic chemistry that you can’t teach or synthesize. You either have it or don’t, and LSZEE is subatomically made of it.LSDREAM and CloZee performing at Seattle's WAMU Theater on June 13th, 2025.Tyler HillLSZEE debuted last year, releasing their self-titled debut album and headlining two nights at Colorado’s historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre. A repeat of their Red Rocks performance, one of EDM.com’s top live performances of 2024, would have sufficed. But LSZEE, abundant with creativity, delivered sweeping new sets.CloZee's stage presence is more playful in LSDREAM's company. The latter's energy is even more infectious with the former in the cockpit. This was best illustrated when a long-haired silhouette started dancing on the decks.I informed my friend that it wasn’t Zingara, who performed the night before, but LSDREAM in a pink wig. CloZee was equally alluring in a short, curly hairpiece channeling Napoleon Dynamite. It was unadulterated fun, just as live music should be.The 40-minute LSZEE: ENIGMA MIXTAPE dropped just in time for our road trip to Seattle. It felt like a love letter to the LSZEE journey–bursting with new ideas and bold flips that later came alive on the stage. “WILDSTYLE,” “ETERNAL NOW (LSZEE flip)” and “COYOTE” were among the imaginative tracks reverberating through the crowd.Consecutive shows gave the DJs ample room to pull from their diverse discographies, from popular LSZEE songs like “French Dream,” “Destiny” and “Nighthawk” to classics like “Color of Your Soul.” Each song was thoughtfully synchronized with a colorful array of lasers, lights and psychedelic video effects, eliciting both enthusiasm and euphoria.Scroll to ContinueRecommended Articles\"Euphoric\" precisely describes watching LSZEE in the company of loved ones. But their transportive sound couldn’t completely wall off the outside world. Nor should it have.Tyler HillLove as a principle permeated throughout the show. I nearly missed the duo's “Overthinker” drop while acknowledging LSDREAM’s request to hug the person next to me. Scroll through social media, and you’ll find that same commanding love radiates through the shows’ other performers.LSZEE travelled with a talented supporting brigade. Zingara was a standout act at Shambhala and Bass Canyon last year, making her continued growth even more impressive. Her stage presence is infectious, and she’s tirelessly expanded her repertoire with new tracks and flips. And you can’t talk stage presence without naming Wreckno, who flexed every creative muscle imaginable, rapping and DJing in perfect harmony while mixing in diverse subgenres to engage the crowd.Texas-based producer and guitarist Vincent Antone was the weekend’s biggest surprise. He shredded the electric guitar like a rock star, beautifully melding it throughout his funky bass set. Furthermore, anyone who plays Evalution’s remix of Wolfmother's “Joker and the Thief” surely has good taste.LSZEE has previously announced this would be their only tour, though they have several one-off festival performances booked. Life is finite, and selfishly, it’s something I hope to experience again.For now, the curtain has closed after LSDREAM and CloZee concluded their 15-city tour with four dates at Denver's storied Mission Ballroom from June 19-22.If they truly tie the knot on touring together, those in The Mile High City witnessed something special.Follow CloZee:X: x.com/clozeemusicInstagram: instagram.com/clozeemusicTikTok: tiktok.com/@clozeeofficialFacebook: facebook.com/clozeeSpotify: spoti.fi/2AvsgHaFollow LSDREAM:X: x.com/lsdreamInstagram: instagram.com/lsdreamTikTik: tiktok.com/@lsdreamFacebook: facebook.com/lsdreammusicSpotify: spoti.fi/3mpNB7m",
