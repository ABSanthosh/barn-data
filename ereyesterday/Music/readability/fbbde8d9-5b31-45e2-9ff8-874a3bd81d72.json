  "text": "Killswitch Engage is now streaming \"Blood Upon The Ashes\", a B-side from their latest record This Consequence. The song is featured on the upcoming compilation The Dogs of Hope, a new compilation \"created raise critical funds for the Randolph County Animal Shelter in rural Alabama—a no-kill, privately run facility that’s saved thousands of animal lives despite operating without public funding or county support.\" The Dogs of Hope runs as follows, with pre-orders available here: Walter Schreifels – \"Pigs On The Wing (Part 1)\" (Pink Floyd cover) Alex Skolnick – \"Disruption\" Killswitch Engage – \"Blood Upon The Ashes\" Snapcase – \"Back To Square One\" (Zero Tolerance cover) Jeromes Dream – \"The Seventeen Downton\" Death Ray Vision – \"Only Wolves Remains\" Orange 9mm – \"Pretend I’m Human\" (2025) Deadguy – \"Makeshift Black Metal Smasher\" Lybica – \"Phaser\" Roman Candle – \"How To Be Considered When You’re Not In The Room\" Drought – \"Abattoir\" Enforced – \"Radiation Sickness\" Taken – \"D4\" Walter Schreifels – \"Pigs On The Wing (Part 2)\" (Pink Floyd cover) \"'Blood Upon The Ashes' is a song about struggle, sacrifice, and redemption,\" said Killswitch Engage vocalist Jesse Leach. \"The lyrics read a bit like a story that's inspired by what we go through in the human experience. I was picturing a war-torn city and people coming together to rebuild it—while the 'blood' signifies the sacrifice people make for each other in times of need. As much as it's based on humanity and everything people are going through in a world riddled with war, it's also a post apocalyptic story.\" Killswitch Engage bassist Mike D'Antonio added: \"For me, 'Blood Upon The Ashes' is 'the one that got away.' Although I was fighting hard for it, this track didn't get the votes to be included in the final, 10-song 'This Consequence' record. So close. Alas, one of my favorite songs is now a b-side. Have no fear, however, The Dogs Of Hope animal shelter benefit is the perfect place for it to live and regain new life. I'm really excited for people to hear it 'cus every time I do, there's regret for not including it on the album. Enjoy.\" Want More Metal?
