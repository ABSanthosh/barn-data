  "text": "While Wicked hasn‚Äôt wrapped up its theatrical run quite yet, many fans are already gearing up for the sequel ‚Äî and so is Universal Pictures. The studio has set the film for release on November 21st, 2025, and has officially retitled the project Wicked: For Good. Named after a duet from the second act of Stephen Sondheim and Winnie Holzman‚Äôs musical, Wicked: For Good was filmed back-to-back with the first film. It will see the return of Cynthia Erivo‚Äôs Elphaba and Ariana Grande‚Äôs Glinda as they pick up where they left off following ‚ÄúDefying Gravity.‚Äù Despite Mattel‚Äôs X-rated blunder, Wicked proved to be one of the more successful films of the year, having grossed $525 million at the global box office on its $145 million budget thus far. For fans looking for an excuse to see it again, sing-along screenings of the movie musical will go down at over 1,000 theaters starting Christmas Day. Revisit our review of¬†Wicked¬†here.
