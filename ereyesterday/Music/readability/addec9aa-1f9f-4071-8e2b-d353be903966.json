  "text": "In a recent conversation with The Guardian, hip-hop icon, actor, and director Ice-T reflected on the aftermath of the band's protest song \"Cop Killer,\" released back in 1992. The track, which described a violent revenge fantasy involving a sawed-off shotgun used to \"dust some cops off,\" caused widespread outrage upon its release. \"Cop Killer\" was subsequently removed it from later editions of Body Count's self-titled album, a decision that was reportedly made at Ice-T's request after Warner Brothers faced immense pressure. Shareholders threatened to pull out of the company due to the song's contentious nature, which led to its eventual removal. Body Count even faced threats of arrest if they attempted to perform the song live. When asked if he ever second-guessed the decision to release such a provocative song amidst the uproar, Ice-T responded: \"I never really questioned myself, but the heat came when they started sending bomb threats to Warner Brothers. I threw the rock; that's my heat. But when other people could get hurt, that's nerve-racking. But I got news for people: anybody who thinks controversy is a way to make money, it's not. You get a lot of buzz, but now you need lawyers. So don't just say something stupid and then backpedal. If you're going to say something, stand on it.\" Reflecting on the song's reception over the years, Ice-T told The Washington Post four years ago that he wonders if people today might understand \"Cop Killer\" better than they did back in 1992. He said, \"It was a song about somebody who, during a moment like this, got so mad that they went after the cops. We don't want that guy. But a lot of times you warn people by saying this can happen. I never killed no cop. I've written better songs that are more on point with what I believe today. I was a little more radical back then. 'No Lives Matter' addresses my feelings at this moment. You got to remember, 32-years-ago Ice is different than now-66-year-old Ice.\" At the height of the \"Cop Killer\" controversy, Ice-T explained that his decision to pull the track was also driven by concern for the safety of the staff at Warner Bros. Records and Sire Records. According to Ice-T, employees had received death threats from law enforcement due to their involvement in distributing the song. This added pressure weighed heavily on him and motivated his choice to remove the track. As part of the arrangement to take \"Cop Killer\" off future versions of the Body Count album, Warner Brothers handed over the masters of the album to Ice-T, giving him full ownership of the record. According to Billboard, \"Cop Killer\" remains conspicuously absent from all major streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. The track is also unavailable for purchase as an iTunes download or as part of the newly pressed CD. Want More Metal?
