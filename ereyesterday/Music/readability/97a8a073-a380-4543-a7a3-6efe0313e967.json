  "text": "Bleed From Within is now streaming their stomping new single \"God Complex\" from the upcoming record Zenith, due out April 4. It's a total behemoth of a track that'll kick your ass clean into next week, so y'know – be careful. Pre-orders for Zenith are available here. \"'God Complex' is the anthem in Zenith. We had a great time putting this together; not overthinking it and letting the groove carry the song,\" wrote Bleed From Within of the single. \"The song always stood out, but Kennedy's vocal performance really pushed it to the forefront of the album. \"It's a song about ego and what it means to us, to you, to everyone. This industry is plagued by those who have a heightened version of themselves but even in everyday life, it is clear to see those that put themselves above others.\" Catch Bleed From Within on tour with Trivium, Bullet For My Valentine, and August Burns Red this April and May.
