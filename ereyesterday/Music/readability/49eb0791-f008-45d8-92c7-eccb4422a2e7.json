  "text": "The British DJ and producer Leon Vynehall will release a new album, In Daytona Yellow, on September 19, via his own label, Ooze Inc. Leading the follow-up to 2021’s Rare, Forever is a collaboration with the London-based artist Poison Anna titled “Mirror’s Edge.” Listen to the new song below.“You use a glass mirror to see your face; you use art to see your soul,” Vynehall said of his new single in a statement. “I made a quip about Roberta Flack’s ‘The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face’ and how it would be an interesting concept to write a song like that, but it’s about yourself. When I put it against the story of the album, I wanted to expand it and explore the duality between ego sex and ego death. Self-loating and self-love. A narcissism, or, more appropriately, an unfamiliar vanity. Something that feels like it's too good to be true—fleeting.”Discussing the new album, Vynehall added, “It’s about the rejection of perfection and embracing vulnerability. I wanted to let go of that pressure—to say goodbye to a former version of myself and move forward.”Read about Leon Vynehall’s Rojus (Designed to Dance) in “The 20 Best Electronic Albums of 2016.”In Daytona Yellow:01 Life Is Not Enough02 Mirror’s Edge [ft.
