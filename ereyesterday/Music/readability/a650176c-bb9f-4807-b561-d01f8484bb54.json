  "text": "Although Oasis’ highly anticipated tour doesn’t kick off until July, Liam Gallagher has spent 2024 hitting all the right notes — at least according to PETA. After sharing the story of adopting his dog, Buttons, the animal rights organization has chosen to gift him the Strike the Right Chord for Animals Award. Gallagher adopted the dog, which had been abandoned in Thailand, back in 2023. Since then, he’s been sharing snippets of life with Buttons on social media; scroll below for some highlights.

We’re so lucky to have her; we’re obsessed. I thoroughly recommend adopting a homeless dog.” “Liam’s compassionate move comes at a time when animal shelters across the UK and elsewhere are reporting spiking numbers of animal abandonment cases,” noted PETA. “By opening his heart and home to a dog desperately in need of a loving family, Liam has set a wonderful example for his legions of fans unlike other out-of-touch celebrities who purchase ‘pedigree’ breeds.” “Let there be love for animals in shelters,” the organization continued, referencing the band’s 2005 song. As we inch closer to the Oasis reunion tour, Liam previously stated that he and his brother had no intention of doing press throughout the upcoming run. Maybe questions about Buttons will be an exception. Oasis’ first shows since 2009 will see them playing the UK and Ireland, Australia, North America, and South America. Editor’s Note: Here are 10 deep cuts we’d love to see Oasis play on their reunion tour.",
