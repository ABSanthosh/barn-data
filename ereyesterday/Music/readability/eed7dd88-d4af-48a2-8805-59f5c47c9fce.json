  "text": "If one thing is true, it’s that Lady Gaga is a natural performer. While the acclaimed artist has been a staple of pop culture for so long that it’s hard to picture her as a hungry, emerging artist, there was a period of time in which Gaga was still establishing her public persona. During a recent appearance on Hot Ones, she revealed that in those days, she would call clubs and pretend to be her own manager, even using different accents to seal the deal. “I look back on that time so fondly when I would spend the whole day trying to get gigs,” she told host Sean Evans. “I would knock on door after door and say, ‘Can I please play here?’ Or I would call and pretend I was my manager. I would tell people ‘She’s so hot right now.’ Sometimes I would do an accent.” Elsewhere in the episode, the pop star shed light on how her piano background impacts her songwriting process, reflected on her high school cover band Mackin Pulsifer, and successfully ate every spicy wing presented to her. The Hot Ones episode is the latest piece of promotion ahead of Gaga’s seventh studio album, Mayhem, set to arrive on March 7th. During the Grammys, she shared the music video for her latest single, “Abracadabra,” which we hailed as Song of the Week. Watch Gaga’s full appearance on Hot Ones below, and navigate to 7:30 to hear her insights into her creative booking techniques.",
