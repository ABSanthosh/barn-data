Drew Afualo: All right, here we are with the iconic, the legendary, the unbelievably beautiful Megan Moroney. How do you feel being here at Billboard Women in Music? I’m so excited. I mean, we’re just celebrating the girls tonight. So I love it. Love, and you’re persevering — you don’t feel that great? Yeah, I got a shot in my butt, my left butt cheek.  She shared that with me.  So now I shared with everyone. And she’s still here serving. And what are you doing?  Because, Mama ain’t raise no… Exactly. You fill in the blank, exactly. Well, I’m so excited to have you here. I’m gonna do a little fun thing for you. So I’m gonna give you some flowers. These are for you.  Thanks! So I want to give you your flowers-  Are they real? They are real.  Cool! Isn’t that so funny. OK, so who do you give your flowers to for getting you where you are now?  My mom.  That’s so common tonight. I love that. Moms, shout ’em out. No, my mom, I feel like, at a very young age, gave me the confidence to be exactly who I am, and she gave me an attitude to match.  Love. I got one for my mom too, period. I love that. OK, so who do you give your flowers to for inspiring your music? Keep watching for more!",
