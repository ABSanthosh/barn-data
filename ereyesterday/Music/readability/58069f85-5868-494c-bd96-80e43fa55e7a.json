  "text": "The first trailer for Wicked: For Good, the upcoming second and final installation of the Wicked film franchise, has arrived. With Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande reprising their roles as Elphaba and Glinda, the trailer offers the first glimpse of the highly-anticipated sequel, which will premiere in theaters on November 21st. Watch it below. In addition to Erivo and Grande, cast members Jonathan Bailey, Jeff Goldblum, Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh, Bowen Yang, and others will return to reprise their roles. Plot-wise, the film picks up where the first left off, tracing the unraveling of Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship — just as Dorothy enters the story and begins to shape the legend of the Wicked Witch. The first installment of Wicked — dubbed Wicked: Part One — debuted in November 2024, and became one of the major film hits of the year, even earning a place among Consequence’s round up of 2024’s best movies. In December, it was announced that the sequel would be titled Wicked: For Good.",
