  "text": "Former Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera and his brother Igor have so far re-recorded three of their Sepultura efforts – Bestial Devastation from 1985, Morbid Visions from 1986, and Schizophrenia from 1987. So the next logical step would be to tackle Beneath The Remains from 1987 and go from there, right? Nope. According to Cavalera in an interview with Oran O'Beirne of Overdrive, he feels the first three Sepultura efforts needed to be re-recorded because they didn't sound great. \"Fans have asked us that, and there's both sides of the argument. Some people say we should do the other ones, but I think it's okay. I think those three are the ones that really needed it, because they were done in Brazil. Once Scott Burns got involved… I don't have a problem with the Beneath The Remains sound. I think it sounds great. It has that Scott Burns sound that is a stamp of the death metal sound of the era. And I wouldn't dare touch Chaos A.D. and Roots.\" There's definitely a small part of me that wishes the Cavalera brothers would re-record Roots, just to see how they revisit all that nü-metal goodness knowing how the genre would eventually evolve. As for Chaos A.D., there may very well be a Cavalera tour around that one. \"We kind of know our barriers and we know our limitations, which is good. Some bands don't — some people don't; they just keep going. I think we're gonna play a live it, though. I would love to see a Chaos A.D. tour… That's totally on the table. That's on the table.\" The Cavalera brothers going out and touring on their old Sepultura albums seems like it has the potential to really blow up, considering Sepultura themselves are currently out on their farewell tour. And no, there won't be a Sepultura/Cavalera reunion happening during those shows. Want More Metal?
