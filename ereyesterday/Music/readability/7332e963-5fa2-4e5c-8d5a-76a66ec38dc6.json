  "text": "Every week, Consequence’s Songs of the Week column spotlights the best new tracks from the previous seven days and takes a look at notable releases. Find our new favorites and more on our Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, you can listen to our New Sounds playlist. This week, PinkPantheress, S. G. Goodman, The Marías, and many more have unveiled new tracks. Staff Picks: March 28th – April 4th 2025 2hollis — “you” 2hollis is back with his latest collection of songs, star, and nearly all of them are floor-filling bangers. One of the most infectious slices of dance pop comes with the Eurotrance-influenced “you,” which moves at such a frenetic pace that it’s surprising Hollis doesn’t let the song fully collapse (like on prior tracks “two bad” and “gold”). What’s so wonderful about “you,” and star as a whole, is the tension between Hollis’ icy distance on the mic and the chaotic rattle of the beats that follow; he’s seemingly a master of this kind of glitched out, paranoid dance music, cathartic at one moment and terrifying the next. While “you” is a cleaner offering overall, it’s yet another great example of 2hollis’ remarkable pop vision. — Paolo Ragusa By Storm — “Double Trio 2” By Storm, the new(ish) outsider hip-hop group formed by the surviving members of Injury Reserve, returned this week with a sequel to their debut single, “Double Trio.” The first track under the name served as a transition between the two projects, and now “Double Trio 2” showcases how rapper Ritchie with a T and producer Parker Corey are continuing to sharpen their artistic vision. The beat is ethereal and intense — an energy that’s matched by the vocal performance — and the bars boldly stare down the experience of grief. It really hits. — Jonah Krueger Dazy — “Pay No Mind (To the Signs)” Dazy has had quite the year already: After releasing a 9-track album in January, the Virginia-based musician is back with a fresh single to further charge up his momentum. A whole lot grimier than the tracks on for all i care, “Pay No Mind” features James Goodson laying his spacey vocals over a thick layer of distorted fuzz, held firmly in place by mechanical percussion underneath it all. Looking at the way things have been going so far, he’s projected to keep getting better as the year progresses. — Karan Singh",
