  "text": "Back in the early 1980s, if you were picking up a guitar with dreams of making it big in metal, there was one clear path: mastering lightning-fast solos in the vein of Eddie Van Halen or Randy Rhoads. For many young players, it seemed that rhythm guitar and songwriting took a backseat to show-stopping lead work. Yet the rise of thrash metal at the end of the 80s shifted those priorities. The genre put a spotlight on tight, aggressive rhythm playing. Just think of the commanding chops from Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, James Hetfield of Metallica, Scott Ian of Anthrax, and both guitarists from Slayer. And right there with them was Eric Peterson of Testament. During a recent appearance on the Scars and Guitars Podcast, Peterson reflected on his early days in the scene—and how a dose of humility shaped his approach to guitar. \"When I started out, there were a lot of guitar players better than me,\" Peterson admitted (as transcribed by Ultimate Guitar). \"But what I think what did it for me was I had a vision of what I wanted the band to sound like, and the whole concept of everything. Rather than just being a shredder. Which I kind of do now. It's funny, because here we are 30 years later, and now I'm starting to do solos.\" That clarity of vision was key. Instead of getting lost in the competitive world of lead guitar, Peterson honed the rhythm playing and songwriting that would become a signature of Testament’s sound. Notably, he remains the only continuous member of the band since its formation in 1983—a testament (pun unintended) to his role in steering its direction. Looking back, Peterson credits a wide range of influences for shaping his approach: \"But I think back then, it was just about having great songs, and there were so many bands to be influenced by,\" he explained. \"All these bands like Mercyful Fate, a lot of the darker New Wave of British Heavy Metal kind of bands were for me.\" And when it came to crafting Testament’s identity? \"But I think that's how we went in it, we went in to…this is what we want to do.\" For up-and-coming guitarists, Peterson’s story offers a valuable insight: you don’t need to be the fastest or flashiest player in the room. Sometimes, a clear vision and solid foundation can carry you further, and in Peterson’s case, it’s worked for over four decades. Want More Metal?
