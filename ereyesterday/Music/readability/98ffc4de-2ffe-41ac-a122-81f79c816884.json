  "text": "Sikth – currently their classic lineup of Mikee Goodman, Dan Weller, Graham \"Pin\" Pinney, Dan \"Loord\" Foord, James Leach, and Justin Hill – is set to return in 2026 for two very special shows in the UK! Sikth will perform their 2006 album Death of a Dead Day in full at two 20th anniversary shows in Manchester and London. Both shows will be opened by Heriot. Here's hoping this also means Sikth is returning to being a band a little more than they are, as Sikth has historically always ruled. Those two dates are: 2/25 Manchester, UK Academy 22/28 London, UK O2 Forum Kentish Town Want More Metal?
