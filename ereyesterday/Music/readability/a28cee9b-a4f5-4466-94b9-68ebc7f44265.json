Buy The Who Tickets HereThe Who, photo by William Synder In Their Own Words: The Who on Their Final Tour In announcing the farewell tour, Roger Daltrey reflected on the band’s journey, saying: “Every musician’s dream in the early 60’s was to make it big in the US charts. For the Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever. The warmth of the American audiences over the years have been inspirational to me… It’s not easy to end the big part of my life that touring with The Who has been. Thanks for being there for us and look forward to seeing you one last time.” Pete Townshend added: “Well, all good things must come to an end. It is a poignant time… Roger and I still carry the banner for the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle and of course, all of our longtime Who fans… This tour will be about fond memories, love and laughter. Make sure you join in.” What to Expect at The Who’s Farewell Shows While no setlist has been officially announced, fans can expect the band to perform their greatest hits from their illustrious career.
