Can’t wait!”Fair warning: As in previous years, we expect all Diamond and Platinum tables for the Music Business UK Awards to sell out QUICKLY, ahead of the nominee shortlists being announced in September.For 2025 tickets and table information please visit the official Music Business UK Awards website, or email Rebecca@musicbizworldwide.com.To lock in one of a limited number of sponsorship opportunities, please contact Dave@musicbizworldwide.com.Music Business Worldwide",
