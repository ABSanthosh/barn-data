  "text": "Even while spending the last five years preparing to play Bob Dylanâ€”including learning 30 of his songs for the biopic A Complete Unknownâ€”TimothÃ©e Chalamet has apparently not missed a single major college football game. Or even the mid-majors. The actor (sporting a puffy pink jacket, natch) appeared on ESPNâ€™s College GameDay in Atlanta on Saturday, where he impressed hosts Pat McAfee and Kirk Herbstreit with his wealth of knowledge and interesting tidbits while predicting six weekend winners. And his picks are already paying off, as he was the only one on set to choose Ohio to defeat Miami (Ohio). Of course Chalametâ€™s talents extend well beyond picking college football winners. His performance in A Complete Unknown has earned rave reviews, including from Dylan himself. Here at Consequence, we named it one of the 25 best films of the year.
