  "text": "After a seven-year wait, Gruesome – the old-school death metal band inspired by the legendary Chuck Schuldiner and the many iterations of Death – are kicking things into gear with the announcement of their new album, Silent Echoes, set for release on June 6, 2025, via Relapse Records. The first glimpse into the record comes in the form of \"A Darkened Window\", which arrived alongside an official music video directed by The Coin. The band explained their vision behind the track, saying: \"'A Darkened Window' was the perfect song to pair with the visuals of The Coin, who captured the existential despair of lyrics perfectly – a vision of modern existence where every human emotion can be commoditized and therefore must be groomed, filtered, and corrected into something synthetic and horrifying.\" While the band’s foundation in classic death metal is still very much in place, Silent Echoes diverges from the straight-ahead brutality of Savage Lands and Twisted Prayers. According to the band, the record delves into deeper waters, leaning into complexity and technicality reminiscent of Death's landmark 1991 record Human. The album's deliberate sonic evolution is a homage to their late mentor, Sean Reinert, the legendary drummer known for his work with Cynic and Death. Originally set to produce the album, Reinert passed away unexpectedly in 2020. His loss left a lasting mark on the band, especially drummer Gus Rios, who was also Reinert’s best friend. In the wake of that loss, Rios, along with vocalist/guitarist Matt Harvey, lead guitarist Daniel Gonzalez, and bassist Robin Mazen, decided to turn Silent Echoes into a memorial. Reinert’s spirit permeates the entire record — from its intricate rhythms to the reflective, almost spiritual approach to songwriting. \"There’s less winking at the audience on this one,\" says Harvey, capturing the more sincere and focused energy of the album.
