Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET Mariah Carey is about to announce MC16, her long-awaited new album. Just a day after previewing a new song called “Sugar Sweet,” the “Type Dangerous” singer dropped another teaser — this time for her upcoming, as-yet-untitled LP that will be the follow-up to 2018’s Caution. Carey released a video celebrating her discography on Sunday (July 20) via her social media accounts, counting up from MC1 — her self-titled debut — through MC15, aka Caution. At the very end of the 37-second clip, the text “MC16” appears. Her post on X featuring the clip shows the title “MC16 – Announcement Tomorrow,” indicating that album details will be revealed Monday (July 21). Though details are currently scarce — though fans will hopefully have more information to obsess over on Monday — last month the pop star did confirm that her new album is complete. Trending on Billboard “What is next? The album coming out. I don’t wanna tell too much about it because I just don’t want to reveal the whole thing. It’s finished,” she revealed in an Apple Music interview in June. Carey released “Type Dangerous” in June and has another single, “Sugar Sweet” — in which she sings, “Imma keep it nice, Imma keep it neat, Imma keep it sugar, Imma keep it sweet” — to come. She uploaded a sneak peak of the light pop track playing in a cute clip of herself baking something in the kitchen on Saturday. “Type Dangerous” was recently hyped with a remix EP release featuring collabs with the likes of Big Sean, DJ Snake and Method Man.
