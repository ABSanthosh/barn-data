  "text": "MJ Lenderman is the subject of a new profile in GQ. And, in the article, written by longtime Pitchfork contributor Grayson Haver Currin, it’s revealed that the Asheville, North Carolina, indie-rocker will no longer tour with Wednesday. He will, however, continue to make recorded music with the band. (Representatives for Wednesday and Lenderman confirmed the new development to Pitchfork.)Lenderman joined Wednesday in 2020 at the behest of lead singer Karly Hartzman, who had launched the band as a solo project in 2017. The two musicians also dated for a number of years, but they are no longer in a romantic relationship.Lenderman played his final show with Wednesday earlier this year in Japan, he told Currin for GQ. The man replacing Lenderman in the live Wednesday lineup is apparently named Jake, but a representative for the group had no further information to share on the new member.Lenderman released his breakout solo album, Boat Songs, in 2022. The following year, Wednesday shared their biggest record to date, Rat Saw God, and, in 2024, Lenderman continued his solo ascent with Manning Fireworks. He and his band, the Wind, are on tour for much of this year.Head to GQ for the full new profile “The MJ Lenderman Story You Haven’t Heard.”",
