The beloved musician shares his journey of performing on the main stage at Coachella, discusses the new ideas he’s bringing to Stagecoach, reflects on Beyoncé, Shaboozey and other Black musicians breaking through in country music, talks about how Wiscansin Fest came to life and how he got GloRilla to join, and opens up about his resurgence and more! Are you excited to see T-Pain at Stagecoach? Let us know in the comments below! Tetris Kelly: Out here in Indio, hanging out with my boy T-Pain, this is what? Weekend three of this for you?  T-Pain: Weekend three!  Most people say Oh, weekend one, weekend two… weekend three. This is three for T-Pain, this is wild, man, I’m so proud of you, but you’ve been streaming the whole time, like, keeping people involved. So how’s that been to, like, have people along for this journey? It’s OK, man, you know what I’m saying? It’s, it’s, it’s more frustrating than anything. Can’t get in the pool as much as I want to. That’s why I’m so ashy right now. Just got out the pool. So, you know, everything, I’m just ash. I’m just made of all ash. Living the life. And I mean, how is it to, like, kind of have people in your personal space? Because, like, some people, I don’t know how many hours you do in sets, but like, when you got a shower, use the bathroom, you need some private time. Like, how was it to be doing that?  I don’t really have, like, personal time, you know what I mean? Like, I’ve grown up, like I got signed when I was 18. So I don’t, I don’t even know what personal life is like, you know what I’m saying? So it’s always been public. You know, going to the bathroom is pretty easy, set the camera just right above, right above the nipple, but no man, people know. You know people understand. Like, when you’re letting them into your life, you can leave them in places.  Keep watching for more!",
