Bruce Springsteen performs before former U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign rally in support of Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris at Temple University on October 28, 2024 in Philadelphia. Debra L Rothenberg/WireImage Bruce Springsteen is hoping to inspire voters in a new advertisement for the Harris-Walz campaign. On Friday (Nov. 1), just days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the Boss shared a minute-long video featuring his late October appearance during a rally for the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee at Temple University’s Liacouras Center in Philadelphia. In the clip, titled “Hopes and Dreams” (a reference to his 2001 song “Land of Hope and Dreams”), Springsteen criticizes Donald Trump and explains why Americans should support Harris and Halz on Election Day this Tuesday. “This election is about a group of folks who want to fundamentally undermine our American way of life. Donald Trump does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American,” Springsteen tells the Pennsylvania crowd. “I want a president who reveres the Constitution, who wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for women’s rights and a woman’s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle class economy that serves all our citizens.” The iconic singer-songwriter adds, “There’s only one candidate who holds those principles dear, that’s Kamala Harris. At thats’ why on Nov. 5, I’m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I urge all of you who believe in the American way to join me.” Trending on Billboard At the rally in Pennsylvania on Oct. 28, Springsteen shared the stage with fellow musician John Legend, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, and former President Barack Obama. The E Street rocker launched his three-song acoustic set with a rendition of his 1978 single “The Promised Land,” followed by a performance of “Land of Hope and Dreams.” He closed the set with “Dancing in the Dark,” which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1984, making it the highest-charting song of his career. The Boss’s appearance at the Philadelphia rally came just days after he joined Harris’s rally in Georgia, where he told supporters that while the current VP is “running to be the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant.” Watch Springsteen’s “Hopes and Dreams” Harris-Walz campaign ad below.
