  "text": "Despite having disappeared from all their social media after being accused of stealing the artwork for their upcoming farewell tour, things are still a go! Oceano has provided a brief update noting that their farewell tour will now feature I Declare War, Escuela Grind, Filth, BackBiter in place of See You Next Tuesday who dropped off after the poster debacle. For those somehow unaware of this ongoing drama, it all started when Oceano revealed they'd sadly be coming to an end in 2025 in the wake of some drama regarding their plans to tour with Attila and Dealer. Oceano will end after a string of shows this May, which hopefully we won't have to report on anymore in terms of drama. Get those dates below and get your tickets here. Oceano was a band between 2006 and 2025. The band released six full length albums, their final effort being Living Chaos released via Sumerian Records in 2024. 5/13 Indianapolis, IN Black Circle5/14 Louisville, KY Bourbon Hall5/15 Cleveland, OH Grog Shop5/16 Columbus, OH The King of Clubs5/17 Detroit, MI The Sanctuary5/18 Lansing, MI Grewal Hall5/20 Bloomington, IL The Castle Theatre5/21 Milwaukee, WI X-Ray Arcade5/22 Minneapolis, MN The Underground5/23 St. Louis, MO Red Flag5/24 Des Moines, IA Wooly's Want More Metal?
