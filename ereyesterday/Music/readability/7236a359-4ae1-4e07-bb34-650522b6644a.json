  "text": "Jessie Ware and Salute have come together for a new song. Listen to “Heaven in Your Arms,” out via Ninja Tune, below.In a press release, Ware said of the collaboration, “I’ve been a fan of Salute for a while and caught their set in Sónar this summer. From that point I was determined to work with them. Salute sent me a load of tracks and this beat stood out. I wanted to make something optimistic and romantic. It reminds me of the garage I used to dance to in my teens, but, of course, with Salute’s unique and futuristic sound it feels brand new! I love the song and to see how it’s been going down in Salute’s shows in the states makes me so excited to perform it with them one day, or two!”The track follows Salute’s debut album, True Magic, released in March. Since That! Feels Good!, Ware has collaborated with Romy on “Lift You Up.”",
