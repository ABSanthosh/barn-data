  "text": "Way back before Krysta Cameron was fronting Iwrestledabearonce, she was in a pretty kickass band called This Year's Addiction. The soon-to-be-legendary record label Been There Scene That has reissued This Year's Addiction's brief discography and you really need to hear it. I mean yeah, it's only six songs, but they're killer – and a great glimpse into some very MySpace-era deathcore circa 2003. \"Does this band sound familiar to you? Should you get to know this band if it doesn’t? And the answer is YES because it was fronted by Krysta Cameron of IWRESTLEDABEARONCE!\" wrote Been There Scene That of the release and the band. \"This is her old band from Long Island before she made IWABO. This is a very important release not only cause it’s a piece of IWABO history, but because we, as a team are raising money for Jim the bassist who unfortunately passed away and left behind a wife and kids a few years ago so we are donating to his family.\" Get the discography reissue here on Bandcamp and pick up a CD or a tape while you're at here on Been There Scene That's website. This reissue also comes with some sad news as bassist Jim Sarlo died in 2023 in a tragic accident. A Kickstarter campaign has since been launched to help out Sarlo's family, which you can donate too right here. Want More Metal?
