  "text": "Following the news of Brian Wilson’s death, figures from across the music landscape are paying tribute to the iconic Beach Boys musician. “Anyone who really knows me knows how heart broken I am about Brian Wilson passing,” wrote Sean Ono Lennon, whose late father, John Lennon, was a Wilson contemporary and known Beach Boys fan. “Not many people influenced me as much as he did. I feel very lucky that I was able to meet him and spend some time with him. He was always very kind and generous. He was our American Mozart. A one of a kind genius from another world.”“The maestro has passed - Brian was a raw open heart with two legs - and an ear that heard the angels - quite literally.” John Cusack, who played Wilson in Love \u0026 Mercy, wrote. “He was touched. To see him so happy with his wife Melinda - finally talking about and performing his unfinished masterpiece Smile , (after the release of the astounding Smile sessions) - to hear him be so open about the depth of his struggles so that the telling of his story might help others and take away the stigma of mental health - was to see a triumph of endurance and spirit , love and Mercy .”Bob Dylan shared on X: “Heard the sad news about Brian today and thought about all the years I’ve been listening to him and admiring his genius. Rest in peace dear Brian.”One of Wilson’s former Beach Boys bandmates, Al Jardine, said in a press statement: “Brian Wilson, my friend, my classmate, my football teammate, my Beach Boy bandmate and my brother in spirit, I will always feel blessed that you were in our lives for as long as you were. I think the most comforting thought right now is that you are reunited with Carl and Dennis, singing those beautiful harmonies again. You were a humble giant who always made me laugh and we will celebrate your music forever. Brian, I’ll really miss you…still I have the warmth of the sun within me tonight ☀️ 🎶 ❤️.”Another former bandmate, Mike Love, wrote, in part, on Instagram, “Today, the world lost a genius, and I lost a cousin by blood and my partner in music.” He added, “Brian Wilson wasn’t just the heart of The Beach Boys—he was the soul of our sound.”“I’ve know the Beach boys since the mid 60’s and have done lots of shows with them,” Bachman-Turner Overdrive’s Randy Bachman shared. “They were the American answer to the Beatles. They wowed everyone with the songs, structures, vocals harmonies. The sunshine sound. I remember when Brian decided to not go on the road anymore but continued to write incredible music. They were like family.”Questlove also posted a lengthy message about Brian Wilson and his own experiences with the 1966 masterpiece Pet Sounds. “if there was a human being who made art out of inexpressible sadness….damn it was Brian Wilson,” the Roots’ drummer wrote. “I hate he went thru what he went thru to create this album (also: Smile Outakes in my North Star) but man——without him I dunno how so many that came after felt safe to express a feeling of sadness that most humans would be otherwise ridiculed/punished for.”Speaking with Rolling Stone, the Beach Boys’ former manager Fred Vail said, “Sixty-two years, that’s how long we were buddies. Some great memories, some great moments. They all fly back at me: meeting them at the old house in Hawthorne; sitting on the floor at Capitol, when he mastered Pet Sounds; at Columbia, when we recorded ‘Good Vibrations’; and then all the shows at the auditorium in Sacramento that I emceed.”Sir Lucian Grainge, the chairman and chief executive of Universal Music Group, said in a statement: “Brian Wilson was one of the most talented singer-songwriters in the history of recorded music. Not only did his songs capture the spirit of youth, joy and longing in ways that still inspire millions of fans around the world, his innovative work in the studio transformed the way musicians record even to this day. Brian made an indelible mark, and our thoughts are with his family in this time of loss.”Additional figures to pay tribute to Wilson include Nancy Sinatra, Fleetwood Mac’s Mick Fleetwood, Jeff Rosenstock, the Walkmen’s Hamilton Leithauser, Primal Scream, the Avalanches, Dam Funk, the Velvet Underground’s John Cale, the Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood, Home Is Where, No Joy’s Jasamine White-Gluz, Anamanaguchi, Ekko Astral’s Jael Holzman, Speedy Ortiz’s Sadie Dupuis, the Beatles’ Ringo Starr, and the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.",
