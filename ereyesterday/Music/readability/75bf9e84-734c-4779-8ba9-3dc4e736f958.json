  "text": "The actor attended one of Swift's three shows at NOLA's Caesars Superdome. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Swift are seen prior to the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium on Oct. 1, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Elsa/Getty Images Ryan Reynolds is his pal Taylor Swift’s biggest fan! The Deadpool actor took to Instagram on Thursday (Oct. 31) to share a series of photos and videos from one of Swift’s shows at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome, which he attended with his wife Blake Lively and Rufus Wainwright. “When I’m 95 yrs old and my wife and kids wheel me outside and into the sun so I can drink a sandwich, I’ll still be talking about seeing this show in New Orleans,” he began his caption. “Not just because it’s one of the best things I’ve seen/heard/felt. And not only because you see the staggering and positive economic impact this tour has on small businesses all over NOLA — a town that’s been thru so much for so long. The main reason I’ll never forget this show is because it brings people together in so many ways. And in 2024, (where that feeling is scarce as hell) it’s a special and incredibly rare thing.” He continued, “I’ve shot movies in New Orleans most of my career. It’s a special place on a normal day — but this weekend, felt like Super Bowl or Mardi Gras had a baby with music. I don’t understand the unimaginable work, care, talent and discipline @taylorswift generates to create an experience like this because I’m not a scientist. It’s an athletic event and a collective cultural phenomenon. It’s gigantic but intimate. The only bummer is she can’t be in the audience to experience what everyone else sees and feels. To watch herself up there is something I wish she could know. But that isn’t physically possible and even if it were, you can’t just get tickets last minute.” Explore See latest videos, charts and news See his post here. Trending on Billboard Reynolds and Lively are parents to four children — James, Inez, Betty and Olin. Swift has been a close friend of the family for years and even used the names of the three oldest kids in her Folklore love triangle songs. Years prior, she borrowed Reynolds’ Deadpool suit for her 2016 Halloween costume, after which he returned the favor by wearing a tee with her cats Meredith and Olivia on it in Deadpool 2.
