  "text": "The 16-track LP includes collaborations with Travis Scott, Shaboozey, Mick Jagger \u0026 Stromae. Burna Boy Shot By Nee Burna Boy released his eighth studio album No Sign of Weakness late Thursday (July 10) via Spaceship Records, Bad Habit and Atlantic Records. The 16-track project includes previously released singles “Bundle by Bundle,” “Update,” “Sweet Love,” “TaTaTa” (featuring Travis Scott) and “Change Your Mind” (featuring Shaboozey). No Sign of Weakness also includes more collaborations too, with Mick Jagger (“Empty Chairs”) and Stromae (“Pardon”). “TaTaTa” reached No. 2 on U.S. Afrobeats Songs, while “Bundle by Bundle” and “Update” both hit No. 5. “It’s extrospective,” he told Billboard France in his recent cover story. “It’s not just about me but about looking outward, reflecting on the world, and how my experiences connect to the bigger picture. It’s about growth, understanding, and challenging perceptions while staying true to who I am.” Burna is headlining the third and final night of Afro Nation Portugal tonight at the Lit Stage, marking his first time being able to perform songs from the album shortly after its release. Come November, he’ll kick of his headlining No Sign of Weakness Tour at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, becoming the first Nigerian artist to headline the iconic venue. The 17-date trek will also go through major cities including Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta before wrapping up with two dates at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, on Dec. 17 and 18. Trending on Billboard No Sign of Weakness arrives two years after his last album I Told Them…., which was nominated for best global music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Its hit singles “City Boys” and “Sittin’ On Top of the World” (featuring 21 Savage on the remix) also scored Grammy nominations that year, for best African music performance and best melodic rap performance, respectively.
