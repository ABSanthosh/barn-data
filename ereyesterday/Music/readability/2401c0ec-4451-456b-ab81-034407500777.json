  "text": "The word is out: Wednesday has been renewed for a third season, with a spinoff show in the works. The news comes appropriately enough on a Wednesday (July 23rd), just weeks before Season 2 launches on August 6th. Wednesday showrunner Alfred Gough and Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria strongly hinted at the spinoff in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s something we’re definitely noodling. There are other characters we can look at,” Gough said, with Bajaria adding, “There’s a lot to explore in the Addams Family.” This isn’t the first time Gough has alluded to a spinoff. “When you create a world like this, the intention is any one of these characters could be the lead in their own show,” he told THR in November 2022. “Certainly it’s cast that way, when you have Fred Armisen, when you have Catherine Zeta-Jones, when you have Luis Guzmán. It’s certainly something we’ve discussed and would very much like to, in success, really branch out this world beyond just Wednesday.” Season 2 of Wednesday will come in two parts; after debuting on August 6th, the second half of the season will arrive on September 3rd. The show will pick up after a time jump, with a majority of the Season 1 cast returning, with a few new additions. The new season finds Wednesday returning to Nevermore as the school’s hero, whose new mission is thwarting character Enid’s (played by Emma Myers) death, which she sees in visions. Watch the Season 2 trailer below. Season 2 of Wednesday also stars Hunter Doohan, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, and Moosa Mostafa. Season 1 regular Jamie McShane will return as a guest star. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzmán, Isaac Ordonez, and Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo have all been promoted to series regulars. The show’s new season regulars include Steve Buscemi, Billie Piper, Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, and Noah Taylor. Fans can expect guest star appearances from Lady Gaga, Thandie Newton, Heather Matarazzo, Christopher Lloyd, Haley Joel Osment, Joanna Lumley, Frances O’Connor, and Joonas Suotamo.",
