Check out our new favorites and more on our Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, check out our New Sounds playlist. This week, Momma, Weatherday, Uwade, and others deserve your attention. Staff Picks: Best Songs of the Week January 24th — January 31st 2hollis, nate sib — “Afraid” The restless energy that dominates “Afraid” epitomizes both 2hollis and nate sib’s approaches to pop music. The hook is one thing; the skittering synths that bubble with radioactivity, the candy-coated piano line that pops in at the chorus, the throbbing bass beneath their croons, and the overall quick tempo all show that the pair of pop auteurs are firmly in their own lane. They debuted “Afraid” on tour together, with sib opening for Hollis, and that ecstatic meeting of minds is well on display through the track’s accessible flavorings and rousing groove. They’re both having a moment right now, so it’s not too late to get on the 2hollis and nate sib bandwagons. — Paolo Ragusa Hooky \u0026 Winter — “horseshoe” Hooky, the glitch-prone indie rockers from Philly, and Winter, the project of songwriter Samira Winter, have joined forces for the upcoming collaborative EP Water Season. “horseshoe” arrives as the collection’s lead single, and it’s every bit as woozy, delicate, and irresistible as each act’s best work. Low-fi in all the right ways, it’s a perfect little tune that’s sure to appeal to fans of guitar music in the vein of early Alex G or poppy noisemakers like Feeble Little Horse. — Jonah Krueger JayWood – “Big Tings” feat. Tune-Yards Melodic and atmospheric, the latest from alternative hip-hop artist JayWood is pleasantly unpredictable. The genre-fluid performer teamed up with Oakland duo Tune-Yards to bring “Big Tings” to life, and the final product is highly detailed, layered, and lyrically encouraging. JayWood shared that the perspective in the song flip-flops throughout — sometimes he’s hyping up the listener, other times he’s working to hype himself up — but “Big Tings” is easy to get lost in either way. — Mary Siroky",
