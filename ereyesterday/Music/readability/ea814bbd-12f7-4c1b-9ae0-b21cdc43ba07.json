  "text": "Nathan Fielder’s atypical TV show The Rehearsal—in which the comedian, a construction crew, and actors help people “rehearse” future moments in their lives—has a Season 2 release date locked in. The series returns on April 20 on HBO. To mark the occasion, the network has shared a teaser trailer of panning footage from what appears to be a behind-the-scenes moment. You can watch the clip below.The Rehearsal’s new season focuses on how “the urgency of Fielder’s project grows as he decides to put his resources toward an issue that affects us all,” according to HBO. Fielder is once again billed as the star, writer, director, and executive producer.“Nathan has sparked such a lively conversation with The Rehearsal,” Amy Gravitt, the executive vice president of HBO programming, said back in 2022 when announcing the TV show’s renewal. “We have no idea where Season 2 will take us, and that is the delight of this boundary pushing show from a truly singular talent.”The Rehearsal became a viral sensation with its episodic rollout in 2022, namely thanks to its unconventional methods and ability to blur the line between reality and fiction. It’s one part of Fielder’s overall deal with HBO, which also included the beloved docuseries How To With John Wilson, which he executive-produced.",
