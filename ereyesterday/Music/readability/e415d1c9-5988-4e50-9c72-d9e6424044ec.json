  "text": "Foo Fighters have parted ways with Josh Freese, the drummer said on social media today. “The Foo Fighters called me Monday night to let me know they’ve decided ‘to go in a different direction with their drummer,’” Freese wrote. “No reason was given.” He continued, “I enjoyed the past two years with them, both on and off stage, and I support whatever they feel is best for the band.” See his full statement below.Freese formally joined Foo Fighters in 2023, succeeding the late Taylor Hawkins. His final show with the band was a private affair at House of Blues Anaheim last September.It’s currently unclear who will drum for Foo Fighters going forward. For now, their only scheduled performance is at the Singapore Grand Prix on October 4. When reached by Pitchfork, a representative for Foo Fighters had no comment.Josh Freese:The Foo Fighters called me Monday night to let me know they’ve decided “to go in a different direction with their drummer.” No reason was given. : ( Regardless, I enjoyed the past two years with them, both on and off stage, and I support whatever they feel is best for the band. In my 40 years of drumming professionally, I’ve never been let go from a band, so while I’m not angry—just a bit shocked and disappointed. But as most of you know I’ve always worked freelance and bounced between bands so, I’m fine. Stay tuned for my “Top 10 possible reasons Josh got booted from the Foo Fighters” list.Josh",
