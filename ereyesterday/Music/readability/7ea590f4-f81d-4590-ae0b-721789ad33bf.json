  "text": "The drama started over a picture taken by Ross and Big Meech. Rick Ross performs on stage during the Legendz of the Streetz Tour Reloaded at Toyota Center on Feb. 4, 2023 in Houston, Texas. Marcus Ingram/Getty Images Rick Ross and 50 Cent are at it again. This time the veteran rappers and businessmen have been going back and forth over a picture. Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory, who was recently released to a halfway house and has been visited by various celebrities including 50 Cent, linked up with Rick Ross — which has apparently created tension. 50 produces a series on Starz entitled BMF, which is loosely based on the exploits of Big Meech and his younger brother Terry “Southwest T” Flenory, and also stars Meech’s son Demetrius Flenory Jr. The Queens mogul obviously didn’t appreciate the elder Meech hanging out with an adversary and posted (and deleted) his feelings on Instagram. He did, however, post this rundown of the situation by user @sirlancwoods. Ross has now fired back by saying that he’s going to produce a movie about Detroit’s notorious Black Mafia Family. “I wanna do a BMF film because you’ve been entertained by a lackluster, small-budget series,” Ross said about 50’s television show. “Now it’s time to do a big-budget film. Which director? Shout out to my homie F. Gary Gray. Antoine Fuqua, what’s up? Tarantino… there’s a lot of legends. This is gonna be big, I can feel it.” Ross famously has a classic single named “B.M.F.” featuring Styles P that peaked at No. 60 on the Hot 100 and spent 16 weeks on the chart. Trending on Billboard Big Meech hasn’t commented yet on 50’s antics, but his son tried to fix things to no avail. 50 posted then deleted text messages between the two, in which Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr. mentioned that 50 unfollowed him and said that the Miami rapper helped his father out so that he could stay afloat financially “until our next season starts,” referring to BMF‘s upcoming fourth season, to which 50 replied, “What next season.” We’ll have to wait and see if 50 is really trolling or not regarding the show’s fate.
