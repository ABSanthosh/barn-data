  "text": "Nevermore is reactivating in 2025 with half a mystery lineup. Nevermore is currently guitarist Jeff Loomis and drummer Van Williams alongside whoever they've chosen from the onslaught of auditions they've received in the past few months. In a new post from Loomis, all we know is that Nevermore has a new line \"The wait is over! We are beyond excited to announce that after an incredible audition process, we've assembled a lineup that honors our legacy while forging a new path forward,\" said Loomis. \"We want to extend a massive thank you to everyone who took the time to submit auditions. The level of talent and passion we saw was truly inspiring, and we deeply appreciate each and every one of you who put your heart into this process. Your support and patience during this time has meant the world to us, and we can't wait to share what's next! Stay tuned there's a lot coming your way soon! We're gearing up for the next chapter of Nevermore, and we promise it will be worth the wait.\" In a recent interview with Metal Magnitude, Loomis credited reforming Nevermore as part of the reason why he left Arch Enemy, and assures fans that the band's next chapter is going to kick ass. \"Yeah, there's some incredible stuff coming up. I've had a tremendous last 10 years with the band Arch Enemy. I've been a part of their band, and I left the band about a year ago because I wanted to kind of be behind the driver's wheel of my own music again. So I'm reforming my old band called Nevermore. And that was a very big part of my life for a long time. \"And as we all know, the singer Warrel Dane passed away about five years ago. So we're on the search right now for a new vocalist and bass player. And we're gonna come back, and we're gonna revamp the band, and it's gonna be bigger and better than it ever was. So that's the plans for 2025.\" The decision hasn't come without its share of controversy. Jim Sheppard, who was instrumental in founding Nevermore alongside Dane in 1991, first publicly expressed criticism of the reunion, calling it \"completely disrespectful,\" even when at a later point Sheppard sort of gave them his blessing, stating: I'm disappointed no one reached out to me concerning the name Nevermore, a name that means blood, sweat, and tears. With that said, I wish them the best.\" Want More Metal?
