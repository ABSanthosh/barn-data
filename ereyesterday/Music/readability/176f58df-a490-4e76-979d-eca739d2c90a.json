  "text": "A benefit concert for victims of the ongoing California wildfires has been announced. FireAid will take place Thursday, January 30 at Los Angeles’ Intuit Dome, with the show’s lineup yet to be announced. Proceeds for the event will go to a 501(c)(3) with the purpose of “rebuilding infrastructure, supporting displaced families, and advancing fire prevention technologies and strategies to ensure LA is better prepared for fire emergencies,” according to a press release. The concert is produced by Shelli, Irving, and the Azoff Family, in conjunction with LiveNation and AEG Presents.In the wake of the deadly fires, many musicians and their families have been forced to evacuate their homes, with some, including Diiv’s Zachary Cole Smith, Tim Darcy, Fat Tony, and Empress Of’s Lorely Rodriguez, seeking aid to stay afloat and eventually cover repairs. Yesterday, January 9, Speedy Ortiz’ Sadie Dupuis shared a spreadsheet tracking “music industry folks who have lost their homes to the fires,” with corresponding links for donations.
