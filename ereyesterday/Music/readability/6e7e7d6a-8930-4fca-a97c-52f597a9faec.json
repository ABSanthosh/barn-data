  "text": "Sleep Token bassist III and guitarist and vocalist IV have fallen ill, but that's not stopping Sleep Token from taking the stage anyway. According to the Sleep Token Instagram page, the band will play tonight's show at the Halle 622 in Zurich, Switzerland with a slew of backing tracks instead of cancelling altogether. Good on Sleep Token for carrying on in the face of adversity! \"Zurich, following the earlier news of IV's illness, we regret to share that our brother III has now also fallen ill and will be unable to perform tonight,\" wrote Sleep Token of the situation. \"The show will go ahead as planned, using pre-recorded tracks from both III and IV, captured during our recent tour preparations. We always endeavour to avoid cancelling a Ritual unless completely unavoidable, and we hope this outcome is more acceptable to you than a last-minute cancellation. \"Thank you for your understanding and support through these unforeseen changes. Tonight, we perform for them, and for you.\" Want More Metal?
