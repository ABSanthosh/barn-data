Jordan Lutes and Demi Lovato attend the Los Angeles premiere of Hulu's 'Child Star' at NeueHouse Hollywood on Sept. 12, 2024 in Hollywood, California. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Demi Lovato and Jordan ‘Jutes’ Lutes are married. The couple were wed in a ceremony in California on Sunday (May 25), the newlyweds confirmed to Vogue. Lovato and Lutes said “I do” at around 4 p.m. PT on Sunday, according the outlet, which got an exclusive first reveal of the pop star’s Vivienne Westwood wedding dress. (See Lovato’s wedding gown here.) Calling herself a longtime fan of Vivienne Westwood, Lovato opted for a custom-designed, corset bodice dress made from heavy silk satin fabric — paired with a cathedral-style veil made from ivory tulle — for her wedding ceremony. Trending on Billboard As Lovato told Vogue, “When I was thinking about [what dress style I wanted], I often found myself coming back to Vivienne’s designs — specifically how the silhouettes really compliment the curves in your body, and her use of corsets.” Lovato changed into another Vivienne Westwood dress for their reception: “The Audrey,” an ivory silk satin column dress with a draped corset top and pearls cascading from the neckline, each strand “draped and attached by hand, one by one,” she said. Just hours before the wedding, TMZ published paparazzi pictures from the bride and groom’s rehearsal from Saturday. The wedding festivities, which were overseen by event planner Mindy Weiss, were long-awaited for the couple, who made their relationship public in August 2022 and got engaged on Dec. 16, 2023. “Jordan, I cannot WAIT to marry you!!” Lovato gushed in a message to Jutes on Valentine’s Day, when she shared a romantic set of photos from an Old Hollywood-style shoot with her then-fiancé on Instagram. “The past 3 years have been the best 3 years of my life and I have you to thank for that. I’m obsessed with your heart, your love and your light. I can’t wait to grow old with you and start a family together. Happy Valentine’s Day to the love of my life. I love you honey!!!” Jutes matched the bride-to-be’s sentiments in a caption on his Instagram page, writing, “happy valentine’s day to the love of my life. words will never do you justice, and I’ll never stop feeling like the luckiest guy alive. there’s no better feeling than being loved by you. I adore you baby and I can’t wait to marry you.” The duo have worked together on music, with Jutes contributing as a co-writer on three tracks that appeared on Lovato’s Holy Fvck album, which reached No. 7 on the Billboard 200 albums chart upon its release in 2022.
