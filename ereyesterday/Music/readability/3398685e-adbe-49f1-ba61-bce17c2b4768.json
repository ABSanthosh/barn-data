  "text": "Donald Trump complains about a lot of things, but one way to really push his buttons is to bring up crowd size. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello preyed on that weakness when he told an audience that Trump is mad at Bruce Springsteen because “Bruce draws a bigger audience.” As previously reported, Springsteen irked Trump when he told a UK concert crowd, “The America I love … is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.” Trump then threatened some sort of action against The Boss when he retorted that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country.” Springsteen then released an anti-Trump EP, while the president posted an edited video of himself hitting Springsteen in the back with a golf ball. Get Tom Morello Tickets Here At the Boston Calling festival on Sunday (May 25th), Morello dedicated his cover of Springsteen’s “The Ghost of Tom Joad” (Morello appears on a live version of the song) by addressing the Trump-Springsteen feud. He told the crowd, “Bruce is going after Trump because Bruce, his whole life, he’s been about truth, justice, democracy, equality.” He added, “And Trump is mad at him because Bruce draws a bigger audience. Fuck that guy!” Morello, who graduated with honors in Political Science from Harvard University in 1996, also used his time onstage to praise the college for taking a stand against Trump as he threatens to withhold federal funds from the Ivy League school. The set also featured Morello and his solo band playing a few Rage Against the Machine tunes, and welcoming Public Enemy legend Chuck D onstage for the song “Prophets of Rage” by their band of the same name. Fans can catch Tom Morello when he embarks on a tour of Canada this summer. Pick up tickets here. See Tom Morello address the Trump-Springsteen feud in the video below, and read why Springsteen getting under Trump’s skin truly matters.",
