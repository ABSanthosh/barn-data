Kevin Mazur/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is coming to a close, with the star wrapping up her U.S. dates in Indianapolis, Indiana, over the weekend, and she took to Instagram on Monday (Nov. 4) to celebrate. Explore See latest videos, charts and news ”Couldn’t have asked for a more magical way to end our US shows on The Eras Tour,” she wrote alongside a series of photos from Lucas Oil Stadium. “Just had the time of my life with 207,000 beautiful people in Indianapolis who showered us with so much love and excitement and joy… I know I’ll be looking back on this weekend and smiling because it was just like a dreamscape, all of it. Thank you to everyone who came out to see us on our last 3 American shows!!” Before expressing excitement to see her “beloved Canadian fans” as the tour heads up North this month, Swift shared a thought with fans the night before Election Day. “And here’s a friendly but extremely important reminder that tomorrow is the US Election and your last chance to vote.” Trending on Billboard See her post here. The “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” singer will head to Toronto from Nov. 14-16 and then Nov. 21-23, before wrapping up her Eras Tour altogether in Vancouver from Dec. 6 to 8. In September, Swift took to social media to voice her support for the Harris campaign. Swift expressed her admiration for Harris, calling her a “steady-handed, gifted leader” and a “warrior” for causes including LGBTQ+ rights and women’s reproductive freedoms. She also called out Trump posting fake AI images that had falsely suggested she supported him. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” she said about the doctored images. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
