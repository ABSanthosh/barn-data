  "text": "Bassist Olivier Pinard has quit Cattle Decapitation to focus more on Cryptopsy. Pinard played bass for Cattle Decapitation between 2018 and 2025, and has been in Cryptopsy since 2011. Cattle Decapitation has since recruited Diego Soria of Broken Hope as their live bassist, who you've already seen if you attended any of the Chaos And Carnage tour. \"Today I'm announcing my departure from Cattle Decapitation,\" wrote Pinard. \"I've been extremely lucky and fortunate to be in 2 major touring bands at the same time. But now it's time to go home and focus on Cryptopsy and my personal life. I'm grateful for the 7 years I did with Cattle Decap and everything we accomplished together ( Death Atlas, Terrasite and countless world tours). I keep nothing but good memories from that era of my life. \" \"I would like to thanks Travis, Josh, Dave and Bel for their friendship over the years! Also, thank you to all the fans across the world, one of the most dedicated and passionate fanbase in the extreme metal scene That being said, I will take the next few months off to catch my breath \u0026 re-energize before coming back on stage later this year. See you down the road\" Cattle Decapitation issued their own statement, saying: \"Its a somber day in the Cattle camp as we must announce the departure of our bass player and buddy, Olivier Pinard. Oli has decided his focus must shift back to his home band Cryptopsy and his personal life. Being in two touring bands is very demanding on a human and while we are sad to see him go, we more than understand. We wish Oli the best of luck and be sure to check out the new song they just dropped and pick up their new album when it comes out! \"Filling in for the upcoming EU tour will be our friend Diego Soria of Broken Hope. You may have seen him on the Chaos And Carnage tour and multiple other tours and shows over the years when he's stepped up and filled in for us.\" Want More Metal?
