She’s now been forced to postpone more shows and cancel outright festival appearances in Mexico and California. See FKA twigs’ latest tour dates below.“im devastated to share the news that due to ongoing visa issues i am not able to see through any of my scheduled tour dates for the remainder of april across north america, including ceremonia and coachella,” FKA twigs wrote on social media. “i promise that i am working to reschedule the affected dates as quickly as possible. for headline shows, please refer to your point of purchase for details and refund information. back to you all with more updates as soon as i have them.”FKA twigs had been scheduled to perform at the Axe Ceremonia music festival, in Mexico City, on Sunday, April 6. She was then going to perform at the 2025 edition of the Coachella Valley Music \u0026 Arts Festival, in Indio, California, on Friday, April 11, and Friday, April 18. It was poised to be a noteworthy return for the experimental pop artist, as she had not performed at Coachella since making her debut in 2015.When FKA twigs first had to postpone her shows, she said that “production did not fill out the correct paperwork in a timely manner for us to have our visas to come to the U.S.A. and perform.” She will now be finding new dates for shows in San Francisco, New York, and Toronto.FKA twigs:04-06 Mexico City, Mexico - Axe Ceremonia04-11 Indio, CA - Coachella Valley Music \u0026 Arts Festival04-18 Indio, CA - Coachella Valley Music \u0026 Arts Festival04-19 San Francisco, CA - Bill Graham Civic Auditorium04-23 Queens, NY - Knockdown Center04-24 Queens, NY - Knockdown Center06-05 Barcelona, Spain - Primavera Sound Barcelona06-08 Paris, France - We Love Green06-24 Chicago, IL - Salt Shed06-25 Chicago, IL - Salt Shed",
