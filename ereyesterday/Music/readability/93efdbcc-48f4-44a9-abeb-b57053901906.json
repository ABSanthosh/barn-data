  "text": "In an industry where Latin music and EDM often intersect as passing acquaintances, Vikina has turned them into inseparable dance partners.Fresh off the release of her genre-defying album ¿QUESTIONS?, the Miami-born artist is ushering in an era where Latin influence isn't a feature—it's the foundation. The album is a daring sonic experiment, threading emotional vulnerability through club-ready production and turning existential dilemmas into irresistible anthems.Tracks like \"Candela\" blend sultry Spanish vocals with thumping house basslines, while \"Descontrol\" merges moody soundscapes with unmistakable dembow rhythms. The result is an introspective yet electrifying fusion that speaks to two worlds at once.Released under Pitbull's venerable Mr. 305 Records banner, ¿QUESTIONS? also features the Latin-Grammy nominated \"BAMBOLE,\" Vikina's recent collaboration with the renowned electronic music producer Deorro.The Latin Grammy nod is a testament to the growing impact of Vikina's sound, which resonates on sweaty dancefloors and global playlists alike. And as EDM evolves beyond its festival roots and Latin music continues its global ascent, she's proving that these worlds don’t just coexist—they thrive together.We caught up with Vikina to discuss her efforts to redefine Latin dance music.EDM.com: What do you think is driving the current global appetite for Latin-infused dance music?Vikina: I think the world is finally catching on to what we’ve known forever: Latin music is alive. It’s vibrant, emotional and full of passion. There’s an energy to it—the rhythm, the stories, the way it makes you feel—that really connects people to their culture and lets them share it through music.When you blend those sounds with dance music, I’m able to show how dynamic and exciting the genre can be. It’s about pushing boundaries and creating something that feels fresh but still honors where it came from.EDM.com: How has your upbringing in Miami influenced your fusion of traditional Latin sounds with contemporary electronic beats? Are there specific cultural elements you want to highlight?Vikina: Growing up in Miami meant being surrounded by this incredible melting pot of Latin culture. With my Ecuadorian mom and Cuban dad, I was constantly exposed to a mix of sounds from every genre you can think of. Gloria Estefan was a huge inspiration for me—she showed that Latin music could have a massive impact in the United States. I want my music to capture that same energy and diversity, to reflect the city that raised me.EDM.com: Can you walk us through your creative process when working with Deorro on your Latin Grammy-nominated song \"BAMBOLE?\"Vikina: I had been wanting to collaborate with Deorro for a long time and sent him a bunch of ideas before, but this one finally caught his attention. I started the idea with some local producers in Miami, using a \"75 Brazil\" sample we knew would be tough to clear. I knew Deorro would take it somewhere bold and electric. I had a feeling he’d do something amazing with it, but what he created completely took me by surprise—in the best way possible. I wanted the vocals to feel like they were calling you straight to the dancefloor and we layered that with one of those iconic Deorro-style drops he crafts so well. It all came together so naturally.Deorro truly deserves the recognition he gets. He’s paved the way for Latinos in EDM, and collaborating with him was such an honor. Knowing it earned me my first Latin Grammy nomination makes it even more special.EDM.com: What’s your ultimate mission as an artist?Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesVikina: My mission is to continue the legacy of the Miami artists who paved the way before me and blend cultures in that special way only we know how. I want to create a soundtrack for freedom—for dancing, crying, wanting, celebrating and living fully in the moment. Beyond the awards (which, let’s be real, are incredible), I want to inspire people, especially women, to take up space, own their roots, be fearless and break boundaries. I hope my journey encourages the next generation to write their own rules, whether that’s in music, life, or even politics. Because the magic—and the truth—is always somewhere in the middle.EDM.com: How do you push the boundaries of physicality and sensuality in Latin dance music to tell diverse stories?Vikina: Sensuality is part of who we are as Latinas, but it's not our whole story. Early in my career, I wrote a lot about yearning and wanting someone who probably wasn't 100% into me. Those were fun and cathartic in a sense, sort of a sexual love letter—with class of course. However, in Spanish there tends to be a much more poetic way of describing certain things.These days, I’m more focused on telling meaningful stories through dance music. One track might be about dancing through heartbreak, and the next is about owning your power. My goal is to bring depth to the dancefloor—whether you're vibing to the beat or really listening to the lyrics, there’s always something there to connect with and to feel.EDM.com: What challenges have you faced as a woman reshaping the male-dominated Latin dance music narrative, and what progress do you see?Vikina: Oh, honey, the challenges are real but I've never been afraid of a challenge. People often underestimate us or think we're just the “pretty face” on the track—but little do they know I'm actually the songwriter, recording engineer and vocal producer of most of my tracks too. I’ve learned to let my skills speak louder than any stereotype and to get comfortable with my role as a leader in these rooms.Strong communication skills and being well-educated in your business and craft earn you real respect even if looks got you in the door. So I say, \"Use it!\" I’m seeing more women stepping into producer roles, headlining festivals and just owning their space. It feels like we’re not just breaking the mold—we’re shattering it.Vikina.c/o Mr. 305 RecordsEDM.com: What do you see as the next evolution in Latin dance music?Vikina: The future is all about blending genres even more. I feel like we’ve really ridden the tech house and Afro house wave hard this past year. With all these \"Latin sample packs\" out there, it feels like anyone can make Latin EDM now. I’d love to see things evolve—maybe more Latin techno or mainstream progressive Latin EDM.For example, Deorro is fusing Mexican music in a really cool way. Imagine a bachata guitar with futuristic synths or traditional Andean flutes on a drum \u0026 bass beat. The sound needs to evolve, and it’s time to make it happenEDM.com: What has been the most surprising lesson you’ve learned about yourself in these fast-moving genres?Vikina: That I’m way stronger than I thought. It’s a tough industry, but every challenge has taught me resilience. I’ve learned to trust my instincts and embrace my uniqueness—because what’s the point of following the crowd when you were born to lead the dance?EDM.com: What do you want your music to communicate to listeners unfamiliar with Latin culture or dance music?Vikina: I want them to be moved, whether it’s through the lyrics or the sazon of the music. It’s more than just sound—it’s about the emotions, the history and the community behind it. Dance music is all about release. Even if you don’t speak Spanish, I hope my music makes you feel something. That's why I write in Spanglish sometimes because I want there to be something for everyone to hold onto. Music is the universal language, and I’m here to make sure EDM en español becomes a part of everyone’s playlist.Follow Vikina:X: x.com/vikinamusicInstagram: instagram.com/vikinamusicTikTok: tiktok.com/@vikinamusicFacebook: facebook.com/vikinamusicSpotify: tinyurl.com/5absh84v",
