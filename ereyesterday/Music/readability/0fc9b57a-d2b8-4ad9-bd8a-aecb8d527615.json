SEVENTEEN: My runny nose is… Tetris Kelly: We love you Mingyu. SEVENTEEN just finished the US leg of their Right Here World Tour, and we’re taking you to the stadium and backstage to talk to them about taking over LA with SEVENTEEN THE CITY and more. You’re going there in Billboard All Access. All right, I’m hanging out backstage with my boys SEVENTEEN at their tour. How are you guys feeling tonight so far? We had so much fun. Honestly, you weren’t expecting the stadium to be so big, because so many of our fans came when we performed. They loved our music. They were singing along. They were dancing. I mean, we had a great time. We had a blast.  I love it, stadiums in the States. And I mean, this is your first time being back in the states in two years. So what’s that like to see your fans after so long?  Two years ago, I caught COVID so I couldn’t take part in the LA concert at that time. It’s a relief that I can get on stage at this time, and it’s all the more meaningful that we get to perform at a stadium.  Yeah, well, we’re glad to have you back this time, and then of course what makes this show different than your past tours?  It’s been a while since we were here in the U.S., so it’s been wonderful to reconnect with our U.S. CARATs. Feeling their energy, I felt like I want to come back and meet them as often as possible. It’s a great honor to be able to perform at a U.S. stadium for the first time.  Yeah, well, we’re glad to have you but you gotta tell me, with it being so many members, how was it like before the show? Like, what are you guys doing? How is it wrangling everyone? Keep watching for more!",
