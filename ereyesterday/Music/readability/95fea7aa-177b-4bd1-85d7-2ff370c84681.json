  "text": "The FIFA Club World Cub final was held in the US for the first time on Sunday, as the match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain took place at East Rutherford, New Jersey‚Äôs MetLife Stadium. The event also featured the tournament‚Äôs first-ever halftime show, with Doja Cat, J Balvin, Tems, and surprise guests Coldplay performing high in the stands. The cadre of international performers played a 15-minute spectacular from up in the nosebleeds thanks to an innovative stage created by halftime presenters Global Citizen and partner Christ Martin of Coldplay. Putting the stage in the stands allowed the production to avoid damaging the field‚Äôs freshly planted grass, and limited the changeover timing issues faced by Shakira‚Äôs halftime performance at the 2024 Copa America final.
