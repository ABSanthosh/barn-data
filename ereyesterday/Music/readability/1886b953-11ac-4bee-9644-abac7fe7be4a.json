  "text": "Welcome back to Fan Chant, a weekly column for K-pop fans, stans, and newbies alike. This week, some news from HYBE about efforts to push back on AI in efforts to protect artists. If you enjoy what you’re reading, feel free to subscribe to my companion newsletter to get Fan Chant delivered right to your inbox each week! On February 26th, HYBE (the company home of BTS, LE SSERAFIM, and a number of other K-pop acts) announced a new tentpole in their efforts to combat AI deepfakes, which have increased in popularity across multiple sectors of the entertainment industry. According to a statement from the entertainment giant, the Memorandum of Understanding sees HYBE teaming up with Korea’s Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency to combat the rise of deepfakes and their connected cybercrimes. The folks at HYBE are no strangers to artist protection. In addition to proactive measures, the 360 label and management company regularly fields reports from fans to ensure an ear to the ground on libel or potentially damaging information circulating. But this specific police agency is especially renowned in South Korea; according to the statement, the folks in this branch are particularly renowned for their expertise, and the unit was recently recognized as the country’s leading cybercrime unit. The move can be seen as an encouraging step from a company within an industry that often sees women disproportionately affected by defamation and online hate campaigns. This directly intersects with the fact that deepfakes can be leveraged for insidious purposes against women, leaving them especially vulnerable to the spread of artificial creations. In September of 2024, multiple other South Korean agencies — including JYP Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and Cube Entertainment — began cracking down on deepfake pornography, most of which targeted their female artists. “As artists face increased vulnerability to online crimes due to the rapid creation and distribution of deepfake videos, the memorandum includes swift action against offenders, including expedited arrests and the launch of a dedicated hotline for reporting such crimes in Korea, strengthening overall efforts to protect artists from online exploitation,” reads the release around the new memorandum. South Korean companies aren’t the only ones pushing back against this specific issue. In July of 2024, one of Hollywood’s top law firms, Venable LLP — whose clients include Taylor Swift — launched a specific service called Takedown specifically dedicated to targeting deepfake content. A bipartisan bill, titled NO FAKES (Nurture Art, Foster Art, Keep Entertainment Safe) was introduced to the US Senate in 2024 with the goal of protecting “the voice and visual likeness of all individuals from unauthorized computer-generated recreations from generative artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies.” However, according to a report from US cybersecurity company Security Hero, K-pop stars are especially at risk. Their 2023 study offered a shocking statistic: 53% of the individuals featured in deepfake pornography were South Korean singers or actresses. The steps companies like HYBE are taking are promising, but the data speaks for itself — the journey ahead is long, and the work has only just begun.
