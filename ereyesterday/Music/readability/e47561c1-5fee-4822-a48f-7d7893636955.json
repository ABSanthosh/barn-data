  "text": "The incident was captured on video and shared on social media, where \"Kelce\" trended Saturday (Nov. 2). Former NFL football player Jason Kelce takes part in the 2024 American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course on July 14, 2024 in Stateline, Nevada. Isaiah Vazquez/Getty Images Jason Kelce came to Travis Kelce’s defense in the middle of a crowd when he heard someone verbally attacking his brother Saturday (Nov. 2). After a heckler made a derogatory remark about Travis for dating Taylor Swift — the person called Travis a homophobic slur — the retired Philadelphia Eagles player grabbed the person’s phone, slammed it to the ground, and yelled it back to him. The incident was recorded in several cell phone videos filmed by bystanders from different angles and shared on social media, where “Kelce” trended Saturday. Billboard reached out to Jason’s representative for comment. “Hey, Kelce! How does it feel your brother’s a f—– dating Taylor Swift?” a voice is heard yelling to Jason in one clip in which the former NFL player is seen walking quickly past a cluster of people trying to get his attention. Jason is seen turning, grabbing the person’s phone and throwing it to the ground in another clip; the harasser had seemingly been trying to film his reaction. A third video shows Jason facing the person and repeating the slur to him, saying, “Who’s the f—– now?” Jason’s brother, Travis, has been linked to Swift since 2023. The pop star first appeared at a Chiefs game on Sept. 23 last year, after Travis said on the brothers’ New Heights podcast in July that he’d tried to give his number to Swift via a friendship bracelet at The Eras Tour’s Kansas City stop. Swift welcomed Travis to her Eras stage in London this past summer during “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” and she gave him a shout-out in her video of the year acceptance speech at this year’s VMAs, which she and Post Malone won for “Fortnight”: “This video seems very sad when you watch it, but it was actually the most fun video to make,” she told the crowd at the awards show on Sept. 11. “I would always just hear someone cheering, like, ‘Whoo!’ from across the studio — that one person was my boyfriend, Travis. Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic, so I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot.” Jason talked about his experience attending one of Swift’s Miami concerts in October, on a recent episode of New Heights. “This Miami show was incredible,” he told Travis, who had a game that weekend. “It was on another level. I texted you halfway through it like, ‘Dude, this rain. Tay is killing it.’” “When Reputation came on and she came out in the new outfit and the rain was coming down, the place could’ve f—ing erupted,” Jason continued. “I mean, it did. The amount of energy was insane.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
