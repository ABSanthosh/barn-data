  "text": "Haim have shared their second single in a month. “Everybody’s Trying to Figure Me Out” is co-produced by Danielle Haim and longtime collaborator Rostam Batmanglij, and Justin Vernon is credited as a writer and composer of the track, alongside the Haim sisters and Rostam. Take a listen below.Prefacing the song on Instagram yesterday, Danielle Haim wrote that it is her favorite that she has written “in the last couple years. “Writing it,” she added, “has gotten me through some hard times, and we felt this might be of some use to get our vibes right for this summer! I started writing this after a panic attack I had the night I got home from tour. I was very confused because I was SO SO SO happy about our incredible tour, but something about being alone with myself scared the shit out of me. after a lot of reflecting I realized I’ve let a lot of people try and tell me how I should live my life, but I realized in making everyone else happy, I lost myself. I wrote this as a way to believe in myself again and quit being scared to do what I want. I hope this finds anyone who needs it.”The new single follows last month’s “Relationships,” also produced by Rostam and Danielle Haim. Both songs—their first since contributing “Home” to Barbie the Album—will appear on a forthcoming album, their press releases suggest.",
