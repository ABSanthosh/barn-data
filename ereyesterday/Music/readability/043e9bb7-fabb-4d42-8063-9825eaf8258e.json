  "text": "TV on the Radio have announced a special event in their Brooklyn, New York, hometown. The band will host There Goes the Neighborhood on Saturday, September 13, at Under the K Bridge Park. Playing the mini-festival are Flying Lotus, Sudan Archives, Moor Mother, and Spellling. See a poster for the event below.“The ethos of our band has always been that there’s plenty of room for new ideas, and the weirder and the better,” TV on the Radio said in a press statement. “At the core of its expression, the music aims to bring people together, and create a space for whoever hears it to be their truest self. Same goes for the community and the scene that we came out of: Everybody, in bringing their own special thing, is what made and makes it magnificent, and we want to celebrate that now more than ever.”TV on the Radio began their comeback last year, surrounding the 20th anniversary of their debut album, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes. They are currently on tour in Europe and return to North America for more shows in July.",
