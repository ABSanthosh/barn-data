  "text": "James Van Der Beek, the actor best known for his starring roles in Dawson’s Creek and Varsity Blues, recently announced he has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Now, he’s selling memorabilia from Varsity Blues in order to cover the “financial burden of cancer” for families “including my own.” A limited-edition capsule of jerseys featuring Van Der Beek’s Varsity Blues character, Jonathan “Mox” Moxon, is available for purchase on the actor’s website. In an Instagram post promoting the jerseys, Van Der Beek stated that “100% of my net proceeds” will go toward covering the cost of cancer treatments. He also included the hashtag, “#cancerisexpensive.” “I’ve been privately dealing with this diagnosis and have been taking steps to resolve it, with the support of my incredible family,” Van Der Beek, 47, said in a recent interview with People. “There’s reason for optimism, and I’m feeling good.” Released in 1999, Varsity Blues featured Van Der Beek as Moxon, an academically-gifted backup quarterback who assumes the starting role of a Texas high school football team after its star quarterback (played by the late Paul Walker) suffers a career-ending injury. The 4K UHD version of the film is on sale for Cyber Monday.",
