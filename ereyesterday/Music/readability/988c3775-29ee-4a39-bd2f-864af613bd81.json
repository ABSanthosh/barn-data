  "text": "As the presidential race nears the end, we’re running through some of the most iconic music moments from Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ campaigns. Which moment was your favorite? Let us know in the comments! Tetris Kelly: As the election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is coming to a close, we’re looking back at the music that defined the campaigns. Like when Kamala announced that she was entering the race for the presidency, and Charli XCX tweeted out, “Kamala is brat.” The British pop star helped create more buzz around Vice President Harris, which prompted “KamalaHQ,” the official rapid response of the VP, to change their header to Charli’s signature ‘brat’ green. Since then, several edits and memes of Kamala Harris were made to songs off of ‘Brat’ like “360,” “365,” and “Von Dutch.” From Kamala to Trump, the former president is apparently in charge of picking the music for his rallies and seems to have some repeat favorites that span a wide range of artists, like opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, Frank Sinatra, and the Village People, even dancing along with the signature “YMCA” moves! But that’s not the only song on Trump’s playlist; his campaign has repeatedly used Lee Greenwood’s rendition of “God Bless the U.S.A,” throughout his three campaigns. The 82-year-old singer even performed it at the RNC. Kamala Harris has her own go-to campaign song for her rallies, Beyoncé’s “Freedom.” To see more stories like this, head over to Billboard.",
