  "text": "Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have released “Outta Da Blue,” the latest single from their upcoming collaborative album, Missionary. Featuring Alus, “Outta Da Blue” sees Snoop and Dre trade verses over a booming beat, produced by Dre, Dem Jointz, BoogzDaBeast, and FNZ. On the chorus, Alus delivers a memorable hook that references the album’s title, Missionary, and then interpolates the gun-shooting, money-taking refrain from M.I.A.’s 2007 hit, “Paper Planes.” Get Snoop Dogg Tickets Here Arriving via Death Row, Aftermath, and Interscope, “Outta Da Blue” is the second single to arrive from Missionary, following the Jhené Aiko-featuring track “Gorgeous,” which arrived earlier this month. Before its release, “Outta Da Blue” was previewed by Snoop and Dre on a live episode of Drink Champs, and was also used in the trailer for the upcoming Netflix film, Back in Action. Stream “Outta Da Blue” below. Missionary itself is due on December 13th, and will mark the first full-length collaboration between Snoop and Dre since their iconic 1993 album, Doggystyle.
