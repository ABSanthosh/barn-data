  "text": "As the world awaits the upcoming Spinal Tap sequel (due this September), the creators of the beloved fake band have announced a new behind-the-scenes book, titled A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever: The Story of Spinal Tap (pre-order here). Written by director Rob Reiner with stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever will be released on September 9th via Simon \u0026 Schuster. Content-wise, the book will feature first-hand stories about the creation of the 1984 film and its iconic one-liners — including “None more black,” “You can’t dust for vomit,” “These go to eleven,” and more. The book will also feature musings and real-life “Spinal Tap moments” from actual rock stars from the era, including Slash of Guns N’ Roses, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, and Don Henley of the Eagles. Additionally, no good Spinal Tap project is complete without some mockumentary-style blurring of the fourth wall, and thus, the backside of A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever literally includes what’s being dubbed as a “B-side;” a fictional half of the book written as Spinal Tap’s band members — Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls — recounting their life in the band to “director” Marty DiBergi. Pre-orders for A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever: The Story of Spinal Tap are currently ongoing. As for the upcoming film, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues will premiere on September 12th, and will include cameo appearances by Paul McCartney, Elton John, Garth Brooks, and more. For more, revisit our round up on the funniest moments from This Is Spinal Tap or read why we named Spinal Tap the best fictional band of all time.",
