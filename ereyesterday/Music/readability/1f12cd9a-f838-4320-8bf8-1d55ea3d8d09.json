  "text": "Tracy Morgan is reuniting with former 30 Rock co-star Tina Fey for the pilot of a single-camera comedy ordered at NBC. Morgan will star in the currently untitled show, with Fey sharing showrunner duties with Robert Carlock (another 30 Rock alum). Carlock and Sam Means (30 Rock, Girls5Eva) will write the episode. Morgan, Fey, Carlock, and Means are all executive producing. According to Deadline, the sitcom will revolve around Morgan as “a disgraced former football player who is on a mission to rehabilitate his image.” Morgan is also starring in a pilot for the Paramount+ comedy series Crutch, but will be able to do both shows if they get picked up. Fey created and starred in all seven seasons of the three-time Emmy winner 30 Rock, for which she also shared executive producer and co-showrunner duties with Carlock. Meanwhile, Morgan won an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Tracy Jordan on the show.",
