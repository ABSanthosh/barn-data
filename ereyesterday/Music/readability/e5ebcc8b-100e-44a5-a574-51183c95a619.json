  "text": "Fender has unveiled the Khruangbin Collection, a limited edition run of guitars and basses modeled after the instruments used by the band’s Mark Speer and Laura Lee. The collaboration honors the sounds that color Khruangbin’s lush, psych fusion arrangements, and marks the first time in Fender’s history that they’ve released a signature instrument line for a band’s guitarist and bassist at the same time. Get Khruangbin Tickets Here The guitar is the Limited Edition Mark Speer Stratocaster, which comes in a beautiful natural finish with a custom-contoured ash body, all-white hardware, a Custom “C” neck profile, and 21 jumbo frets. For pickups, it boasts DiMarzio Pro Track pickups on the neck and bridge, and a ‘70s Strat middle pickup. The guitar also features a vintage-style tremolo and Graph Tech saddles and string trees. The bass, the Limited Edition Laura Lee Jazz Bass, comes in a classic vintage white finish with chrome hardware, vintage-style concentric knobs, a custom “U” neck, and a rosewood fingerboard with 21 jumbo frets. In the pickup department, the bass will feature DiMarzio Ultra Jazz pickups. Both instruments are “exact replicas” of the respective axes played by Speer and Lee since their debut album, The Universe Smiles Upon You, was released ten years ago. Watch a Fender Signature Sessions video showcasing the Limited Edition Mark Speer Stratocaster and the Limited Edition Laura Lee Jazz Bass below. Meanwhile, Khruangbin released their fourth studio album, A La Sala, in April 2024. Later this month, the band will play a run of US shows, stopping in Pittsburgh, Boston, and more cities, followed by a jaunt of European dates. Get tickets here.",
