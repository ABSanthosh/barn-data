After covering the band’s calling-card anthem, “The Whole of the Moon,” back in 2019, Apple gets her hands on a tailor-made composition by the band’s frontperson, Mike Scott, in “Letter From an Unknown Girlfriend.” Check it out below.The song’s parent album, Life, Death And Dennis Hopper, also features Bruce Springsteen and Steve Earle, among others. As the title suggests, it is a concept album about the late actor, and it arrives April 4. Apple has dipped in and out of the studio since Fetch the Bolt Cutters, her latest releases being an Iron \u0026 Wine duet and a cover of Don Heffington’s “Lately.”Read Mark Richardson’s recent Sunday Review of the Waterboys’ 1985 landmark, This Is the Sea.",
