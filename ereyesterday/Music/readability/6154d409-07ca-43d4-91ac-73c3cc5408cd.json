  "text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of modern hardcore, Stick To Your Guns have long reigned supreme as titans of the genre, their music serving as a rallying cry for social justice and personal growth. Now, on their eighth full-length offering, \"Keep Planting Flowers,\" the Orange County quintet returns with a searing, cathartic exploration of resilience that solidifies their status as the genre's most impassioned standard-bearers. Produced by the esteemed Beau Burchell, this album is a relentless excavation of life's challenges, with Jesse Barnett's evocative vocals cutting through the band's trademark blend of uncompromising heaviness and melodic power. The opening salvo of \"We All Die Anyway\" sets the tone, as the sound of a shovel breaking ground signals the start of a journey through struggle and self-discovery. Barnett's lyrics urge listeners to embrace courage in the face of mortality, establishing the record's overarching theme of finding beauty and purpose amidst adversity. Tracks like \"Severed Forever\" and \"More Than A Witness\" showcase Stick To Your Guns at their most intense and lyrically introspective. \"Severed Forever\" is a standout moment, its punk-infused pace and crushing breakdowns amplifying the song's existential questions about time, loss, and spiritual awakening. Barnett's vocals soar over some of the best riffs the band has ever crafted, making this a true highlight of the album. In contrast, the brooding \"Permanent Dark\" offers a somber counterpoint, exploring a world consumed by fear and despair. This track provides a poignant contrast to the record's overall message of resilience and collective action, showcasing the band's versatility and depth. But Stick To Your Guns' commitment to using their platform to uplift and empower their community is never far from the surface. Guest appearances from hardcore luminaries like Terror's Scott Vogel (\"Who Needs Who\") and SeeYouSpaceCowboy's Connie Sgarbossa (\"H84U\") elevate \"Keep Planting Flowers\" into a communal celebration of the genre's unifying power. The album's emotional core arrives with the title track, \"Keep Planting Flowers.\" Equal parts uplifting and reflective, the song weaves together intricate guitar work and anthemic choruses, urging listeners to maintain hope and perseverance in the face of adversity. This sentiment carries through to the contemplative closer, \"Eats Me Up,\" tying the themes of personal accountability and growth into a poignant finale. Throughout \"Keep Planting Flowers,\" Stick To Your Guns' sonic palette is enriched by subtle atmospheric details. The inclusion of natural elements like rain, wind, and ocean sounds threads the tracks together, reinforcing the album's central metaphor of nurturing beauty and meaning amidst life's challenges. These touches provide moments of respite between the record's relentless bursts of energy, like the blistering \"Spineless.\" In an era marked by division and despair, Stick To Your Guns have crafted an album that serves as both a rallying cry and a balm for the weary. \"Keep Planting Flowers\" doesn't just expand the band's sound; it solidifies their place as a cornerstone of modern hardcore, a group unafraid to confront societal ills while championing the power of personal growth and communal action. Whether you're navigating your own battles or fighting for something larger than yourself, Stick To Your Guns' latest offering is a reminder to stay the course and perhaps plant something beautiful along the way. In a world that often feels consumed by darkness, this album shines a light, urging listeners to find the courage to bloom anew.",
