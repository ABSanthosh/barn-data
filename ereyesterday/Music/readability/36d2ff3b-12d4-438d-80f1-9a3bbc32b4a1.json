  "text": "The 2025 BRIT Awards aired today (March 1) at London’s O2 Arena, hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall. The ceremony featured performances from Sabrina Carpenter, JADE, and The Last Dinner Party, with Teddy Swims, Myles Smith, Lola Young, Sam Fender, Ezra Collective and Jorja Smith also taking the stage. Though she did not perform, Charli XCX was far and away the night’s big winner, taking home five trophies in total: Song of the Year (for “Guess featuring Billie Eilish”), Best Dance Act, Artist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, and Album of the Year. Scroll down to watch footage of the performers.Sabrina CarpenterNotable non-Brit kicked Sabrina Carpenter kicked off the show, though you wouldn’t have been able to tell from her performance, which featured Buckingham Palace guards in formation and the whole stage lit up with Union Jack flags. After a mashup of “Espresso” with “Rule Britannia,” Carpenter momentarily vanished, then reappeared atop a heart-shaped platform in red, glittery lingerie for a boudoir-themed rendition of the Short n’ Sweet album track “Bed Chem.” Carpenter threw out some impressive vocal runs and began to suggestively flirt with one of the guards, who winked as the camera panned away. Later in the evening, she was presented with the BRITs Global Success award by Diana Ross.Teddy SwimsAtlanta crooner Teddy Swims brought a surreal setup for his medley of recent hits, including white furniture covered in cartoon doodles, a leather-clad dancer with a lamb on her head, and a stuffed, life-size bear perched on a cloud above the band. Swims performed “Bad Dreams” in a cloak and collar that looked like a comforter and pillows, stripped down to a rhinestoned terrycloth robe for “The Doors,” and sat down at a piano to sing “Lose Control”—which he also performed at the 2025 Grammy Awards—as the stage caught fire.Myles SmithRight after accepting his Rising Star award from The Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith gave a comparatively humble performance of his song “Nice to Meet You”—though, in this case, “humble” still meant a horn section, fiddle solo, and six or so backup singers crowded around old-fashioned radio broadcast microphones. And for anyone who thought stomp-clap music was dead, Smith got the crowd literally stomping and clapping along to his biggest hit, “Stargazing,” before taking his mic off the stand and making his way out onto the risers in front of the stage, acoustic guitar in tow.JADEJade Thirwall, formerly of Little Mix, recreated the music video for her 2024 pop opus “Angel of My Dreams” in a heavenly, five-act theatrical production. Thirwall wore a wedding dress for “Act I: The Marriage,” then quick-changed into her “Act II: Prima Donna” ensemble, which consisted of an oversized blonde wig, cat’s eye sunglasses, and a massive fur coat. Dancers in tragicomic masks surrounded her for “Act III: Metamorphosis,” and “Act IV: Requiem” made a brief detour into “IT GIRL,” Thirwall’s first and thus-far only single of the year. Finally, for “Act V: Ascension,” Thirwall took to the sky, flying above the stage with outstretched white wings to sing the final chous of “Angel.” As the segment’s closing title card read: “That’s showbiz baby!”The Last Dinner PartyBuzzy London five-piece The Last Dinner Party paid tribute to the late David Lynch with their performance of “Nothing Matters,” from last year’s debut record Prelude to Ecstasy. Accompanied by her bandmates and a string section, lead singer Abigail Morris danced around in set dressing clearly inspired by the Black Lodge from Twin Peaks, complete with red velvet curtains and a black-and-white zigzag floor. Eventually the red curtains parted, as images of the band were projected behind them and leaf-shaped confetti rained down from the ceiling.Lola YoungDelivering the first lines of “Messy” from a pile of wrinkled clothes and loose tchotchkes, Lola Young made good on the song’s hook: “’Cause I’m too messy, and then I’m too fucking clean.” The speak-singing standout from 2024’s This Wasn’t Meant for You Anyway was brought further to life as Young tossed dirty laundry into the crowd, make a short-lived attempt at vacuuming, and dumped an entire box of detergent onto the stage.Sam FenderBest Alternative/Rock Act winner and “The North Shields Springsteen” Sam Fender, as he was described by host Jack Whitehall, gave a not-half-bad impersonation of The Boss with his single “People Watching” from his new album of the same title. Fender baritone definitely had a Springsteenian quality to it, and if that wasn’t enough E Street Band worship for you, a squealing saxophone and trumpet kicked in during the song’s rousing last chorus.Ezra Collective with Jorja Smith2023 Mercury Prize winners Ezra Collective closed out the 2025 BRIT Awards—where they also won Group of the Year—with a medley of songs including “Ajala.” The British jazz quintet were joined by a massive horn section and Jorja Smith, who sang 2023’s “Little Things” with full band accompaniment.",
