  "text": "Brian James, founding guitarist and principal early songwriter for the legendary UK punk band The Damned, has died at the age of 70. James’ passing was reported on his Facebook page, with no cause of death listed. The guitarist, who was born in London in 1955, had just turned 70 on February 18th. Prior to The Damned, James played in the proto-punk bands London SS, The Subterraneans, and Bastard. He formed The Damned in 1976 with singer Dave Vanian, bassist Captain Sensible, and drummer Rat Scabies. James wrote most of the songs on the band’s first two albums — Damned Damned Damned and Music for Pleasure — including “New Rose,” which is considered the first-ever UK punk single (preceding any releases by The Clash or Sex Pistols). However, he quit the band at the end of 1977, the same year both of those albums were released. He went on to form the band Tanz Der Youth before starting the group The Lords of the New Church with Stiv Bators, releasing a few albums in the early ’80s. He also released a number of solo albums throughout the years, with his most recent being 2015’s The Guitar That Dripped Blood. James reunited with The Damned briefly in the late ’80s, and again in 2022 for a series of shows in the UK. The full statement posted on the guitarist’s Facebook page sums up his career as follows: “It is with great sadness that we announce the death of one of the true pioneers of music, guitarist, songwriter, and true gentleman, Brian James. Founding member of The Damned, writer of the first ever UK punk single, ‘New Rose,’ Brian was the principal songwriter of the band’s debut album, Damned Damned Damned, which was released in February 1977. Parting ways with the Damned following the release of their second album, the Nick Mason-produced Music for Pleasure, Brian created the short-lived Tanz Der Youth, before he formed The Lords of the New Church with his friend and fellow rocker Stiv Bators. In a wave of excitement, headed by the twin powers of Brian James and Stiv Bators, three successful studio albums followed for The Lord of the New Church, spawning singles such as “Open Your Eyes,” “Dance with Me,” and “Method to My Madness.” Always looking for new challenges and keen to work with different musicians, over the years that followed, Brian formed The Dripping Lips and guested on different records, while creating the Brian James Gang and working on his solo albums. Incessantly creative and a musical tour de force, over a career which spanned more than six decades, with his music also gracing film and television soundtracks, in addition to The Damned and The Lords of the New Church, Brian worked with a plethora of punk and rock ‘n’ roll’s finest, from Iggy Pop to Wayne Kramer, Stewart Copeland to Cheetah Chrome. Most recently, more than four decades after the release of the epoch-making ‘New Rose,’ the original members of The Damned reformed for a series of very special and emotional UK shows in 2022. With his wife Minna, son Charlie, and daughter-in-law Alicia by his side, Brian passed peacefully on Thursday 6th March 2025.” The Damned continue to tour with a lineup of Dave Vanian, Captain Sensible, Rat Scabies, Paul Gray, and Monty Oxymoron. As of this posting, the band has not released any statements regarding James’ passing. Our condolences go out to Brian James’ family, friends, and various bandmates throughout the years during this difficult time. Watch footage of James performing with The Damned below.",
