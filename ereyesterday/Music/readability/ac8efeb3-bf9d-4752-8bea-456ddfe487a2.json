Drake performs live on stage during day two of Wireless Festival at Finsbury Park on July 12, 2025 in London, England. Simone Joyner/Getty Images for ABA On Sunday night, (July 13), Drake’s love letter to London concluded during the finale of his Wireless Festival takeover. While the first two nights were frontloaded with special guests such as Lauryn Hill, 21 Savage, Latto, Sexyy Red, Skepta, Central Cee and Bryson Tiller, due to Wireless’ hard out, the finale lacked the same level of star power. Unbothered by the time constraints, Drake played facilitator and leaned on dancehall icon Vybz Kartel and Afrobeats superstar Burna Boy to dictate the tempo in what was considered a global affair for those in attendance. A sea of Jamaican flags flooded the crowd — a fitting sight. Sunday marked Kartel’s first performance in the U.K in 20 years. After serving 13 years in prison, the Worl’ Boss was primed and ready for a landmark performance even if that meant trimming Drake’s own set. According to the 6 God, Kartel’s return was the top priority, and he had ample time to shine. “Today, I really wanted to pay my respect to the performers. Bringing the Worl’ Boss home to London after 20 years, making sure that he got time to headline his set. Bringing out Big 7, Burna Boy and making sure he got his time to rock with y’all,” said Drake. Alongside Kartel’s fiery performance, Burna Boy brought out Lauryn Hill and YG Marley, while Drake teased new music with Central Cee, slated to drop on Friday (July 18). Check out Billboard’s best moments from Drake’s Wireless Festival finale. Vybz Kartel Makes His Presence Felt in London After 20-Year Absence On Sunday, Kartel’s victory lap continued when he performed in London for the first time in 20 years. Kartel, who served 13 years in prison, was visibly moved by the fanfare and excitement surrounding his return. “Twenty years I haven’t been here. It’s a pleasure,” Kartel said as he grinned. The Worl’ Boss hasn’t lost a step. For more than 90 minutes, he applied pressure, unleashing an arsenal of hits. Whether skating through “Picture This” or teaming up with Spice for their instant classic “Romping Shop,” the island vibes were alive and well. Beyond playing the hits, he also leaned on the younger generation to keep the crowd active, bringing out Moliy for her Hot 100 hit “Shake It to the Max.” Burna Boy Shines Despite Short Set With Vybz Kartel owning the night, Burna Boy’s time was limited. Still, Big 7 didn’t shrink under pressure, and he injected his signature flair into what was already proving to be a global masterclass between Kartel, himself, Spice and Popcaan. As he walked onstage, there was a pseudo bar dubbed “Burna’s Saloon.” There, he served fans an overflow of hits, including “Last Last,” “City Boys” and “Ye.” With the clock ticking, Burna had the crowd swaying and mesmerized during his 30-minute set. Lauryn Hill Makes Her Second Appearance of the Weekend On Friday, Hill stole hearts when she appeared during Drake’s rousing night 1 opener and delivered an indelible mash-up of “Ex-Factor” and “Nice for What.” On Sunday, Hill doubled back at Finsbury Park during Burna Boy’s set. After seeing him and her son YG Marley team up for the remix of “Praise Jah in the Moonlight,” Hill sauntered onstage, beaming with joy. After requesting an encore of the song, she treated fans to an impromptu a capella performance of “Killing Me Softly.” Drake Teases New Song With Central Cee After teasing fans on Saturday, Drake let the cat out of the bag and previewed his new collaboration with Central Cee. “I’m about to play a new tune. Me and my brother Central Cee. Run it,” Drake told the crowd. The energy was palpable as Cench smiled from the crowd, nodding along while the song reverberated through the speakers. Anchored by bouncy house elements and playful boasts, Drake and Cench prove why they’re a formidable duo, especially after their fiery 2024 On the Radar freestyle. “You want friends or success? Which one?” Drake raps on the track. According to Drizzy, the song drops on Friday (July 18). Drake Performs His Verse From Rihanna’s ‘Work’ Last year, Drake dismissed the idea of performing Rihanna’s “Work” during his It’s All a Blur Tour, telling fans, “I don’t sing this song anymore. You can sing it for me.” On Sunday, despite steering clear of Rihanna’s verse, he sang his verse from the 2016 Hot 100 chart-topper, making the moment all the more noteworthy amid his feud with A$AP Rocky last year. Drake Brings Out Rema for a Quick Medley Though Drake was short on time, he had one last trick up his sleeve: Rema. The Nigerian superstar didn’t waste a second as he performed “Baby (Is It a Crime).” The Sade-sampling track had fans entranced, despite the clock winding down on Drake’s set. Unbothered by the time crunch, Rema steamrolled through a quick medley that included Darkoo’s “Favourite Girl” and his global smash “Calm Down.” Drake Has His Kodak Moment With Central Cee, Vybz Kartel \u0026 Popcaan Toward the end of his set, Drake paused to thank London for the its hospitality and for allowing him to bring his friends across The Pond. As he stood alongside Central Cee, Popcaan and Vybz Kartel — who all joined him during his performance of “Hotline Bling” — it was a snapshot of Drake’s global reach and ability to unite worlds through music.
