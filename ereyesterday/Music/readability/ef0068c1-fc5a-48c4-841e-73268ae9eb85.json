  "text": "Originally launched in 2022, Exile – the dystopian sci-fi comic series created by Demon Hunter frontman Ryan Clark – returns in a deluxe collected edition via a new partnership with Z2 Comics. Beloved by fans of heavy metal and science fiction, the four-issue Exile series quickly sold out and became a rare collectible. Now Exile being re-released as a premium hardcover compilation, bundled with an exclusive vinyl 7\" featuring four songs previously released only on flexi-disc: \"I Align,\" \"The Brink,\" \"Some Of Us,\" and \"World’s Apart.\" \"Teaming up with Z2 to release this special hardcover edition of Exile has been an absolute pleasure,\" said Clark. \"The team at Z2 has been incredible to work with, and it’s an honor to collaborate with a company so respected and beloved in the world of comics. Collecting all four issues into one volume – along with some extra bells and whistles – feels like the perfect way to celebrate the full scope of this story and the Exile album.\" Set in a chillingly plausible near-future, Exile explores a world where technology has overrun society, personal freedom is extinct, and an authoritarian faction known as the M.A.S. (Moral Authority Syndicate) rules with brutal efficiency. The few remaining dissidents, calling themselves the LOTUS (Last of the Undying Spirit), have gone underground—erasing digital footprints and relying solely on ancient symbols and word of mouth to survive. At the center of the story is sixteen-year-old Hunter Woodson, whose home is raided by M.A.S. forces. Armed with a wooden staff and driven by duty, she embarks on a perilous journey to preserve her family’s legacy and deliver a sacred heirloom to a hidden survivor network. \"Watching Ryan’s story come to life was thrilling. After the issues quickly sold out, it became clear that a proper deluxe collected edition was in order,\" says longtime Demon Hunter manager Ryan J. Downey. \"Z2’s understanding of music and comics is unrivaled, something I know from working with them as a writer. It made perfect sense to partner with them.\" The 12\" hardcover deluxe collection includes: All four original Exile issues Four 24\" posters An exclusive orange 7-inch vinyl, featuring songs previously released only on flexi-disc A limited number of Platinum Editions, hand-signed by Ryan Clark, will be available exclusively through Z2 Comics.
