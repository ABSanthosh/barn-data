  "text": "School of Song, the online platform offering songwriting and community workshops with famed musicians, has announced that Brian Eno will host its January program. The workshop includes four lectures, hourlong Q\u0026As, and a live in-class writing exercise, with topics ranging from Oblique Strategies to Avant Gardening and beyond. The program costs $160, and the registration deadline is January 4.The description for Brian Eno’s School of Song course promises that he will guide students through his relationship to the creative process by sharing techniques and practices he’s developed throughout his career. “I’m looking forward to the chance to properly articulate some ideas about the creative process that have been fermenting over the last 50 years,” he added. “To be able to do this with some fresh young minds and imaginations was a chance that I couldn’t refuse.”The most recent solo album that Eno put out, ForeverAndEverNoMore, came out in 2022. In the years since then, he’s worked with Fred Again.., on Secret Life, rolled out the Small Craft EP and the archival album Sushi! Roti! Reibekuchen!, and worked with Hot Chip, Goddess, and Jean-Michel Jarre on songs.Revisit Philip Sherburne’s interview “A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music” and see where Eno and John Cale’s “Lay My Love” landed on “The 250 Best Songs of the 1990s.”",
