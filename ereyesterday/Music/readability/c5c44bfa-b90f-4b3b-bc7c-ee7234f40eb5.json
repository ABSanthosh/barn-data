  "text": "Lzzy Hale and Joe Hottinger of Halestorm have announced an intimate tour featuring the two of them performing acoustic, stripped down versions of Halestorm favorites and music that has inspired the band. Tour starts and ends in January 2025. In the meantime, you can check out the duo playing through \"The Silence\" below. \"With this tour, we're inviting our fans to experience what it would be like hanging with Joe and me in our living room: picking up instruments, telling stories, chatting about songs that helped shaped us as a band and brought us to where we are today,\" said Hale. Hottinger added: \"Back when we decided to quit our day jobs and make music our full-time endeavor, Lzzy and I would play music wherever we could, and sometimes that meant playing acoustic covers in any bar or restaurant that would have us. That time really allowed us to develop our playing skills and dig into songwriting, and it really set the groundwork for what Halestorm is today.\" 1/8 Flint, MI The Machine Shop1/10 Bloomington, IL Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts1/11 Des Moines, IA Hoyt Sherman Theatre1/13 Springfield, MO Gillioz Theatre1/14 Little Rock, AR The Hall1/16 Chattanooga, TN The Signal1/17 Biloxi, MS Hard Rock Live1/19 Pensacola, FL Vinyl Music Hall1/21 Savannah, GA District Live at Plant Riverside District1/22 Charleston, SC Charleston Music Hall1/24 Springfield, MA Aria Ballroom/MGM Springfield1/25 South Burlington, VT Higher Ground Want More Metal?
