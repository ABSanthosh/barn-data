  "text": "Mexican superstar Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda have postponed their concert scheduled in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday, allegedly due to visa issues. In a statement posted to Instagram on Friday, Álvarez claimed that his work visa has been revoked, preventing him from entering the United States for the sold-out performance at the AT\u0026T Stadium. Reportedly, the stage was already set for the show, and over 50,000 tickets had been purchased. “Sadly, the event will not go on as planned due to our work visa being cancelled,” Álvarez said. “It is not possible for us to go to the United States and fulfill our show promise with all of you. It’s something out of our control. That’s the information I have, and it hurts… It’s an event that was completely sold out.” According to a press release shared by Álvarez, his team is now working with promoters CMN and Copar Music to reschedule the performance. As of now, those who have already purchased tickets have been told that their tickets would remain valid for the rescheduled date, but refunds are available upon request. This isn’t the first time Álvarez has had visa issues. In 2017, his US work visa was revoked after the US Treasury Department alleged he had ties to a drug trafficking operation. He maintained his innocence — claiming his connection was limited to a real estate connection — and was eventually removed from the sanctions list in 2022. He regained his work visa this year, and performed three sold-out concerts at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA, last month, marking his first US shows in eight years. Now, it’s unsure when he’ll return. Álvarez is one of several musicians who’ve been forced to alter touring plans due to visa issues as of late, including FKA Twigs (who dropped out of Coachella because of visa complications) and Bells Larsen (who was effectively unable to apply for a visa because he’s trans).",
