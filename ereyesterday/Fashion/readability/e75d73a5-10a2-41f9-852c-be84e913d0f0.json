Ms. Wilbourn, a cat therapist, was a pioneer in the art of listening to them.Carole Wilbourn, a pioneer in feline psychotherapy, having a session with a troubled cat named Finn in 2014. She said she had treated some 13,000 cats. Credit...Bryan Smith/Zuma, via AlamyJan. 8, 2025Carole Wilbourn, a self-described cat therapist, who was known for her skill in decoding the emotional life of cats, as confounding as that would seem to be, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.Her death was confirmed by her sister Gail Mutrux. Ms. Wilbourn’s patients shredded sofas, toilet paper and romantic partners. They soiled rugs and beds. They galloped over their sleeping humans in the wee hours. They hissed at babies, dogs and other cats. They chewed electrical wires. They sulked in closets and went on hunger strikes.They suffered from childhood trauma, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, jealousy and just plain rage. And Ms. Wilbourn, who was self-taught — in college she had studied (human) psychology and majored in education — seemed particularly attuned to the inner workings of their furry minds. A minor Manhattan celebrity, she was often called the kitty Freud, or the mother of cat psychiatry.Cats hate change, she often noted. Even a new slipcover on the sofa can undo them. Cats are selfish. Unlike dogs, who strive to please their masters, a cat strives to please itself. To mangle a cliché, happy cat, happy (human) life.“A cat behaves badly when it’s trying to communicate,” Ms. Wilbourn told The Los Angeles Daily News in 1990. “It’s sending an SOS. It’s saying, ‘Please help me.’”Ms. Wilbourn developed her specialty over a half-century after founding The Cat Practice, billed as Manhattan’s first cats-only hospital, in 1973 with Paul Rowan, a veterinarian. She said she was the first feline therapist in the country, a claim that is not known to have been disputed.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
