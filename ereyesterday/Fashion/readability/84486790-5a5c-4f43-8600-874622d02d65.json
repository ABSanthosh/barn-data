  "description": "When I pulled out my Victoria's Secret Fashion Show getting-ready outfit from the shopping bag delivered to my doorstep, I was stoked. To be honest, I'd always wondered what it felt like to be one of the Angels getting her makeup done backstage in the brand's signature Satin Short Piped Robe ($60). Mine even came with the official VS merch emblem emblazoned in crystals on the back. Both the crystals and the matching baseball cap (which is sadly now sold out from the \"Shop the Show\" drop) made up for the fact that I had to do my own makeup before trekking it to Brooklyn's Duggal Greenhouse for the return of the legendary VS runway. Still, it was the outfit I slipped on after wearing the pink robe, the one I would ultimately wear to the show, that made me the most nervous: the Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit ($130). It was far more daring than the loungewear I had been sporting before, and I nearly put my foot in my mouth when I saw just how see-through the material actually was. As it would turn out, model and former First Lady of France Carla Bruni wore the very same design on the runway as I looked on from my seat in the audience, admiring her confidence. Suddenly, I didn't feel so eager to cover up in my oversize denim jacket anymore. In fact, seeing what my fellow showgoers were wearing also made me feel more liberated in my lingerie as we all watched a VS Fashion Show that was more body inclusive than ever before. Don't get me wrong: the brand still has a long way to go, in my opinion - viewers all over the world expressed that same sentiment after the spectacle wrapped - but getting to wear lingerie that's typically reserved for Angels made the runway fashion feel more accessible. Ahead, learn how I styled the VS Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit, worn by Bruni, and read my full review of the piece, which is still shoppable online. Carla Bruni on the Victoria's Secret Runway Image Source: Getty / TheStewartofNY/FilmMagic Bruni, who celebrated getting her wings ahead of the show, wore the VS Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit with the Lace Lightly Lined Demi Bra and the Twinkle Strap Lace Corset Set. Her shimmering beaded wings, chunky stone hoops, and wraparound sparkling stilettos amplified the glitzy boning on her top, with the catsuit itself acting as the foundation of her whole look. How to Style a Lace Catsuit As the wing-less spectator I am, I felt it appropriate to layer with an oversize denim jacket from Frame and opted for simple black pumps. I kept on my hat to add a sporty twist. Underneath, I was rocking the VS Shine Patch Lightly Lined Wireless Bra ($45) and VS Logo Cotton Shine Patch Hiphugger Panty ($15), a bra and underwear set I highly recommend for anyone who who prefers just a touch of glamour but favors comfort above all else. The wireless bra felt so smooth and lightweight, whereas the panties provided just enough coverage underneath the stocking-like bodysuit, without adding bulk. Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit Review As time went on, I grew to appreciate the catsuit more and more - and not just because I was inspired by Bruni's confidence. It really does have a stretchy feel to it so that it fits like a second skin. I also appreciate design details such as the illusion front panty panel and vertical front seams, which add undeniable sex appeal but sophistication all the same. The back zipper is also easy to maneuver without any help; and from a style perspective, it really does look good with a pair of heels, regardless of how many layers you add up top. My only gripe is that the sweetheart neckline is very low cut and the chest area is wide open, so if you want to layer a bra beneath the built-in cups, it will definitely be visible and may not align exactly how you pictured it. My advice is to try it with a few different bra and panty sets underneath until you find the perfect match for your shape. Of course, just like with a pair of tights, you'll want to pull up this bodysuit carefully because the lace embroidery is definitely delicate. Additional Details About the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Rose Lace Balconette Catsuit The catsuit comes in sizes XS-XXL. I took my usual size, XS. It's unlined and partially made from recycled materials, including recycled polyamide and recycled elastane. Since there's no back coverage, you will see your bra band from behind (and it'll likely peek out in the front, too). The catsuit is hand wash only. Rating:",
