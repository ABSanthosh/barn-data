  "description": "Ariana Madix's sartorial sense first captured our hearts during her time on Bravo's \"Vanderpump Rules.\" From the revenge dress shared all over social media to her go-to designer handbag, we knew she was a style star since her debut back in season two. Since then, she's become a bona fide fashion darling as the impeccably-dressed host of \"Love Island USA.\" The actress and restaurateur, who just celebrated her 40th birthday, says her TV hosting outfits are like her \"children\" - and, given the effort and talent that goes into choosing each one, the analogy fits. This season, Madix's looks are the talk of the \"Love Island USA\" universe, from a LaQuan Smith pink ab cutout gown that's currently trending on TikTok to a red minidress that feels like a nod to her \"Vanderpump Rules\" reunion days. And there are plenty of outfits and glam moments to come from her time in Fiji. Working closely with stylist Emily Men with assistance from Karissa Loveday, Madix chooses summer-ready outfits that exude main-character energy, perfect to recreate if you're hosting a birthday dinner or even attending a fancy party. Whether she's strutting in a gown covered in colorful paillettes or posing in a glittering metallic low-rise skirt, she ensures all eyes are on her with every outfit change. Ahead, check out Ariana Madix's best \"Love Island USA\" looks from season seven - and shop available and inspired pieces in time for your next event.",
