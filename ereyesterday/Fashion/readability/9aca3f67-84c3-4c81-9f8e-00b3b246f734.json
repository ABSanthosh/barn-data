But retinol has had a makeover. No longer is it that thing that stings and burns and leaves your skin shedding like a snake on acid. No, there are now, thank goodness, kinder, more modern iterations of the skincare polymath that does everything from smoothing to brightening the skin. Like Kate Somerville’s Mega A Skin Transforming Serum. The name of this serum really sets the bar high, doesn’t it? When a product tells me it will transform my skin, I roll up my sleeves and say bring it on, cynical as to whether it will actually deliver. But you’ll be pleased to know that this serum not only lives up to expectation, it exceeds it. Powered by a clinical-grade retinol, it is 11 x more powerful that your regular retinol and yet gentle enough to use every single day. The downside associated with retinols – the burning, the peeling, dryness, etc – is nowhere to be seen. Perhaps that is because this light milky yellow-hued serum includes ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and squalene, meaning your skin’s hydration and elasticity is through the roof. Also it means it is totally suitable for the most sensitive of skins. Within a few days of trialling this product, I noticed my skin texture was much smoother, had a more even tone and was plumper – my makeup goes on like a dream. It is giving me the kind of results I would only expect with a good facial. Magic in a bottle. I’m obsessed.
