  "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: summer outfit ideas — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. It hasn’t been the *hottest* start to the summer (at least not yet), but we’d be lying if we said we weren’t daydreaming about long, easy days that remind us of school breaks. Maybe we’re on the beach, maybe we’re taking leisurely strolls at the local park, maybe we’re running errands on our lunch — whatever it is, we’re covered in a layer of sweat, and we don’t mind because the sun is shining. With such daydreams, naturally, come thoughts of summer outfits that make you feel like the main character in a rom-com. Pretty sun dresses, cool yet distinctive denim, lively patterns and colors, the perfect pair of sandals — you name it, we’re thinking of it. But if you’re struggling to actualize the enchanting visions in your head to IRL outfits, we’ve got you covered here, too. After a thorough search of our Instagram feeds, we’ve collected a selection of trend-forward and inspo-worthy outfits that practically scream summer. Scroll on to discover 23 summer outfit ideas to help you get dressed this season. Summer Outfit Idea: Polka Dots Polka dots are back, bringing a retro edge to contemporary pieces. Your summer ’fits will be full of nostalgic whimsy, whether you opt for a dress, accessories, or separates adorned in the print. Summer Outfit Idea: Boat ShoesRejoice! The footwear item of the summer is one you’ll always be comfortable in: the boat shoe. Prep up your looks with this “ugly shoe” trend by pairing it with a blazer and shorts, a maxi dress, or even your favorite pair of jeans.Summer Outfit Idea: Lacey Whites Why wear a traditional crisp white set this summer when you can wear one with intricate frills and lace details instead? Summer Outfit Idea: Ruffles Zhuzh up your summer dress rotation by adding one with a flourish of ruffles. We especially love the Y2K vibes and ruched front of the one pictured here.Summer Outfit Idea: Capri Pants + Thong Kitten Heels Get even more Y2K with a pair of capri pants and thong kitten heels, which will elevate any outfit just a tad. Summer Outfit Idea: Fisherman Aesthetic If full-out marine motifs aren’t your thing, try your hand at the fisherman aesthetic with some nautical stripes. Of course, being by the water doesn’t hurt either. Summer Outfit Idea: Jorts Jorts and longer, utilitarian-style shorts will be everywhere this season, and with good reason. They’re ideal for warmer weather and effortlessly blend fashion and function without feeling too bulky. Summer Outfit Idea: WaistcoatVests and waistcoats are still going strong this summer, which is good news for us all: dress them up, lean more western, or keep your look casual — the sartorial possibilities are endless. Summer Outfit Idea: Crochet Crochet has been popular for a few summers now, but, this year, why not try a different approach? Style your crochet separates with airy linens or other well-loved seasonal favorites for an outfit that’s textured, put-together, and warm-weather-ready. Summer Outfit Idea: Graphic Tee + Flowy Pants Pair your breeziest pants with your comfiest graphic T-shirt for the most effortless, chicest summer outfit ever. You’re welcome.  Summer Outfit Idea: Maxi Skirt + Sneakers We love a summer outfit that is equal parts cute and comfortable, especially on hot days. Enter: a maxi skirt and sneakers. We can’t imagine a better combo to be in while strolling about town all day. Summer Outfit Idea: Linen SetLinen sets for summer? Groundbreaking, we know. But why resist something this perfect?Summer Outfit Idea: Raffia Accessories Raffia and straw accessories are perennial summer favorites. This year, try the charming material in bags, hats, or even jewelry.Summer Outfit Idea: Gingham Much like raffia, gingham often sees a resurgence during the warmer months. Opt for the pattern in full pieces or smaller accessories, and try out a range of color options to land on a look that feels the most like you. Summer Outfit Idea: Shorts + BootsMini shorts and knee-high boots? Not just for Coachella, as it turns out! Summer Outfit Idea: Bubble HemSummertime is for having fun, and what better way to do so than with a bubble hem? If you’re already well acquainted with the trend, which found its footing last summer, change things up by upping the volume or even trying out a puffed-up bloomer.Summer Outfit Idea: Pierced and Studded PiecesIf you’re tired of classic minimalist looks and ultra-feminine pieces that don't fit your aesthetic, designers and brands are bringing a punk element to the season with pierced and studded clothing and accessories. The only thing for you to decide is just how much embellishment you’re going for — an accessory, like a belt, or on elements of your entire outfit.  Summer Outfit Idea: Butter Yellow Butter yellow is a color trend that isn’t fading — not that we’re complaining about seeing more of the dreamy sunny hue. Summer Outfit Idea: Icy Blue If butter yellow is outside of your color palette or a bit too on the nose for your liking, try the cooler, elegant icy blue. Summer Outfit Idea: Asymmetrical HemsAdd some intrigue to your summer matching sets by choosing a skirt with an interest slit, cut-out, or hemline. Summer Outfit Idea: 3D Accoutrements  This one is for the bag charm girlies, who don’t mind a “more is more” approach. Extend that philosophy to your full looks by going for pieces with fabulous 3-D embellishments, like the oversized rosettes pictured here. Summer Outfit Idea: BowsIf floral accoutrements are not your style, why not an over-the-top bow instead? Summer Outfit Idea: Sweater For Layering Keep a couple of your favorite sweaters out of storage — not for wearing (though, who knows, they may come in handy on occasion), but to wear tied around your waist or shoulders as a finishing touch to your summer outfit.
