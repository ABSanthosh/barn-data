  "text": "THE RUNDOWN This morning, Tracee Ellis Ross went on The Today Show to promote her new show, Solo Traveling With Tracee Ellis Ross.The actress wore brand-new Jacquemus from the spring 2026 collection. The look was complemented by a slicked-back bun covered by a cobalt fishnet. Tracee Ellis Ross is one of the undefeated street-style champions of our time. In just one week, the High Note actress has turned out a series of impeccable looks, including an A-line tent dress from Givenchy made entirely of leather and a more sculptural look from independent designer LII. This morning, Ross was spotted on the streets of New York City, headed to an appearance on The Today Show in fresh-off-the-runway Jacquemus, styled by her longtime collaborator Karla Welch. The sweeping blue-and-white-striped look effortlessly embodied the oceanside breeze you’d enjoy while summering in the south of France—exactly as the spring 2026 collection intended to do. (The pieces were inspired by designer Simon Porte Jacquemus’s peasant-farmer heritage in the region.) Raymond Hall//Getty ImagesTo add a further pop of color, Ross enlisted her longtime and legendary hairstylist Chuck Amos for a cobalt fishnet-covered slicked-back bun. The duo has recently been obsessed with the neon-netted chignon cover, pairing teal with a recent Khaite look, and for the LII dress, cherry red that matched the soles of her white Louboutins. On Instagram, the actress joked that it was the theme of the week, even captioning one photo dump: “I did a lot of fish-netting around the apple.”",
