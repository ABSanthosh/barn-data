The photo of the shirtless man was created for the 2015 edition of the “Hunks and Hounds” annual calendar.“Now that we have your attention,” the text read, “a critical special election is happening TOMORROW!”In the election, Wisconsin voters approved an amendment to the state’s constitution to strengthen a current law requiring photo identification at the polls — a measure that Look Ahead America supported — while electing a liberal candidate to a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.Matt Braynard, the executive director of Look Ahead America, said in an email that the organization had “conducted studies that have proven that using eye-catching images not typically associated with politics increase voter awareness of elections and voter participation.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
