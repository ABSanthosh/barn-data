The auntie shared our phone numbers, and our relationship moved quickly from there.”Their first phone conversation lasted more than three hours, leading to a week of daily phone calls and plans for a first date. They even coordinated their outfits: black head to toe, just for fun. “Despite never having seen her, I already felt a deep sense of comfort and familiarity,” Mr. Khan said.“Each conversation brought us closer, more in tune, and I began to realize that Raed was the man I had been searching for all along,” Ms. Badat, also 30, added.For their first date on July 7, Mr. Khan and Ms. Badat agreed to meet at the parking lot of the Galleria mall in Houston. Mr. Khan, with a bouquet of flowers in tow, was instantly enamored. “Her hair blew softly in the wind, her skin glowed, her eyes pierced through me, and her smile radiated warmth,” he said.Ms. Badat felt an immediate attraction, too. “He was so tall and handsome,” she said, “and I was surprised and touched that he brought me flowers.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
