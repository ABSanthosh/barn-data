Mr. Amin said he had been eager to acquire Rhode for months, citing the brand’s fervent fan base.Credit...RhodeMay 29, 2025, 4:51 p.m. ETRhode, the upstart beauty brand founded by the fashion model and entrepreneur Hailey Bieber, has been acquired by E.L.F. Beauty for $800 million in cash and stock, an eye-popping sum for a line of blushes and lip glosses that’s not yet three years old.In an industry crowded with other celebrity-fronted beauty brands, Rhode has experienced rapid growth, which many attribute to Mrs. Bieber’s considerable influence on social media. (Mrs. Bieber, a daughter of the actor Stephen Baldwin and the wife of the pop star Justin Bieber, has 55 million followers on Instagram and 15 million on TikTok.)“Rhode has seen exponential growth over the past three years because of deliberate decisions and best-in-class marketing and community building,” Mrs. Bieber said in a statement. “To continue to grow strategically, we need the partnership of E.L.F. Beauty to fuel innovation and global expansion.”On top of the guaranteed $800 million payout, the E.L.F. deal, which was announced on Wednesday, includes the potential for an additional $200 million, contingent on Rhode’s growth over the next three years. Rhode, which Mrs. Bieber founded with Lauren and Michael D. Ratner, reported net sales of $212 million in the year that ended March 31.According to Tarang Amin, the chief executive of E.L.F. Beauty, the acquisition had been in the works since October. Mr. Amin said he was eager to close on it to marry the Gen Alpha fans Mrs. Bieber has pulled in with the millennials and Gen Z consumers whom E.L.F. has traditionally relied on.The expansion includes a partnership with Sephora that will bring Rhode products to physical stores for the first time since the brand’s debut. But even without a consistent presence in brick-and-mortar shops, Rhode had built a fan base that Mr. Amin found impressive.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
