What if there’s a care product that can effectively manage your B.O.? One that’s skin-friendly enough to use across your entire body?

Apart from choosing the right product from the Lume brand, I also read through tons of Amazon listings for comparison. I chose options that can solve body odor problems as well as those that offer enticing scents with no harmful ingredients mixed in. From there, I got units for testing and spent significant time trying them out. I paid attention to each deodorant’s composition, the texture, and my skin’s reaction when used. The results, along with other important details, are listed below. About My Skin I have sensitive skin, so I easily experience breakouts when I use skincare products that have harmful chemicals. For this Lume deodorant review, I selected options that are free from harmful ingredients like parabens, phthalates, alcohol, and aluminum, to name a few. So I always go for organic items made from naturally sourced materials and free from fragrances. TL;DR The Lume deodorant review will tackle both the product and the brand, showing you everything you need to know from the item’s composition to its performance. The Lume Whole Body Deodorant serves as your primary solution for controlling body odor. It’s versatile enough to be used on any hotspots on your body, from the pits to your groin. It comes in various scent profiles often sporting refreshing, and rejuvenating aromas on top of its premium price tag. About Lume Whole Body Deodorant Lume Whole Body Deodorant offers users complete odor control for the pits, privates, and more. It’s designed to keep you smelling fresh every day of the week. It’s clinically proven to block B.O. for a maximum of 72 hours. The brand claims that its formula is pH-optimized to stop ghastly smells before they occur. It’s also free from aluminum, baking soda, and parabens, so it’s hypoallergenic and skin-safe, especially on your sensitive parts. The Lume Whole Body deodorant also features refreshing green forest scents with a touch of bergamot and pepper notes. Its crisp and clean aroma will revitalize your senses, allowing you to jump-start your day with no problems. lumedeodorant / Instagram What To Consider Before Buying Before tackling further details in the Lume deodorant review, it’s important to note that the product is a scented deodorant more than anything else. The aroma won’t last the entire day and doesn’t have strong projection and sillage. You’ll need it only to mask your body odor, so go for perfumes if you want to smell great the entire day. The Lume Whole Body Deodorant is also meant to be used on specific parts, which are the hotspots for B.O., like the armpits, crotch, and feet. Why It’s Great When it comes to completely deodorizing your body, the Lume Whole Body Deodorant doesn’t disappoint. I rubbed it on my armpits and feet, then played basketball all day, completely covered in sweat. When I got home and took my clothes off, I smelled no bad odor. I avoided taking a shower and hit the gym the next day, and to my surprise, I still didn’t produce any B.O. It also doesn’t leave any stains on the fabric, so you can be sure that your clothes will always look sharp no matter how many times you use the deodorant. The Fresh Alpine flavor also gives a nice and refreshing scent that’s not cloying to the nose. How To Use It Like any stick deodorant, you just rub it on specific parts of your skin that generate odor caused by sweat. So that means your armpits, the bottom of your feet, and your private parts. These come in 2.6-ounce sticks, so it’s compact but highly concentrated. You don’t need to generously and vigorously rub it just to get rid of body odor because you’ll end up using all of it very quickly. A good two to three rubs per area should be enough to get you through a day or more. lumedeodorant / Instagram Flaws But Not Deal-breakers Lume Whole Body deodorant has excellent longevity, but it doesn’t last three days as advertised. By the end of the second day I was wearing Lume, I already whiffed hints of my body odor, which prompted me to take a shower. This product isn’t cheap, either. It costs roughly $16 per stick, but the brand does offer bundles of two, which are priced at $30. Some of the available scents have synthetic notes, which tend to be overpowering when sniffed. I saw some reviews in which people claimed that the unscented cream option smells like cheese, and they’re right. Here’s an expert tip from my review of Lume deodorant: I wouldn’t order that unscented one a second time. If you want your deodorant to smell nice and rejuvenating, then stick to the Fresh Alpine, Clean Tangerine, and Lavender Sage flavors. You Have Options: Lume Alternatives Item 1: Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men Why it’s great: The Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men comes as a powerful natural protection against bad body odor. Its ingredients of Arrowroot powder, charcoal, and postbiotics effectively get rid of germs that cause those nasty smells. It’s also free from harsh synthetic chemicals like aluminum, parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and silicones. The Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant is highly concentrated. You need only three to four swipes post-shower to smell fresh and stay confident. The sticks come in 2.65 oz bottles and four different scents: Alpine Sage, Fresh Falls, Summer Citrus, and Fresh Aloe. Who is this for? Great for people looking for powerful organic deodorants. Flaws but not deal-breakers: It doesn’t last as long as advertised. Item 2: Each \u0026 Every All Natural Deodorant Why it’s great: Meant for people with sensitive skin, the Each \u0026 Every All Natural Deodorant is free from skin-irritating ingredients like baking soda and alcohol. It comes in 10 different scents crafted from essential oils, allowing you to choose the one that matches your tastes and personality. Its dead sea minerals act as a natural odor fighter, and the plush tapioca and coconut oil allow it to glide smoothly against your skin when applied. This deodorant is also ethically sourced and vegan-friendly. The brand uses recyclable plant-based packaging to contain this body deodorizer and ensures that the products were never tested on animals. Who is this for? Perfect for guys who need deodorants that are gentle enough for sensitive skin. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Some of the scent options tend to overpower the nose. teresamix93 / Instagram Why Trust Us? My years of experience as a lifestyle blogger, fashion writer, and product reviewer allow me to accurately determine what makes a great deodorant people can invest in. I wrote various articles from notable websites like Men’s Health and Travel+Leisure. I’ve also covered similar categories like finding the best toners and body washes for guys, so I’m strongly familiar with the right skincare men can truly benefit from. For this Lume deodorant review and for other articles, my research method includes checking out the product’s features through online listings and noting down what the brand claims and what the customers say about them. Then I test them out and see if the opinions from both sides hold merit. This approach provides my readers with accurate information based on expertise and real-life testimonials, allowing them to make informed decisions about the product that they want to purchase. Verdict We’ve reached the end of this review of Lume deodorant. So, what did we learn? Lume Whole Body Deodorant is an extraordinary skincare product that can effectively fight body odor minus harmful chemicals. It has excellent longevity, lasting at most two consecutive days before you need to reapply it. The deodorant does come with a hefty price tag, and you can find cheaper options that also get the job done. It’s not something I’ll consider buying again given the steep cost, but if you’re someone who’s dealing with strong body odor or want a deodorant that lasts more than a day, then it’s worth trying out. FAQ Lume deodorants work as intended, and they can completely get rid of your body odor when applied. The great thing about the brand’s items is that you can apply them to any of your body parts. Most Lume deodorants have enticing scents like the Fresh Alpine, Clean Tangerine, and Lavender Sage. There are options, however, that tend to cloy the nose or have unfavorable aromas. The amount of Lume you need to use depends on the type of deodorant. If you have cream, a pea-sized amount should be enough while the stick would require you to rub it twice or thrice on places where you want to control odor.

By the end of the second day I was wearing Lume, I already whiffed hints of my body odor, which prompted me to take a shower. This product isn’t cheap, either. It costs roughly $16 per stick, but the brand does offer bundles of two, which are priced at $30.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the available scents have synthetic notes, which tend to be overpowering when sniffed. I saw some reviews in which people claimed that the unscented cream option smells like cheese, and they’re right. Here’s an expert tip from my review of Lume deodorant: I wouldn’t order that unscented one a second time. If you want your deodorant to smell nice and rejuvenating, then stick to the Fresh Alpine, Clean Tangerine, and Lavender Sage flavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"alternatives\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Have Options: Lume Alternatives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TWFRWC8?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180201-20\u0026amp;linkId=494861aa82b51c140e02716d95623638\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eItem 1: Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TWFRWC8?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180201-20\u0026amp;linkId=494861aa82b51c140e02716d95623638\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview.jpg 600w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: The Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men comes as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-natural-deodorants-for-men/\"\u003epowerful natural protection\u003c/a\u003e against bad body odor.

By the end of the second day I was wearing Lume, I already whiffed hints of my body odor, which prompted me to take a shower. This product isn’t cheap, either. It costs roughly $16 per stick, but the brand does offer bundles of two, which are priced at $30.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the available scents have synthetic notes, which tend to be overpowering when sniffed. I saw some reviews in which people claimed that the unscented cream option smells like cheese, and they’re right. Here’s an expert tip from my review of Lume deodorant: I wouldn’t order that unscented one a second time. If you want your deodorant to smell nice and rejuvenating, then stick to the Fresh Alpine, Clean Tangerine, and Lavender Sage flavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"alternatives\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Have Options: Lume Alternatives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TWFRWC8?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180201-20\u0026amp;linkId=494861aa82b51c140e02716d95623638\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eItem 1: Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TWFRWC8?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180201-20\u0026amp;linkId=494861aa82b51c140e02716d95623638\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview.jpg 600w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DrSquatch_NaturalDeodorant_LumeDeodorantReview-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: The Dr. Squatch Natural Deodorant for Men comes as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-natural-deodorants-for-men/\"\u003epowerful natural protection\u003c/a\u003e against bad body odor.
