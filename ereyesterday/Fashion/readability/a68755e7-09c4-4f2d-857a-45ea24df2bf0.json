Once you start wearing cashmere socks, there isn’t really any further you can go in terms of luxury—you’re at the top. And, from comfort to breathability to unbelievable softness, there are lots of reasons to get yourself a pair. Cashmere has been a mark of quality for hundreds of years, ever since the luxurious fabric from the Kashmir region began to reach the West. Although it’s not as rare as it once was, thanks to modern production techniques and globalization, cashmere is still a sought-after commodity worldwide. This article is a deep dive on the best cashmere socks for men to help you stay warm and comfortable during the fall and winter months. Say goodbye to those itchy wool socks, and get ready for some serious comfort. Let’s get right into it. Key Takeaways I’ve bought more than a few pairs of cashmere socks over the years whenever I was in the mood to indulge in my most luxurious tastes. As a result, I have a lot of experience that helped me come up with this list of the seven best cashmere socks for men. One of my favorite brands for socks is Pantherella, which makes it no surprise that I’ve rated their Moreton Feeder Stripe Cashmere Men’s Socks as the best cashmere socks for men. The feeder stripe pattern and top and bottom stripes look really classy when you don’t have your shoes on, and high-quality cashmere feels amazing at all times. I’ve also included a budget option, the Mens Pringle 1 Pair Cashmere And Merino Wool Blend Luxury Socks, for those men who want a pair of great cashmere socks but don’t have a small fortune to spend on them. And, on the other end of the extreme, you’ll find the ultra-luxe Falke No. 2 Finest Cashmere Men Socks with Mongolian Cashmere for those who want the absolute best.

They’ve even got an anti-odor treatment that anyone who’s self-conscious whenever they take off their shoes will appreciate. Who are they for? If you’re looking for a comfortable pair of socks but not overly concerned with what percentage of cashmere you’re going to be getting, then I’d recommend this option for you. Flaws but not deal-breakers: They do contain a couple of synthetic materials that some shoppers might prefer to do without. Material: 37% Wool, 27% Viscose, 24% Recycled Polyamide, 11% Cashmere, and 1% Elastane | Sizes Available: 7 – 11 U.S. Mens | Colors Available: 8 | Style: Long Anklet, Ribbed legs | Care: Machine Wash Best Luxury: Falke No. 2 Finest Cashmere Men Socks with Mongolian Cashmere Why they’re great: The Falke No. 2 Finest Cashmere Men Socks with Mongolian Cashmere are distinctive in every possible way.

With vibrant red, green, and yellow options, you can use them as a part of lots of mixing and matching. Who are they for? If you’re someone who loves socks to be a notable part of their outfit, rather than just in the background, then you’ll find lots to like about Ralph Lauren Ribbed Cashmere-Blend Dress Socks.

Material: 73% cashmere, 15% polyester, 10% spandex, and 2% rubber | Sizes Available: 43 E.U. º 46 E.U. | Colors Available: 8 | Style: Ankle | Care: Machine Wash ralphlauren / Instagram Buying Considerations for The Best Cashmere Socks For Men Thickness The first decision you should make when shopping for men’s cashmere socks is how thick you want your new socks to be. You can find both ultra-thin and ultra-thick cashmere socks, so which you should opt for depends on how and when you think you’ll get the most use of them. If you’re looking for formal socks to wear with dress shoes, they’ll usually be thinner. But, more outdoorsy socks that are meant for tramping around in boots are most often on the thicker side. Color \u0026 Style Once again, you can find cashmere socks that come in all manner of colors, patterns, and styles. You should pick some socks that you really like and will be appropriate for the occasions when you want to wear them. If you’re not a fan of wearing funky socks, either with formal outfits or in general, you’ll find plenty of black and navy options as well. Pure Cashmere or Blend? Finally, you should decide whether you want to really look for a pair of 100% cashmere socks or if you’re happy getting a blend of cashmere and another material. Many thinner cashmere socks will contain a small amount of synthetic fabric like Polyamide because this helps to give the sock a little more durability and stretchiness. You can also find cashmere socks that contain merino wool, which is a very soft wool that pairs very nicely with cashmere. As long as you like the socks you’re ordering, I wouldn’t be too concerned with whether or not they are 100% cashmere instead of 75 or 80%. pantherellasocks / Instagram How We Chose Men’s cashmere socks have to tick off a few boxes to be considered for a list like this one. They have to be made from incredibly high-quality cashmere (and, as you probably know, not all cashmere is created equal). They also have to be durable and functional—nobody wants to spend money on some expensive cashmere socks only to have them fall apart after a few wears. We also made sure that each product we recommended comes from a brand that does well on these four crucial criteria: Brand Reputation: We always ensure that every brand we recommend has a track record of consistent quality and craftsmanship. Customer Reviews: Cashmere socks are supposed to be exceptional, so the products we considered that had anything less than rave didn’t get anywhere close to our list. Price: Although some of the men’s cashmere socks on this list have high price tags, we always make sure that any product we recommend carries enough value to justify how much it costs. Transparency: Finally, we’re always careful to choose brands that are transparent about crucial details like the origin of their materials and their return policies. Why Trust Us? The editorial team here at FashionBeans is united in our love of cashmere socks. We feel that there’s no reason not to look for the best possible fabrics when shopping for every article of clothing, all the way from socks and shoes to hats. That’s why we were all really excited to work on this article about the best cashmere socks for men. We each looked through our own closets, talked to friends and families, and looked through hundreds of online product lists on our own. Then, after coming up with a shortlist of our individual favorites, we met to iron out exactly what would and wouldn’t make the list. After a lot of debate, we’re quite happy with the list we eventually settled on. Final Verdict  Overall, the best pair of cashmere socks for men is the Pantherella Moreton Feeder Stripe Cashmere Men’s Socks. They strike the right balance in a lot of different ways: they’re thick enough to generate some serious warmth but not too thick to wear under most shoes or boots. They also have a super simple and classy design that you could show off to anyone. FAQ Yes, cashmere is an excellent material to make socks from, you just need to make sure you’re wearing them in situations that make sense. Cashmere is a very warm material so you don’t want to wear them in the middle of the summer—you’ll just end up with sweaty feet. (To avoid that outcome, you might want to go with a pair of no-show socks from this list during the summer). The answer to the question of whether a pair of cashmere socks will be warmer than a pair of wool socks depends on how thick they are. In general, though, cashmere socks are capable of being just as warm as wool ones, even when they’re considerably thinner. That means you won’t suffer from stuffing your feet into massively thick wool socks before stuffing those into a pair of boots. You can definitely wear cashmere socks with shoes—I’d even recommend you try it out. There are lots of thin and breathable cashmere socks that work really well under a pair of sneakers or dress shoes. This makes cashmere socks a great replacement for either a pair of traditional crew socks or dress socks.",

Many thinner cashmere socks will contain a small amount of synthetic fabric like Polyamide because this helps to give the sock a little more durability and stretchiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also find cashmere socks that contain merino wool, which is a very soft wool that pairs very nicely with cashmere.
