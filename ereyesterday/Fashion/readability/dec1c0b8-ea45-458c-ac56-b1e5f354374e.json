Just like ‘Tom Brady’ and ‘misplaced pass,’ ‘cheap’ and ‘Rolex’ are two words that you don’t see together often. Thoughtfully designed and manufactured using the very best materials, a Rolex passes through the hands of watchmakers, engineers, designers, and many other specialists before it finds its way onto your wrist.  It’s said that each individual timepiece can take around a whole year to make, so is it any wonder we struggle to find the cheapest Rolex watches for men? I’ll answer that for you: no, it’s not. However, while coming across something that doesn’t break the bank is a tough task, it’s by no means impossible (especially if you know where to look). As luck would have it, we’ve been looking in all the right places. We pulled together a bunch of pretty awesome watches that aren’t going to leave you eating beans on toast for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

It’s arguably one of the most recognizable luxury watches in the world (and the best ever made). The Datejust is timeless, iconic, and all-around beautiful—making it the perfect choice for pretty much any occasion.

Each starts at a different price point, with some being more affordable than others. For those searching for the cheapest Rolex for men, you should look at the Datejust, Oyster Perpetual, and Air-King. These styles aren’t going to hit your wallet as heavy (although, be warned, they’re still not exactly ‘cheap’).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1106517\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1106517\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nivram_vintage_watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1040633\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen.jpg\" alt=\"Three Rolex watches with different straps\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1440\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen.jpg 1440w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-696x696.jpg 696w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nivram_vintage_watch_CheapestRolexWatchesforMen-1068x1068.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1106517\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nivram_vintage_watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1040634\"\u003enivram_vintage_watch\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eMovement\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNowadays, Rolexes are either self or manually winding. However, this wasn’t always the case. The luxury watchmaker previously produced a small number of battery-powered watches called ‘Oysterquartz.’ This ended in 2001, but you can still find some of these models on the pre-owned market (and they tend to be some of the cheapest Rolex for men).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eMaterial\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJust as the metal of a wedding ring changes the price tag, your Rolex watch materials also play a big part in its value. The bracelet, dial, and bezel construction can all affect the price. Platinum is generally the most expensive, then gold and stainless steel. The cheapest Rolex for men are usually made from the latter. Bezels can be made from a variety of materials, including gold, titanium, and ceramic. But you may also find some dials can include extras such as diamonds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"custom_faqs\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAQ\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRolexes can range from $5,000 for the cheapest Rolex for men, all the way up to $400,000+ for the iced-out versions you see on the wrist of your favorite rapper.
