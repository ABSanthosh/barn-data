User reviews may have been lightly edited for clarity.01PS Photography | Marisa PetrarcaBest Budget-Friendly Wedding ShoesDream Pairs Chunk Low Heel Pump Sandals ($33, originally $46) Finding comfortable and budget-friendly wedding shoes may feel damn near impossible, but this pair proves the two can coexist. They feature a walkable block heel for extra stability and an adjustable strap to help you get the just-right fit. One of our editors has worn them to multiple weddings; not her own, though according to the comments, plenty of brides have. Learn more about them in our Dream Pairs Chunk Low Heel Pump Sandals review. Pros: Under $50; Fast shipping via Amazon Prime; Over 15,000 five-star ratings Cons: Some reviewers report that they run narrow Material: Polyurethane (synthetic plastic material meant to look and feel like leather) Colorways: 39 Who it's best for: Budget-conscious brides and bridesmaids Extras: They're the number-one bestseller among Amazon's heeled sandals Editor Quote: \"At the time of writing, I've already worn the Dream Pairs Open Toe Pump Chunky Heel Sandals to two of my three summer weddings. I'll admit, when everyone was showing off their designer shoes before the ceremony at the first wedding, I stayed quiet since I spent practically nothing on mine. But then I couldn't help but smile when I was the only bridesmaid who kept my shoes on for the entire reception. They were comfortable enough and stable. Even though the unhemmed dress I wore gave me some trouble walking down the aisle (totally my fault), my shoes kept me upright.\" — Marisa Petrarca, contributing editor, Shopping02POPSUGAR PhotographyBest Wedding Shoes With a Block HeelNaturalizer Vera Dress Sandal ($102, originally $130) If you're looking for reliable block heels that actually feel good on your feet, this Naturalizer pair has you covered. Thousands of reviewers call them \"comfortable,\" with many saying they wore them on their wedding day, and would do it all over again. Pros: Certified leather from the Leather Working Group; Shipped in environmentally conscious packaging; Available in half sizes and multiple widths Cons: Some shoppers reported quality issues Material: Leather Colorways: 40+ Who it's best for: Brides or guests who want stable, stylish heels under $100 Extras: They're a cult-favorite on wedding-focused Subreddits What Reviewers Say: \"The most comfortable shoes I've ever owned! I wore these at my wedding and have worn them many times since then, and I am obsessed with them. They have held up wonderfully. I might buy these in a bunch of different colors, honestly; I love them so much.\"03amazon.comBest Lace Wedding ShoesBetsey Johnson Women's Nikki Pump ($119) As one Amazon reviewer pointed out, these embroidered, lacey pumps evoke vintage vibes in the chicest way possible (all the elegance, none of the dust). In addition to the intricate beading, they feature a pretty blue bottom that'll check the \"something blue\" box off your to-do list. Pros: Intricate bead and sequin detailing; Easy to walk in; Wearable three-inch heel Cons: Currently backordered on the brand's website Material: Mesh textile Colorways: 6 Who it's best for: Brides or guests who want a detailed, dressy shoe that makes a statement What Reviewers Say: \"Best purchase everrrrr for wedding shoes! They're so comfortable and stand out with the blue bottoms and beading. Easy to put on, great fit for wide feet. They were not scratchy on the inside of the shoe, and the back has a slight stretch, which helps with comfortability.\"04amazon.comBest Wedding Shoes With PearlsDolce Vita Women's Kanika Pump ($135) Nothing says \"I'm getting married\" quite like the delicate pearl-covered upper on these polished, pointy-toe pumps. They look far more expensive than they are and come in both full and half sizes. If you fall in love with them for your big day, you can grab the same silhouette in more low-key hues for future wear, too. Pros: Sold at multiple retailers; Pairs beautifully with pearl accessories or embellished dresses; Available in a flat and lower-heel version Cons: Some report rubbing at the sides Material: Textile Colorways: 4 Who it's best for: Brides or guests who want an elegant, closed-toe shoe What Reviewers Say: \"I usually hate wearing heels. They always cut the back of my ankle and give me blisters on my pinky toe. These shoes are actually quite comfortable. I wanted heels for my wedding day that I could comfortably spend a lot of time in. Although my wedding day hasn't happened yet, I've been wearing them around the house to break them in, and I stood in them for about an hour during my dress fitting. I can go quite a while wearing them without any pain.\"05nordstrom.comBest Pointed-Toe Wedding ShoesBadgley Mischka Collection Blaze Pump ($198) These ankle-strap pumps tie into a dainty bow at the side, making them eye candy for soon-to-be brides. The three-inch heel hits that sweet spot (not too tall, not too short), and they come in a dreamy lineup of colors like mist blue, blush pink, and classic black if white's not your thing. Pros: Offers ankle support; Chic chiffon ankle-wrap bow; Elegant Cons: Stain easily Material: Textile Colorways: 4 Who it's best for: Best for brides who want a sleek mid-heel with a subtle back bow What Reviewers Say: \"I wore these shoes for my wedding and they were great! The tie really helps provide ankle support and stability and they were so easy to walk in. I broke them in prior to the wedding and wore them for about 12 hours on wedding day. My feet were sore at the end of the day, but beyond manageable! Loved these shoes!\"06POPSUGAR PhotographyBest Wedding Shoes With a BowLoeffler Randall Camellia Pearl Pleated Bow Heel ($395) These Loeffler Randall sandals epitomize elegance, thanks to their signature crinkled fabric and bow detail, not to mention the comfort factor courtesy of a padded footbed. They come in a range of colors, with pearl white as the clear wedding-day favorite, but shades like pale blue are also available if you're still on the hunt for your \"something blue.\" Pros: Has an adjustable buckle strap; Vegan; Has chic pleating Cons: The bow's raw edges may fray over time and need a light seasonal trim Material: Polyester Colorways: 11 Who it's best for: Best for brides who want a romantic, open-toe heel What Reviewers Say: \"These are SO comfortable. I was shocked. Was testing them out to be my wedding shoes by using them for my shower and I didn't think twice about them - meaning, they were amazing.\"07margauxny.comBest Platform Wedding ShoesMargaux The Platform Sandal ($395) Platforms are a smart choice if you're getting married outdoors. They offer more stability on grass or sand than traditional pumps, plus they give you a solid height boost. They're also a stylish pick for any wedding event, whether you're walking down the aisle or headed to your rehearsal dinner. Pros: Cushioned with a comfy 5mm layer of foam; Handmade in Spain; Available in a wide, medium, and narrow fit Cons: Runs small — the brand suggests going up half a size Material: Italian suede and leather Colorways: 5 Who it's best for: Brides who want a little extra height without giving up comfort What Reviewers Say: \"I wore these platform sandals for my wedding, and they were perfect! First of all, the style is classic and looked really pretty under my dress. But I danced the night away in these, and they didn't blister or hurt my feet. I wore them for 7 hours straight. These shoes are super comfortable and supportive, and the style is timeless. I wanted to buy a shoe I would wear again, and I definitely will!\"08nordstrom.comBest Pearl-Embellished Wedding ShoesStuart Weitzman Bliss Pointed Toe Pump ($510, originally $850) For allover texture, don't sleep on this discounted Stuart Weitzman pair, decked out in pearls of all sizes. They're perfect if you're looking to add a little personality to a minimalist dress or want to match the pearls on your gown. Either way, you can't go wrong. Pros: Practically made for a close-up in your wedding album; On sale right now (!); A no-brainer if your dress has pearl accents Cons: Only comes in one colorway (albeit a very bridal one) Material: Textile and leather Colorways: 1 Who it's best for: Brides looking for a pump with lots of texture and/or pearl detailing What Reviewers Say: \"Bought these for my wedding and cannot wait to wear them. They're an ideal height, and they're super easy to walk in. I would say they run about 1/2 size small (like most designer shoes do). These look way more gorgeous in person. Photos do not do them justice!!\"09Kearsten Taylor PhotographyBest Editor-Loved Wedding ShoesMarion Parke Lottie 85 Sandal ($575) If there's one thing to know about footwear designer Marion Parke —aside from the fact that every pair is effortlessly chic and timeless — it's that she was formerly a podiatric surgeon. And it shows. These shoes are built for comfort, with cushioning that molds to the unique shape of your foot over time. One of our editors even wore them on her wedding day and swears by their stability, even after hours on her feet. Pros: Designed by a podiatric surgeon-turned fashion designer; Cushioning molds to your unique foot shape; Versatile Cons: Most expensive pair of wedding shoes on our list Material: Nappa leather Colorways: 3 Who it's best for: Brides or guests looking for an investment pair of elegant heels they can wear well beyond the wedding day Editor Quote: \"Sadly, the beige version of these shoes — the pair I wore on my wedding day — is no longer available. That said, they're still offered in soft gold, silver, and black if you've got some wiggle room with your color scheme. I originally slipped into a pair of lacy white pumps but quickly realized they weren't built for a full day on my feet. Swapping them for this pair was the right move. They're incredibly comfortable and impressively stable, even on grass and gravel, and well into hour nine of the best day of my life.\" — MP-Marisa Petrarca (she/her) is a contributing editor for PS Shopping and has over seven years of experience writing and editing beauty, fashion, and lifestyle content.

But then I couldn\u0026#39;t help but smile when I was the only bridesmaid who kept my shoes on for the entire reception. They were comfortable enough and stable. Even though the unhemmed dress I wore gave me some trouble walking down the aisle (totally my fault), my shoes kept me upright.\u0026#34; — Marisa Petrarca, contributing editor, Shopping\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DREAM-PAIRS-Womens-Nubuck-Sandals/dp/B07CDQPSH6/?tag=popsugarshopx-20\u0026amp;asc_source=mp-metropcs\u0026amp;asc_campaign=feed\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/comfortable-wedding-shoes-brides-40812745\u0026amp;ascsubtag=___psv__p_40812745__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\" aria-label=\"\" data-vars-action=\"product image\" data-vars-retailer=\"amazon\" data-vars-price=\"$33\" data-vars-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DREAM-PAIRS-Womens-Nubuck-Sandals/dp/B07CDQPSH6/\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/7A0qGeJOAQgqbJcHfAiPuuETdFg=/fit-in/516x516/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/17/935/n/44344577/9092bd576851dd89a12d05.51493612_61UCnpSHxPL..jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-size=\"desktop\" width=\"258\" height=\"258\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/7A0qGeJOAQgqbJcHfAiPuuETdFg=/fit-in/516x516/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/17/935/n/44344577/9092bd576851dd89a12d05.51493612_61UCnpSHxPL..jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" data-size=\"tablet\" width=\"258\" height=\"258\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/YUu_DzTTmN-mPuGgEdZ8Gc_uzic=/fit-in/700x700/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/17/935/n/44344577/9092bd576851dd89a12d05.51493612_61UCnpSHxPL..jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" data-size=\"mobile\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/aTvsCsQDvJFa_rDlAXCP_ABiGR4=/fit-in/350x350/filters:format_auto():quality(70):extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/17/935/n/44344577/9092bd576851dd89a12d05.51493612_61UCnpSHxPL..jpg\" alt=\"Main Image\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"photo-49447611\" data-element-type=\"ParagraphSlide\" data-element-index=\"5\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e02\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"0\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/HCeWZWtw4P4q124jrucdSH2xSrg=/fit-in/792x792/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/06/16/720/n/1922564/7c01f04e3335ee5c_Naturalizer_Vera.jpg\" alt=\"Best Wedding Shoes With a Block Heel\" width=\"792\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/HCeWZWtw4P4q124jrucdSH2xSrg=/fit-in/792x792/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/06/16/720/n/1922564/7c01f04e3335ee5c_Naturalizer_Vera.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/un1kyxldFUQsFTQGgmSbiOskz9Y=/fit-in/1584x1584/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/06/16/720/n/1922564/7c01f04e3335ee5c_Naturalizer_Vera.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePOPSUGAR Photography\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBest Wedding Shoes With a Block Heel\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Naturalizer-Womens-Heeled-Sandal-White/dp/B09RB4DXWG?tag=popsugarshopx-20\u0026amp;asc_source=mp-metropcs\u0026amp;asc_campaign=feed\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/comfortable-wedding-shoes-brides-40812745\u0026amp;ascsubtag=___psv__p_40812745__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNaturalizer Vera Dress Sandal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e ($102, originally $130)\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re looking for reliable block heels that actually feel good on your feet, this Naturalizer pair has you covered.

That said, they\u0026#39;re still offered in soft gold, silver, and black if you\u0026#39;ve got some wiggle room with your color scheme. I originally slipped into a pair of lacy white pumps but quickly realized they weren\u0026#39;t built for a full day on my feet. Swapping them for this pair was the right move.
