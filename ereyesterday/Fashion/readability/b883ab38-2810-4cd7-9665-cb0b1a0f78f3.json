  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca My earliest memories of Loft date back to when it was still called Ann Taylor Loft, when I'd tag along with my mom to help her pick out work outfits. It's been a minute since I've stepped foot in a store, but recently, my TikTok algorithm (which knows me frighteningly well) served up a few trending fashion picks from the brand's website. And honestly? Loft is delivering. The pieces feel exactly like the aesthetic I'm reaching for these days: elevated but effortless, polished yet comfortable. Cue me immediately adding the exact items they fed me to my cart: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt ($35, originally $70) and the Ribbed Square Neck Sweater Tank Top ($27, originally $55). About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt The Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is available in both regular and petite sizes. You can find it in stores and online. It's made of 100 percent lyocell and is machine washable. It measures 17.5 inches in length and features a straight, relaxed shift fit. What I Like About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt What I like most about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is how it blends two trends I keep seeing on Pinterest: bandana prints and sarong-style silhouettes. The fit feels polished yet playful, and with the right accessories, I can wear it just as easily for daytime plans as I can for a night out. It's also incredibly easy to style. Admittedly, I'm not the most adventurous dresser, so this skirt speaks to my minimalist heart - it looks chic with anything black and white (though by all means, go bold if that's your thing). I paired it with a classic Loft tank I'll be wearing on repeat year-round, the Staud handbag I wear constantly, and a pair of strappy black heels. Lastly (and at the risk of sounding a little obsessed), I love that this skirt isn't an online exclusive. So many pieces sell out fast online and are nearly impossible to track down. Thankfully, it's also available in stores, and I noticed that several Minnesota locations near me still had it in stock. (Can't promise the same for you, but I'm hopeful!) Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca What to Consider About the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Something to keep in mind about the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is that it's made of 100 percent lyocell, which the brand lists as machine washable in the product details. While that's true, I did a little digging and found that the best way to keep it looking its best long-term is to wash it on a delicate cycle in cold water with a mild detergent, then air dry. I'm admittedly reaching for cons here, but if you're planning to keep this piece in regular rotation, it's worth noting. Where Is the Loft Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Available? No shocker here: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is a Loft exclusive, available both in stores and online.
