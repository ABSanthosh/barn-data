Wearing shoes with no socks is the kind of sartorial move that splits opinion. Especially amongst the older generation. I once flashed my ankles at a spring wedding and had to listen to my aunts and uncles insist I had “forgotten something”. But I hadn’t; never heard of a no-show shock, grandpa? Anyhow, I’m here to tell you that it’s totally acceptable to go completely sockless. In fact, it’s a super smart warm-weather move. Everyone’s doing it. Just not everyone’s doing it correctly. Finding the best shoes to wear without socks isn’t easy. Make one wrong move and you’ll be faced with super smelly feet and some painful blisters to match. However, choose the right pair and your styling opportunities improve tenfold. To help with your transition to a sock-free summer, I’ve pulled together the designs you should consider, and why they can be worn that way. Keep reading for my round-up of the finest sockless shoes every guy should own. Key Takeaways Whether you’re hitting the beach or alfresco dining, leaving your socks at home is liberating. But things can get sweaty fast. And pretty uncomfortable too. So, instead of tearing your feet apart in stiff slip-ons and heel-cutting loafers, finding the best shoes to wear without socks is key. From Cole Haan’s Oxfords to Myrqvist’s sandals, these are the options to consider adding to your sunny-day rotation. You’ll also find multiple types of sneakers and the kind of boat shoes that deserve their own yacht. In This ArticleOur PicksWhat to look forFinal VerdictFAQs colehaan / Instagram Best Overall: Cole Haan ØriginalGrand Wingtip Oxford Shoes Going sockless is the ultimate power play. Freeing, slightly rebellious, and a middle finger to your elders, it’s the perfect way to bring your outfit to the 21st century. It also allows your feet to breathe while hiding your overly hairy toes. Cole Haan’s ØriginalGrand Oxfords are a lightweight, more breathable version of the classic style. Crafted in a flexible and airy knit material, they’re comfy, stylish, and suitable for wearing without socks (obvs). Dress them up with slacks and a shirt, or keep it casual with jeans and a short-sleeved polo. Material: Not specified | Sizes: 6-15 | Colors Available: 3 Best Smart-Casual: Suavs The 247 Why it’s great: Ever dreamed of kicking your socks to the curb without unleashing a foot odor apocalypse? Enter the Suavs 247 Sneaker, your barefoot’s new best friend. The real magic lies in their breathable knit upper, woven from recycled water bottles (because why should plastic have all the fun floating in the ocean?). This eco-friendly fabric works overtime to keep your feet feeling fresh, even when you’re running your 10th errand of the day. And for those impromptu beach trips or poolside lounging? These babies slip on and off faster than you can say, ‘pass the SPF 50.’ How it feels: Imagine dipping your feet into a bowl of marshmallows (maybe don’t try it, but imagine it)- that’s the Suavs 247 experience. The flexible knit hugs your feet like a gentle koala, providing just enough structure without making you feel like you’re wearing foot prisons. Going sockless is where these truly shine. The moisture-wicking interior feels soft, while the cushioned insole provides a comfort level that’ll make you wonder if you’ve accidentally stepped into a foot massage parlor. It’s like your feet are being constantly high-fived by comfort angels. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Let’s keep it real – if your feet sweat more than a snowman in a sauna, you might need to air these out between wears. While the breathable design works wonders, it’s not a miracle worker for the sweatiest among us. Also, if you’re used to the firm support of traditional shoes, the flexibility here might feel a bit like walking on a waterbed at first. And for those with wider feet, you might find the toe box a tad snug – think more “cozy hug” than “toe prison,” but worth noting. But here’s the deal – these minor quibbles are like complaining about free guac at Chipotle. For a shoe that lets you live your best sockless life without alerting the entire neighborhood to your bare feet situation, the Suavs 247 is a game-changer. Material: Upper made from 100% Recycled Water Bottles, Cushioned Lining, Lined Foam Insole, Non-Slip Rubber Sole, Vegan Friendly | Sizes Available: 8-13 | Colors Available: 6 Best Everyday: Tropicfeel Jungle Sneakers Warm weather brings with it a plethora of summer shoe styles to choose from. However, not all of those are suitable to wear without socks. Which is fine if you’re just popping out for coffee, but far from ideal if you’re dressing for the day ahead. The solution is a pair of soft and breathable sneakers like these from Tropicfeel. An all-terrain design made with the outdoors in mind, they feature speciality mesh and are treated with Lava XL and Anti-bacteria to stop unwanted odors. Slip yours on with jeans and a tee, or wear some shorts if it’s extra hot. Material: 77% Recycled Polyester, 23% Polyester | Sizes: 6-12.5 | Colors Available: 6 Best Summer Choice: Scarosso Manuel Espadrille With the passing of cloudy skies and puddled sidewalks, it’s time to put away your boots and turn to the options suitable for vacations, festivals, and backyard barbecues. But remember: if you’re going to take off your socks, you’ll need to tread carefully. Scarosso’s beachside slippers are a sandal-espadrille hybrid—giving you no choice but to go barefoot. They offer plenty of ventilation and the kind of laid back style that’ll feel most at home in the French Riviera. Keep in line with the European elegance by pairing them with linen pants and a short-sleeved shirt. Material: 100% Suede | Sizes: 39-47 | Colors Available: 3 Best Sandal: Myrqvist Solvik Sandals When it comes to the best shoes you can wear without socks, sandals sit pretty high on the list of must-have styles. And it’s not just their breathability that makes them an essential—they’re also one of the coolest footwear choices on the market right now (in more ways than one). My favorite pair comes from Myrqvist. The Slovik is a hand-crafted style made from leather with moldable cork soles. You can wear them to the beach with swim shorts, but they’ll look just as good at the poolside bar with linen pants and a camp collar shirt. Avoid taking them into the water, but don’t worry if they get a little wet. Material: Leather, Cork, Suede | Sizes: 6.5-12.5 | Colors Available: 4 Best Luxury: Mulo Suede Loafers Surviving the summer scorch is a challenge. From sun cream to baseball caps and picnic blankets, there’s heaps to remember before we leave the front door. So much so, we often forget about our footwear—leaving us with stinky, sweaty feet that feel like they’re going to combust at any given moment. But not this year. This time around you’ll be equipped with these breathable loafers from Molo. Exposing enough skin to allow your feet to feel the gentle breeze, they’re perfect for tropical vacations and hot days in the city. They fall firmly into the smart-casual category, so you can wear them with everything from khakis and Oxford shirts to shorts and crisp cotton tees. Material: 50% Leather, 50% Various Materials | Sizes: 6-12 | Colors Available: 1 Best Boat Shoe: Velasca Giulietta Boat Shoes You don’t have to own a yacht to get on board with boat shoes. The classic footwear choice is an excellent option that works well with everything from jeans to khakis and Bermuda shorts. And guess what? They look just as good on land as they do at sea. The Giulietta is Velasca’s take is one that’s inspired by traditional sailing designs. They’re made from soft suede with canvas cutouts that give them a slight vintage feel. As comfortable as they are stylish, you can pair them with casual tailoring or keep it relaxed with seersucker shorts and a breton stripe tee. Material: Suede calf leather | Sizes: 5-13 | Colors Available: 4 Best on Amazon: Hey Dude Wally Loafers If you prefer to do your shopping on Amazon, you’ll be pleased to hear that Mr Bezos offers some of the best shoes to wear without socks. From sneakers to sandals, you’ll find plenty of seriously stylish footwear choices for your consideration. My favorite is this pair from Hey Dude (read our full review here).

Thanks to the removable memory foam cushioned insole, you’ll notice a reduction in sweating and nose-offending smells. If you do want to wear socks though, there’s a bunch of options for the best socks for Hey Dudes. Material: Textile | Sizes: 7-15 | Colors Available: 10+ Best Budget: Toms Alpargatas Canvas Shoes Summer is an expensive season. If you’re not paying for flights, you’re splashing the cash on cocktails and new shades to wear to the beach. So wouldn’t it be nice if you could save a little on your footwear? These slip-on Toms are a wallet-friendly option that look awesome with rolled up khakis and cargo shorts alike. Better yet, they’re made using eco-friendly materials that help lessen your impact on the planet. Oh, and did I mention they’re seriously comfortable? Material: 50% Recycled Cotton, 25% Recycled PU Foam, 15% Recycled Rubber, 10% Bio Oil | Sizes: 7-14 | Colors Available: 6 Best Slip on: Allbirds Tree Loungers If we’re leaving the socks at home, we may as well do away with the laces too, right? Whether you’re exploring the city or partying in the backyard, some no-fuss footwear is the perfect way to complete your ensemble. These slip-on sneakers from Allbirds are made with lightweight eucalyptus tree fiber that allows for ultimate breathability and maximum comfort. Stylish yet squishy and soft, they’re beautifully cushioned with proprietary foam that has an S-curve tread that’ll mimic the natural movement of your feet. Wear them on weekends with rolled-up khakis and your choice of tee. Material: Eucalyptus fiber | Sizes: 8-14 | Colors Available: 6 Best for the office: Greats The Royale Knit 2.0 Sneakers The office dress code has seen some major changes over the years. Meaning it’s now entirely acceptable to leave your socks at home—as long as you’re not wearing a suit. Warning: you’ll probably need to double check with your boss too.

Material: Recycled knit, recycled bamboo | Sizes: 7-16 | Colors Available: 1 allbirds / Instagram What To Look For In The Best Shoes To Wear Without Socks Material Unless you want your feet to kick up a stink, choosing the right material is vital when it comes to finding the best shoes to wear without socks. Look out for breathable fabrics such as leather, suede, and canvas. Avoid synthetic styles that don’t let your feet breathe. Style From canvas shoes to white sneakers, there are many different styles of shoes that you can wear with no socks. The ones most worthy of your consideration will be those that can complement the rest of your wardrobe (or at least the outfits you plan to wear them with). Bear in mind that some footwear is more versatile than others. Cushioning To ensure maximum comfort when you’re not wearing socks, it’s important to consider cushioning. This can include memory foam insoles and padding at the heels. This isn’t a deal breaker but it can certainly help protect you from irritation and pain. cariuma / Instagram Final Verdict Your feet take a beating every day—regardless of the season. But when it comes to the summer, and you want to lose your socks, sweat and sore heels can become a real problem. To stop this, you’ll need to be wearing sockless shoes like Cole Haan’s ØriginalGrand Oxfords. Ticking all the right boxes, they’re made from an airy knit material that’s lightweight, breathable, and ridiculously comfy. You can dress them up or down and they’ll help you tackle pretty much any dress code. FAQ Wearing shoes without socks is possible, but you have to make sure you’re buying the right pair. The best sockless shoes allow your feet to breathe and don’t cause pain as you walk. Look for breathable materials and cushioning (especially in areas such as the heels). This depends on the type of loafers (they should be breathable and comfortable) and whether you are wearing them with pants or shorts. Loafers with shorts should be worn without socks, whereas loafers with pants can be worn with or without. Alternatively, you can opt for no-show socks that make it look like you’re sockless (even though you’re not). Wearing shoes without socks is particularly popular during the summer months when men’s outfits include shorts and rolled-up pants. Wearing socks is not always the most stylish option, so going sockless may be the best move. Sockless shoes are best worn with smart-casual outfits. For example, with jeans, khakis, or shorts. When dressing formally (especially with a suit), it’s best practice to wear socks. Billy is a content specialist and social media manager.
