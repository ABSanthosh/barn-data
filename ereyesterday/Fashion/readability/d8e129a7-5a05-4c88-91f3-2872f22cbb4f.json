If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Spooky season has finally arrived, so it’s time to decide which Halloween costume you’ll be wearing on October 31 and Halloweekend. While you can go as a tried-and-true witch or cat, with the simple addition of a hat or ears, this past year has brought us many notable pop culture moments that are too good to pass up on. The 2024 Paris Olympics captured the world’s attention with viral athlete memes, Tyla’s Met Gala sand dress amazed us, Brat green took over our Instagram feeds, and a baby hippopotamus warmed our hearts.This year’s TV, film, and music releases provided plenty of costume inspo, too. From blockbuster movies like Challengers and Saltburn to the much-anticipated Wicked film adaptation to chart-topping music releases from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Beyoncé to Chappell Roan’s festival performances, there’s been no shortage of entertainment (or style).With that in mind, read on to get inspiration for your DIY Halloween costume this year, which will no doubt get you best-dressed status at your upcoming parties. Aside from the occasional kitschy prop, we’ve curated pieces that may already live in your closet, or ones you’ll be able to wear outside of spooky holiday festivities. Whether you want to dress up with your friends and relive Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour or keep it more simple (yet still recognizable) as a chef from The Bear, there are many pop culture Halloween costume ideas to be excited about ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 Love Island USA Costume: The PPG Trio You and your besties can be the new bombshells that have entered the villa this Halloween! Season 6 of Love Island USA was one of the most talked-about reality series of 2024, and fast-friends JaNa Craig, Serena Page, and Leah Kateb were a highlight. PPG (AKA Power Puff Gang) brought us heartwarming and hysterical moments, often while wearing complementary outfits. (The trio even wore matching pink, green, and blue bikinis at one point.) Decide which friend is which reality star (and Powerpuff), then pick out trendy pink, green, and blue outfits to wear together. Oh, and don’t forget to hook on a wireless microphone and to strap on a mic belt, like you’re really being filmed for television. DashDividers_1_500x100 Wicked Witch Costume: Glinda \u0026 Elphaba Duo There’s no question that Wicked will be one of the biggest moves of 2024, and a major fashion presence this fall, with Wicked collaborations already dropping. This Halloween, dress up as Ariana Grande’s Glinda or Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba solo or as a duo costume.To channel Elphaba, put together a dramatic black outfit using a satin corset, tulle skirt, and sheer cape. And don’t forget to swipe some green onto your face and arms for the full effect. For Glinda, be pretty in pink in a ruffled or puff-sleeve dress. Accessorize with a tiara, wand, and statement heels that are just as whimsical.Now, the only question is… are you a good witch or a bad witch? DashDividers_1_500x100 Beyoncé Costume: Cowboy Carter Cowgirl View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) Beyhive assemble, because Beyoncé has brought us yet another era of music (Country) and fashion identity (Western) that we’re eager to replicate. Rather than dressing up as your average cowgirl this Halloween, be Cowboy Carter herself. Take inspiration from Beyoncé’s album cover art, music videos, or new Levi’s campaign and create an ensemble full of denim and leather, accessorizing with statement cowboy boots and a customized sash. DashDividers_1_500x100 Met Gala Costume: Tyla’s Sand Dress 2024’s Met Gala exhibition was “Sleeping Beauty: Reawakening Fashion,” while its party’s dress code was “The Garden of Time.” While many celebrity guests’ looks failed to impress, a few nearly broke the internet — one of them being Tyla’s dress. The “Water” singer made her Met Gala red carpet debut wearing a literal sand dress by Balmain that was molded to her body. The gown was so fragile that Tyla had to be carried up the stairs, and it was so fitted that it eventually had to be cut into a mini dress. Recreate the viral look yourself with a textured nude dress, hourglass jewelry inspired by the “purse,” and a whole lot of body glitter. DashDividers_1_500x100 Saltburn Costume: A Midsummer Night’s Dream Party Boy Although it was released in theaters in November 2023, Saltburn blew up when it started streaming on Amazon Prime Video a month later. The conversation around the divisive thriller carried over well into 2024 — and, whether you loved or hated the culture-rattling film starring Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan, you can agree that it gave us some pretty strong indie sleaze costume inspiration. You can dress up as either Felix or Oliver at their A Midsummer Night’s Dream-themed party in a simple (off-theme) white tank top with gold angel wings or a white blazer (preferably with floral embroidery) and antlers.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Olympian Costume: Team USA Stars The 2024 Summer Olympics brought out some of the most wholesome and inspiring moments of the year. Team USA brought home 126 medals across all the sports, but there were certain moments and athletes that made an even bigger impact than any medal could. From gymnastics superstars like Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and Stephen Nedoroscik (AKA pommel horse guy AKA Clark Kent) to the “fastest woman in the world” Sha’Carri Richardson and TikTok-viral rugby player Ilona Maher, we’re excited to channel America’s real-life superheroes this Halloween.Look out for a red-white-and-blue activewear, bedazzled leotards, rugby jerseys, or official Team USA Ralph Lauren merch. Bonus idea: Make it a group costume by dressing like the gymnastics “Golden Girls” crew. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sabrina Carpenter “Taste” Duo Costume View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter) Carpenter knows a thing or two about dropping drool-worthy music videos and looks (from the red carpet to the stage). Her recent video, for Taste, features the performer alongside Beetlejuice star Jenna Ortega rivaling over a boy while looking drop-dead gorgeous. Dress up as Sabrina in a ‘50s-inspired gingham capri set covered in washable fake blood. And have your bestie join in on the fun, wearing a sleek tweed dress while holding an inflatable chainsaw balloon. DashDividers_1_500x100 Challengers Costume: Tashi Duncan Oh, the whirlwind experience that was watching the Challengers film… and admiring the on-theme press tour looks that came before it. When she wasn’t wearing a 2000s velour tracksuit jacket in the film, Zendaya’s tennis star Tashi Duncan sported classic activewear like tennis dresses, court sneakers, and the Loewe graphic T-shirt. If you want to turn this into a group costume, recreate the film’s love triangle with characters Art and Patrick in their striped button-downs and backwards hats. Or wear a T-shirt inspired by the heated New Rochelle tennis match. DashDividers_1_500x100 Moo Deng Costume A viral baby hippo wasn’t on our 2024 Bingo card, but we’re glad it happened. Moo Deng, which translates to “bouncing pig,” is a pygmy hippo in a Thailand zoo who went viral after videos of her sassiness and wet-glazed donut-meets-glass skin appearance quickly spread in September.If you want to channel the adorable Rhode-worthy ambassador, embrace blushed cheeks, glossy lips, and slicked-back hair. Then wear any gray or metallic silver dress you desire (and can wear again afterward). Accessorize with light pink jewelry, bags, or shoes, and throw on hippopotamus ears for good measure. DashDividers_1_500x100 Emily In Paris Costume: Season 4 Masquerade View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emily In Paris (@emilyinparis) Emily In Paris is one of Netflix’s most beloved shows, and the two-part fourth season wasn’t short of twists and turns or Emily’s wacky and wonderful outfits that we love (…to sometimes hate). But one of her best looks was the striped catsuit ensemble she wore to the masquerade ball for one of her luxury clients. Channel Emily’s mysterious (but certainly not demure) look in a black-and-white jumpsuit, tie-on skirt, lacey mask, dramatic wide-brim hat, and your favorite dark red lipstick. DashDividers_1_500x100 Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour Group Costume One of the biggest cultural phenomenons of 2024 was (and still is) Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, where the star performs songs from her many original and re-recorded albums. These fashion-forward mega concerts have inspired fans to dress up like the singer’s different “eras,” from Lover and Red to Reputation and Folklore (or 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department).Relive your concert by re-wearing your concert outfit and commemorating the magic that was the Eras Tour. Or if you didn’t get a ticket, take Halloween as your chance to finally dress up with your besties in styles that symbolize your favorite Taylor Swift album, or replicate the costumes the singer wore on stage herself. DashDividers_1_500x100 Brat Green Costume: A Charli XCX-Approved Outfit View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charli (@charli_xcx) We just lived through a pretty iconic Brat Summer, defined by dance pop, carefree partying, and Brat green, of course. The viral color has become synonymous with Charli XCX and her album Brat, which will be getting a star-studded remix on October 11. Channel the vibes of Summer 2024 through quirky accessories like jewelry, handbags, and tights for a head-to-toe neon-chartreuse fall look. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Bear Costume: Season 3 Chefs Everyone’s favorite stress-inducing “comedy” series made another splash this year with a third season. We’re talking about the award-winning dramedy The Bear. Channel any of the loveably flawed characters by wearing a dark blue apron and a white top (fashion props if it’s from Thom Browne). Draw on faux tattoos with an eyeliner pencil like Carmi, or throw on a colorful headscarf like Sydney. Complete your look with chef-approved on-trend clogs, some beat-up dish towels, and go on your way shouting “Yes, chef!” to everyone you cross paths with. DashDividers_1_500x100 Poor Things Costume: Bella Baxter Oh, Bella Baxter, how you made everyone who watched the Frankenstein-esque Poor Things film fall in love with you… no matter if they also loved or hated the overall polarizing movie. Emma Stone’s character is filled with childlike wonder, and her 19th century-inspired outfits reflect that. To channel Bella this Halloween, recreate any of her fantastical looks by throwing on puff-sleeve tops, ruffle dresses, or organza maxi skirts; slipping into lace-up booties; and carrying around a book or an apple (IYKYK). DashDividers_1_500x100 Chappell Roan Costume: “Pink Pony Club” View this post on Instagram A post shared by ･ﾟ: *✧ Chappell Roan ✧*:･ﾟ (@chappellroan) Although The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess album debuted in 2023, it wasn’t until 2024 that Roan exploded on the mainstream music scene. Now, the pop diva’s campy songs, high-energy performances, maximalist stage costumes, and drag queen-inspired makeup are ubiquitous.While the singer’s costumes and color palettes constantly shift and evolve from performance to performance, many of her signature looks include cowboy hats, bedazzled bodysuits, fringe, and lots of pink. Join the “Pink Pony Club” this Halloween by wearing pink-everything and donning a red curly wig. Or if you want to switch it up, replicate other iconic Chappell looks, like the Statue of Liberty at Governor’s Ball. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bridgerton Costume: The Season 3 Featherington Reign Season 3 of Bridgerton put Penelope Featherington (AKA Lady Whistledown) into the spotlight as she unwillingly searched for a husband. At first a wallflower dressed in cutsey florals, Penelope’s confidence and style evolved into more mature, deep gem tones. This Halloween, dress up like Lady Whistledown (or her comical sisters) in a bright citrus-hued dress and lots of feathers (from a hairpiece to a quill pen for writing the town’s gossip column).However, if you connect more with the Bridgerton sisters, instead wear pink, purple, and blue pastels and delicate lace. Better yet, make it a group costume, and dress up as this season’s frenemy duo Penelope and Eloise. Like what you see?

To channel Bella this Halloween, recreate any of her fantastical looks by throwing on puff-sleeve tops, ruffle dresses, or organza maxi skirts; slipping into lace-up booties; and carrying around a book or an apple (IYKYK).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eChappell Roan Costume: \u0026#34;Pink Pony Club\u0026#34;\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough \u003cem\u003eThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u003c/em\u003e album debuted in 2023, it wasn’t until 2024 that Roan exploded on the mainstream music scene.

This Halloween, dress up like Lady Whistledown (or her comical sisters) in a bright citrus-hued dress and lots of feathers (from a hairpiece to a quill pen for writing the town’s gossip column).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you connect more with the Bridgerton sisters, instead wear pink, purple, and blue pastels and delicate lace.
