Everyone knows the struggle of trying to find the right pair of shoes. Some people prioritize style above all else. Others may focus on getting maximum functionality, while many even consider factors like sustainability. If only there was a brand out there that checked all these boxes at once—oh wait, there is. Allow me to introduce you to REEF. In This ArticleAbout The BrandOur PicksFinal Thoughts REEF About The Brand The year is 1984. Fernando and Santiago Aguerre—a pair of surf-loving brothers —spend their days riding waves and soaking up the sun in Argentina. They set out to build a brand that captured their love of the beach, surfing, and the rich culture that surrounds it,and thus, REEF was born. Forty years later, REEF has expanded far beyond its original ambition of being a sandal brand. Of course, it has stayed true to its roots, offering several unique options for beachgoers—including flip-flops with a bottle opener built into the sole. Now, REEF offers an expansive men’s assortment, complete with casual surf sneakers, durable boots, apparel, and more. Let’s take a deep dive into our top men’s footwear picks from REEF: Swellsole Neptune The Swellsole Neptune is easily one of REEF’s most popular sneakers. It features a classic, yet sporty profile that’s perfect for days at the office or excursions on the weekends. You can throw them on for a quick run to the store and just as easily rock them out to a casual dinner. The knit upper material is breathable, and the EVA sole provides the cushion and support you need for long days on the move. Our favorite feature is the crushback heel, which makes slipping these on and off a breeze. The Neptune sneaker is available in over a dozen eye-catching colors, so you’re sure to find one that fits your look. Swellsole Triton The Swellsole Triton combines the aesthetic of the iconic German Army Trainer with modern materials to create the ultimate day-to-night look. The suede accents around the toe box, sides, and heel add a retro twist, while the knit panels add comfort and breathability. Inside the shoe, you’ll find a comfortable sock liner and REEF’s signature Swellsole cushioning, which offers next-level comfort—regardless of how much time you spend on your feet. Swellsole Triton is available in three refined colorways. Swellsole Terramar If a classic leather sneaker is more up your alley, the Swellsole Terramar might be the one for you. The upper is made with premium full-grain leather, sustainably sourced from silver and gold-rated tanneries. Down below, the minimalist EVA outsole offers excellent support without skipping the streamlined silhouette you look for in a solid leather sneaker. These also include a crush-back heel, which is a game changer for traveling. If you’re headed on a business trip and need to pack light, these would be a great option. This style is available in three leather colorways, and a knit version is also available in black and off-white. The Maroon Leather is a great option for adding a subtle pop of seasonal color to an otherwise basic outfit. Swellsole Valle The sportiest member of the Swellsole family, the Valle, takes its design cues from classic jogger-style sneakers. Swellsole Valle features bouncy Swellsole cushioning and the REEF knit upper we’ve come to know and love. Overall, we found them to be very durable, yet still comfortable and flexible. These are more lightweight than other athletic sneakers, which makes them perfect for walking the dog, running errands, or other light exercise The design is sleek and modern with pops of texture and accented color, and REEF currently has seven colorways in stock, ranging from subdued to stand-out. Swellsole Navigator The final addition to the Swellsole collection is the Navigator: a next-level travel sneaker designed to combine style with unparalleled comfort. The distinct rip-stop upper panels are durable, breathable, and dry quickly if they ever get wet, making these a great choice for unpredictable weather situations The memory foam insole comes in clutch for long days of sightseeing, and the EVA outsole keeps the shoe super lightweight. This shoe, of course, features REEF’s signature crush-back heel, which is especially helpful at airport security. The Navigator is currently available in six distinct colorways. We’re partial to the White/Forest version since they look great with both denim or khaki pants. El Jefe The El Jefe is hands-down our favorite sneaker style from REEF. It combines both a surf sneaker and a skate sneaker—serving the ultimate casual aesthetic. The upper features a unique combination of high-quality suede and colorful textiles. The El Jefe also features a nitrogen-infused EVA midsole, which translates to a ton of comfort. A durable, non-marking rubber outsole offers plenty of grip on all kinds of coastal terrain without adding unnecessary bulk or weight. This sneaker is available in five distinct colorways–ranging from classic black or white, to bright colors–so we recommend grabbing more than one pair to keep your shoe wardrobe feeling fresh. Otis The Otis is REEF’s lightweight take on a Chelsea boot that packs a layered classic style with rugged durability. The upper is available in a range of high-quality, LWG-rated leathers or suede. The flexible outsole features sawtooth treading, which offers plenty of traction for wet fall and winter weather. The dual pull-tabs up top make this boot effortless to get on and off, and the cushy insole molds to your foot, guaranteeing you’ll be comfortable all day long. Between the full-grain and suede options, this boot is available in five classic colorways. If you want a reliable fall and winter piece that can withstand the elements, the Otis is a great option for you. Scallywag The Scallywag is quite possibly the most important boot to add to your rotation this winter. The upper is made from a featherlight, molded TPU that’s water-friendly and super easy to clean. Inside, you’ll find a soft, neoprene lining and a soft EVA footbed with extra arch support. The grippy rubber outsole offers excellent traction while still being extremely lightweight. While these won’t replace a traditional pair of winter snow boots, they’re a great choice for soggy days, muddy yard work, or an inclement commute. They do a great job of keeping your feet warm and dry without adding unnecessary weight or bulk. Plus, with eleven colorways, you’ll find one to rock this season. REEF Final Thoughts We’ve thought of REEF as a sandal brand for years, so we’re glad to see the quality and comfort they pack into their signature flip-flops translated well into sneakers and boots.
