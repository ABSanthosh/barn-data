If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Tote bags are a true MVP of your handbag lineup. While some say basic, we say essential — as useful for your office commute as they are for a weekend getaway, out-and-about strolls, a farmer’s market visit, or a day of antiquing. Plus, there are tons of on-trend styles from our favorite brands that make hauling your life around look effortless. Think of totes as emotional support in functional accessory form: always there when you need them, holding way more than you probably should be carrying, and just plain dependable. Leather tote bags help you get to and from work in style, zip tote bags keep your valuables (hello, laptops!) secure while traveling or on the go, and woven raffia and crochet totes make beach days a breeze. Ahead, scroll to shop the edit with picks from Free People, Lululemon, Everlane, Madewell, L.L. Bean, and so many more. Work Tote Bags R29 readers can’t resist a good Everlane, Madewell, or Coach pick. From sleek leather carryalls to fashion-forward shapes like Polène’s structured stunner, these tote bags deliver on practicality and style. Travel Tote Bags These travel companions are designed to keep your essentials secure. Don’t miss Lululemon’s multi-pocket tote and Free People’s cult-favorite quilted carryall in fresh, seasonal colors. Beach Bag Totes  Sandy days call for durable totes that can handle it all, from woven raffia and straw to crochet that lets sand shake right out and even durable canvas and neoprene. These picks are more than just cute — they’re built to withstand sun, sand, and surf while keeping you organized (sunscreen! towels! snacks! bevs! beach reads!). Canvas Tote Bags Classic and on-trend? Absolutely. With a utilitarian feel and low-key vibe, canvas tote bags are the ultimate anything-and-everything schleppers, suitable for every vibe — whether you’re looking for a minimalist option (peep H\u0026M’s picks for under $20!), a playful stripe (see: Kule’s signature carryall), or a custom style with cheeky embroidery or a timeless monogram. These are the sturdy go-to’s for work, grocery hauls, the beach, travel — wherever! Like what you see?
