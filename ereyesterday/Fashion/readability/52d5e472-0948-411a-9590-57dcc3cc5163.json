This design vacuum poses a challenge for the house, but Chanel still has a star designer – albeit one who has been dead for 54 years.Coco herself, in suit and pearls and with a black ribbon trim on her shallow boater hat, is still the image that springs to mind first at the mention of the name Chanel, and this gives the house unrivalled staying power. The collections that have been produced by the leaderless design studio for the past year stay close to her codes.

Consumers never get bored of cheeseburgers.A celebrity crowd that included the actor Dakota Fanning, gathered to admire grenadine silk tweed suits in cream, lipstick red and classic black, that came matched with ribboned hats.There were crystal bows as jewellery, silk bows as blouse buttons, and a trompe l’œil ribbon snaking across a knitted dress. Pearls were supersized, with a single pearl the size of a tennis ball as the heel of a boot, and a string of pearls scaled up to be slung cross-body, with a hollow central pearl as a tiny bag.Sock boots, with shiny black patent toes sewn on to bow-trimmed lace socks, brought Chanel’s two-tone pump up to date, leaning into fashion’s current obsession with posh socks. The handbags that drive Chanel’s profits were an integral part of the show with a style for every look – from miniature versions the size of postage stamps to oversized laptop sacks.Prestige in fashion is about Oscar dresses and dazzling catwalk shows, but profits are dictated by sales of handbags, totes, wallets and sunglasses.
