Size: 17.7 x 10.4 x 4.9 inches | Material: Water-Resistant Recycled Fabric | Colors Available: 3 thewalletshop / Instagram Buying Considerations For the Best Briefcases for Men Intended Use The best briefcases for men will vary depending on what you use them for. If you’re simply hopping on a train or in a taxi to get to the office, then you’ll likely only need a few compartments for your laptop and papers. But, if you’re using a briefcase on longer trips or have errands to run, then opt for briefcases with extra storage and weather-resistant features. Size Similar to your intended use case, size will vary on how long you’ll be away from home and how many items you need in a typical day. It’s not a good idea to have a bulky briefcase with a ton of extra pockets if you’ll never use them, but you also don’t want to lean too much into the minimalist side and not have enough storage. Material Simply put, some materials are better than others, and it depends on what you need your briefcase for. If style and professionalism are your top priority, then you’ll want materials like leather and canvas. But, if you need durability for rough commutes or you live in a place that has unpredictable weather, then waterproof polyester is your best bet. View More On Roderer How We Chose Most briefcase brands will claim that they have the best features and the highest quality, but the reality is that all briefcases will have different functions that work better for different people. With this is mind, I read through customer reviews and product descriptions to find the best briefcases for men that would be best for certain individuals based on these factors: Purpose: Is this briefcase best for daily use or long trips? Is there enough storage for everything a guy would need in a day? I looked for bags that served the right purpose, not ones that claimed to work for everyone all the time. Customer Reviews: Do people who bought and used this briefcase vouch for it? Customer reviews were one of the main indicators of a good product when making these selections. Price: There’s no need to spend more than you need to on a briefcase when there’s plenty of budget-friendly options. I balanced quality and price point when suggesting these briefcases. Why Trust Us?

His readers get first-hand experience and tailored recommendations, not generic descriptions, to help make informed decisions based on real-life customer testimonials. Final Verdict  The best briefcases for men are made of strong, durable materials, have plenty of storage for all the necessary items, and are reasonably priced. The Solo Grand Central Attaché Briefcase is my top choice because of its classic design, durable shell, and over 3,000 positive reviews on Amazon. Plus, it comes in at an extremely affordable price. FAQ Yes, people still use briefcases in day-to-day life, especially if they have to go into the office. Briefcases store essentials like laptops, notebooks, and business cards, so a durable briefcase is a must to keep everything safe and organized. It depends on the occasion and your job setting. If you have to wear a suit and tie everyday, then a leather briefcase will be appropriate, but if you have a more laid-back corporate setting, then briefcases made of nylon or polyester are more in line with expectations. Just like most things, briefcases span a wide range of price points and qualities. You can easily spend a few hundred dollars on a luxury briefcase because it’s made of the best materials, or you can get a budget suitcase for under $50 if it’s made of more widely available fabrics.
