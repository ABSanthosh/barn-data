Credit...Evan Agostini/Invision, via Associated PressFeb. 21, 2025Mark Kolski was sitting at his home in the Stuyvesant Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, drinking a cup of coffee by his sewing machine, when the messages started to pour in.On Tuesday, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had released the name for her new cooking and lifestyle brand, As Ever. But Mr. Kolski’s morning was thrown into tumult because the vintage-inspired workwear brand he started a decade ago is also named, as it happens, As Ever.“I started getting messages from friends and family and people that know my brand,” Mr. Kolski, 58, said. “And they were saying, ‘Have you seen this?’ There was just a lot of confusion, and I didn’t really know what to do.”Mr. Kolski’s life has been upended in the days since, his phone ringing incessantly, as he’s found himself thrown into a flurry of speculative tabloid coverage about Meghan’s use of his label’s name. In an interview this week, he said he had been reading up on trademark law and had consulted with a lawyer. His brand also has been discovered by new fans, his Instagram account netting thousands of followers.ImageMark Kolski started his vintage-inspired workwear brand a decade ago.Credit...Astrid DahlFor Meghan, the incident is the latest snarl in her efforts to create a lifestyle brand.
