Fashion brands have noticed.Among the more prominent wives and girlfriends of star athletes are Morgan Riddle, who is dating the tennis star Taylor Fritz; Jordyn Woods, who is dating the N.B.A. star Karl-Anthony Towns; and Kristin Juszczyk, who is married to the N.F.L. star Kyle Juszczyk.July 2, 2025Updated 1:41 p.m. ETAs Wimbledon was underway this week, with players adhering to the tournament’s strict all-white dress code, fashion watchers turned their attention to the stands, where personalities like Morgan Riddle, the fashion influencer and girlfriend of the American tennis player Taylor Fritz, brought a slightly bolder look to the Grand Slam.On Monday, the tournament’s first day, Ms. Riddle wore a blush pink mini dress by Patou, paired with matching strawberry-adorned mules (a nod to the tournament’s well-known strawberry and cream dish) and a red Chanel purse. Her blond hair was tied into a half up, half down style with face-framing tendrils.“If I dressed incredibly inappropriately for Wimbledon, it would be blasted on social media almost instantly and people would probably troll him for it,” Ms. Riddle said in an interview, referring to Mr. Fritz.Her wardrobe teems with skirts, dresses, blazers and button-down shirts from brands like Thom Browne, Miu Miu and Burberry — a far cry from her early days on tour with Mr. Fritz, whom she began a relationship with in 2020. Back then, Ms. Riddle, who did not grow up watching tennis, favored jeans, crop tops and sweatshirts. But as she became more enmeshed in the world of the elite sport, her style evolved to meet its expectations.ImageMs. Riddle, who has been watching Mr. Fritz at Wimbledon this week, tries to wear designs from local designers. Credit...Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated PressWhile Wimbledon does not enforce a dress code for spectators, attendees are encouraged to dress “smart.” For men, that typically means tailored separates in muted tones; for women, sundresses and low heels. Ms. Riddle takes it a step further. She is polished from every angle, with every sartorial detail deliberate. That’s partly because she is a WAG.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
