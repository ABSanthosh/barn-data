These objects are infused with celebration, significance, nostalgia, and, of course, love.But occasionally a specific item can take center stage, and like your relationship, it has endured the test of time and grown in sentimental value.Some couples refer to these treasured items as wedding artifacts. But before you photograph that frozen slice of wedding cake, even if it’s from 2003, we want you to look deeper.We want to hear about the one item from your wedding day that you’ll keep and pass on for generations to come. Perhaps it’s the tablecloth your mother hand-sewed and used on your wedding table. Maybe it’s the cake topper passed down from your great-uncle, or a framed collage of the crushed cans that were strapped to the back of your post-wedding vehicle.We will review each response to this questionnaire and contact you if we’re interested in learning more about your story. We will not publish any part of your response until we have followed up with you, verified your information, and heard back from you. And we will not disclose your contact information with anyone outside of The Times newsroom, nor will it be used for anything other than communicating with you.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
