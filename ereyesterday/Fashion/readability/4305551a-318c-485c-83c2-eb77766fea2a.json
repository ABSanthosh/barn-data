  "text": "Olivia Rodrigo is the master of effortlessly cute style. The Guts singer was spotted earlier today at Wimbledon in London with her recently hard-launched boyfriend Louis Partridge, with whom she first sparked dating rumors back in October 2023. Rodrigo went all-in on color coordination, wearing a vintage Ralph Lauren gingham shirtdress from the spring 2000 collection. She paired the look with a Khaite Simona shoulder bag in an electric red rebel suede and red-rimmed Karen Wazen oval sunglasses.Though her dress is vintage, she has just cemented gingham as one of this summer’s chicest print trends. Emma Watson also recently turned heads in Nice during the Cannes Film Festival in a powder-pink gingham midi dress—perfect for the sea breeze in the south of France. Whether you’re dressing for a garden party, running errands on a hot summer day, or jetting between red carpet premieres, gingham is guaranteed to add a fresh pop of color to any look.Karwai Tang//Getty ImagesRodrigo was all smiles as she and Partridge chatted during the match. The singer is fresh off an incredibly successful string of performances—first at Gov Ball earlier in June, where she surprised fans by bringing out the legendary David Byrne of Talking Heads for a surprise performance, and most recently as the final headliner at Glastonbury. Over the weekend, she closed out the festival’s Pyramid Stage with another iconic surprise: Robert Smith of The Cure. Together, they teamed up to perform the band’s classics “Just Like Heaven” and “Friday I’m in Love.”",
