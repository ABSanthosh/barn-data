Nothing says comfort and confidence in quite such an attractive way as Italian loafers. The famously well made and beautifully designed shoes coming out of Italy have stood as the height of luxury for generations. And, as you’ll see in this list, nothing has changed. Well, that’s not quite true because globalization has transformed the production of the best Italian loafers for men. That’s led to some strange questions about what actually counts as an Italian loafer. Is it a loafer whose leather (or suede) comes from Italy? Or one that was made in Italy? Nobody, truth be told, is quite sure. In this list of the best Italian loafers for men, I’m going to recommend 6 amazing pairs of shoes that all share in the heritage of Italian loafers. Some of them are 100% Italian; others feature Italian leather but were produced elsewhere. After all, the style and quality of a shoe is what matters most at the end of the day. Let’s jump right in and see if we can’t help you find your next favorite pair of men’s Italian loafers. Key Takeaways I’ve owned, worn, and tried on more pairs of Italian loafers than I can count. And, after looking back on all those different pairs and checking out a ton of new options, I’m quite happy with the list of 6 standout loafers that I’ve put together. Overall, I placed the Myrqvist Stenhammar II at the top of this list as the best Italian loafers for men. The dark brown calf leather is simply top class, and the classy design will look just as good with a suit as it will as part of a more casual outfit. I’ve also recommended a more casual pair of loafers, the Scarosso Ludovico Loafers, as well as, on the opposite extreme, the more explicitly formal Oliver Cabell Penny Loafers. The other options have several different styles and approaches, so I’m sure that you’ll be able to find a version of the loafers you’re picturing. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs View More On Velasca Best Overall: Myrqvist Stenhammar II Why they’re great: These incredibly cool, brown calfskin Italian loafers are a great way to make a statement, whatever you’re wearing. I’ve worn them with both suits and casual attire and never gotten an odd look (even when casual means jeans and a T-shirt). I really like the dark brown calf version of these shoes, but you can also check out the black calf, black suede, or brown suede options. Who are they for? I’d say that, basically, anyone with a discerning taste in men’s footwear would love to have these excellent loafers in their closet. They’re some of the best Italian loafers for men. Flaws but not deal-breakers: There’s not anything interesting in the form of tassels or metal clasps going on with these shoes, which might be something you’re looking for. Material: 100% Leather or 100% Suede | Sole Material: 50% Rubber, 50% Cork | Sizes Available: U.S. 8.5 to U.S. 13.5 | Colors Available: 4 Best Luxury: Velasca Brugnon Loafers Why they’re great: The Velasca Brugnon Loafers are both incredibly stylish and unbelievably comfortable on your feet. Everything in these shoes is leather, including the soles, which means that they fit your feet so well that you won’t have a problem standing or walking around in them all day. Who are they for? These are some of the best Italian loafers for men. They have an eye-catching shape and tassel as an accent, which makes them a great choice if you like that style. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The character is quite obvious on these deer leather loafers (meaning that they have a rougher texture than smooth leather), which isn’t really a flaw but more of a very distinctive feature. Material: 100% deer leather | Sole Material: 100% Leather | Sizes Available: U.S. 5 to U.S. 14 | Colors Available: 6 Best Everyday: Scarosso Ludovico Loafers Why they’re great: The Scarosso Ludovico Loafers are far and away the most casual option on this list of the best Italian loafers for men. They’re made from incredibly soft and comfortable suede and come in a variety of colors that are generally more appropriate for the boat than the boardroom. And, a nice extra-nice touch is the calf-skin interior. Who are they for? Anyone who’s looking for a pair of swanky Italian loafers to do some hardcore chilling in should take a look at these. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Honestly, this is a product for which the wealth of color options you have can make actually choosing one to go with difficult. Material: 100% Leather | Sole Material: Rubber | Sizes Available: 39 E.U. to 46 E.U. | Colors Available: 16 Best Formal: Oliver Cabell Penny Loafer Why they’re great: These loafers from Oliver Cabell can fit right into your formal looks without looking even the least bit out of place. The dark navy color can go well with a black suit, as well as several other color palettes. Who are they for? If you’re a fan of ease and comfort when you’re dressed up, look no further. Flaws but not deal-breakers: These are among the best Italian loafers for men. However, there’s a small white tag on the outside edge of the shoe, which I think provides a great accent, but others might feel that it’s misplaced. Material: 100% Leather | Sole Material: 100% Leather | Sizes Available: U.S. 6 to U.S. 14 | Colors Available: 3 Best Budget: Rockport Mens Classic Loafer Lite Venetian Why they’re great: The Rockport Men’s Classic Loafer Lite Venetian is a great pair of shoes that embody everything that’s great about Italian loafers while maintaining an affordable price. The brown or black leather they come in, as well as their simple design, mean that these are some very versatile shoes. Who are they for? If you’re desperate for a pair of men’s Italian loafers but are put off by the high prices, then this is an option you should consider. Flaws but not deal-breakers: You’re usually going to sacrifice a bit of the quality of construction when you go for lower-priced options. But, these shoes are more than well made enough to last for a long while with proper care. Material: 100% Leather | Sole Material: 100% Thermoplastic elastomers | Sizes Available: U.S. 7 to U.S. 13.5 wide | Colors Available: 2 Best on Amazon: Allen Edmonds Men’s Verona ii Loafers Why they’re great: These beautiful Italian-made loafers from Allen Edmond can make an instant impact on your day-to-day fashion choices.

Amazon is a great way to fill out openings in your wardrobe easily and conveniently. Flaws but not deal-breakers: They aren’t the cheapest shoes on this list, but the extra price you’re paying is for top-quality leather and craftsmanship. Material: 100% Leather | Sole Material: 100% Leather | Sizes Available: U.S. 8 to 12 U.S. | Colors Available: 4 allenedmonds / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best Italian Loafers For Men Material The main question you have—in terms of material—when shopping for Italian loafers is whether to go for leather or suede loafers. Both options are great, to be honest, but they do offer different benefits to someone wearing the shoes. Suede is incredibly soft and comfortable, and it’ll immediately start morphing to fit your feet when you first put them on. However, that does mean that they’ll start to wear out more quickly than leather loafers, especially if you wear them often and walk a lot in them. Leather loafers, on the other hand, have a lot more structure to them. They also tend to go better with formal attire, whereas suede shoes are more of a leisure thing. Color Once you’ve decided on the material that you want for your loafers, you then need to pick out what color you want them to be. Some men will prefer the more limited and conservative colors that leather loafers come in, and others love the sometimes outlandish options you have with suede loafers. Where and when you’re planning to wear the loafers you’re shopping for, as well as the types of outfits you’re planning to wear them with should be your first guide to what color to choose. If you’re planning on wearing them to work or other formal settings, then I’d recommend going with a black or dark brown leather loafer. But if you’re getting a pair of loafers for a summer vacation, then you can definitely think about a wider range of colors. Size Finally, ensuring that you’re getting the right size is essential when you’re shopping for loafers. You should always be sure to consult the brand’s sizing advice, as this can help you make the right decision. It’s also crucial to think about the unique features of your feet that aren’t represented in your size. Are your feet narrow or wide? What types of shoes have you been comfortable in before? Answering all these questions before you make a purchase can help you get a comfortable pair of shoes you love wearing. View More On Myrqvist How We Chose The best Italian loafers for men are an investment in the true sense of the word.

Make sure to enjoy your new loafers, whichever you go with. FAQ Italian loafers have a long history that informs their similarities and differences from other types of loafers. Generally speaking, Italian loafers feature high-quality materials and tend to certain design choices, such as a longer profile and pointed toes.
