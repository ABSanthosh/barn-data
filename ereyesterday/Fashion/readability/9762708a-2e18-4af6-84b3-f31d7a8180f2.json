If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Beanies? Gloves? Sure, they’re wardrobe essentials when the wind chill intensifies, and your coffee cools down faster than you can sip it. But on the winter fashion scale, they’re pretty basic. Scarves, on the other hand, are anything but. These winter accessories have range and can transform an outfit with minimal effort. From patterned and colorful designs to luxe cashmere and wool fabrications and even hooded silhouettes, they’re the MVPs of cold-weather dressing. But if there’s one type that consistently steals the spotlight (and keeps us the coziest), it’s the oversized scarf — the stylishly and borderline excessive piece that turns bundling up into an art form. This season, brands are doubling down on the trend, offering everything from ultra-plush styles made from faux fur and teddy-like shearling to fuzzy brushed alpaca and vibrant, ribbed silhouettes that rival your favorite throw. So, instead of splurging on yet another pair of forgettable gloves or a one-size-fits-all beanie, opt for an oversized scarf — it’s a budget-friendly way to embrace the scarf coat trend without committing to (or investing in) the full look. Keep scrolling to shop 24 of the season’s best options for every style and sensibility — you’ll be covered, both literally and sartorially. Oversized Scarves: Brushed A brushed scarf is all about adding a touchable, cozy texture to your look. Offered in mainstay neutrals and playful colors or prints, these scarves bring ultimate warmth with a classic sensibility. Oversized Scarves: Cashmere Soft, oversized, and luxe, cashmere scarves are a timeless winter must-have. Whether you go for a neutral, graphic whipstich detailing, or a pastel hue, these babies bring coziness and polish to any cold-weather outfit. Oversized Scarves: Fleece-y Feels Fleece scarves are the ultimate in cuddle-worthy, from timeless wraps to trendy hooded designs à la Free People’s rust-red version. They bring a plush, modern touch while delivering mega warmth. Oversized Scarves: Fringe We love a bit of drama — when it comes to fashion, at least. Long, exaggerated tassels are the perfect way to refresh this classic winter accessory, adding movement and a bold finish to any winter look. Oversized Scarves: Faux Fur Shearling, faux fur, and shaggy textures bring a whole new dimension of softness. These scarves are a tactile treat, begging to be touched. Layer them over sleek silhouettes for a refined contrast, or lean fully into the snug vibes with matching textured pieces as seen above. Oversized Scarves: Ribbed Ribbed scarves bring a chunky feel and add personality to your winter lineup. From pastel wool to bold cashmere blends, these styles add texture while feeling like your coziest blanket.  Like what you see?
