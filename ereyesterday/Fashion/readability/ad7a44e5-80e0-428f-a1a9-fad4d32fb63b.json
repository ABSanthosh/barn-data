Fans are pinning their postseason hopes on the lucky gourd.“Nothing’s more like fall than playoff baseball and pumpkins,” said Pete Alonso, who was doused in beer and champagne by his Mets teammates after hitting a pivotal home run against the Milwaukee Brewers.Credit...Aaron Gash/Getty ImagesOct. 9, 2024Last week, the Washington Post sports reporter Chelsea Janes noticed a curious development in the Mets’ locker room. First baseman Pete Alonso had carried in a miniature pumpkin and placed it on the top shelf of his locker.“I have never seen this before,” Ms. Janes wrote on X.It would not be the last that Mets fans would hear of the pumpkin — the latest in a string of gleefully nonsensical lucky charms that have been embraced by the team amid its raucous run into the playoffs.On Wednesday night, after the Mets defeated the Philadelphia Phillies to advance to the National League Championship Series, fans of the team rejoiced: The auspicious gourd had claimed another victim.This season, Mets iconography has expanded to include Grimace, the purple McDonald’s mascot who now regularly graces the big screen at Citi Field, and “OMG,” a Latin pop anthem recorded by second baseman Jose Iglesias.

Afterward, he took questions from reporters with his lucky pumpkin in one hand.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
