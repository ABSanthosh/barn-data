A lifelong lover of secondhand goods, Davis captured the luxury resale market in a way no one had previously conceived by sourcing reliable, authentic designer goods.\"I always just wanted nice things,\" Davis shared with Fashionista's Brooke Frischer on The Fashionista Network. (Watch it here!) \"I would rather buy a used quality product than a new, less quality product. That was what got me started in those early days.\"In 1999, she realized the untapped potential of luxury resale. \"I was like, 'Why's nobody doing this?

She grew a following on the resale platform before social media even came to be. By 2010, Entrepreneur Magazine raved about Fashionphile's innovative business model.The company went its first 20 years without investors. It wasn't until Neiman Marcus invested in the company in 2019 that it received any outside funding, Davis noted. Fashionphile opened storefronts in 10 department stores and focused on creating an upscale, convenient experience for both sellers and buyers.Before the Neiman Marcus investment, Fashionphile didn't have a marketing department. Instead, it found sellers in its buyers, relying on the quality of its services and word of mouth to grow the business. \"If you're buying a Chanel flap or a Louis Vuitton backpack from us, it's likely not your only luxury item,\" Davis explained during the interview. When customers receive a Fashionphile product, their invoices (now online) include an invite to resell their items and any other designer goods they may have on the platform.Davis also discussed pricing rare pieces, navigating resale once a slew of competitors (with deeper pockets) infiltrated the market and more.
