  "description": "Don’t write them off as just another step in your routine: primers can make a huge difference to whatever goes on topI never really thought that primers would form a significant part of my makeup ritual. For me, primers were simply another step I just didn’t have time for. And so I skipped it. To my peril. What I have long realised is that a decent primer is imperative to the (quality) finish of your makeup. It creates an even, blurring and hydrating base for everything that follows. This means, fundamentally, you avoid everything on your face sliding around before you’ve made it down the street. Putting on makeup without a primer is a bit like painting over layers of wallpaper. You think it looks OK. Then you compare it to a wall that has been skimmed, cleaned and primed before being painted. And you get an aha moment. There’s no comparing the two. However, I do understand why, aside from the time factor, tons of people don’t use primers. Historically, the textures and formulations have been a bit gunky and ironically just didn’t work well with foundations, leaving a piling effect. These days the choice is better and much more wide-ranging – textures (powders, sprays, balms) and also finishes, to meet all needs (blurring, mattifying, glowing). Which means you no longer need to worry about your primer making your face look like a bobbly old jumper.1. Refy Blur and Hydrate Primer £24, refybeauty.com 2.
