In the UK, sales fell by 6% as the number of website visits and orders dropped. However, full-price own-brand sales rose by 9%.Calamonte said Asos would probably benefit if, as expected, the UK scrapped or reduced a tax break for products costing less than £135 sent direct to consumers from abroad, which has driven the growth of Shein and Temu. However, he added: “We want to win by offering consumers the best possible product and that’s where we put all our energy.”The CEO said Asos, which sells goods worth about £300m a year in the US, had “the flexibility to react to whatever comes” on tariffs, as its products were made in a number of countries including Turkey, Morocco, eastern Europe and even the UK, as well as China and the Asia-Pacific region.“I feel confident we are well prepared to react to this challenge,” he said, adding that the group was “monitoring the situation very closely as it is changing quite a lot”.Asos products are not subject to import tariffs in the US because they benefit from a tax break for items worth less than $800 sent direct to consumers from abroad. That loophole will be closed for Chinese-made products from next week.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionCalamonte said only 5% of the group’s sales in the US was generated by products sourced in China. These were likely to face higher tariffs when rules changed, but that would not necessarily mean higher prices for US shoppers, he said. “We adapt to the market we will not push prices we will follow the market.”The Asos boss said there were no signs of Chinese-made products being dumped in the UK or Europe but Asos was “not fighting the battle of being the cheapest in the market and we are not going to change that now”.He added that the UK online fashion market could not get any more competitive than it already was. “Some companies are operating cheaper than us and we are still finding green shoots,” Calamonte said.",
