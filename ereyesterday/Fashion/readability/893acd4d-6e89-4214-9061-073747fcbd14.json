The king of Milanese fashion and sole shareholder of a company recently valued by Forbes at $13bn (£10bn) has confirmed he will retire soon.“At 91, age is undoubtedly a factor to contend with,” he said. “I will continue as long as my health and energy permit, but taking a step back in the near future is inevitable.” Yet he still has no heir to his throne.Armani is the designer who transformed stiff suiting and brought Italian style to Hollywood. And on Monday’s catwalk, this was no different. Broad-shouldered jackets – his calling card now and then – came with just enough construction to create shape. Wool and velvet trousers were flattering but baggy enough not to constrict. Bags were cavernous, and so were trouser pleats. As ever, the waists were low.
