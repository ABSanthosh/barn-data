  "text": "Here’s the latest.It’s Met Gala time, also known as the most discussed, debated and otherwise dissected red carpet of the year. From Diana Ross to Bad Bunny, the arrivals this year have created a buzz.The gala raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. In recent years some of the conversation has focused on the gala as a tone-deaf display of wealth and frivolity, but this year, the anticipation is real.To celebrate the new exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” a history-making look at the Black dandy, Anna Wintour has enlisted a who’s who of style-defining Black men as her co-chairs: ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, Pharrell Williams and Colman Domingo, plus LeBron James as honorary chair. In addition, there’s a host committee filled with a panoply of Black talent, all of whom are presumably going to show (think Jeremy O. Harris, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Angel Reese and Spike Lee).For them, the dress code of the night — “tailored for you” — isn’t just fashion, it’s personal — meaning that you can expect not just a lot of suiting, but that many of the looks we are going to see will be multidimensional, and a change from what has often seemed the increasingly absurd costuming of Met Galas past. It’s an evening centering Black contributions to fashion that is long overdue.Here’s what else to know:This year’s theme: The party is celebrating the history and influence of the Black dandy in the Western world, and the way fashion has been used as a tool of both enslavement and liberation. The show was inspired by the 2009 book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,” by Monica L. Miller, a professor of Africana studies at Barnard College, and it has been jointly curated by Professor Miller and Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator in charge. We are live-blogging the event, so tune in here.What’s the price?: Individual tickets to the gala start at $75,000, and tables of 10 at $350,000. All the money from ticket sales goes directly to funding the Costume Institute’s yearly budget. This year, those sponsors include Louis Vuitton (Mr. Williams is Vuitton’s men’s wear designer), Instagram, Africa Fashion International, Tyler Perry and Condé Nast.A nod to a legend: Anna Wintour said that planning the gala had been emotional because of its deep connection to André Leon Talley, the longtime Vogue editor who died in 2022. She said she pictured Talley standing at the top of the steps, wearing something resplendent. “I think he would be having the time of his life,” she said.Central Cee said he was a little bit nervous about his Jacquemus look. It might look “a little basic” compared to all of the fashionistas here, he said, but it was a big step up from his usual track suit. What’s he looking forward to inside? “Pretty women,” he said, declining to be more specific.ImageCredit...Amir Hamja for The New York TimesThe red carpet arrivals have slowed down. Teyana Taylor, who was one of the hosts of Vogue’s livestream, said she felt like she’d been doing interviews for “16 hours.” We’ve reached the point in the evening where every wave of screams feels like it could be a Rihanna alert. So far, no luck.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSculpted curls to go with structured tailoring on the Met Gala carpet.ImageCurls slicked the forehead of Dua Lipa on Monday evening.Credit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesThere were slicked-down curls, dramatic swoops and sculpted waves that contrasted with the structured, tailored clothes of the evening.Many of the hair styles appeared to be nods to Josephine Baker, the French singer whose hair was typically gelled down into face-framing kiss curls. In an interview on the Met Gala carpet, Quinta Brunson, who opted for a pinstripe dress and blazer with a swoop that took up most of her forehead, said she was heavily inspired by the Jazz Age performer and World War II resistance fighter.The singer Coco Jones, dressed in an ivory suit by the Indian designer Manish Malhotra, was among the first of the night to turn up with a singular, snaking kiss curl lacquered to her forehead. Sydney Sweeney paired a form-fitting Black Miu Miu dress with a slicked-back bun and loop-dee-loop bang. Cole Escola, among the more colorfully dressed guests of the evening, seemed to pay homage to the style as well, sporting hair gathered into a single, glossy wave. Dua Lipa finished her flapper-esque feathered and jeweled Chanel outfit with four swoops snaking from a bun down to her forehead and temples. Curls peeked out of a large feathered hat worn by Teyana Taylor, who co-hosted Vogue’s livestream in a custom Ruth E. Carter suit and cape. Men, apparently, also got the memo. Bad Bunny’s swoop poked out from under his wicker boat hat. A single strand of hair appeared to be sprung deliberately loose from the actor Henry Golding’s well-coiffed head. ImageBad BunnyCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesImageCole EscolaCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesIt’s not the first time the look has been more widely adopted in the fashion world and in red carpet dressing. The hair style appeared to inspire, for instance, the spring 2017 Givenchy show, for which the hairstylist Guido Palau gelled down the hair of models like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid to achieve a “sculptural” effect.Some of the hair styles that appeared on the Met Gala carpet Monday night toed the line between curls and Marcel waves, which have caught on in the last few years among stars like Rihanna, Halle Berry and Zendaya. That style was popularized in the 19th century by the Parisian hairdresser Francois Marcel Grateau, who achieved the look with hot curling tongs. As The New York Times reported in 2023 of the resurgent trend, the soft-yet-slick style can “take an edge off some of the more aggressively tailored looks on the runways this year.”With so many people keeping up with the Met Gala on X and Instagram, I wonder if there will be uproar online over the Vogue livestream ending before 9 p.m.Dressing for the MetJanelle Monáe is a ‘time-traveling dandy.’ImageCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesJanelle Monáe was feeling euphoric on Sunday when asked to break down her look for this year’s Met Gala, which celebrates Black dandyism.“I feel like a kid in class ready to give the presentation,” Monáe said.After all, “she truly is the modern day dandy,” said Thom Browne, who designed her look.Since Monáe started releasing music in the 2000s, tailored suiting has been core to her style. She adds her own flair with sculptural layering and accessories like whimsical hats and bow ties.Growing up, Monáe observed her mother, a janitor and part-time banquet server; her father, a sanitation worker; and her grandmother, a cook, in their uniforms, which included black slacks, white button-down shirts, bow ties, jackets and cummerbunds.When the singer, actor and author started cultivating her style early in her career, she knew she wanted to honor her working class parents, her ancestors and herself.“I’m a very free-spirited person,” said Monáe, 39. “I’ve spent a great deal of my career — I’ve tried to at least — just redefining who you can be in a suit.”ImageCredit...Amir Hamja for The New York TimesRedefinition and self-expression are central to dandyism, a style of elevated dress once imposed upon enslaved people, and remade by Black aesthetes into a tool of self-actualization, revolution and subversion.For her Met Gala look, Monáe hoped to play a character she conceived, as she does every year for the event, she said. This year, it was “the time-traveling dandy,” a visual representation of how she is informed by her past while considering herself a staunch Afro-futurist.“We asked ourselves, ‘What would elements of dandyism from the past, present and future look like?’” Monáe said.That includes literal elements of time, like a monocle that is also a moving clock, and a watch. But also, an oversized trompe l’oeil cape, embroidered with radial outlines, which will give the illusion of a rectangular portal. When she removes it on the red carpet, it will be as if she is emerging from a time machine: “It feels like you’re getting a glimpse of somebody moving through time,” she said.Monáe, who identifies as nonbinary, also conveys how dandyism transcends gender.For this look, she collaborated with Paul Tazewell, the costume designer who recently won an Oscar for his work in the film “Wicked.” Mr. Browne said the cape is a reference to Fritz Lang’s futuristic film “Metropolis.” Monáe’s derby hat evokes Gladys Bentley, a blues singer who was known for adopting more masculine styles of dress in the 1920s. And beneath the cape, Monáe will wear a deconstructed sport coat and skirt — the right half in black and white pinstripes, the left half in a red wool crepe fabric.“You almost go from the traditional male to the red exuberant female, all on the same figure,” Mr. Tazewell said.The deconstruction in the suit was also symbolic for Monáe.“I’ve tried to deconstruct systems for many years through my work, through my art and activism,” she said. “I want to deconstruct respectability politics around suiting and around how Black people can show up in the world. I wanted to show that we get to decide who we are.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt’s not yet 9 o’clock, and Vogue’s only-game-in-town livestream has ended. Anna Wintour is famously punctual and likes everything to run on time, but there is her time, and then there is Rihanna time, and they are not the same thing.Law Roach’s favorite moment of the night so far? “Riding in the car with Andre 3000 with the piano on his back.”ImageCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York Times“I’m so sorry, there’s a piano coming,” said Natasha Lyonne. The piano was being worn, backpack-style, by Andre 3000. It has pedals and everything.Jimmy Fallon has a lot to say about Rosalía’s Balmain look.

Wow!Keke Palmer said her outfit, designed by Vera Wang, was inspired by the actress Dorothy Dandridge and that she was serving a mix of masculine and feminine.ImageCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe protesters at East 82nd Street have seemingly gone home for the night, but the fans of the gala remain: those on Madison Avenue, peering longingly toward the entrance on Fifth, and those on Fifth, close to the action, screaming the names of their favorite stars. The party is underway inside, but the arrivals continue.Law Roach giving a big shoutout to eBay as a place to source fashion. He’s not the only one talking up the platform tonight either. eBay is not normally a name (or a brand) associated with the Met Gala, but the company clearly decided that was going to change tonight. Dapper Dan, the menswear legend, had to close his Harlem boutique in the 1990s after a lawsuit from Fendi. He talked to me about fashion as a means of resistance that has carried him through his career. “I am here today as a disruptor,” he said. ImageCredit...Amir Hamja for The New York TimesDressing for the MetDiljit Dosanjh brings Punjab to the red carpet.ImageCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesDiljit Dosanjh defies labels. His melding of Punjabi music with hip-hop and rap has created a unique sound that has turned him into a star. In 2023, he became the first Punjabi musician to perform at Coachella; he has collaborated with stars like Sia, Ed Sheeran and NLE Choppa; and has consistently topped global charts.On Monday, he made his first appearance at the Met Gala.The focus on dandyism is, to him, a perfect fit: “It’s what I’ve been doing all this time,” he said. On the eve of the event, the artist, who goes by Diljit, mused on his look for the night while perched on the sofa in his hotel room at the Plaza. “It’s about carrying your identity with pride, right?” he said.In his time on the global stage, Diljit has cultivated a visual identity that is almost as genre-bending as his music. He fuses traditional attire — a turban (a symbol of Sikh identity) and a kurta and tehmat (a long tunic and draped bottoms) — with modern-day twists. He’ll often pair his outfits with sneakers and sprinkle his looks with jewelry, like big gold hoops and chunky necklaces — what he calls the “cherry on top.”He walked the steps of the Met in a look designed to emulate Sir Bhupinder Singh, the early 20th century Maharaja of Patiala from the Punjab region of India.Diljit’s ivory and gold sherwani (a classic Indian jacket), pants and cape, designed by Prabal Gurung, were based on archival images of the maharaja, who was known for his opulent lifestyle, said his stylist, Abhilasha Devnani. One example: In 1928, the prince commissioned Cartier to make him a diamond necklace that weighed 1,000 carats — the largest necklace the French jeweler has ever made.To complete Diljit’s look, Ms. Devnani tried to borrow that iconic Cartier necklace for the night. But, she said, it sits sealed in a museum, so she commissioned the Indian jeweler Golecha’s to create jewelry inspired by the prince’s collection, including a turban brooch.The look features hand-embroidered motifs of India’s cultural markers, like lotus flowers and peacocks on the belt, and, on the cape, an artistic representation of the state of Punjab as well as Punjabi script, known as Gurmukhi.The outfit is, in many ways, an ode to the rich sartorial history of the subcontinent, Mr. Gurung said, where for centuries, royalty dressed with such extravagant flair that they themselves were the subject of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in 1985.The touches on the cape were Diljit’s idea, Mr. Gurung said. “He’s unapologetically himself” and is highlighting a culture rarely seen in the global spotlight.What, he asked, is dandyism if not that?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnother contender for Train of the Night: Shakira in yards of pink Prabal Gurung. She needs six men to manipulate all that material.ImageCredit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesEarlier this evening, when Laban King hopped a puddle, he made sure not to get his white pinstripe suit wet. He said his outfit, which included a gigantic black brim hat, was an homage to this year’s Met Gala theme — and to his father.“I’m from Detroit, a fashion capital for Black people, and my dad dressed like this,” he said. “Of course, I don’t have a ticket to get into the Met Gala, but my father is now dead, and I wanted to represent him.”ImageCredit...Graham Dickie/The New York TimesOlivier Rousteing, the Balmain designer, accessorized his look with Rosalia — and a handbag in the shape of a sewing machine.“You know it’s your girl,” shouted Keke Palmer, referencing a viral clip of her greeting Megan Thee Stallion at a past Met Gala. She climbed the steps with Vera Wang, who designed her white dress with structured lapels. Then she ran over to exchange a warm hug with the designer Sergio Hudson.VideoCreditCredit...Chevaz Clarke/The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDressing for the MetJordan Casteel honors her grandmother at the Met Gala.ImageCredit...Amir Hamja for The New York TimesThe first time the painter Jordan Casteel saw the dress Charles Elliot Harbison designed for her to wear to this year’s Met Gala, she immediately started to cry.“Not only was it beautiful to see this garment that is tailored quite literally for me,” she said from her couch after her final fitting for what will be her first time attending the event. “It is something that feels like they were thinking about me from the beginning to the end in designing it.”“This is a fever dream,” she added.While Ms. Casteel had seen sketches and mood boards and was in constant communication with Mr. Harbison during the design process, the abstract came to life when she was in the room with the garment and the several tailors who were pinning and pricking the dress to her specific needs.“I feel feminine, I feel bold,” she said about wearing the gown. “This is a moment where our freedom — there’s the complexities of the world that we exist in, but for this day for this carpet for this moment, we are showing up and this outfit makes me feel like I am stepping into a version of myself that no one would expect but that I know I belong.”She added, “I feel I am powerful and I am beautiful and you will see me, my Black body is going to be seen.”Ms. Casteel, 36, describes the dress as Afro-futurism, or “the things that we imagine for ourselves,” she said. “When I put it on, I think it’s the feminine part that feels really good.”The dress is really a two-piece: a skirt and a top. They both have strong volume points around the hip and Ms. Casteel is expecting to reveal more and more of it as the night goes on. And while the dress is a focal point of the night, it is what will not be seen from the red carpet that she feels proudest to wear.Beneath the dress will be a necklace that belonged to Ms. Casteel’s grandmother, Margaret Buckner Young, who was an author, educator and the first Black woman to serve on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.“We are all thinking about the dandies in our life,” Ms. Casteel said, referring to the theme of the gala this year. “She fashioned herself. I am holding her spirit as close as humanly possible in this moment.”“This is for her,” she added. “That is also the freedom.”There’s a “White Lotus” reunion happening between Patrick Schwarzenegger and Aimee Lou Wood. They missed Walton Goggins, who sailed up the stairs earlier in the evening.Doja Cat, Marc Jacobs and Cynthia Erivo are holding hands in one very powerful, well-dressed triangle. Erivo complimented Doja Cat on her towering heels. Everybody made a fuss over Jacobs’s curled hair.
