Her work was the focus of an exhibition in New York this summer.Credit...Clara Vannucci for The New York TimesKathleen BeckettReporting from Florence, ItalyNov. 28, 2024The women entering the Italian Cultural Institute on Park Avenue on this particular spring day all had one thing in common: They were wearing a piece, or several, of big, bold, colorful jewelry. The necklaces and bracelets and brooches had been created from chunks of resin, strung together in eye-catching color combinations like orange, red and yellow, or blue lapis dusted with gold alongside shimmering mother-of-pearl.And they were wearing the jewelry to view an exhibition by its designer, Angela Caputi.Like many of the visitors to “Reflections/Riflessi: Angela Caputi,” which ended in early June, the institute’s director, Fabio Finotti, discovered Ms. Caputi’s jewelry on a visit to Florence, Italy, where the 87-year-old designer lives and works.“I was walking down the Via Santo Spirito,” he said, “and saw this wonderful necklace for my wife in a shop window.”It resembled clusters of autumn leaves, he said, and cost about 350 euros (now $370). And the more he looked around the boutique, especially after meeting Ms. Caputi, who was working in the back, the more impressed he became. So he arranged the show.It was not the first time Ms. Caputi’s jewelry had been in the spotlight. It has appeared in movies and on television (the ’80s TV series “Dynasty” was a big fan), on runways and in museums from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Pitti Palace in Florence. And Ms. Caputi has won numerous awards, including the Fiorino d’Oro, Florence’s highest honor, given to individuals deemed to have brought prestige to the city.ImageA necklace on display in Angela Caputi’s other shop in Florence, on Borgo Santissimi Apostoli.Credit...Clara Vannucci for The New York TimesImageMs. Caputi started designing jewelry decades ago, when she was a widow with two young children to support.Credit...Clara Vannucci for The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
