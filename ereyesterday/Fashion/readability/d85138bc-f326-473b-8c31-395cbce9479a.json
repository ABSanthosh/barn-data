It can be a social experience, and a deeply personal one; at times, it can be impulsive and entertaining, at others, purpose-driven, a chore. Where do you shop? When do you shop? How do you decide what you need, how much to spend and what's \"you\"? These are some of the questions we're putting to prominent figures in our column \"How I Shop.\"Paris Jackson likes her home how she likes her clothes: soft, comfortable and earthy. \"I live in a vintage home that was built in the 1940s,\" she tells Fashionista. \"My house, my animals, my clothing and everything else co-exist very beautifully where there's a lot of earth tones and a lot of natural elements. There's a lot of stone, brick, wood and lots of nature and trees. It's a very bohemian-style home and it all goes really well together.\" Jackson at the Ann Demeulemeester show during Paris Fashion Week September 2024Photo: Peter White/Getty ImagesHer adherence to a cohesive aesthetic can be felt in every aspect of her public life from acting, to fashion (she attended a slew of fashion month events like the KidSuper x Lovesac Comedy Show and even walked the runway during Paris Fashion Week), to music (she maintains a career as a singer-songwriter), to interiors. Over the years, her personal style has leaned boho-chic with an element of grunge, or, as she describes it, \"Janis Joplin meets Kurt Cobain\" (fitting references for the daughter of the King of Pop).Ahead, Jackson shares some of her favorite red carpet outfits, her love for anything John Galliano, her go-to vintage store and more.Jackson at KidSuper's Funny Business Comedy Fashion Show in Partnership with Lovesac.Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images for Lovesac\"[My relationship with fashion] used to be more of a love-hate and now it's more love because I've learned how to not let the industry affect my personal life and find a good balance with it. When I'm at home, I really do get to just enjoy the art of fashion. My earliest memories of it, I mean, I was always around pretty innovative fashion growing up, so it's always been a theme in my life.\"With my personal style, I go for comfort most of the time, so I like a lot of soft clothing. Typically I stick with earth tones and browns and it's a cross between Janis Joplin meets Kurt Cobain.\"For all events, I meet with my stylists and tell them what colors and brands I like and the overall style I'm going for. They'll pick a bunch of options and then I mix and match the outfits myself. One of my favorite looks was the Celine look that I wore to the Grammy's earlier this year where I covered all of my tattoos to let the dress have its moment. There's this beautiful green Versace jumpsuit that I wore at the [2018] Vanity Fair [Oscars party] — that's probably one of my favorites as well. And also the Giambattista Valli dress at the Vanity Fair Oscar party I wore last year.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesPhoto: John Shearer/Getty ImagesPhoto: Clickpix/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\"I have to say the first outfit standout that comes to my mind was the one for the [2018] Met Gala after party. I wore this long-one-sleeved Balmain dress that had a lightning bolt across the front and I wore it with a bandana and knee-high boots. That was probably the most fun going-out look that I can think of. \"For my favorite fashion week moments, I mean I love the city of Paris. I have friends there, so anytime I can go for fashion week, I'll typically extend my stay a couple extra days so I can see friends and really enjoy the city.\"I shop both [online and in-store]. My favorite type of shopping would be resale and vintage, especially for the sustainability purposes. I really enjoy buying old animal products because I don't like the idea of an animal having died for one season's worth of popularity and then collecting dust in a store. So I buy a lot of old vintage leather and vintage fur. What Goes Around Comes Around is probably my favorite vintage store and they have a location in L.A. and in New York.Jackson attending the Stella McCartney show during Paris Fashion Week in September 2024Photo: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images\"Pretty much anything that [John] Galliano designed while he was at Dior is number one for me. I have so many pairs of pants from that era and so many tops and jackets that it truly is my favorite end-all, be-all. I'm always looking for more stuff from those collections. And I really like old-school Galliano, like the pieces he designed for [his own brand]. He's probably my favorite designer and I love what he's doing with [Maison] Margiela right now. Old school Vivienne Westwood is really cool, and quite a few Chanel pieces lately as well [have been in my closet rotation].\"I have a suede Dior by Galliano trench coat that I'm just obsessed with.\"I have a vintage Dior dress, also from the John Galliano era. It's this bohemian striped, almost rainbow — but muted — dress that I wore for the 'Low Key In Love' music video that I did with The Struts. The stylist found it for the video and I ended up buying it because I loved it so much.\"Jackson wearing vintage Gucci at the 2023 Fashion US Trust Awards.Photo: Steve Granitz/FilmMagic\"My favorite color is brown and I've been sporting it for years and I think as we're coming into fall more people are going to be wearing brown, so that color is eye candy for me.\"Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.

I wore this long-one-sleeved \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/designers/balmain\"\u003eBalmain\u003c/a\u003e dress that had a lightning bolt across the front and I wore it with a bandana and knee-high boots.

I have friends there, so anytime I can go for fashion week, I\u0026#39;ll typically extend my stay a couple extra days so I can see friends and really enjoy the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;I shop both [online and in-store]. My favorite type of shopping would be resale and \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/vintage\"\u003evintage\u003c/a\u003e, especially for the sustainability purposes. I really enjoy buying old animal products because I don\u0026#39;t like the idea of an animal having died for one season\u0026#39;s worth of popularity and then collecting dust in a store. So I buy a lot of old vintage leather and vintage fur. What Goes Around Comes Around is probably my favorite vintage store and they have a location in L.A. and in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\u003cphoenix-picture\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.webp 380w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.webp 620w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.webp 700w\"/\u003e\u003csource sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.jpg 380w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.jpg 620w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.jpg 700w\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Jackson attending the Stella McCartney show during Paris Fashion Week in September 2024\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.jpg\" data-src=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMjM4MDczNjEzNTkxNzU2/paris-jackson-fashion-week-2024.jpg\" height=\"6000\" width=\"4000\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" itemprop=\"contentUrl url\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/phoenix-picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"caption\"\u003eJackson attending the Stella McCartney show during Paris Fashion Week in September 2024\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"author\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;Pretty much anything that [John] Galliano designed while he was at \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/designers/dior\"\u003eDior\u003c/a\u003e is number one for me.
