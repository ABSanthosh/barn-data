  "text": "The retail landscape changed dramatically in the last decade, and is continuing to evolve. Take Saks Fifth Avenue’s new concept, for example. The Fifth Avenue Club, a personal shopping and styling service, has opened at 21 luxury resorts across the country, including, most recently, at The London West Hollywood. For the uninitiated, The Fifth Avenue Club aims to offer the best in luxury shopping. At The London, this translates to one-on-one appointments tailored to individual needs and complimentary light bites and drinks. In addition to curated ready-to-wear items, all of which are picked out via consultation, customers can find beauty products to add to their collection. And the experience isn’t limited to hotel guests either—locals are free to enjoy it too. Peter Christiansen ValliInside The Fifth Avenue Club at The London West Hollywood. “The Fifth Avenue Club West Hollywood represents Saks Fifth Avenue’s commitment to redefining the luxury shopping experience by combining our expertly curated assortment with personalization in an innovative way,” Larry Bruce, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus President of Stores, says in a press release. “West Hollywood is the perfect setting for this concept, allowing us to offer our customers an unmatched level of service in a space that reflects the sophistication and creativity of our brand.” Built in 2008 and designed by David Collins Studio, The London West Hollywood pays tribute to its namesake city across the pond in more ways than one. With its central location in L.A., it not only offers great clothing from British labels—there’s a bar that transports guests to the English countryside, often-photographed pool, and a hotel suite inspired by the work of Vivienne Westwood.",
