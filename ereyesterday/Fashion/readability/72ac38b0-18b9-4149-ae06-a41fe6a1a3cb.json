And thus, not every curl cream is created equal. A few blessed curl creams work from 2a waves to tight, springy 4c coils, but there are some (looking at you, Ouai). For the most part, it pays to pay attention to the types of curls for which a curling cream for men is created. Otherwise, you might not be getting enough moisturization or there might be too much, and heavy oils will weigh your fine, wavy hair down. Silicone-free  Silicones are added to hair products to make it look silky, shiny, and smooth. However, in addition to waxes and mineral oils, they leave build-up behind on the hair, which can leave them limp, dry and oily. Over time, this affects the curl pattern you’re trying to enhance. Your best bet for the best hair curling cream for men is a silicone-free alternative, of which there are plenty. If you like silicone cream, that’s totally fine. Just make sure to use a clarifying shampoo regularly to remove that build-up. Hydration One of the best ways to ensure that curly hair is healthy and bouncy is with a curl cream that provides adequate hydration. As you might have already noticed, it’s frizzy, dry hair that causes all the trouble. Look for curl creams that specifically advertise moisturizing properties, and look for ingredients like various oils, panthenol, and silk proteins. theouai / Instagram How We Chose  Plenty of curling creams claim to contain ingredients that strengthen, moisturize, and redefine curls. But oftentimes, these products cause curls to fall flat. So, wherever possible, I chose curling creams from reputable brands that have effective, well-known ingredients that they display transparently. I also sifted through hundreds of customer reviews, landing on my top 8 by choosing curling creams that are highly rated and effective and that consumers would likely buy again. Company reputation: Does that brand have a good track record over the years in terms of delivering consistently high-quality products on time? The way a company operates is of the utmost importance to me. Customer reviews: Does the description of the performance given by the company match what customers say online? I pay more attention to how real people view curling creams on their actual curls than anything else. Transparency: Do they say that a product is ‘all natural’ while sneaking in silicones and other damaging chemicals onto their labels? I prefer a curling cream company that is up-front about what the product contains so you know exactly what you’re getting.
