To help you on your search for pant perfection, I’ve pulled together the best jeans for big guys—including a range of must-have options for all budgets, body shapes, and sartorial preferences. Keep reading for my list of the finest styles ready to buy right now. Key Takeaways Finding the best jeans for big guys is no easy task, which is why I’ve rounded up a variety of suitable styles to improve your denim collection. From Closed’s regular pair to Wrangler’s stretchy jeans, these are the designs that will help cover big bellies, accommodate chunky thighs, and hide away those stubborn muffin tops. You’ll also find some tips on what to wear them with. In This ArticleOur PicksWhat to look forFinal VerdictFAQs david_fadd / Instagram Best Overall: Closed Cooper True Regular Jeans Alongside the crew neck T-shirt and white sneakers, a pair of blue jeans is one of the most essential items in a guy’s wardrobe. You can wear them casually or dress them up, and they’ll pair perfectly with just about any footwear choice. Part of the label’s sustainable denim line, this pair has been made from organic and recycled cotton in a mid-rise style that’ll feel comfortable on men of all sizes. Wear them with an oversized top for relaxed days or pop on a flannel shirt or a hoodie if you’re heading into town. Material: 80% Cotton, 20% Recycled Cotton | Sizes: 27-38” | Colors: 1 Best on Amazon: Lucky Brand 181 Relaxed Straight Jeans It’s probably not a shock to hear that Amazon has one of the largest collections of the best jeans for big guys. I mean, is there anything they don’t do? Seriously, I’d be interested to know. Amongst a sea of stylish denim options (including white jeans and fits that your dad would wear), you’ll find these from Lucky Brand. Select the ‘big and tall’ fit and you’ll find a huge selection of sizes that go all the way up to a 54” waist. They’re made from cotton in a relaxed straight-leg silhouette that’ll flatter pretty much any build. I’d wear them with a graphic tee and your go-to pair of high-top sneakers. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: 28-54” | Colors: 14 Best Timeless: Asket The Washed Denim Jeans No man should be starved of timeless everyday choices, regardless of his weight or fat percentage. Thankfully, brands like Asket are in agreement. The Swedish-born label offers up a selection of reliable wardrobe staples in a range of sizes that are suitable for guys of all builds. These washed blue jeans are cut from 13oz Italian denim that’s been softened and finished with a classic wash that will only get better with age. You can choose from a regular or slim fit, and the waist sizes go up to 38.” For men above average height, you’ll be pleased to know their inside leg measurements are pretty generous too (30-36”). Team yours with a crew neck tee and designer sneakers for a stylish ensemble that can be worn for endless occasions. Material: 100% Organic Cotton | Sizes: 28-38” | Colors: 2 Best Stretch: Wrangler Flex Waist Jeans Many of the best jeans for big guys come with a bit of stretch. As well as making them generally more comfortable, it also means they are better at accommodating large waistlines and chunky or muscular legs. My top pick comes from Wrangler—available in waists 29-60” (the most impressive size range I’ve featured). The regular fit pair is made with a flex waistband and stretchy denim to ensure that the fabric moves and bends with you. You can wear them with a plaid shirt and boots, or a crew neck tee and sneakers. Material: 98% Cotton, 2% Spandex | Sizes: 29-60” | Colors: 9 Best Ripped: Levi’s Original Fit 501 Jeans Ripped jeans aren’t just for skinny indie guys. Truth is, the big boys can wear them too. But with so many options on offer, how do you separate the good from the bad? I find putting your trust in Levi’s is a good place to start. The Original Fit 501 was first introduced in 1873 and now comes with distressed detailing to bring them bang up to date. The sizing is generous enough for the larger lad, while avid gym goers shouldn’t have a problem getting their calves through the straight legs. I’d wear them on the weekend with a long-sleeved T-shirt and canvas sneakers. Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: 28-46” | Colors: 9 Best Up and Comer: Represent Straight Leg Jeans From Levi’s to Replay, there are a plethora of classic denim labels to choose from. However, if you’re looking for something a little different, may I suggest Represent? Founded in 2011 by brothers George and Mike Heaton, the luxury British brand is making huge waves in the streetwear scene, and offers up some of the finest jeans around. This pair is cut to a straight fit that looks just as good with boots as it does with sneakers. The super soft fabric features a hint of stretch for comfort and the unique wash gives them a slightly casual feel that’ll complement a range of weekend staples. Material: 98% Cotton, 2% Elastane | Sizes: 28-38” | Colors: 2 Best Luxury: Canali Straight Leg Jeans As a big guy, you’ve probably succumbed to the fact that there are some things in life you simply can’t wear. But while spray-on skinnies are out of the question, you don’t have to give up hope on finding the perfect pair of designer big and tall jeans. Canali’s denim offering is available in waist sizes 31.5-41.5” and has been made from a blue cotton fabric that has a slight stretch to it. The straight leg will accommodate bulky calves, while the mid-rise will be comfortable on six-packs and beer bellies alike. Pop them on with a button-down shirt and smart sneakers for a fail-safe outfit suitable for trips to the offices and lunch with friends. Material: 98% Cotton, 2% Elastane | Sizes: 31.5-42.5” | Colors: 2 Best Budget: H\u0026M Freefit Slim Jeans Good news: you don’t have to pay more for the extra material used to make the best jeans for big and tall guys. Which means there’s a bunch of affordable options on the market, including this slim-fitting pair from H\u0026M. With a regular waist, tailored thigh, and straight leg, they’re cut perfectly for guys carrying a little timber. Better yet, the Freefit technology allows a soft, generous stretch to ensure freedom of movement and all-day comfort. I suggest wearing them with a flannel shirt and leather boots for a timeless smart-casual look. Material: 90% Cotton, 8% Elastomultiester, 2% Spandex | Sizes: 28-44” | Colors: 7 ben_jjames / Instagram What To Look For In The Best Jeans For Big Guys Fit  The best jeans for big guys are available in a range of fits. Which one you choose will largely depend on your physique. For example, short men with big stomachs will require something slim with a mid or high-rise, while those that are tall with bulging thighs may need a slightly looser fit. Material  If you’re buying a pair of good quality jeans, they should be made from denim: a sturdy cotton twill fabric presented in a variety of washes. However, some styles will be blended with materials like elastane. This will provide a stretchier garment that is particularly suitable for guys with big legs or stomachs. Style Big guys have choices too. Although there may not be as many options as you would like, there are still plenty of styles to choose from. Dark wash or black denim is perfect for smarter ensembles, while ripped jeans can be a great way to add a little attitude to your look. raulsamuel_official / Instagram Final Verdict  If you were worrying about finding the best jeans for big guys, I hope I’ve helped put your minds at ease. With the must-have styles included in this guide, all that’s left for you to do is pick out your favorite pair. If it were up to me, I’d look no further than Closed’s Cooper True regular jeans. Available in a good range of sizes, the style is finished with a classic wash that will continue to improve with age. You can wear them with tees or shirts, and they’ll look just as good with shoes as they will with sneakers. FAQ The type of jeans you should wear will depend on the type of big guy you are. For example, if you’re short and stocky, you’ll require something slim to flatter your physique. Taller, slimmer builds have a greater choice, so they may want to go for something skinnier or perhaps looser. Jeans with a mid or high-rise will help hide bigger stomachs. You should also look for styles that have added stretch, as these are going to be more comfortable around the midsection. A lot of big guys think that wearing baggy clothing will help hide body fat. However, this will actually accentuate your size and often make you look larger than you actually are. Slim-fit jeans are a great option for making you appear smaller. Guys with big bellies may be tempted to try and hide them by pulling up their jeans. Others may feel more comfortable wearing them below the waistline. Ideally, you shouldn’t do either. If you feel comfortable enough, you should wear your jeans at your waist (in line with your belly button). 8 Best Jeans for Big Guys 2024 SHARE ON We independently evaluate all recommended products and sercives.
