The instrumental piano album follows one in which he focused entirely on the flute — a sharp departure from his days in the rap duo Outkast.Beyond the promotion of his new album, his outfit on Monday was carefully planned, both to highlight the event’s theme, which centered on Black style and dandyism, and its dress code, “Tailored For You.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
