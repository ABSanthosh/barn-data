  "description": "When it’s sweltering out, the only thing more appealing than blasting the AC is slipping into an ultra-lightweight dress that barely skims the body. Whether it’s a floaty cotton dress that breathes easily, a poplin midi with cut-outs for added airflow, or a linen maxi made for getaways, these summer-ready silhouettes are what we’ll be living in from now through Labor Day.This edit includes the most breathable summer dresses we could find — many with open backs, strategic slits, or draped shapes that won’t cling, bunch, or stick to sweaty skin. We’ve got all the trends covered, too: shift dresses that go from desk to drinks, tiered and flowy dresses made for triple-digit temps, picnic-ready gingham, bubble hems that bring volume without weight, and standout hues like butter yellow and poppy. Consider this your guide to surviving the heat in style — whether your summer plans include a sardine-girl stroll through the city, a fisherman-coded coastal escape, or a destination wedding abroad (hello, European aesthetic). Mini Dresses Short, swingy, and made to float away from the body, these minis are your best defense against summer’s stickiest days. But heat-proof doesn’t mean shapeless or void of detail — our favorites include ruched accents, exaggerated babydoll silhouettes, and not-overly-clingy smocking. Midi Dresses Midi lengths strike the perfect balance between ease and polish — ideal for office days, dinner plans, or anything in between. Refresh your assortment with of-the-moment silhouettes featuring halter necklines, milkmaid-esque puff sleeves, and beautifully embroidered handkerchief designs. Maxi Dresses Maxis may offer the most coverage, but the best ones still feel easy, airy, and perfectly cool on hot days. Reach for a cut-out design or open back for date night, a cotton shirt dress for a day full of shopping and lunch, or a printed option that feels just right for a summer wedding or dinner outing.
