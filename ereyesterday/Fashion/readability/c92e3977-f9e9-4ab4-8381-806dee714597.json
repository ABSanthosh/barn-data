But unlike your clothes, you can’t take a crap haircut off after a day of fielding abuse from your colleagues. Which is why—before going under the barber’s scissors—it’s worth knowing which is the best haircut for your face shape. After all, an extra inch here or a smattering of facial hair there can make all the difference. Whether you’re looking for haircuts for round faces, long or rectangular faces, square faces, heart-shaped faces, diamond-shaped faces, or triangle-shaped faces, we’ve got you covered. And no, you can’t have one of each face. Unless you’re a Batman villain. What’s My Face Shape? If you’re asking yourself, “Which hairstyle suits me?” start by determining your face shape. Take a look at the illustration below and find a mirror to compare your face to these different male face shapes. There are more detailed instructions at the bottom of this article if you can’t tell. Interested in Learning More? See All Our Face Shape Articles Once you’ve learned your face shape and what haircut works for you, don’t skip out on all the other potential styling tips for your face shape. Face Shape Articles Triangle Face Shapes Rectangle Face Shapes Pear Face Shapes Diamond Face Shapes Oblong Face Shapes Heart-Shaped Faces Square Face Shapes Round Face Shapes Oval Face Shapes How To Choose A Haircut For Your Face Shape Haircuts For Round Faces Circular with a rounded chin and no obvious lines or angles, a round face shape benefits from a haircut that lends it some definition. Whether you’ve got some extra baby fat and are looking for haircuts for chubby faces, or your face just lacks angles, consider one of these hairstyles to suit your face. “If you’ve got a round face shape, think square,” says Stevens. “Since round faces have little in the way of natural angles, you need to create the illusion of structure with your hair. A style with height on the top that’s taken tight at the sides such as a pompadour or a flat top works well to add structure, as do front fringes.” “Square corners in the high recession area of your hair will sharpen up any soft edges,” adds Robinson. “A full square beard will also help thin the chin area, giving the appearance of a more chiseled jaw.” Haircuts For Long Faces Also considered a rectangular face shape or an oblong face shape, long faces fall somewhere between an oval and a square, but require a subtly tweaked hairstyle to ensure the face doesn’t appear even longer than it is. “Because a rectangular face looks longer, it’s important to avoid taking the sides too short if keeping length on the top, as this would only accentuate the length of the face,” explains Nicolaou. “Try a well-proportioned style that doesn’t take the sides too short or leave too much length on top.” Taking that advice, try a style that lets the hair fall to the sides and/or across the forehead to add width and ensure your face doesn’t appear narrower than it is. Finally, never pair with a Duck Dynasty beard, says Robinson. “A full beard only elongates the face, so instead try facial hair that ranges in length from stubble to a short beard to fill out any gaps.” Haircuts For Oval Faces Seen as the genetic jackpot for women, an oval face shape may not be the most alpha of face shapes for men, but it’s a good canvas for experimentation when it comes to men’s haircuts. Symmetrical and well-proportioned, an oval face shape does pretty much any hairstyle justice, so—you lucky boy—the choice is very much yours. That said, there are a couple of minor caveats to ensure you optimize your ovalness. “The trick with an oval face shape is to wear your hair off the forehead to create some volume and angles on top,” says Aveda master barber Stelios Nicolaou. “The most suitable style is a classic short back and sides and slightly longer on the top, with a side-swept parting.” You’ll also want to avoid a forward fringe. “Too much heaviness on the forehead softens features and increases roundness of the face,” says celebrity hairstylist Jamie Stevens. And feel free to ditch the beard, says Ruffians creative director Denis Robinson. “You don’t need facial hair to fill out any disproportionate gaps in this case, so feel free to go clean-shaven.” Classic Men’s Hairstyle: The French Crop Haircuts For Square Faces Considered the masculine ideal, a square face shape is characterized by a razor sharp jawline, even proportions and an overall chiseled appearance. Grrr. Like the oval, it’s a great foundation for most styles and is versatile enough to work with both extremely short and longer hairstyles—from buzz cuts to French crops to quiffs. Just bear in mind that the shorter you go, the more you look like you’ve just been conscripted. Not that that won’t serve you well. “Classic, neat haircuts complement a square shape best—think close fades, side partings and short layers,” says Stevens. Some light stubble also gives the sharpness of your jawline a little welcome texture without blurring its line. Haircuts For Heart-Shaped Faces Wide at the temples and hairline, gradually narrowing to a point at the chin, the (fairly rare) heart-shaped face benefits from a few optical illusions to make it appear better proportioned. “Avoid cuts that are very tight, as these will accentuate the narrowness of the chin and the width of the forehead,” says Stevens. “A medium-length swept look is the safest bet.” Mid-length and long hairstyles that are kept reasonably thin and light soften the heart shape’s strong forehead. Facial hair is also key in this case, adding some much-needed bulk to a narrow chin and jawline, says Robinson. “As with the diamond face shape, a beard helps a heart shape gain fullness in the lower, narrower half of the head.” Haircuts For Diamond-Shaped Faces Narrow in the chin and brow, with width in the cheeks, the diamond face shape is one of the rarer face shapes for men. Because of that, it has some specialist requirements to ensure it looks its namesake. “Hairstyles that add width at the forehead and chin area are your best bet,” says Stevens. “Fringes work well to add texture to the forehead, while longer styles that can be tucked behind the ears are great for accentuating a diamond shape’s bone structure.” Don’t, however, take the sides too short—given the width of the cheekbones, a hairstyle that’s particularly short at the sides will only make your ears look bigger. Softer lines and layers are better for this face shape, working to soften its natural angles. Try a side sweep or deep side-parting, and consider growing a 5 o’clock shadow if you want to add some size to a narrower chin. Haircuts For Triangle-Shaped Faces Due to its narrow forehead and wide jawline, a triangle-shaped face requires the opposite treatment of a heart shape. “A style with volume is king with this one,” says Stevens. “Opt for longer, nose-length haircuts with fuller sides, which work to add depth.” As for the beard, the most you’ll look good with is some light stubble. But really, given the prominence of the jawline, in this case, it’s best to steer clean-shaven. Grab the razor, fellas. FAQs How can I determine my face shape? When thinking about how to find your hairstyle, start with your face shape. It’s simple. First, arm yourself with a flexible tape measure. Then, take the following measurements, recording each as you go. Forehead: Measure across your face from the peak of one eyebrow arch to the peak of the opposite arch. Cheekbones: Measure across your cheekbones, starting and ending at the pointiest part below the outer corner of each eye. Jawline: Measure from the tip of your chin to below your ear at the point at which your jaw angles upwards. Multiply that number by two to get your jawline measurement. Face Length: Measure from the center of your hairline to the tip of your chin. Once you’ve taken these measurements, note which is the largest of the four, and then compare this to the seven main profiles to find out where your face falls. Oval: Face length is greater than the width of the cheekbones, and forehead is greater than the jawline. The angle of the jaw is rounded rather than sharp. Long: Face length is the greatest measurement. Forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are similar in size. Triangular: Jawline measures greater than cheekbones, which measure larger than the forehead. Round: Cheekbones and face length have a similar measurement. They are larger than the forehead and jawline, which also have a similar measurement. The angle of the jaw is soft and much less defined. Heart: Forehead measures greater than the cheekbones and jawline. The chin is pointed. Square: All measurements are fairly similar. The angle of the jaw is sharp rather than rounded. Diamond: Face length measures largest. Then, in descending order: cheekbones, forehead, and smallest is jawline. The chin is pointed. What hairstyle suits my face? This all depends on your face shape. There are seven unique face shapes, and the angles of yours will determine what kind of haircut will accentuate your features, rather than making you look worse. What are the seven different face shapes for men? The seven different face shapes for men are round, long or rectangular, oval, square, heart, diamond and triangle. Which face shape is best for male? Generally, the square-shaped face is considered the most masculine of the different face shapes because of the angles of the jawline. The most common face shape, however (among both men and women) is the oval-shaped face.
