  "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" may be over, but we're still digesting it all. After all, the show ran every day - except for Wednesdays - since its premiere on June 3, and each nearly two-hour episode showcased some of the worst (and best) of what America's current dating pool has to offer. The series has even left us with a slew of aftermath moments to hold us over until the season's Aug. 25 reunion, from embracing the beauty of being a sensitive gangster like Amaya Espinal to fan-favorite couple Nicolandria trekking to Disneyland. Another item to stoke the post-Love Island obsessive madness? Iris Kendall's boy shorts. After entering the villa as a bombshell in episode nine, the Los Angeles-born star proved to be one of the most enduring islanders, as she diligently explored multiple connections before making it to the final four with partner Jose \"Pepe\" Garcia. Kendall's style is another element we're reflecting on, but not for the reason you think. Naturally, she wore many looks that reflected the carefree California vibe (like bikinis and frilly dresses), but her pajama wardrobe was especially impressive. As islanders got ready for bed each night, fans quickly noticed that Kendall often wore the Skims Soft Smoothing Seamless Boy Short ($22) and the Skims Fits Everybody Lace Short ($24) - and for good reason. Not only are they super lightweight, but they're constructed with high-quality cotton and nylon that provides full coverage and a confidence-boosting silhouette. They even range from size XXS to 4X, making them accessible for all. @megannicklas Give me all of them @SKIMS @Iris Kendall ü§≠üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüñ§ immediately ordered #skimsboyshorts #loveislandusa #irisandpepe4life ‚ô¨ Iris - Goo Goo Dolls To no one's surprise, the affordable bottom has gained TikTok approval, with many users flocking to the Skims website to get the Iris Kendall look for themselves.
