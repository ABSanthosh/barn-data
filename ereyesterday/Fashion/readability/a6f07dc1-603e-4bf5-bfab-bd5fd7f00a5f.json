As your winter dresses make their seasonal debut, it’s the perfect time to refresh a few favorites. This season calls for cozy-luxe long-sleeve sweater dresses, sumptuous velvet styles, and maxi silhouettes that deliver warmth and coverage. Blazer dresses are having a major moment, too — ideal for everything from casual hangs and office hours. We even found styles perfect for date nights and winter weddings. Ahead, shop the best cool-weather picks from reader-favorite retailers like Free People, Nordstrom, and Aritzia. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sweater Dresses Whether you’re dressing for the office, a cozy dinner, a log cabin getaway, or a stroll and window shopping, a sweater dress has you covered. From lightweight jersey to plush cashmere and chunky knits, these versatile styles are equal parts warm and comfortable. We found a range of versatile styles, such as a cardigan-hybrid for work and a turtleneck maxi for outdoor winter festivities. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Maxi Dresses Maxi dresses aren’t just a summer staple — they’re arguably even better for winter (hello, full coverage). On casual days, opt for lounge-worthy styles, but when the vibes skew dressy, go for elevated details like off-the-shoulder necklines or flowy skirts. DashDividers_1_500x100 Velvet Dresses When it comes to winter fabrics, velvet is the undisputed favorite. It’s soft, tactile, and undeniably luxe — perfect for cocktail parties and winter events, especially in fitted midi or maxi silhouettes. For other seasonal occasions, like Valentine’s Day, we’ve also spotted darling minis with playful details like fluttery sleeves and lace collars.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Blazer Dresses With 2025 fashion trends like bold shoulders and soft suiting on the rise, it’s no wonder blazer dresses are having a moment. The suit alternative lets you bring the business vibes while showing a bit of leg (hey, now). Plus, with thicker fabrics like tweed and wool in the mix, you don’t have to sacrifice warmth. Just add fleece-lined tights and over-the-knee boots to fully winter-proof your look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Wedding Guest Dresses If you’ve got weddings on the horizon and no look confirmed — we’ve got you. Go for sequins in rich jewel tones or classic black dresses with a twist (think bows and ruffles). For cocktail attire dress codes, try a mini or midi dress versatile enough to repurpose for other winter festivities. And if it’s black-tie, opt for a gown — bonus points if it’s in a festive color or dripping in sparkle. Like what you see?
