Credit...Daniel VerleyNov. 29, 2024Amaiya Briani Davis thinks she was in the grips of the woolly astrological stage known as “Saturn return” in the spring of 2018. “It’s this period before you turn 30 when a lot of change happens,” she said.Ms. Davis, then 27, had started a new job as a music publicist and moved from her apartment in Midtown Manhattan to a place on the Upper West Side. Most destabilizing of all, in April, her boyfriend of almost two years, Matthew Carrington Durrae Wynter, abruptly broke off their relationship without much of an explanation. “It was hard for me to understand, why would you do this?” she said. “There was nothing fundamentally wrong at the time.”Chalking her topsy-turvy late 20s up to the cosmos helped return her sense of equilibrium. But letting the stars decide whether Mr. Wynter was worthy of falling for a second time never felt like an option.Ms. Davis, 33, and Mr. Wynter, 35, of Long Island City, Queens, met in the fall of 2009 at the University of Maryland when both were undergraduates, Ms. Davis a freshman and Mr. Wynter a senior. Before the two were introduced at a party given by a mutual friend, Ms. Davis had racked up a string of admirers.“I had heard her name and the chatter,” Mr. Wynter said. “A lot of guys had mentioned this freshman, Amaiya, who was very beautiful.” Meeting her was proof they weren’t wrong, he said. But he made it clear he wanted no part in being on her shortlist of suitors. “He didn’t really interact with me, and it was a similar situation when we would run into each other after that,” she said. “He wasn’t very talkative.”ImageThe groom handed out gifts to his wedding party, as well as the father of the bride, Dr. Marvin Davis.Credit...Daniel VerleyThank you for your patience while we verify access.
