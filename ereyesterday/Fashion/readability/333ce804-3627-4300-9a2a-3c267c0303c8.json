The gimmick is working.Among the cafes serving coffee drinks in buckets are Noctua Coffee in Imperial, Mo.; Dulce Vida in Tulsa, Okla.; and Wicked Southern Coffee in Salem, Conn.July 16, 2025, 6:00 p.m. ETOnce used to hold paint, mop water or haul home a fresh catch of fish, buckets are increasingly being used for something else entirely.
