There was definitely a time when even the idea of buying clothes, shoes, and accessories from a Latine-owned shop, let alone created by Latine designers, wasn't even on the radar, largely because representation was severely lacking.

Getty Images | PA WireFrom earrings to outerwear and everything in between, here are some of our favorite Latine-owned fashion brands to shop if you're looking to dress up yourself or gift someone something chic.shopjzd.comJZDJZD Feliz Stud Earrings ($32) JZD is a Latine-owned lifestyle brand that launched in 2016 and now sells empowering apparel, accessories, and home goods that are affordable and super cute. Born out of passion and determination, founders Jen and Vero persisted through poverty and struggle to make the line what it is today, and we love to be able to support them as they support the Latine community. We think these earrings are the perfect accessory for anyone who might need to remind certain family members that you don't need their approval (or advice) to be perfectly happy and content.clandestina.coClandestinaClandestina Camo Bucket Hat ($35) Clandestina is a history-making fashion line out of Cuba. The company launched in 2015 as the first independent design outlet in Cuba and soon after became the first Cuban clothing brand to sell its products online and ship to anywhere in the world. It features trendy, casual wear inspired by the island and constructed with materials that are often recycled. This adorable hat is super on trend, works year-round, is made of recycled materials, and is reversible. It comes in three sizes, but the fabric is actually denim with a little bit of stretch, making for a comfy fit.rabbleandrouse.comRabble \u0026 RouseRabble \u0026 Rouse Give All The Damns™ Jute Bag ($44) Rabble \u0026 Rouse makes fashion pieces that will help you let everyone and anyone know exactly where you stand on the issues that matter. Based in Atlanta and created by Latine owner Vanessa Toro, the line's tagline is \"Give all the damns\" as featured on this chic and functional tote. They carry shirts as well that are simple, soft, and to the point, featuring slogans like \"chingona come mi abuela\" and \"respect the locals.\" The company even donates some of its profits to charities local to the Atlanta area.shopmclc.comMCLCMCLC Balancing Act Mule ($95) MCLC is a Latina-owned shoe brand with a meaningful mission. Created by Guatemalan American designer Jacqueline Velasquez, the company features inclusive, eco-conscious footwear designs that are meant to evoke specific emotions in anyone who wears them or sees them. The line also donates a portion of every sale to nonprofit organizations. Currently, MCLC is focusing on \"balance,\" using an iteration of the classic yin and yang symbol on mules, slides, and boots available in various colors. We love the versatility of these mules, which are constructed from vegan leather. You can probably get away with wearing these throughout the seasons.farmrio.comFarm RioFarm Rio Ana Tapestry Pink Midi Dress ($248) Farm Rio is a Brazilian-owned fashion brand that has been around for more than two decades and always manages to stay true to its Latin American roots. From the textures and colors to its commitment to using diverse models, everything about the brand resonates with the Latinx community. This bold look is one of our favorites right now. The colors are rich and striking, and the cut looks ultra comfy without being too casual for, say, your next dinner party. This transitional piece can be dressed down with nude sandals for your next vacation getaway or dressed up with a pair of strappy heels for date night.migolondrina.comMi GolondrinaMi Golondrina Maria Botones Gris Blouse ($295) Inspired by her mother's Mexican heritage, founder Cristina Lynch launched Mi Golondrina with the goal of honoring traditional Mexican art forms like embroidery. All of the garments sold by Mi Golondrina are hand-stitched by artisans from communities throughout Mexico, who are paid a fair wage for their work. The line offers many styles of dresses and blouses and even some one-of-a-kind pieces. One of our favorites is this puff-sleeved, embroidered blouse which can be styled with everything from denim to pleated skirts.madebyciriaco.usCiriacoCiriaco Ashley Minimalist Baguette Leopard ($400) The definition of an It bag, Ciriaco bags are a favorite among fashion girls, including Blue Ivy Carter, who wore hers to the 2025 Super Bowl. The bags are the work of Afro-Latina designer Ashley Ciriaco, a Bronx-based artist with Dominican and Haitian roots who launched her line in 2020. The viral bags are known and loved for their asymmetrical shape that resembles a crecsent moon. This particular accessory boasts a leopard print that pairs well against neutrals, denim, or a bold red dress.flordemariacollection.comFlor de MariaFlor de Maria Flor Yellow Heeled Sandal ($495) We have been drooling over Flor de Maria shoes for some time now. Flor de Maria Rivera, who is originally from Peru, gave up a career as a sports journalist to pursue her fashion dreams in New York City and ended up launching her own line of high heels. All of the label's shoes are chic and trendy and have some sort of unique element that makes them stand out. This super-sexy sandal is one of our forever faves, boasting a high-quality leather ouutsole and a comfy insole with padded foam. We're loving the four-inch heel and the crystal rhinestone-embellished straps that add the perfect dose of sparkle.cuyana.comCuyanaCuyana Oversized Double Loop Bag ($498) We cannot express how much we love the concept of Cuyana. Owned by Ecuadorian immigrant Karla Gallardo, the label is all about fashion minimalism. Essentially, the idea is that we don't need quite as many items cluttering up our closets if we invest in high-quality staples that will stand the test of time. It sells a full range of gorgeous leather accessories and a variety of comfy fashion basics, including matching sweat sets and bodysuits, all constructed with care and sustainability in mind. The stunning loop bag is the type of tote that you'll definitely want to take out again and again. It's chic enough to go with any fancy dresses but also roomy and durable. What more can you ask for?andrea-gomez.comAndrea GomezAndrea Gomez Chiara 95 Black Lucite Boot ($500) Andrea Gomez literally has a shoe for every occasion. From kick-around boots perfect for the fall and winter months to trendy pumps and mules, this designer makes beautiful, well-made shoes in a huge variety of styles. Every shoe is made in small, family-owned factories in Italy, and a portion of the company's profits goes toward helping children in need in Andrea's home country of Venezuela. This lucite boot is made of soft leather and features a cushioned insole. If you're looking to spend, it's the perfect way to bring the lucite trend into fall and even winter.esant.shopEsantEsant 3D Pocket Long Coat ($1,520) Esant is a Latine-owned luxury clothing brand out of Mexico that focuses on creating functional and versatile clothing that is aesthetically interesting, while still being totally wearable and comfortable. It does a bit of everything, including workplace essentials like blazers and blouses and glamorous capes and coats. This chic coat is a functional classic that is just as suitable over a pair of jeans as it is over a cocktail dress.",
