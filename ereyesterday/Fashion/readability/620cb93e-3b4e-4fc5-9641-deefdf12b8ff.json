When it comes to the subject of wristwatches and ‘Bling,’ at what point is enough, enough? Some might argue you can never have too much and that’s undoubtedly the case with JBW watches. Just Bling Watch, mostly known as JBW, is a watch brand with no qualms about flashing reflective rocks in your face—particularly those of the crystal and diamond variety.  Started in 2008 by siblings Amir and Shabeena Meghani, JBW found its niche when Hip-Hop was synonymous with diamond-studded jewelry. Rappers would frequent Akber Meghani’s (Amir and Shabeena’s father) wholesale shop in the Dallas area—often searching for the flashiest timepieces. As third-generation watch connoisseurs/entrepreneurs, Amir and Shabeena took the opportunity to serve an ideal market and have gone on to set more than 18 million jewels since. @jbwwatches / Instagram Characteristics of JBW Watches Unless your eyes are closed, you’ll almost certainly notice JBW leans heavily into “flash” aesthetics —with a strong emphasis on naturally sourced earth diamonds and Swarovski crystals. While those points are notable in their own right, you’re likely wondering what else is so unique about these timepieces. We’ll cover some of the most impressive features of JBW watches more in-depth below. Covered in Diamonds and Swarovski crystals We’d be remiss not to—once again—highlight the abundance of shiny rocks embedded in JBW diamond watches. As we mentioned earlier, the diamonds you see in these pieces are REAL. JBW guarantees as much, both on its website and in all of its branding.  That said, affordability and diamonds seldom go hand-in-hand, but JBW has some of the most affordable prices, particularly when compared to similar styles from competing brands.  JBW can provide this by sourcing melee diamonds, which are often small and very affordable to obtain—making up for the lack of clarity you’d find in higher-end diamonds with sheer volume (and mixed with Swarovski crystals).  Large Size To make these pieces stand out, you’ll notice that size is of the utmost importance. JBW watches are often on the larger end of the spectrum, easily measuring around 50mm in diameter for many styles.  Still, with an increasing variety in selection from JBW as the brand grows, you can find plenty of smaller watches measuring in the 30-40mm range as well. @jbwwatches / Instagram Movement JBW watches offer three distinct movement types, depending on which model you decide to invest in: Japanese Chronograph Japanese Multifunction Swiss Multifunction JBW Swiss movement watches will run on the higher-end in terms of price. That said, JBW’s distinct style is evident in most of its available models, meaning you’ll have a variety of flashy options to choose from —regardless of your preferred movement type. Durability The consensus among JBW watch enthusiasts is that they are generally very well-made as far as quality goes.  That said, because JBW offers so many different styles, durability will largely depend on the material makeup (stainless steel or gold) and the ‘tier’ of a given watch.  Keep in mind that you certainly won’t find the same level of durability that you would find in, say, a G-Shock, but generally speaking, you can expect JBW to deliver.  Quality As mentioned above, JBW diamond watches are typically crafted from a mix of stainless steel and gold, depending on the model—not to mention varying amounts of natural (albeit smaller) diamonds. Keep in mind that JBW’s focus is on ‘fashion,’ they cater to this market instead of your typical higher-end investment pieces (think Rolex or Patek Philippe). Still, for the price point, it’s tough to deny that you’re getting great quality and luxurious vibes for a better price. @jbwwatches / Instagram Warranty All JBW watches come with a standard 2-year international warranty, along with a validated serial number and “guarantee card” in the box.  Be mindful that warranties generally only cover defects unrelated to physical wear and tear. JBW’s website states the following regarding its warranty: “…does not cover damage caused by accidents, misuse or excessive wear and tear under conditions exceeding the timepieces manufacturer’s water resistance limitations.” The site also mentions that any accessories related to JBW purchases are not covered under the 2-year warranty. You can, however, opt for a “Platinum” extended warranty, extending your base warranty for an additional two years (making it four years in total). This is in addition to offering added perks, such as: Unlimited battery replacements One-time “tune-up/cleaning” One-time strap replacement Free additional links for sizing Warranty-related shipping costs are covered Extended warranties can be added up to 30 days after an initial purchase has been made. Platinum warranties can also vary depending on the price of the watch.  JBW Watches Review JBW Jet Setter—Original  Key Features: Stainless steel (with a variety of finishes) Water-resistant (up to 50 meters/165 feet) Five time-zone capability Swiss quartz movement  26mm band  50mm in diameter 200 ethically sourced diamonds Arguably the most popular watch JBW carries, the Jet Setter is one of the original designs from the company’s early days. Sporting an impressive 200 diamonds and measuring at around 50mm in diameter, this watch is not for the faint of heart.  One of the more standout features of the Jet Setter is its ability to track five time zones, giving the term “Jet Setter” new meaning.  JBW Jet Setter PS Key Features: Stainless steel and gold finishes Water-resistant (up to 50 meters/165 feet) Five time-zone capability Swiss quartz movement  26mm band  52mm in diameter 550 ethically sourced diamonds Suppose the original Jet Setter isn’t quite luxurious enough for your tastes. In that case, the Jet Setter PS (Platinum Series) is JBW’s limited edition version of its best-selling Jet Setter—upping the diamond count to a whopping 550 in total. The sizing and look are almost identical to the original Jet Setter in terms of build. Still, in terms of value, it’s both more exclusive and nearly triple the number of diamonds compared to the base model.  While significantly more expensive, this piece caters to those looking for something leaning more towards an investment piece, clearly reflected (no pun intended) in the price. JBW Phantom 10-Year  Key Features: Three stainless steel finishes Water-resistant (up to 50 meters/165 feet) Day; Dual Time \u0026 24 Hour With Date Japanese quartz movement  30mm band  42mm in diameter 196 ethically sourced diamonds While a bit more subdued than other pieces from JBW, the Phantom 10-Year is a reimagining of the original Phantom model. The watch is still sporting close to 200 diamonds but opting for a leather strap for a bit of contrast. The Phantom 10-Year is undoubtedly a unique design, and even though it may not be quite as iced-out as something like the Jet Setter, it makes up for it in uniqueness. If you want a slightly more subtle timepiece with an added level of class thanks to its leather strap, the Phantom 10-Year is worth checking out. JBW Heist Key Features: Three stainless steel plated finishes Water-resistant (up to 50 meters/165 feet) Day; dual time \u0026 24 hours with date Japanese quartz movement  26mm band  45mm in diameter 20 ethically sourced diamonds For those of you looking for harder edges in a JBW watch, The Heist offers an angular case with what you might call ideal proportions.  While far less diamond-heavy than most JBW watches, the Heist still offers a good amount of flash with its asymmetrical dial placement. Coming in at a solid 45mm in diameter, this watch is still perfectly bedazzled but feels distinct enough to stand out, given its unique design and angles.  JBW Echelon PS  Key Features: Stainless steel and gold finishes Water-resistant (up to 50 meters/165 feet) Day; time \u0026 24 hours with date Swiss quartz movement  22mm band  41mm in diameter 570 ethically sourced diamonds; 1 ruby The Echelon is one of JBW’s classiest pieces, with a tonneau-shaped case and the addition of a radiant ruby on the crown (on top of the 570 diamonds, of course). The versatility in styling for the Echelon should be noted, as it’s subtle enough to be worn on most occasions while getting equal attention from male and female buyers.  This watch is perfect for those looking for a versatile, limited edition piece, as it’s part of JBW’s “Platinum” series. The added ruby does just enough to set it apart from other JBW timepieces.  Final Verdict: Are JBW Watches Worth It? JBW has undoubtedly found its place in the watch industry. From its humble roots in 2008, they now offer unique enough, eye-catching styles to be worth consideration—particularly for those in their target audience.  They have several striking, diamond-studded pieces—with natural diamonds—at a fraction of the cost of other brands and do so with a decent amount of transparency.  All in all, if you’re looking for something to grab attention with a noticeable glisten, JBW might be an excellent choice to consider. And while its pieces aren’t typically of the investment variety, they certainly do their part in aiming to provide options for the fashion-conscious buyer. Whether JBW watches are worth it to you personally is a matter of perspective, but we hope that this review provides a solid foundation for you to determine if the cost and quality are worth it in your eyes. FAQs About JBW Watches Are JBW watches fake? While there may be imitations on the market, authentic JBW watches are, in fact, real—specifically, from a material standpoint. Be mindful of where you purchase your JBW diamond watch, though, as the internet is full of imitators in any given industry. Are the JBW watches diamonds of good quality? Whether or not JBW diamonds are of good quality depends on your standards. That said, its timepieces typically use melee diamonds, which, while real, are often smaller in size and not the highest quality diamond available on the market. Who owns JBW watches? JBW watches is owned by its founders, Amir and Shabeena Meghani. They are 3rd generation watch industry entrepreneurs and started JBW in Dallas, Texas, in 2008. Where are JBW watches made? Like many brands, JBW manufactures its watches in China and sells them in several different countries worldwide.
