If you take a look inside the modern man’s bathroom cabinet, you’ll probably find enough products to moisturize a small army. Vain creatures, these 21st-century chaps. But while most are happy to sort out their skin, shaving, and scent routines to a religious degree, there is a whole category of grooming that’s often overlooked: hair care, and more specifically, devoting time to finding the best shampoo for men. It’s not surprising. Beyond what pomade helps coif the perfect quiff, there’s so little information available, making it frustrating to even attempt to look for the right men’s shampoo. What was wrong with your 14-year-old self’s 2-in-1 body and hair wash? A lot, unless looking like a greasy teenager is what you want (note: you don’t). In reality, you should pick products suited to your hair, just like you’d pick the right tie knot for your collar. While we could dive into micellar waters, milks, masks, serums, oils and treatments for hair, it pays to start with the basics: in this case, the best shampoo for men, based on your unique hair type. How To Pick The Right Shampoo Shampoo comes in many forms to address all manner of hair types and issues, so picking one for your men’s skincare kit is a bespoke process, one that requires you to analyze your locks much in the same way you would your face. “Pick a shampoo based on your hair condition and texture,” says Kelly May, a senior hairstylist at the award-winning Neville salon in London’s Belgravia. “If your hair is colored, opt for a color-enriching shampoo. If it runs oily, a clarifying shampoo is ideal. Similarly, if your hair is dry or brittle, opt for a hydrating shampoo and definitely a conditioner.” Sounds fairly basic, but if your hair doesn’t have any obvious symptoms, or you’re not using specific products that you need to wash out (for example gels, men’s hair mousse, pomade or sea salt spray), it’s worth asking a professional who can give you a well-informed assessment and recommend the best shampoo for your specific head of hair. Best Shampoo For Men Best All-in-One: Pantene Pro-V Classic Clean 3 in 1 Shampoo, Conditioner \u0026 Treatment Ah, the classic 2-in-1. Once loved, then scorned and now wistfully longed for by guys needing to save space in the gym bag. Luckily for us all, Pantene has given the formula an adult upgrade, bringing the dual-action cleanser into triple-action territory. A men’s shampoo, conditioner \u0026 treatment all in one, it’s also a godsend for frequent flyers. Buy Now Best For Dandruff: Head \u0026 Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care Anti-Dandruff Shampoo For anyone who applies heavy styling aids like wax or gel, this cult-classic dandruff shampoo from Head \u0026 Shoulders is the definition of a bathroom essential. Fortified with eucalyptus extract, it works to remove any lingering product at the end of the day, preventing inflammation, soothing irritation and reducing dandruff for flake-free hair. Buy Now Best Men’s Shampoo For Thick Hair: Living Proof No Frizz Shampoo Thick hair can look and feel heavy, usually suffering from dryness and resulting in a frizz-frenzy. God forbid humidity gets involved; then you end up looking like an electrocuted version of Jon Snow. The trick is to pick a shampoo for thick hair that is light and conditioning (like this one from Living Proof, which was worked on by biotech scientists), so it smoothes without making your hair even heavier. Buy Now Best Hair Color Shampoo: Aesop Classic Shampoo Dyeing your hair is just a chemical reaction, one that is safe but not exactly stable. Colored hair, like regular hair, is exposed to all kinds of environmental aggressors – sunlight, saltwater, pollution – all of which can degrade your new hue. Aesop’s Color Protection Shampoo shields against those nasty elements, while also softening and supporting your ‘do. Buy Now Best Shampoo For Grey Hair: Pantene Silver Expressions, Purple Shampoo and Hair Toner It’s back! Care for your silver hair with the same Pantene Pro-V Silver Expressions Shampoo you know and love, now with a fresh new look. This paraben-free and silicone-free purple shampoo brighten and correct gray, white, and silver hair to bring back its original look and tone. But how? Thanks to its purple pigment, it’s able to neutralize the yellow tones your hair absorbs from the world around it. Buy Now Best Shampoo For Dry Scalp: Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo Scalp issues are generally caused by irritating ingredients in your existing hair products and even the hard-water you use to wash it with. Take a step back from the hairspray and reach for this scalp treatment from Swedish shampoo brand Sachajuan, which contains a host of anti-fungal, anti-irritating and naturally hydrating ingredients. It’s like a face mask, but for your scalp – and a must for shower caddies everywhere. Buy Now Best Shampoo For Thinning Hair: Kiehl’s Rice \u0026 Wheat Volumizing Shampoo Though a thick, creamy shampoo might feel like it’s returning a balding head to its glory days, the opposite is actually true. Instead, look for a shampoo for thinning hair that has a lightweight formula and doesn’t weight down hair or leave any residue. Kiehl’s Volumizing Shampoo does just that, replenishing lifeless locks for a fuller appearance. Buy Now Best Shampoo for Afro Hair: Charlotte Mensah Manketti Oil Shampoo Charlotte Mensah is a bit of a legend in the world of haircare, having poured her quarter decade’s experience working with afro hair into a great product range. A little denser than Asian or Caucasian hair, afro locks benefit from a shampoo almost akin to a conditioner to make it supple and easy to manage. Buy Now Best Shampoo For Dry Hair: Malin + Goetz Moisturizing Shampoo So rich and creamy you’d consider eating it with a spoon (don’t do that). This moisturizing shampoo from Malin + Goetz, designed specifically for dry hair, will instantly load up damaged or brittle strands with fortifying amino acids and vitamin B5. It smells like a dream, too. Buy Now Best Shampoo For Curly Hair: Aveda Be Curly Shampoo If you’ve got curls, embrace them and trust that most other guys are already jealous. Ever the pioneer in haircare, Aveda has developed a shampoo that defines curly hair with a wheat protein and organic aloe blend that expands when the hair is wet and retracts when the hair is dry – calming frizz and upping shine. Buy Now Best-Smelling Men’s Shampoo: Rahua Classic Shampoo The story of this luxurious yet sustainable best smelling shampoo from New York-based brand Rahua (pronounced ra–wa) is almost as good as the smell. Its ingredients are locally harvested by tribes in the Amazonian rainforest before being blended with a touch of aged wood to deepen the scent. It’s the kind of shampoo to reach for if you want your hair to smell like an old writing bureau, in the best way. Buy Now Best Shampoo Bar: Christophe Robin Hydrating Shampoo Bar There are a few great reasons to pick a shampoo bar over a traditional bottle. Chiefly: it travels well (no need to include it in your liquids allowance), lasts longer and is a more environmentally-friendly option than a plastic bottle. Apply Christophe Robin’s all-natural one to the scalp and work up a lather with a good massage for an easy, ethical wash. Buy Now Best For Everyday: Viviscal Man Full Force Fortifying Shampoo Full Force Fortifying Shampoo by Viviscal Man effectively cleanses and fortifies hair, leaving it dense and strong. It has Ana:Tel™ complex to prevent hair loss, biotin to thicken the hair fiber, keratin for its smoothing capabilities, and zinc to strengthen the hair fiber from within. Because of this, we recommend Viviscal as the best shampoo for men who want to stop hair loss and strengthen hair fibers from within. All hair types are suitable, including dry, damaged, colored, thin, and weakened hair. Buy Now Best For Oily Hair: L’Oréal Professionel Serie Expert Pure Resource Shampoo Oily hair is often the result of product build-up, so go easy on the dry shampoo, mate. If the damage is already done, you’ll need a super-strength shampoo to get rid of it. Look no further than L’Oreal’s Professionnel Serie powerhouse, a shampoo that tackles not only the muck but also any hard-water residue that might remain in the follicles. Use this two or three times a week for hair to rival Chris Hemsworth. Buy Now Best For Hair Loss: Korres Natural Magnesium And Wheat Protein Shampoo It’s a cruel fact of life that hair loss is primarily a genetic trait, a trait that is notoriously difficult to overcome. While there are options in the world of surgical aesthetics (hair transplants, plasma injections, etc.), it’s worth starting with one of the best shampoos for men. Korres uses a multi-mineral combination of calcium, magnesium, manganese and zinc to restore energy into cells in order for them to do their best work. Buy Now Best Natural Shampoo: Mauli Rituals Grow Strong Shampoo A brand that’s part of the ancient Ayurvedic health care tradition practiced in India, Mauli Rituals recently entered the haircare market with knockout success. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill rosewater natural shampoo; it contains a heady blend of botanicals including turmeric, frankincense, argan and cedarwood, all serving to remove impurities, stimulate circulation and heat-damaged strands. It’s a natural shampoo perfect for long or short hair with scientific strength. Buy Now FAQs About Shampoo for Men How often should you shampoo your hair? Should you shampoo your hair every day? Every week? Every month? There are so many different opinions surrounding this one that get spouted all the time. For most, the answer is simple. “Two to three times a week should do it,” says May. “If you work in labour, are a chef or use a generous amount of product, then up it to every day.” In the case of the latter, make sure the shampoo you use is light and hydrating, otherwise frequent washes may strip the scalp of its natural oils and lead to dandruff, dry hair and general life descent. What’s the difference between shampoo and conditioner? No, it’s not a case of snake oil; there really is a difference between shampoo and conditioner. “Shampoo will open the hair cuticle and cleanse,” says May, “while a conditioner will seal the cuticle and add shine to your hair.” Think of it like a good buff and polish at the garage; one for getting rid of the dirt and debris that accumulates on the surface, and one for a Goodwood-worthy gleam. For a truly high-shine finish, take the time to massage the head, which stimulates circulation to the scalp and allows active ingredients to absorb fully. What are the bad ingredients in shampoo? There are a few ingredients in the world of hair that remain a bone of contention among stylist and scientists. The term ‘paraben-free’, for example, has appeared on grooming products for several few years now, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still exist. In fact, many haircare companies use them despite their link with breast cancer (and yes, that includes man boobs). Sulphates like sodium laurel sulphate can also irritate the scalp, resulting in brittleness, eczema and dandruff. These are inexpensive detergents that help create a lathering effect but are also used in insecticide and even engine cleaner. So you decide.
