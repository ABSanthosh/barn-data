Industry leaders Gap Inc. and H\u0026M Group have committed to utilizing recycled materials as they enter the market. However, the road to a multi-billion-dollar recycling business is still rocky. The innovative materials face challenges such as cheaper new-material alternatives and a lack of support for anti-plastic production measures in Saudi Arabia and Russia. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Quannah Chasinghorse is making way for fellow Indigenous modelsQuannah Chasinghorse began modeling in 2020 when a Calvin Klein scout saw photographs of her advocacy work.
