The annual fashion event celebrated the Costume Institute’s newest exhibition —  “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” inspired by Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity by Monica L. Miller — and saw Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams join Anna Wintour as co-chairs, as well as Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Janelle Monáe, Tyla and more as part of the host committee.Following the night, we turned our attention to the new fashion and beauty launches making waves this month.

Revived bags include the first-ever Puzzle, a geometric mix of pink shades from the spring/summer 2015 men’s collection; the Anime, a bag with a manga-style illustration from the spring/summer 2016 men’s collection; the Cloud, spring/summer 2017’s dreamy sky print; the Varsity, a whimsical bag with sporty details, like an undone shoelace pattern, from the fall/winter 2018 men’s precollection; and 2019’s Plumeria, which featured 3-D flower motifs modeled after Hawaiian quilts. The new Puzzle, meanwhile, is dubbed the Confetti and is covered in colorful rounds of leather in delightful candy colors. The Loewe Puzzle 10 Collection will be available to shop in select stores.Chanel Eau SplendideA new season often calls for switching up your scent, and Chanel’s latest fragrance couldn’t have come at a better time. Joining the colorful Chance cohort, Splendide’s lilac liquid is both fruity and floral, blending sparkling raspberry with powdery violet. Its heart notes include sweet rose geranium, some of which was even grown in Chanel’s perfumery garden in the South of France. Notes of cedar and white musk round out the fragrance. This is a spring scent if there ever was one.Shop now at ChanelChanel Chance Eau Splendide, $, available at ChanelReformation x Jimmy FairlyReuniting for a second collaboration, French eyewear brand Jimmy Fairly has teamed up with Reformation for another round of statement sunglasses.
