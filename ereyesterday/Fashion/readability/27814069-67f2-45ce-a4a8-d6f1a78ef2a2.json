  "description": "I first laid my eyes on the Reformation Cary jeans at the Soho store in New York City. It was the Chesapeake Studded pair, which is currently the second most popular iteration of the perfectly baggy denim. I tried them on alongside my best friend, and we both popped out of our dressing rooms (which are decidedly luxe and technologically advanced, just in case you've never been to a Ref shop before) equally delighted and shocked. We have completely different body types, but we loved the subtle slouch, give, and swingy feel of the jeans just the same. One thing led to another, and I ended up enlisting three fellow PS editors to test them via our Vetted series. Could these jeans be universally flattering? I wondered. We have completely different body types, but we loved the subtle slouch, give, and swingy feel of the jeans just the same. Alexandra Avdey, Vice President of Buying at Reformation, shared that the Cary was first launched around the time customers started shifting away from a skinny fit, and the silhouette was loosely inspired by the bestselling Mason, a pooling trouser with a similar leg opening. After the high-rise Cary was launched in the brand's signature Colorado wash, it exploded in popularity and naturally progressed to a low-rise version in September 2024. Today, the low-rise in Ondine - which one of our editors tested! - is Reformation's top-selling denim style. The low-rise in Cleary (the pair I personally own) comes in at number three. \"The Cary is designed to fit like your favorite pair of well-loved vintage jeans, fitted through the waist, and relaxed at the hips and thigh with a wide leg. Go for your true size or even size up for an ultra slouchy fit. These aren't meant to be super tailored so if you don't want a slightly oversized fit, opt for a straighter style,\" Avdey says. Like most of the eco-conscious retailer's denim, the Cary is made with regeneratively grown cotton and TENCEL™ lyocell, with the fiber makeup varying slightly across SKUs; can be recycled via RefRecycling when customers wish to retire them; and should be washed on cold and left to air dry to preserve fit and color. The Cary has a 32-inch inseam, which wasn't exactly ideal for our more petite editors; however, Reformation conveniently offers free in-store alterations to solve that problem.

I knew as soon as I laid eyes on this Cleary shade of denim that it was exactly what I was looking for. From the swingy shape to the true blue wash, they help me achieve undeniable '90s vibes. I even styled mine with the incredibly popular Clara Crew Cardigan in Black Pointelle ($198) for an effortless Ref-babe combination. I will say, I had to cut a minimum of three inches off the bottom of these jeans — something I'm used to doing for all my denim in a pinch — and I don't mind the ragged, distressed look of the hem. Thankfully, snipping fabric didn't affect the shape of the pant leg since the Cary is significantly wider at the bottom. As someone who's 5'1\", I do wish the Cary came in a petite variation — but in my opinion, that's all that's missing here. Everything else — from the comfort to the subtle stretch to the eco-friendly production method — is truly top notch when it comes to nailing the perfect baggy jean.\" — Sarah Wasilak, associate content director, Shopping Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Yerin KimReformation Cary Low Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in OndineReformation Cary Low Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in Ondine ($168) \"Low-rise jeans are typically way out of my comfort zone, but the Cary jeans might have changed my mind. Despite their lower rise and slouchy fit, I was pleasantly surprised by how structured and polished these looked once I tried them on. The jeans fit more mid-rise on my frame, but the waistline was certainly lower than what I was used to. I love the relaxed yet streamlined fit, which made these jeans also feel dressy enough for nighttime, especially when paired with a belt. Aside from the waistline, I found this wash in particular so easy to style, whether with a plain white T-shirt and flats or a dressy blazer and heeled boots. I know from experience, though, that Reformation pants run long, so if you're under 5'8\", know that you'll likely have to get these hemmed or cut. (I'm 5'2\" and I had to cut off a considerable few inches.)\" — Yerin Kim, editor, Features Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Taylor AndrewsReformation Cary Stretch High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in BlackReformation Cary Stretch High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in Black ($168) \"I absolutely understand the hype behind the Reformation Cary jeans. Although jeans tend to fit me wonky — I'm never the same jean size at any store I shop — the Cary Stretch High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg jeans were a total win. For one, they're incredibly flattering. They are high-waisted and have a wide leg, which is the perfect recipe for accentuating my bottom half. But they don't just look good, they feel good, too. I could sit, stand, eat, and breathe in these jeans without a problem. As a 5'8\" girlie, they are also the perfect length. When I wore heels, they were only about an inch or two above the ground. (But for those of you on the shorter side, you may need to hem them or at least be OK embracing the puddle jeans look.) In addition to the long-leg look they gave me, what really stood out is that the jeans kept their shape, even after I wore them for hours. The jeans didn't stretch out or get those annoying crease lines from sitting, which is pretty unheard of. At first, I thought the jeans seemed a little bulky in the crotch area — I even wondered if I needed to size down. But once I embraced the looser, relaxed fit, I ended up loving the look. Lesson learned: not everything is meant to be super tight on all parts of your body.\" — Taylor Andrews, editor, Balance Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Lena FeltonReformation Cary High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in OndineReformation Cary High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans in Ondine ($168) \"I'm a bit of a high-waisted jeans obsessive. They're my daily uniform, so I've tried tons of different brands, and I have to say that these Reformation Cary jeans over deliver. They hit well above my belly button and are loose through the leg — a very trendy look that makes me feel Gen-Z (I'm a lame Millennial, hence why I haven't yet ventured into the low-rise category). They're structured but somehow still feel soft, and in the Ondine wash (a gorgeous dark blue), I can easily dress them up for a nice dinner out or down for a stroll around my block. The only downside is that I'm short (5'2\"), and these were LONG — I ended up getting them hemmed by a tailor, but you can also go to a Reformation store for free alterations. Very worth it in my book, as I've been reaching for these jeans nonstop.\" — Lena Felton, senior content director Rating: ★★★★★Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of Shopping at PS.

Despite their lower rise and slouchy fit, I was pleasantly surprised by how structured and polished these looked once I tried them on. The jeans fit more mid-rise on my frame, but the waistline was certainly lower than what I was used to. I love the relaxed yet streamlined fit, which made these jeans also feel dressy enough for nighttime, especially when paired with a belt. Aside from the waistline, I found this wash in particular so easy to style, whether with a plain white T-shirt and flats or a dressy blazer and heeled boots. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eI know from experience, though, that Reformation pants run long, so if you\u0026#39;re under 5\u0026#39;8\u0026#34;, know that you\u0026#39;ll likely have to get these hemmed or cut.

Although jeans tend to fit me wonky — I\u0026#39;m never the same jean size at any store I shop — the Cary Stretch High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg jeans were a total win. For one, they\u0026#39;re incredibly flattering. They are high-waisted and have a wide leg, which is the perfect recipe for accentuating my bottom half. But they don\u0026#39;t just look good, they \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e good, too.

When I wore heels, they were only about an inch or two above the ground. (But for those of you on the shorter side, you may need to hem them or at least be OK embracing the puddle jeans look.) In addition to the long-leg look they gave me, what really stood out is that the jeans kept their shape, even after I wore them for hours. The jeans didn\u0026#39;t stretch out or get those annoying crease lines from sitting, which is pretty unheard of. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eAt first, I thought the jeans seemed a little bulky in the crotch area — I even wondered if I needed to size down.
