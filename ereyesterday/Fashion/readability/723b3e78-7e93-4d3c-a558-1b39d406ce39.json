  "description": "If you're a fan of Netflix's \"Love Is Blind,\" then you may be curious about the engagement rings, which are either chosen on set or brought in (Kyle Abrams presented his mom's ring to Shaina Hurley during season two, for example). Knowing that on \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette,\" the jewelry is entirely provided by Neil Lane, you have to wonder how much shopping the men on \"LIB\" could possibly be getting done outside of the pods while they're holed up from the outside world. What's more, if you're looking closely, you may notice similarities in some of the women's engagement rings. In fact, in season one, it appeared Lauren Speed, Jessica Batten, and Amber Pike wore identical rings following their proposals. According to \"LIB\" production company, Kinetic Content, all the men are presented with dozens of rings to choose from (Netflix said that in seasons four and five, they were all courtesy of Bridal Rings Co.), unless they brought their own. \"Whatever they choose, we pay for. Whatever we pay for, they keep, regardless of engagement ending,\" a Kinetic representative says. And even though you might recognize similar elements on some designs - like diamond carat size, band embellishment, and setting - no two styles are exactly the same. Kinetic even shared that in season two, the men proposing discussed their choices together, so the rings felt unique to each recipient. Of course, there are fans who have tweeted that they believe the women should be able to choose their preferred style before heading into the pods. That became a major issue in season two, when Mallory Zapata ended up with a silver ring picked by Salvador Perez, instead of her preferred choice of gold. Perhaps the producers will find a way for both contestants to join the ring-selection process in future seasons. In the meantime, keep reading for everything to know about the \"Love Is Blind\" engagement rings, including the similarities, the payment, and the process by which they're chosen.",
