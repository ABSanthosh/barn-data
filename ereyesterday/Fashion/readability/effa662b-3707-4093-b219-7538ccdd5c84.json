  "description": "Taylor Swift's presence at NFL games has done more than just bring a new legion of fans to the sport; it's also given fashion girlies (like myself) an excuse to tune in each week for a glimpse at the star's commanding game-day looks. Last weekend, Swift attended the 2025 AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills, decked out in a head-to-toe Louis Vuitton ensemble that offered a grunge, Blair Waldorf-inspired take on TikTok's loud-luxury trend - perhaps a callback to the Y2K aesthetic she sported throughout her original \"Reputation\" era? (Cue the speculation of Swifties everywhere.) Keeping in theme with the red and black color palette of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce's, Super Bowl-bound team, the pop star paired a logo Louis Vuitton hoodie and beanie with a preppy mini skirt, lace-up boots, and burgundy Calzedonia 50 Denier Total Comfort Soft Touch Tights ($15) - which perfectly matched Swift's red lips (because of course). The pop star-approved opaque tights are made from a polyamide material that's thick, without being too warm - making them a great wardrobe essential to have on hand year-round, but especially come winter. And with over 10 different colorways to shop - 3897 Dark Red being Swift's shade of choice - you can easily mix the colorful tights into your game-day wardrobe or Super Bowl outfit, regardless of the team you're rooting for. While the under-$20 accessory is one of the more affordable options in the musician's most recent game-day outfit, Swift has incorporated plenty of budget-friendly pieces into her past WAG looks - including a $35 knit beanie and custom New Balance sneakers.
