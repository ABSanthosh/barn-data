She started working at Who What Wear UK in the summer of 2022, where she was hired to lead all branded content for the UK site.

A self-confessed internet obsessive, she loves all facets of content creation—be it writing, filming, art directing or styling—and revels in collaborating with brands to help harness their product and tell their story. After graduating from University of Liverpool in American Studies, she travelled around North and South America before moving to London to pursue her career as a fashion journalist. Before she landed her position at Who What Wear, she was a freelance writer and content consultant, writing for Polyester, Screenshot, Marie Claire, Refinery29 and Culture Trip, reporting on everything from internet culture, vintage shopping across the world, sustainability and sex work. Adding to this, she has also held editor positions at FLANNELS.com, BURO., Koibird and SHOP Magazine.
