The film, directed by James Mangold, traces Mr. Dylan’s arrival in New York as a teenager and his ascent through the Greenwich Village music scene.Mr. Chalamet sang live in the movie and said he had spent five years working with a harmonica coach to nail the singer’s mannerisms. Although his dark hair is tousled to Dylanesque proportions in the film, on Friday, during red carpet photos, it appeared blond and straight, sticking out from under a turquoise beanie.He was channeling Mr. Dylan’s look from a Sundance Film Festival appearance in 2003 for the premiere of the film “Masked and Anonymous,” which the musician starred in and wrote with Larry Charles. The look startled Mr. Chalamet’s co-star Monica Barbaro, who plays the folk singer Joan Baez.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
