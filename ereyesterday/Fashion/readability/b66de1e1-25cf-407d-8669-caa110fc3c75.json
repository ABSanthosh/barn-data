Conceived by the scenographer Willo Perron, the designer of Lady Gaga’s Monster Ball tour and of the floating stage for Rihanna’s 2023 Super Bowl half-time show, the catwalk was installed in the giant wrought-iron nave of the Grand Palais – itself a statement of Chanel’s status in French culture.The catwalk was designed by Willo Perron.

Hair was loose or in slicked-back buns, and each model wore a red lip picked to suit their skin tone.Jennie Kim and Kylie Jenner at the show.

The technical sophistication of the haute couture ateliers was showcased in lace embroidered for a trompe l’oeil tweed effect, and tiered chiffon gowns of gravity-defying lightness. Several of the low-riding skirts came with satin blouses attached, for those clients who prefer not to flash bare skin under a cropped jacket.The youthful spin on Chanel chimed with Taylor Swift’s recent choice of a short Chanel tweed playsuit, worn for an NFL game in Kansas last week. The actor Mikey Madison, who is being wooed by major fashion houses as she prepares to appear as a nominee at the Oscars in March, chose a short white Chanel tweed suit for the Toronto film festival’s red carpet in October.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionBlazy, whose appointment was announced in December, is only the fourth designer to have held the creative director post at Chanel, after Coco herself, Karl Lagerfeld, and Viard.He will take up the role in the next few months, but due to the long lead times of large brands, will not show his first Chanel collection until October.
