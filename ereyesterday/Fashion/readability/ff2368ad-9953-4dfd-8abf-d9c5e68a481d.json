  "description": "If you were already toying with the idea of braving the naked dress trend, catching a glimpse of Halle Bailey and Emily Ratajkowski sporting the look at the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar party may just seal the deal for you. As someone who has thrown a birthday party for myself solely so that I could have a reason to wear a naked dress, I get it. When I scrolled past a reel of model Chloe Lecareux wearing Onarin's Ms. Hearts bustier and fishtail skirt a few months ahead of my birthday month, the wheels started spinning. By the end of the week, I had at least five different restaurants in mind and a guest list of my closest friends at the ready. Maybe it was the Taurus in me, but I was hell-bent on pulling off this set - and it was only after I ordered the look that I really began to process just how sheer the silk-chiffon fabric actually was. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. \"Welp, I guess I'm trying this whole naked dress thing,\" I thought to myself as I pulled up Commando's site to track down the right underwear. In preparation, I placed an order for the classic control thong and shaping brief, unsure just how cheeky I might go in this decidedly revealing, ultrafitted ensemble. The Stolen Stores team assured me that the retail site's in-house made-to-measure team would develop a personalized size for me, so the co-ords would fit me just right. But at the end of the day, they were still see-through. People were going to see my underwear, and I was probably going to feel pretty naked. Truthfully, I thought this all to be a fun, timely experiment, especially since the naked dress trend has become standard among celebrities and mere mortals alike. Sheer fabrics are a common detail, and I think there's something to be said for having the confidence to show off your body - however much or little you like. When the Onarin pieces finally arrived, I abandoned my doubt and slipped into the outfit, only to find that both separates were a little snug. (Quick tip: if you're already thinking about ordering the set, add an inch to your usual measurements upon placing your order.) Luckily, the exchange for a new, customized size was coordinated in more than enough time for my birthday dinner. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. Ahead, see how I ended up accessorizing my look and read my final review of the Onarin naked dress.",

I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. Ahead, see how I ended up accessorizing my look and read my final review of the Onarin naked dress.Cristal RojasHow to Style the Naked DressOutfit: Onarin Ms. Heart Bustier ($389), Onarin Classic Fishtail Maxi Skirt ($259), Maidenform Shaping Brief ($16, originally $23), and Nina Amorie Minaudière Bag ($30, originally $78) A few days before my birthday, when accessories were finalized — Nina had the perfect heart-shaped clutch with rhinestones to play up the bust and Zara a luxurious, strappy velvet heel (sold out) — I excitedly showed my boyfriend the look. While he loved it (as he does everything I wear), he did offer the comment, \"That's really see-through,\" after seeing the model on the product page in a G-string. The man was simply stating facts. Moments later, I found myself on Amazon ordering a thicker high-waisted brief by Maidenform, just in case I ended up wanting more coverage the night of. Let's just say I'm very glad I did. For naked-dress first-timers who are slightly nervous about the big reveal like I was, I can promise that panties with more fabric will offer security and structure. I tested out the skirt with all three undergarments, and the Maidenform silhouette looked the most proportional and modest as a foundational layer. Finally, be sure to wear a shoe you're comfortable in. I tend to play by the following rule: when you're skeptical about one part of your outfit, leave the rest up to familiarity.Cristal RojasNaked Dress Trend ReviewUltimately, I received compliments all night long on the Onarin naked dress, and I never for an instant felt too exposed or awkward. While I do wish I could have graced my party guests with a booty as famous as Emrata's or Halle Bailey's, that is honestly my only regret. As to whether or not I'd try out the naked trend in the wild again, the answer is as clear as day (just like my underwear) — sure, why not?-Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of Shopping at PS.
