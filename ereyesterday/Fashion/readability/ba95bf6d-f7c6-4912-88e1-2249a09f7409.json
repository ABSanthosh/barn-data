  "description": "Heading off on a trip and don’t know what to wear? Whether you’re venturing to the airport, the train station, or in the car, one thing’s for sure: Comfort is non-negotiable. Sure, trusty leggings and cozy sweats are MVPs, but, sometimes, you want to look a little more “effortless jet-setter” and a little less “just rolled out of bed.” Enter: travel pants. When curating our list of the best travel pants, we held them to sky-high standards: They needed to be versatile enough to wear straight off the plane and into whatever adventure awaits, comfy enough for the bizarre yoga-esque positions you’ll find yourself in while attempting to sleep on a long-haul flight, and stylish enough to pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe (and avoid the dreaded overpacking guilt). Bonus points to pants with practical perks like wrinkle resistance, technical fabrics, and — the holy grail — pockets.Meet our 29 favorite travel pants below. Once you experience the magic of sweat-wicking, breezy, and polished bottoms that don’t scream “athleisure overload,” we promise you’ll never look back.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
