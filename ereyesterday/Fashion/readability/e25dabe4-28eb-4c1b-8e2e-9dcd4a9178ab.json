Mr. Kuzma, 29, a forward for the Milwaukee Bucks, proposed to Ms. Harlow, 30, on Feb. 13.According to Vogue, he chartered a private plane to Turks and Caicos Islands for the long weekend, returning to a special spot where they had vacationed together in 2022. The plane was decorated with roses, balloons, chocolate and Champagne, but Ms. Harlow didn’t see a proposal coming, instead thinking it was a grand romantic gesture for Valentine’s Day.He read her a poem he’d written, which ended with the line: “Will you be my wife?” She said yes.The ring — an “8.5-carat oval-cut engagement ring with two baguette stones on the side,” per Vogue — was designed by Mr. Kuzma. He told the magazine: “I just wanted to draw a picture of what I felt resembled her — something that was elegant, but very timeless and simplistic at the same time.”After their plane touched down, Mr. Kuzma surprised Ms. Harlow yet again. Her family, Mr. Kuzma’s family, as well as some friends, were waiting at a private villa for them to celebrate their engagement all together.“I’ve dreamed of this moment ever since I was a little girl, and it was even more beautiful than I could have imagined,” Ms. Harlow told The New York Times in an emailed quote sent by a representative. “I’m overflowing with love for him and so excited to start this incredible new chapter of our lives.”By Wednesday evening, the couple’s joint announcement post on Instagram had more than 900,000 likes and thousands of comments. Stars of the entertainment, fashion and sports worlds and beyond commented, sending their congratulations to the couple.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
