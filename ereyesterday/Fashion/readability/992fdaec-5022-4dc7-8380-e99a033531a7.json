  "description": "In all the hype leading up to the 2025 Super Bowl, who could have predicted that the biggest winner of last night's game would be... Kendrick Lamar's jeans? That's right: fresh off the heels of his five Grammy wins at the 67th Grammy Awards, Lamar took the stage for Apple's Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday, Feb. 9, with a headlining performance that included hit songs from the rapper's expansive catalog - including everything from \"Humble\" to \"All the Stars\" featuring SZA and yes, even his infamous Drake diss track, \"Not Like Us\" (currently on repeat today). While the musician's Halftime performance was legendary in its own right (we're still not over that Serena Williams cameo!), Lamar's outfit choice for the spectacle proved to inspire just as much discourse online - specifically his oversize flare jeans. The washed denim pants - which I was able to identify as a now sold-out $1,300 Celine style - weren't quite as flamboyant as a '70s-esque bell bottom, nor were they as tame as a classic bootcut style; but the throwback jeans still felt quintessentially Y2K, with a light wash coloring and exaggerated silhouette that flared at the knees. As a self-proclaimed jean girlie, I love how Lamar's Super Bowl outfit felt like a casual departure from the glitzy performance looks of year's past, and one that signaled the return of retro denim - because of course Kendrick Lamar would be the one to make bell bottoms cool again. Whether you're looking to replicate Lamar's Super Bowl ensemble or simply want a way to tap into the quiet-luxury trend, I scoured the internet and rounded up a few of the best flare jeans for women - with styles inspired by the star's viral denim.",
