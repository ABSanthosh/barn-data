  "description": "When it’s too hot for jeans but you still want to wear pants, linen is the answer. Light, breathable, and blessedly low-maintenance, linen pants are the rare summer essential that checks every box: They’re comfortable in triple-digit heat, instantly pulled-together, and look just as good with a bikini top as they do with a blazer. Whether you’re braving a humid subway platform, wandering a weekend farmers’ market, or dressing for a European summer, linen pants are your one-and-done solution.This season, the category is quietly thriving. You’ll find exaggerated barrel-leg silhouettes as the heat-proof answer to everyone’s favorite jean, cargo styles with a utilitarian feel, and striped pairs that tap directly into the sardine girl summer and fisherman trends. Meanwhile, wide-legs — from drawstring and low-slung to sharply pleated — are everywhere, anchoring everything from office looks to beach outfits with equal ease. Black linen makes the case for warm-weather minimalism, while crisp white remains a forever staple for those devoted to versatile neutrals.Ahead, we’ve gathered the standout linen pants to wear now — tailored, slouchy, coastal-coded, and everything in between. The best part? They’re as cool as they look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Linen Barrel Pants This voluminous silhouette has touched all our wardrobe favorites — from jeans to travel pants and loungewear — and now it’s taking shape in linen fabrications. The result? Structured ease that feels trend-forward and heat-wave approved. Linen Cargo Pants Linen gives this utility classic a lighter, breezier feel. Oversized pockets and drawstring waists make these cargo styles equal parts functional and fresh. Wide-Leg Linen Pants Wide-leg linen pants are the silhouette of the season, offering ease, movement, and so much comfort. Try a low-slung drawstring style with a ribbed tank, or dress up a pleated pair with an oversized button-down. White Linen Pants Crisp white linen is a forever favorite that works for the office, beach days, and everything in between. Go wide-leg for extra drama or tailored for a polished finish. Linen Striped Pants Stripes are inherently summery, especially when paired with linen and a breezy silhouette. Channel coastal-core with a pair styled alongside raffia accessories and a fisherman sandal. Black Linen Pants If you’re committed to black wardrobe staples, linen is your summer loophole. Lightweight and clean-lined, black linen pants deliver sleek minimalism without the heat. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
