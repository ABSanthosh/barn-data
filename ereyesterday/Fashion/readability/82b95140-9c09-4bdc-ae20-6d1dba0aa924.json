He knew Ms. Silvestro had previously worked as a store manager at Bath \u0026 Body Works. His mother had also worked at one of the chain’s stores near his hometown, Seaford, N.Y.“He was wondering if we had ever worked together,” Ms. Silvestro said. “He seemed so nice.”So nice, in fact, that she hatched a plan while they chatted at the party to set him up with one of her roommates in Astoria, Queens. Dating each other felt like a bad idea to both. “We were starting our careers,” Mr. Kluender said. Neither wanted to navigate the fuzzy rules around an office romance.But that night, Mr. Kluender, who was living with his parents in Seaford, ended up at her Astoria apartment. And not with Ms. Silvestro’s roommate. “We did have a first kiss that night,” Ms. Silvestro said.Ms. Silvestro, 30, grew up in Plainview, N.Y. She has a bachelor’s in philosophy from St. John’s University. Mr. Kluender, 32, has a bachelor’s in business management from Farmingdale State College.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
