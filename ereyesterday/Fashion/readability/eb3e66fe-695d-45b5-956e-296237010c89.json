Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockBorn Rosita Jelmini in Golasecca, in the Varese region of Lombardy, in 1931, Missoni met her husband during a study break in London in the summer of 1948. He was competing in the final of the 4 x 400m hurdles at the Olympic Games and she was learning English at a Hampstead boarding school.After marrying in 1953, the couple established a small knitwear store in Gallarate, north of Milan, before putting down roots in nearby Sumirago, where they built their home and factory.They caused a furore in 1967 when, during a fashion show at the Pitti Palace in Florence, Missoni sent braless models wearing sheer tops down the catwalk, and they were briefly banned from showing there. However, after being championed by the then American Vogue editor, Diana Vreeland, the fashion editor Anna Piaggi, and Joan Burstein, the founder of the British retailer Browns, the couple weathered the storm, and began focusing on their signature knitwear, which became central to the brand’s success.According to the trade journal Women’s Wear Daily, the zigzag patterns were made using raschel machines, which are sometimes used to make swimwear and blankets. “My grandparents had used them to make multicoloured embroidered shawls with big rose patterns and long fringes, all hand-knotted, the kind you throw on lampshades,” Missoni said.The couple’s three children, Vittorio, Luca and Angela, and grandchildren all became integral to the family business, regularly fronting advertisements that were photographed by their long-term collaborator Juergen Teller.In 1996, Angela and Luca took over the creative side while Vittorio became the marketing director and, eventually, the chief executive. Missoni continued to work on the Missoni Home arm of the family business, including after the minority-stake sale of the brand to Fondo Strategico Italiano in 2018.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIn early 2013, Vittorio died in a plane crash, aged 58, and Ottavio died shortly after, in May of the same year, aged 92.A keen traveller, avid collector of art and famous thrift-market devotee, towards the end of her life Missoni regularly invited interior magazines to photograph her Sumirago home, confirming her reputation as one of the world’s most influential tastemakers. In 2022, she told the Observer magazine: “I have had the privilege of living a long life and I take great pleasure in sharing our home.”Missoni is survived by Luca and Angela, her nine grandchildren and their families.",
