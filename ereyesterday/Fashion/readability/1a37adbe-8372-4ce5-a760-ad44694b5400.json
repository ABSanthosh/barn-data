The collection includes a bomber jacket, T-shirt, gym shorts and a hoodie that will be available on Wednesday at 12 p.m. EST. Proceeds from this collection will be donated to organizations and individuals impacted by the recent wildfires in Los Angeles. \"Kendrick performing [at the Super Bowl] is so monumental given his voice on the empowerment of brown and Black people and I love his pure L.A. heart,\" Chavarria told WWD. \"Working with [Lamar] is an important cultural moment for the two of us. We both have an unwavering voice when it comes to our people.\" {WWD/paywalled}Black beauty brand founders urge shoppers not to boycott Target amid diversity rollbacksIn 2021, Target committed to investing more than $2 billion in Black-owned businesses, but the retailer announced on Friday that it's rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the wake of the new Trump administration. This news came as a surprise to many Black beauty founders, but they're urging customers not to boycott the retailer in response and diminish their brands' sales. Maya Smith, co-founder of hair-care brand The Doux, wrote on Instagram: \"We didn't see this coming, and we have no control over these changes. What we do control is how we respond — and that response requires us to think strategically about what it takes to ensure that businesses like ours continue to thrive…The costs of participating in big-box stores are steep, and performance in those spaces can guarantee the survival of the brand, period.\" {Beauty Independent/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesBarbour and Erdem unveil capsule collectionFollowing Barbour and Erdem's Spring 2024 runway collaboration, the two British labels are teaming up again for a five-piece outerwear capsule collection for Spring 2025. The collection combines Erdem's codes of modern femininity with Barbour's practicality and heritage fabrications to create four key outerwear styles: The Beauflower, The Dhalia, The Clover and The Constance. \"I was inspired by the extraordinary Barbour archive, particularly their fabrications and hardware and loved the idea of translating their heritage of practical, utilitarian details and combining it with my language of the feminine,\" Erdem's Creative Director Erdem Moralioglu said in a statement. In an extension to the capsule collection, Erdem and Barbour also collaborated on a Re-Loved initiative where 25 previously-owned Beaufort jackets have been restored with an oversized cord collar and embellished with silver hardware eyelets, which are available to buy exclusively at Harrods. The Barbour x Erdem capsule collection will be available from barbour.com selected retailers in January 2025.
