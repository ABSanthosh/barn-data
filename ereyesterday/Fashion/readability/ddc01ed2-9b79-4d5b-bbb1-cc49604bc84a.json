If income inequality in America ballooned in the 1970s, attention inequality got worse in the 1990s — thanks of course to the internet, but also to reality TV.On “The Real World,” which premiered on MTV in 1992, viewers were invited to surveil the day-to-day of people who were both totally normal and anything but, people finding jobs and facing crushes and doing what 20-somethings do, all while living under one roof. On “Road Rules,” a sister show of sorts that premiered 30 years ago this month, a handful of teens and 20-somethings were dropped into the middle of nowhere in a camper van. There, they performed “challenges” like jumping out of an airplane or spending the night in a supposedly haunted building. The two shows, made by the same production company, essentially ushered in the reality television factory of fame — fleeting and otherwise — as we have come to know if in the decades since.There is something distinctly American about “Road Rules,” possessed of a berserk energy as if it had emerged from a Hollywood brainstorming lunch between Jack Kerouac and Kim Kardashian. It’s just an R.V. full of young people and the open road. Plus some “challenges” that seem like a real-life test of the parental aphorism “If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?” The answer is always yes, so long as the tape is running.Both “The Real World” and “Road Rules” attracted and thrived on a particular personality: obnoxiously authentic. The type of person saying what nobody else will — because it’s rude, offensive, moronic or plainly unnecessary. If that archetype sounds familiar, it’s because reality TV show fame is now actual real-world fame, and we’re living in a world that “Road Rules” made.ImageSean Duffy, at the beginning of a career in the public eye.Credit...MTVImageMr. Duffy, now secretary of transportation under President Trump.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesTheo Von, a cast member on Season 9, is now one of the biggest podcast stars in the world, with a show that frequently ranks in YouTube’s Top 10, reaching millions, and which last year counted President Trump as a guest.

Michael Mizanin, now a wrestling star better known as the Miz, was a cast member of “The Real World” and went on the mash-up once known as the “Real World-Road Rules Challenge.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
