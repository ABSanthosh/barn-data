  "description": "Nik Bentel is the genius designer behind the TikTok-viral pasta bag (which he confirms is his bestselling item to date), and his wheels keep spinning - literally. The Nik Bentel RC Car Bag ($251, originally $295) launched in February and has already outpaced most of the brand's past product drops in terms of day-one performance, according to Bentel himself. \"It's definitely one of our fastest-moving designs,\" he jokes of the statement piece that's part handbag, part remote control car with four-wheel drive. \"What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved?\" Like most of his projects, this accessory is made to get you noticed, which is exactly why I was committed to taking it out on the town for dinner and drinks. Of course, I also love the fact that it's inspired by vintage toy cars, a nod to nostalgia I can definitely get behind. \"My inspiration tends to come from everyday objects that feel overlooked or oddly iconic - things we see all the time but don't usually imagine as wearable or collectible,\" Bentel says, naming Moschino and Chanel as brands that have a similar imaginative approach. \"With the RC Car Handbag, I was thinking about motion and creating a little chaos. What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved? That sparked the idea of taking a remote control car - something playful and nostalgic - and merging it with the functionality of a handbag. It became an object that turns sidewalks into runways.\" I wasn't surprised that the moment I sat down at a bar with my partner for cocktails al fresco on the first truly warm spring day, cheerful onlookers to my left and right begged me to send my bag in motion. They were close enough to notice the wheels and intrigued by the functional object. Needless to say, this was definitely Bentel's intention. \"People love the chaos of it! We've had people racing them in their offices, at galleries, and even just using them as shelf pieces,\" he says, continuing, \"Some carry it, some drive it - and some do both at once. The reactions are usually split between 'Wait . . . it moves?' and 'I've never seen anything like this.' It's been really fun to watch how people interpret and interact with it.\" In just two months, the RC Car Bag has become a beloved piece of art spotted on artists, influencers, and editors alike, from Kitty Lever and Taylor Quitara to Emma Orhun and now even me! Ahead, you can read my full review of the intriguing design and watch it in motion. About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag The bag is crafted from matte black genuine leather with mechanical wheels and a battery powered motor; handheld controller included. The remote control can power the car from up to 30 feet away at 9 mph. The wheels have silver rims and rubberized tread for drifting control. The bag measures 7.25\" x 3\" x 12.5\". AA batteries are included (standard and rechargeable). A limited edition quantity of 300 bags were produced for this project. There's an interior clasp to keep belongings secured, including the remote control while you're carrying it like a handbag. Each piece is handmade, with the bag and remote control weighing just over 1 pound together. What I Like About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag Obviously, this bag is a conversation-starter, which for me makes an accessory worth the splurge. The matte black colorway is versatile while the avant-garde structure of the bag is currently on-trend. Funnily enough, Bentel allowed the shape to be fully dictated by the car itself, or as he describes, \"almost like the bag was hijacking another object's identity.\" While this isn't necessarily a statement piece you'd wear to a wedding, it can complete many casual outfits from athleisure to jeans and a tee. I also love that the wheels are small and subtle - up-close, you can tell the style is much more than just a purse, but from across the room it might as well be any other coveted designer handbag on the market. Finally, all the pieces included are lightweight - the bag weighs 1 pound and 3 ounces when the remote control is stored inside - so it's not like you're lugging around a huge satchel. In fact, the bag and remote control together weigh a lot less than some of the other purses I own. What to Consider Before Buying the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag If you like to keep your belongings protected, note that this bag does not come equipped with any interior pockets and there's no secure closure aside from a thin snap tab that arches over the top. When the remote control is stored inside, there's also not much room for anything else. I personally carried two credit cards, some gum, and hand sanitizer and wouldn't have had room for my chunky keychain (luckily, I was out with my partner who had his own keys to get us back into the apartment). While currently marked down, the bag is also somewhat of an investment being that it's probably not appropriate for every occasion or event on your calendar. That being said, it's important to remember the thought-provoking and somewhat kitschy nature of Nik Bentel's viral pieces - they aren't exactly built for convenience, and that's sort of the point. For a similarly shaped bag without the eccentric twist (aka four-wheel drive), get the look with the Coperni Swipe Leather Top Handle Bag ($710), JW Pei Carly Saddle Bag ($67), Freja Mini Chrystie Bag ($268), Charles \u0026 Keith Perline Sculptural Top Handle Bag ($66), or Mas Laus Asymmetrical Shape Shoulder Bag ($390).

I personally carried two credit cards, some gum, and hand sanitizer and wouldn\u0026#39;t have had room for my chunky keychain (luckily, I was out with my partner who had his own keys to get us back into the apartment).

That being said, it\u0026#39;s important to remember the thought-provoking and somewhat kitschy nature of Nik Bentel\u0026#39;s viral pieces — they aren\u0026#39;t exactly built for convenience, and
