A hot new sneaker collaboration has entered the chat — arriving just in time to conquer bold spring sneaker trends. Hoka is becoming expert in viral limited-edition sneaks, partnering with R29 reader-favorites like FP Movement and Reformation (congrats to those who scored a pair). Its latest link-up, though, is by far the most high-fashion — and surprising — collab yet.The California-based brand teamed up with luxury label Marni to create a sneaker that fuses Hoka’s performance expertise with the Italian house’s maximalist aesthetic. The result? A fresh, puffy, monochromatic twist on the unisex Bondi B3LS lifestyle sneakers, launching today.In a press release, Marni Creative Director Francesco Risso described the collaboration process as “exhilarating — an exchange of energy where their technical mastery met Marni’s instinct for shape, color, and emotion.” The co-designed style features durable rubber soles, cushioned EVA insoles, and padded polyester uppers built for all-day activity — a bold, totemic design that  Risso calls “a fearless expression of movement, volume, and identity.”Perhaps the most exciting twist is the new color palette: Poinciana red, Bracken charcoal, Tourmaline blue, and Straw beige — hues that beautifully echo Marni’s Fall 2025 collection from Milan Fashion Week. Plus, each pair comes with three sets of laces, giving shoppers the freedom to customize and switch up their look. The Marni x Hoka sneakers are available for $395 both on Hoka’s and Marni’s websites now. Like what you see?
