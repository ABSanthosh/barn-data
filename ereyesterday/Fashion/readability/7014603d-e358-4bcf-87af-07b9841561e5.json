This sartorial fantasising was a way to kill time and to escape. Waiting for a friend at a restaurant? Time to hunt for wide-leg jeans. Tough day at work?

I spent money I didn’t have and, although sometimes the clothes were great, often they weren’t quite right. Even if they didn’t fit, or I hated them, I never returned them because the whole process felt too daunting. Printing a return label? Going all the way to the post office?
