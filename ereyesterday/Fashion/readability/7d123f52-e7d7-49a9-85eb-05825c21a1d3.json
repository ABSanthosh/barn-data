Best Overall: Closed Unity Slim Denim A heavier good-quality denim is the way to go when you’re looking for jeans that add shape for men with no butt. Unity makes their slim pair with strong, compact denim that feels weighty so it sits on the hips and hugs the body just right, ideal as best guys jeans for a flat butt. But if that has you thinking it’s stiff, have no fear, it’s still a mid-weight 11 oz denim. They’re perfectly stretchy where you need it to be. That’s what you get when you invest in quality. Unity makes their denim in Italy, and has worked together with their factories for decades to produce durable, innovative, and sustainable denim. As for that backside, the pockets are small, if not proportionate, and set far enough apart to give the impression that you’ve got more going on back there than you really do. Material: 98% cotton, 2% elastane |  Colors: 7 | Sizes: 27-38 waist | Style: Slim tapered Best Smart Casual: Luca Faloni Dark Blue Jeans If you need to appear more polished, a crisp, tailored pair of jeans will do the trick. I love a tapered jean for that, because it’s nice and narrow at the ankle, which is perfect for drawing your eye upwards and making your butt appear fuller. Selvedge denim is also a good choice, because it’s nice and sleek. Once your eye lands on that behind, you’ll notice the smaller, slightly angled pockets set proportionally on the seat for a nice framing effect. A mid-rise helps, too, as it covers more of your backside and lengthens the appearance of your legs. Plus, Luca Faloni uses a premium mid-weight denim so that it doesn’t bunch around the hips and has a nice, natural stretch. These jeans are clean and smooth, and easy to elevate with a pair of dress shoes and a blazer. Hot tip: Avoid ripped jeans when going for a pulled together vibe. Material: 100% cotton |  Colors: 2 | Sizes: 28-40 | Style: Tapered Best Budget: Wrangler Authentics Men’s Slim Fit Straight Leg Jean These Wrangler jeans are almost too good to be true. They’re super cheap, fit great, and come in a nice variety of washes for filling out your whole wardrobe, ideal pants for men with no butt. The pockets aren’t too large, and they have a diagonal line design on them that accentuates your hips and cuts the surface area of the pocket to make your butt look bigger. It’s almost like a nice little shelf that makes it seem like your butt is filling out a smaller space. They fit nice and slim through the seat and thigh, which is what you want when you’re trying to accentuate your bum. And I think lots of guys can appreciate a straight leg, which is easy for throwing on every day. Looks just as great with sneakers as they do with dress shoes or boots. Material: 98% cotton, 2% spandex |  Colors: 11 | Sizes: 29-42 waist | Style: Slim straight Best on Amazon: 7 For All Mankind Slimmy Fit Jean While I can appreciate the pocket detail on Wrangler Slim Fit Jeans, a clean design can also have an enhancing effect. These pockets are comfy and small, which is perfect for a tiny, flat butt. And they hug the butt just right, giving you an overall great fit through the hips and seat. Alternatively, you’ll notice that some of the colors have the iconic 7 For All Mankind squiggle across the pocket, which can also make the butt appear larger. This squiggle is what made the brand so popular in the first place. They might be on the pricey side, but they’re known for their excellent fit and overall attention to detail, which makes them some of the best jeans for men in general. Like the best of them, these Slimmy jeans have a slim, straight leg that’s tapered ever so slightly at the ankle for nice and easy everyday appeal. An easy, high-quality choice. Material: 92% cotton, 6% polyester, 2% spandex |  Colors: 9 | Sizes: 28-42 waist | Style: Straight Best Everyday: Bonobos Premium 4-Way Stretch Jean Pocket placement is so important when it comes to faking a better butt, especially in jeans for men with a flat butt. I love the way these pockets are set far apart, and seem to wrap around the hips. This makes your butt look nice and pumped up—just how you want it. The 4-Way Stretch Jean is known for having a great fit. Fit is everything when it comes to jeans for men with no butt. It’s all about hugging those hips, and this pair does it nicely. They’re soft on the skin, yet feel sturdy and resilient, with just the right amount of stretch for moving about your day. I have a feeling you’ll want to live in these. While I do wish they came in more washes so it was easier to fill out your wardrobe, I can appreciate the option to choose from either a slim taper, slim, or a straight cut style. Material: 92% Cotton, 4% Elastomultiester, 4% Elastane |  Colors: 4 | Sizes: 28-40 waist | Style: Slim taper, Slim, Straight Best for Comfort: Paige Normandie When it comes to the best jeans for men with no ass, Paige’s Normandie jean ticks all the right boxes. Here is an easy to wear, everyday jean in their classic straight fit that frames your bum to make it look bigger than it really is. There are plenty of brands that do a decent job at plumping up a flat butt, but few do so to the same level as Paige. They’re known for amazing quality and durability because they use good technical fabric and pay lots of attention to fit. That being said, I chose the Normandie, which is their straight leg jean, because they have premium stretch and recovery. This means they’re slightly roomy so that they move with you, but won’t get baggy throughout the day. When it comes to that backside, you’ll love the shorter, wider back pockets set proportionally in the seat of the jeans. This helps to frame your butt and makes it appear larger. They have plenty of colors and washes to choose from, including black and white, which is helpful, because I think you’ll fall in love with this jean. Why not go ahead and get a bunch of colors? Material:  54% Rayon, 23% Cotton, 22% Polyester, 1% Spandex |  Colors: 19 | Sizes: 28-40 | Style: Straight Style Tips to Enhance Your Flat Butt  The right pair of jeans can transform your silhouette, adding structure and definition where needed. If you’re looking to create a more proportional look, these styling strategies will help maximize your jeans’ impact: 1. Opt for Slim or Athletic-Fit Jeans Slim-fit jeans contour the thighs and seat, naturally enhancing shape without excess fabric that can flatten the appearance. Athletic-fit jeans, designed with extra room in the thighs but a tapered leg, offer a similar effect with added comfort. Style Tip: Look for structured denim with minimal excess fabric around the seat and thighs to create a more sculpted look. 2. Prioritize Back Pocket Details Back pockets significantly impact the way jeans shape your backside. Styles with flaps, embroidery, or contrast stitching add dimension, creating the illusion of a fuller rear. Avoid oversized or low-set pockets, which can make the area look flatter. Best Picks: Brands like Levi’s, Wrangler, and Nudie Jeans design back pockets that subtly lift and shape the posterior without adding bulk. 3. Choose Jeans with a Slight Stretch Denim blends that contain 1-3% elastane (spandex) mold to your body, enhancing natural curves and preventing a saggy, boxy appearance. Stretch denim also improves comfort and flexibility, ensuring a sleek yet sculpted fit. Fabric Tip: Opt for stretch-infused denim with a heavier weight (12–14 oz.) to maintain structure while providing a tailored look. 4. Consider a Mid to Low-Rise Cut A mid or low-rise waistline creates a visual break at the hips, making the posterior appear more pronounced. High-rise jeans can elongate the torso, which may flatten the seat rather than enhance it. Pro Tip: A contoured waistband (curved rather than straight) helps create a more defined shape at the waist and seat. 5. Avoid Baggy or Oversized Jeans Excess fabric can make the backside disappear entirely. Instead, choose fitted or tapered styles that provide structure without being restrictive. A slightly tapered leg helps maintain balance and proportion. Best Styles: Straight-leg and slim-taper jeans are ideal for adding shape without looking too tight or unnatural. bonobos / Instagram What To Look For In The Best Jeans For Men With No Butt Denim Weight Believe it or not, the weight of the denim influences the appearance of your bum in jeans. Lightweight denim with too much stretch will bunch easily, drowning your small bum in too much fabric. On the other hand, thicker, weightier denim will drape better, round out your hips, and add a bit of bulk to your bum. Think Japanese denim or even flannel lined jeans if it suits the season. Pockets Pockets and their placements matter greatly when it comes to the best jeans for flat buttocks men, especially if you’re looking to accentuate that area. Proportional pockets are great, but those that are smaller, and sit higher, preferably at an angle, will make your butt look larger and more filled out. Pockets that wrap slightly around the hips and are set farther apart will also make your backside pop. Fit The best way to add some definition to your behind is to pick up a pair of slim fit jeans. Baggy jeans make your butt look flatter and smaller. Alternatively, super skinny jeans may make your butt look bigger because they’re snug, but they’ll only emphasize your bony points everywhere else. When jeans are slim, they sit nicely on the hips so that they frame your butt for the right amount of emphasis. Style  Your best bet when searching for a better pair of jeans is either a straight leg for balance, or a tapered leg for creating a long, lean line. Tapered jeans narrow at the ankle and draw the eye to your bum. I’d avoid dad jeans, unfortunately, because they tend to be too roomy for hugging any curves. lucafaloni / Instagram Why Trust FashionBeans At FashionBeans, we understand that finding the perfect fit in jeans—especially for men with a flat butt—takes more than a quick search.

Baggy jeans make your butt look flatter and smaller. Alternatively, super skinny jeans may make your butt look bigger because they’re snug, but they’ll only emphasize your bony points everywhere else.

Baggy jeans make your butt look flatter and smaller. Alternatively, super skinny jeans may make your butt look bigger because they’re snug, but they’ll only emphasize your bony points everywhere else.
