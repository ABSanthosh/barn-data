When you really think about it, footwear is an extension of your lifestyle. The pair of shoes that you choose to wear every day can say a lot about the things that you value and the way you live your life, not to mention the things that you want other people to see. This is why it’s so important to find shoes that match your specific style. Enter REEF, a brand that designs footwear with all kinds of different lifestyles in mind. REEF began as a simple sandal brand back in the ’80s but has since expanded to include a vast selection of shoes, boots, and clothing. The El Jefe is one of the most prominent pieces of footwear in the REEF lineup—and for good reason. This is a unique yet versatile sneaker that can handle pretty much anything life throws your way, making you the boss of your own fashion ouevre. There’s nothing more fundamental to fashion than shoes; they’re the rhythm section in your own personal style composition. And a great pair of shoes is worth the time, effort, and money that you spend on them. So let’s take a quick look at all of the reasons that you’ll want to add the El Jefe to your wardrobe right now. Watch Our Review In This ArticleHow We TestedMeasurementsTL;DRAbout El JefeWhat To ConsiderWhy They’re GreatBreak Them InFlawsHow To CareAlternativesWhy Trust UsVerdictFAQs How We Tested For testing, I picked up a pair of these shoes and set out to put them through their paces (literally). Since these shoes are designed for everyday wear, I did everyday things while wearing them, such as going grocery shopping and on dinner dates and on walks in the park, etc. That road-testing gave me a good feel for how these shoes fare through consistent usage and what kind of wear and tear to expect. Not to mention that they just felt great on. Overall, they’ve been both durable and versatile throughout many of these situations. With good care (and you’d promise to provide that, wouldn’t you?), I’d expect these shoes to last several years—even with consistent usage. Measurements When it comes to footwear, my size typically ranges between 10.5 and 11.5, depending on the style and material. With that in mind, 11 is my go-to size for this type of sneaker, and it’s the one yhsy I picked for the El Jefe. It’s important to note that these shoes do run a bit large, and other reviewers claim to have opted for a half-size smaller than what they typically wear. If you tend to fall in between sizes (and yes, I know that this is annoying, but you have the feet that you were born with, so deal with it), then it might be a good idea to order a half size smaller than your normal size. If you do order a pair that doesn’t quite fit, REEF offers free returns within 30 days of delivery to ensure that you end up with the correct size no matter what. (Score 1 for customer service.) TL;DR Here’s a brief overview of everything that you need to know about the El Jefe sneaker from REEF: Sizing: This shoe tends to run a bit large. If you’re in between sizes, it might be a good idea to order a half-size smaller than you normally wear. That being said, if you have wider feet, then it might be best to stick with your normal size because this shoe is average in width. Pros: These shoes are durable, versatile, and stylish. They have nitrogen-infused EVA insoles and high-grip rubber outsoles for maximum comfort and traction. They’re also available in a handful of eye-catching colorways to effectively showcase your personality. (There’s nothing worse than shoes that are comfortable enough yet stay in the closet because you just don’t want to be seen wearing them.) Cons: They’re a bit bulkier and heavier than many other sneakers that REEF offers. However, this is completely by design. These shoes are meant to be worn like skate or surf shoes—not like running shoes. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the sizing might also be tricky to nail down at first. Alternatives: REEF offers a variety of other shoes if the El Jefe isn’t quite up your alley. A few notable options are the Triton, Navigator, and Terramar. Each of these shoes is designed to benefit different lifestyles and preferences. Verdict: The El Jefe is a special shoe that’ll feel right at home with anyone who exudes the skater and surfer vibe. This is a high-quality pair of sneakers that you’ll want to throw on each and every day. So take my advice and do just that! About The El Jefe Sneaker The El Jefe sneaker is REEF’s take on a classic surf and skate sneaker. It’s an effortlessly casual shoe that blends textile fabric with high-end suede. This scintillating shoe features a nitrogen-infused insole, which is supportive and springy. Not to mention, the outsole is made with high-grip, anti-marking rubber that’ll give you great traction—regardless of the terrain. Cool inside and out – I’m sold. The El Jefe is available in a couple of different colors to match your specific style. You have the standard options like black and white. Yet, you’re the boss of the hue of your shoes, so REEF also offers other colorways like the Madras, which blends shades of blue and gray for an added pop of character. What To Consider Before Buying First off, it’s always important to consider your personal style before picking up any pair of shoes. The El Jefe is a very casual shoe, so it might feel out of place if you typically dress formally or preppy. That being said, if you feel more comfortable in shorts and a tee, then this might be the perfect shoe for you (like is as like does, as it were). It’s also important to consider the type of environment in which you’ll be wearing your shoes. The El Jefe is primarily designed with coastal living in mind. If you live somewhere with more snow than sunshine, then this might not be an ideal sneaker for you. (I said ideal. You can wear these anywhere if you really want to; remember, you’re the boss.) Why they’re Great/Why I Liked them My favorite thing about this sneaker is its design. This is a beautiful-looking shoe that is youthful and vibrant, yet still sophisticated. It’s a perfect summertime accessory and can be thrown on for a ton of different warm-weather activities. The nitrogen-infused EVA insole is also a massive game changer—you can feel the extra support and bounciness in each step (and over time, that adds up to massive comfort – trust me). I also think that the materials used for the upper are high-quality and should last a fairly long time. I’m personally a big fan of suede accents on shoes because they offer a lot more character. How To Break them in/Wear them Breaking in the El Jefe is very similar to the process for any other skate shoe that you might have owned in the past. The break-in period is way less intense than a pair of leather footwear, but there is still a minor adjustment period. Since these shoes are a bit bulkier, they might be a bit stiff at first. After a few days, though, they should begin to soften up and adapt to your feet for a more comfortable fit. Then, the sky’s the limit. How do you style these shoes, though? The El Jefe is best for those who prefer to dress casually on a day-to-day basis. This sneaker pairs great with shorts, slacks, and jeans. You can also compliment them with a nice T-shirt, polo, or tropical button-up. To put it simply, this shoe will work with anything you’d wear to the beach. Flaws but Not Deal-breakers The two most common complaints regarding this shoe are that it’s bulky and runs a bit large. This is highly dependent on your feet (and your personal preferences), but it is worth noting. If you’re used to wearing boots (like me), then these shoes won’t feel bulky at all. On the other hand, if you typically wear athletic sneakers, then these shoes might feel a bit heavier than what you’re used to. As for sizing, it’s really only an issue when you first buy these shoes. Once you have the right size, it shouldn’t be a concern anymore. REEF also has half sizes, which is a big perk that some other brands don’t offer. How to Care for the El Jefe Looking after the El Jefe demands very little effort. You can take a fully hands-off approach and let these shoes age as they would naturally (as in go with the flow of nature). That being said, if you want to preserve them as long as possible, then it’s best to do some light maintenance every now and then. The suede upper components can be cleaned with a simple suede brush and eraser combo. The fabric components can also be cleaned up with a brush or dry cloth. Lastly, you can use a damp cloth or old toothbrush to clean off any dirt and debris from the outsoles. You Have Options: 3 Alternatives To The El Jefe Triton: The Triton is REEF’s take on the classic German Army Trainer sneaker with some modern additions. This shoe features the brand’s signature Swellsole insole, which is super plush and supportive. For the upper, this shoe features a combination of knit fabric and suede. These design elements essentially make this sneaker as light as a feather and athletic enough for a variety of activities. Navigator: The Navigator is a shoe designed to be your go-to travel buddy. The rip-stop upper is durable, water-resistant (excellent for being in the vicinity of the beach), and breathable. It also features a crush-back heel, which helps when going through airport security or when slipping them on for a quick trip to the car. Terramar: There’s also the Terramar, which features a classic leather sneaker design. This shoe utilizes premium leather from gold and silver-rated tanneries. It’s an effortlessly sleek shoe that still offers premium comfort (including the Swellsole insole). Why Trust Us Shoes are, without a doubt, my favorite element of style. It’s hard to beat a great piece of footwear that can tie a whole outfit together. Your shoe choices support your overall fashion sense (not to mention your shoes supporting your feet, your back, your posture, etc.) My appreciation of footwear has led me to learn as much as I can about the design and manufacturing process of different styles, and I’m more than happy to pass on what I have learned. I’ve also tackled a range of pieces with FashionBeans, focusing on topics such as travel shoes and types of sandals. Not to mention, I have a year’s worth of experience working at a prominent boot company in New York. All of this is to say that I’m a diehard fan of footwear. This is why I take the subject of shoes so seriously and strive to find the best options out there. With the knowledge that I’ve gained, my ultimate goal for this shoe review is to help you make an informed decision that will ultimately benefit you and your style. Verdict The El Jefe is a standout option in REEF’s footwear lineup. You can tell this shoe was intentionally designed and that it’s built to be one of your best friends. There’s nothing I love more than a pair of shoes that can be worn pretty much every day, and this is one of those shoes. The El Jefe lives up to its name as “the boss,” able to take command of your entire footwear collection and transfer that ascendancy to you and your overall look. FAQ Over the years, REEF has evolved from its humble beginnings as a sandal brand to a full-fledged footwear brand. It now offers a variety of high-quality and stylish footwear that embodies the “REEF DREAM”. If you’re looking for a pair of shoes to go from point A to point B, REEF is a great brand to choose from. The El Jefe sneaker is one of the most unique shoe styles REEF currently offers. This shoe is durable, comfortable, and eye-catching (especially in the Madras colorway). If you’re looking for something versatile and functional, I’d say these sneakers are well worth the money. Ryan is a writer, filmmaker, and all around content creator.

So let’s take a quick look at all of the reasons that you’ll want to add the El Jefe to your wardrobe right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch Our Review\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Casual But Never Basic: REEF\u0026#39;s El Jefe Shoe Review\" width=\"604\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDPteSABUGE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"table_of_content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn This Article\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tested\"\u003eHow We Tested\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#measure\"\u003eMeasurements\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tldr\"\u003eTL;DR\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#about\"\u003eAbout El Jefe\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#consider\"\u003eWhat To Consider\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#great\"\u003eWhy They’re Great\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#break\"\u003eBreak Them In\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#flaws\"\u003eFlaws\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#care\"\u003eHow To Care\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#alternatives\"\u003eAlternatives\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#trust-us\"\u003eWhy Trust Us\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fin-ver\"\u003eVerdict\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#custom_faqs\"\u003eFAQs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"tested\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow We Tested\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor testing, I picked up a pair of these shoes and set out to put them through their paces (literally). Since these shoes are designed for everyday wear, I did everyday things while wearing them, such as going grocery shopping and on dinner dates and on walks in the park, etc. That road-testing gave me a good feel for how these shoes fare through consistent usage and what kind of wear and tear to expect. Not to mention that they just felt great on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, they’ve been both durable and versatile throughout many of these situations. With good care (and you’d promise to provide that, wouldn’t you?), I’d expect these shoes to last several years—even with consistent usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5.jpg\" alt=\"Holding an El Jefe Shoe\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe5-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"measure\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMeasurements\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to footwear, my size typically ranges between 10.5 and 11.5, depending on the style and material. With that in mind, 11 is my go-to size for this type of sneaker, and it’s the one yhsy I picked for the El Jefe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to note that these shoes do run a bit large, and other reviewers claim to have opted for a half-size smaller than what they typically wear. If you tend to fall in between sizes (and yes, I know that this is annoying, but you have the feet that you were born with, so deal with it), then it might be a good idea to order a half size smaller than your normal size. If you do order a pair that doesn’t quite fit, REEF offers free returns within 30 days of delivery to ensure that you end up with the correct size no matter what.

If you’re in between sizes, it might be a good idea to order a half-size smaller than you normally wear. That being said, if you have wider feet, then it might be best to stick with your normal size because this shoe is average in width.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePros: \u003c/b\u003eThese shoes are durable, versatile, and stylish. They have nitrogen-infused EVA insoles and high-grip rubber outsoles for maximum comfort and traction. They’re also available in a handful of eye-catching colorways to effectively showcase your personality. (There’s nothing worse than shoes that are comfortable enough yet stay in the closet because you just don’t want to be seen wearing them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCons: \u003c/b\u003eThey’re a bit bulkier and heavier than many other sneakers that REEF offers. However, this is completely by design. These shoes are meant to be worn like skate or surf shoes—not like running shoes. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the sizing might also be tricky to nail down at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlternatives: \u003c/b\u003eREEF offers a variety of other shoes if the El Jefe isn’t quite up your alley. A few notable options are the Triton, Navigator, and Terramar. Each of these shoes is designed to benefit different lifestyles and preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVerdict: \u003c/b\u003eThe El Jefe is a special shoe that’ll feel right at home with anyone who exudes the skater and surfer vibe. This is a high-quality pair of sneakers that you’ll want to throw on each and every day.

It’s an effortlessly casual shoe that blends textile fabric with high-end suede. This scintillating shoe features a nitrogen-infused insole, which is supportive and springy. Not to mention, the outsole is made with high-grip, anti-marking rubber that’ll give you great traction—regardless of the terrain. Cool inside and out – I’m sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe El Jefe is available in a couple of different colors to match your specific style. You have the standard options like black and white. Yet, you’re the boss of the hue of your shoes, so REEF also offers other colorways like the Madras, which blends shades of blue and gray for an added pop of character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"consider\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat To Consider Before Buying\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, it’s always important to consider your personal style before picking up any pair of shoes. The El Jefe is a very casual shoe, so it might feel out of place if you typically dress formally or preppy. That being said, if you feel more comfortable in shorts and a tee, then this might be the perfect shoe for you (like is as like does, as it were).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to consider the type of environment in which you’ll be wearing your shoes. The El Jefe is primarily designed with coastal living in mind. If you live somewhere with more snow than sunshine, then this might not be an ideal sneaker for you. (I said \u003cem\u003eideal\u003c/em\u003e. You can wear these anywhere if you really want to; remember, you’re the boss.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"great\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy they’re Great/Why I Liked them\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8.jpg\" alt=\"El Jefe Shoe insole\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite thing about this sneaker is its design. This is a beautiful-looking shoe that is youthful and vibrant, yet still sophisticated. It’s a perfect summertime accessory and can be thrown on for a ton of different warm-weather activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nitrogen-infused EVA insole is also a massive game changer—you can feel the extra support and bounciness in each step (and over time, that adds up to massive comfort – trust me). I also think that the materials used for the upper are high-quality and should last a fairly long time. I’m personally a big fan of suede accents on shoes because they offer a lot more character.\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"break\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow To Break them in/Wear them\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking in the El Jefe is very similar to the process for any other skate shoe that you might have owned in the past. The break-in period is way less intense than a pair of leather footwear, but there is still a minor adjustment period. Since these shoes are a bit bulkier, they might be a bit stiff at first. After a few days, though, they should begin to soften up and adapt to your feet for a more comfortable fit. Then, the sky’s the limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you style these shoes, though? The El Jefe is best for those who prefer to dress casually on a day-to-day basis. This sneaker pairs great with shorts, slacks, and jeans. You can also compliment them with a nice T-shirt, polo, or tropical button-up. To put it simply, this shoe will work with anything you’d wear to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"flaws\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFlaws but Not Deal-breakers\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two most common complaints regarding this shoe are that it’s bulky and runs a bit large. This is highly dependent on your feet (and your personal preferences), but it is worth noting. If you’re used to wearing boots (like me), then these shoes won’t feel bulky at all. On the other hand, if you typically wear athletic sneakers, then these shoes might feel a bit heavier than what you’re used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for sizing, it’s really only an issue when you first buy these shoes. Once you have the right size, it shouldn’t be a concern anymore. REEF also has half sizes, which is a big perk that some other brands don’t offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"care\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Care for the El Jefe\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6.jpg\" alt=\"El Jefe Shoe\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking after the El Jefe demands very little effort. You can take a fully hands-off approach and let these shoes age as they would naturally (as in go with the flow of nature). That being said, if you want to preserve them as long as possible, then it’s best to do some light maintenance every now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suede upper components can be cleaned with a simple suede brush and eraser combo. The fabric components can also be cleaned up with a brush or dry cloth.

Since these shoes are designed for everyday wear, I did everyday things while wearing them, such as going grocery shopping and on dinner dates and on walks in the park, etc. That road-testing gave me a good feel for how these shoes fare through consistent usage and what kind of wear and tear to expect. Not to mention that they just felt great on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, they’ve been both durable and versatile throughout many of these situations.

If you tend to fall in between sizes (and yes, I know that this is annoying, but you have the feet that you were born with, so deal with it), then it might be a good idea to order a half size smaller than your normal size.

If you’re in between sizes, it might be a good idea to order a half-size smaller than you normally wear. That being said, if you have wider feet, then it might be best to stick with your normal size because this shoe is average in width.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePros: \u003c/b\u003eThese shoes are durable, versatile, and stylish. They have nitrogen-infused EVA insoles and high-grip rubber outsoles for maximum comfort and traction. They’re also available in a handful of eye-catching colorways to effectively showcase your personality. (There’s nothing worse than shoes that are comfortable enough yet stay in the closet because you just don’t want to be seen wearing them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCons: \u003c/b\u003eThey’re a bit bulkier and heavier than many other sneakers that REEF offers. However, this is completely by design. These shoes are meant to be worn like skate or surf shoes—not like running shoes. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the sizing might also be tricky to nail down at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlternatives: \u003c/b\u003eREEF offers a variety of other shoes if the El Jefe isn’t quite up your alley.

It’s an effortlessly casual shoe that blends textile fabric with high-end suede. This scintillating shoe features a nitrogen-infused insole, which is supportive and springy. Not to mention, the outsole is made with high-grip, anti-marking rubber that’ll give you great traction—regardless of the terrain. Cool inside and out – I’m sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe El Jefe is available in a couple of different colors to match your specific style. You have the standard options like black and white. Yet, you’re the boss of the hue of your shoes, so REEF also offers other colorways like the Madras, which blends shades of blue and gray for an added pop of character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"consider\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat To Consider Before Buying\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, it’s always important to consider your personal style before picking up any pair of shoes. The El Jefe is a very casual shoe, so it might feel out of place if you typically dress formally or preppy. That being said, if you feel more comfortable in shorts and a tee, then this might be the perfect shoe for you (like is as like does, as it were).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to consider the type of environment in which you’ll be wearing your shoes. The El Jefe is primarily designed with coastal living in mind. If you live somewhere with more snow than sunshine, then this might not be an ideal sneaker for you. (I said \u003cem\u003eideal\u003c/em\u003e. You can wear these anywhere if you really want to; remember, you’re the boss.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"great\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy they’re Great/Why I Liked them\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8.jpg\" alt=\"El Jefe Shoe insole\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe8-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite thing about this sneaker is its design. This is a beautiful-looking shoe that is youthful and vibrant, yet still sophisticated. It’s a perfect summertime accessory and can be thrown on for a ton of different warm-weather activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nitrogen-infused EVA insole is also a massive game changer—you can feel the extra support and bounciness in each step (and over time, that adds up to massive comfort – trust me). I also think that the materials used for the upper are high-quality and should last a fairly long time. I’m personally a big fan of suede accents on shoes because they offer a lot more character.\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"break\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow To Break them in/Wear them\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking in the El Jefe is very similar to the process for any other skate shoe that you might have owned in the past. The break-in period is way less intense than a pair of leather footwear, but there is still a minor adjustment period. Since these shoes are a bit bulkier, they might be a bit stiff at first. After a few days, though, they should begin to soften up and adapt to your feet for a more comfortable fit. Then, the sky’s the limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you style these shoes, though? The El Jefe is best for those who prefer to dress casually on a day-to-day basis. This sneaker pairs great with shorts, slacks, and jeans. You can also compliment them with a nice T-shirt, polo, or tropical button-up. To put it simply, this shoe will work with anything you’d wear to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"flaws\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFlaws but Not Deal-breakers\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two most common complaints regarding this shoe are that it’s bulky and runs a bit large. This is highly dependent on your feet (and your personal preferences), but it is worth noting. If you’re used to wearing boots (like me), then these shoes won’t feel bulky at all. On the other hand, if you typically wear athletic sneakers, then these shoes might feel a bit heavier than what you’re used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for sizing, it’s really only an issue when you first buy these shoes. Once you have the right size, it shouldn’t be a concern anymore. REEF also has half sizes, which is a big perk that some other brands don’t offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"care\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Care for the El Jefe\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6.jpg\" alt=\"El Jefe Shoe\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElJefe6-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking after the El Jefe demands very little effort. You can take a fully hands-off approach and let these shoes age as they would naturally (as in go with the flow of nature). That being said, if you want to preserve them as long as possible, then it’s best to do some light maintenance every now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suede upper components can be cleaned with a simple suede brush and eraser combo. The fabric components can also be cleaned up with a brush or dry cloth. Lastly, you can use a damp cloth or old toothbrush to clean off any dirt and debris from the outsoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"alternatives\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou Have Options: 3 Alternatives To The El Jefe\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12.jpg\" alt=\"a Collection of Reef shoes\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12.jpg 1280w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ReefCollection12-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reef.com/products/mens-shoe-swellsole-triton-grey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eTriton\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e:\u003c/b\u003e The Triton is REEF’s take on the classic German Army Trainer sneaker with some modern additions. This shoe features the brand’s signature Swellsole insole, which is super plush and supportive. For the upper, this shoe features a combination of knit fabric and suede. These design elements essentially make this sneaker as light as a feather and athletic enough for a variety of activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reef.com/products/mens-shoes-navigator-white-forest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eNavigator\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e:\u003c/b\u003e The Navigator is a shoe designed to be your go-to travel buddy.

Your shoe choices support your overall fashion sense (not to mention your shoes supporting your feet, your back, your posture, etc.) My appreciation of footwear has led me to learn as much as I can about the design and manufacturing process of different styles, and I’m more than happy to pass on what I have learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve also tackled a range of pieces with FashionBeans, focusing on topics such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-travel-shoes-for-men/\"\u003etravel shoes\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/types-of-mens-sandals/\"\u003etypes of sandals\u003c/a\u003e.
