  "description": "A true summer staple, denim shorts always have your back for music festivals, farmers market strolls, vacations, and more. They’re a foundational piece, so it’s worth having at least one (or two or three) pairs that can anchor your entire warm-weather wardrobe. And while dresses and skirts in the same iconic fabric are still going strong, think of these as the natural next step in your summer lineup.All signs point to nostalgia this season, with once-polarizing low-rise waists and Bermuda shorts firmly back in rotation. Dark, tailored options are also trending — great for the office (depending on your dress code) or dressed up with thong kitten heels for dinner. No matter your vibe, we’ve found a range of rises, inseam lengths, and washes to suit your style. Bonus: we even included the comfiest pull-on pairs to keep your summer extra breezy.Read on for 35 denim shorts that deserve a prime spot in your closet. DashDividers_1_500x100 Jorts There’s no denying it: Jorts are back, and Refinery29 editors are fully on board. Once deemed uncool, the longline silhouette is fully in the spotlight, now a favorite among influencers and fashion girlies alike. If you’re ready to join the movement, these just-above-the-knee styles feel effortlessly cool and are surprisingly versatile to style. DashDividers_1_500x100 Low-Rise Denim Shorts If you’re channeling early-aughts energy this summer, low-rise shorts are a must. Go ultra-mini with cutoffs made for festival season (hello, Cowboy Carter tour), or lean into the Y2K revival with a low-rise Bermuda for a fresh take on the throwback. DashDividers_1_500x100 Mid-Rise Denim Shorts Like a good white tee, mid-rise denim shorts are timeless. Stick with classic blue washes for everyday wear, or try something with a twist — embroidered cherries, silver studs, and other playful details are trending big time. DashDividers_1_500x100 High-Rise Denim Shorts For a snatched waist and easy styling, you can’t beat high-rise denim. Whether you gravitate toward A-line shapes, sailor-style pockets, or frayed cutoffs, these styles are made to pair with your favorite summer tops and statement belts. DashDividers_1_500x100 Denim Pull-On Shorts When the heat hits hard, pull-on denim shorts are the answer. Elastic waistbands and lightweight fabrics make these feel like loungewear — but they still look put-together enough for casual Fridays, brunch dates, and everything in between. Like what you see?
