Fashion for fashion’s sake is fine, but there’s something so rich about clothing with a history, especially a sporty one. There’s the tennis polo designed by Rene Lacoste that sparked a massive athleisure trend, and then there’s the coach jacket. Also called stadium jackets, coach jackets were worn by—you guessed it—track and field coaches throughout the ’60s and ’70s to withstand inclement weather and promote ease of movement. Like varsity jackets, the best coach jackets have several distinctive features, including a loose shape that is wide around the torso, a lay-down collar, snap closures, and a drawstring base at the waist. Typically, they’re made from nylon for water resistance and durability out on the field. Nowadays, you can expect some slight variations in features, but the overall idea is the same: a jacket that plays well and looks downright cool while you do it. Whether you want to touch on the trend for cheap or are considering a more durable staple, we have the very best coach jackets laid out for you. Let’s take a peek at the top 10 below. Key Takeaways  For this assignment, I began by poring over hundreds of photos, customer reviews, and even my own closet (and my partner’s) until I whittled it down to the 10 finalists you see on this list. Overall, the best men’s coach jacket is the Stance Coaches Jacket because it’s well-priced, has the perfect shape and fit, and is doubly water-repellent. For a label-free option lined with cotton jersey for added warmth, look no further than Los Angeles Apparel Nylon Raglan Coaches Jacket.

It has all the go-to features that this kind of jacket requires: snap closures, the perfect roomy shape and fit, plus functionality in its fabric. The nylon is coated with double DWR (durable water repellent), and the lining is mesh for sweat-wicking breathability. It’s trendy, it’s easy to wear with literally anything, and it comes in a lovely little price point that you can’t resist. Who is this for? This is for the guy who doesn’t want to deviate from the classics and wants to dress every day in a simple yet stylish way. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re not familiar with the brand, then you may not love repping a logo, although I find it to be attractive. Plus, they’ve got excellent customer service, so you might find that it’s a brand worth getting behind. Fit: Relaxed | Sizes: XS–XL | Colors: 3 | Material: 100% Nylon, 100% Polyester lining | Care: Machine wash cold with like colors on a gentle cycle Best Regular Fit: Closed Trekking Jacket Why it’s great: Although technically not a coach jacket, it has plenty of the right features to give you the same vibe, including high-quality water-repellent Italian nylon, slit pockets, and an elasticated waistband and sleeves. It does have a zipper instead of snaps and a stowable hood for inclement weather, but I personally find that these details make it easier to wear. Who is this for? Because it has a regular fit and sits closer to the body, it’s for the guy who prefers a slightly more tailored look. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The quality and construction are there to qualify as a best men’s coach jacket, but the price tag is a bit steep. Fit: Regular | Sizes: XS–XXL | Colors: 2 | Material: 100% Polyester | Care: Machine wash Best Zip Front: Pangaia Men’s Nylon Jacket Why it’s great: Similar to the Celine coach jacket, this one has that cool, urban streetwear factor. It also takes creative license in terms of the best coach jacket for men, but for the most part, it fits the bill, thanks to an innovative nylon design that is meant to degrade in five years. It’s got the drawstring waist as well but on both sides of the jacket. Expect a slouchy, oversized fit, extra deep front pockets, and a zip closure instead of snaps. Who is this for? For the guy who wants a coach jacket but prefers to do things his own way, with some unique variation, Flaws but not deal-breakers: It’s well worth its price, but it may cost more than some are willing to spend. Fit: Oversized | Sizes: XS–XL | Colors: 1 | Care: Machine Wash | Material: Degradation Nylon | Care: Not listed Best Cropped: Rains String W Jacket Why it’s great: Who knew that a rain jacket could have so much style? I still think it counts as a coach jacket because it has a drawstring waist, a loose, cropped fit, and deep slit pockets. But what sets it apart is the luxe-sport aesthetic and superior construction, like double-welded front pockets, welded seams, and underarm eyelets for ventilation. A truly functional, well-made jacket for a pretty good price point, this is one of the best coach jackets you’ll find. Who is this for? A great choice for the dude who prefers to invest in quality that’s built to last.

Fit: Loose, cropped | Sizes: XS–XL | Colors: 2 | Material: 100% Polyester, 100% polyurethane | Care: Machine wash cold, do not tumble dry Best Budget: Shaka Wear Classic Nylon Windbreaker Why it’s great: Free from logos, this is the best men’s coach jacket if you’re looking for a versatile basic. Coming in six dark-toned colors with matching snaps, it’ll pair well with all your sneakers, boots, and your favorite tee. But what I really love is that it’s so easy to wear. The nylon is water-resistant, the cuffs are infused with lycra for a good scrunch, and the raglan shoulder design increases mobility. Who is this for? A good option if you don’t want to shell out too much for a plain coach jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Consider sizing up. The material doesn’t seem to be very durable if you’re wearing it with a tighter fit. Fit: Relaxed | Sizes: S–5XL | Colors: 6 | Material: 100% Polyester lining, 100% Nylon | Care: Hand wash only Best on Amazon: Nike Sportswear Authentics Men’s Coaches Jacket Why it’s great: Because of that insanely iconic Nike check and a loose, roomy fit that’s perfect for layering, you’ll find choosing from one of these easy neutrals to be a no-brainer.

I really love the deep slash pockets for tucking in your hands and phone. Who is this for? This is for sportswear fans who like combining a touch of fashion with functionality. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This is one of the best coach jackets out there, sure, but sizing is pretty limited. Check out their website for a similar alternative if you’re struggling. Fit: Loose | Sizes: Medium, Large | Colors: 3 | Material: 100% Polyester | Care: Machine wash Best Cold Weather: Levi’s Men’s Retro Coaches Jacket Why it’s great: If there ever was a perfect coach jacket for winter, this is it. It’s got a puffier look than most, but that’s because it’s sherpa-lined to keep you cozy and warm in wind, rain, and snow. Plus, you get a hidden zipper underneath the snap closure to keep you buttoned up. Even the flight nylon satin outer shell is good for battling the elements, thanks to its water resistance. Who is this for? A great option if you need a coach jacket to keep you warm while also looking stylish. Flaws but not deal-breakers: With so much added warmth, this might not be the best choice if you want an all-year-long pick. Fit: Regular | Sizes: XS–XXL | Colors: 2 | Material: 100% Nylon, sherpa | Care: Hand Wash Cold Best Luxury: Celine Homme Logo-Print Shell Coach Jacket Why it’s great: On the flip side, maybe what you love about a coach jacket is a logo or label. But you wouldn’t rep a sports team with this one, rather a high-end designer brand that comes with plenty of clout. The white drawstring, buttons, and gothic stencil font contrast well with the vintage blue color. Cut from the shell, it’s mid-weight, so neither too light nor too heavy, with tailored elasticated cuffs for pulled-together streetwear appeal. Who is this for? This is one of the best coach jackets and a great pick for guys who are into designer fashion. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Obviously, this is a steep price point for most, but it could be worth the splurge for some.

Fit: Standard | Sizes: S–XXL | Colors: 1 | Material: 100% Polyester | Care: Not listed Best Everyday: Los Angeles Apparel Nylon Raglan Coaches Jacket Why it’s great: Los Angeles Apparel is great for basics, so it makes sense that their coaches jacket is a true classic. With a wide torso and slightly cropped body, it’s exactly what you’re looking for, sans labels or unique features. The nylon taffeta is nice and lightweight, perfect for protection against wind and rain, but it’s also lined with cotton jersey for a boost of comfort and warmth. Who is this for? This is for the guy looking for an easy-to-wear staple sans logos. Flaws but not deal-breakers: No extended sizing if you’re a bigger dude. Fit: Oversize | Sizes: S–XL | Colors: 5 | Material: Nylon taffeta, 50% cotton, 50% polyester jersey lining | Care: Not listed skatestoreutrecht / Instagram What Makes The Best Coach Jackets? Weight Typically, the best coach jacket is made from nylon, which is a naturally lightweight material. This is good for sport, as it allows for freedom of movement and sweating without overheating. Some of the options on this list are naturally mid-weight, which is great for year-round, and others are thicker and heavier, making them ideal for cold months. That has a lot to do with material composition, which I’ll get into below. Material Composition Coach jackets are almost always made from nylon because they are lightweight and water-resistant, though today, you can find some polyester or poly blend options. This is also a lightweight fabric. The lining is where brands differ and can get pretty creative. Some use cotton or even sherpa for comfort and warmth, which is perfect for winter. Others use mesh, which is great for wicking away sweat in spring and summer. Fit  Coach jackets are defined by their fit and rise. By nature, they’re roomy at the waist, with either a loose or relaxed type of fit. This was originally to promote ease of movement on the field and make them very comfortable to wear now and style with multiple layers. I included a regular fit option for guys who prefer a more streamlined look, but overall, the coach jackets are spacious. newyorkjoe_shibuya / Instagram How We Chose  Lots of outerwear producers claim to offer the style and functionality of a coaches jacket, but oftentimes they don’t measure up. So, wherever possible, I chose coach jackets from reputable brands at decent prices and with the snap closures and roomy feel one would expect. I also sifted through hundreds of customer reviews, landing on my top 10 by choosing jackets that people rated highly and would likely buy again. Price: There is a lot of discrepancy in price points on this list, and for good reason. I wanted to offer you amazing value, but I also wanted to include high-quality options with varying price tags so that you could make the best choice according to your budget. Design: How does the coaches jacket look? It should come with snap closures or a drawstring waist, and definitely a lay-down collar. I made sure that every one of the coach jackets for men that I chose had most of these iconic details and that they were well-executed. Brand Reputation: How do most people feel about the brands that I chose to include? The answer is that they trust and rely on them to deliver high-quality goods at a decent price point over a consistent number of years. Why Trust Us?

This is good for sport, as it allows for freedom of movement and sweating without overheating. Some of the options on this list are naturally mid-weight, which is great for year-round, and others are thicker and heavier, making them ideal for cold months. That has a lot to do with material composition, which I’ll get into below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eMaterial Composition\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach jackets are almost always made from nylon because they are lightweight and water-resistant, though today, you can find some polyester or poly blend options. This is also a lightweight fabric. The lining is where brands differ and can get pretty creative. Some use cotton or even sherpa for comfort and warmth, which is perfect for winter. Others use mesh, which is great for wicking away sweat in spring and summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eFit \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach jackets are defined by their fit and rise. By nature, they’re roomy at the waist, with either a loose or relaxed type of fit.

This is good for sport, as it allows for freedom of movement and sweating without overheating. Some of the options on this list are naturally mid-weight, which is great for year-round, and others are thicker and heavier, making them ideal for cold months. That has a lot to do with material composition, which I’ll get into below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eMaterial Composition\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach jackets are almost always made from nylon because they are lightweight and water-resistant, though today, you can find some polyester or poly blend options. This is also a lightweight fabric. The lining is where brands differ and can get pretty creative. Some use cotton or even sherpa for comfort and warmth, which is perfect for winter. Others use mesh, which is great for wicking away sweat in spring and summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eFit \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach jackets are defined by their fit and rise. By nature, they’re roomy at the waist, with either a loose or relaxed type of fit. This was originally to promote ease of movement on the field and make them very comfortable to wear now and style with multiple layers. I included a regular fit option for guys who prefer a more streamlined look, but overall, the coach jackets are spacious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1183158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1183158\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants.jpg\" alt=\"man wearing a coach jacket and a baggy corduroy pants\" width=\"900\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants.jpg 900w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants-160x200.jpg 160w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newyorkjoe_shibuya_manwearingacoachjacketandabaggycorduroypants-768x960.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1183158\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkfqQVHhmYh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003enewyorkjoe_shibuya\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-choose\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow We Chose \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of outerwear producers claim to offer the style and functionality of a coaches jacket, but oftentimes they don’t measure up.
