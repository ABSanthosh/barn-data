  "description": "After originally selling out in five hours — and again on Sperry’s own site — the Sperry x Aritzia boat shoes are getting re-stocked on Aritzia’s website on April 26 at 12 a.m. PST.  While spring 2024 brought us the surprising return of the Clarks Wallabee, spring 2025 is bringing another prep-school classic: the boat shoe. Then again, maybe we shouldn’t be surprised. The “fisherman aesthetic” started trending on TikTok this past January, casting its net as one of the biggest spring trends and putting nautical styles back into the spotlight. And the newest ones you should test the waters with are from the Sperry x Aritzia collaboration. Sperry, the nostalgic original boat shoe brand founded in 1935, teamed up with Aritzia, the modern “elevated essentials” fashion brand, to reimagine the latter’s iconic boat shoes with two new styles.  “The boat shoe is more than just a trend — it’s a timeless staple that has defined style for nearly nine decades,” said Sperry’s president Jonathan Frankel in a press release. “This partnership is a perfect fusion of heritage and modernity, bringing fresh versatility to an enduring icon.” The Sperry x Aritzia Slim Boat has a sleek, narrow toe box and anti-slip outsole (because functional fashion is at the heart of the fisherman trend). It comes in full-grain leather, and is available in brown and light brown colorways. Meanwhile, the Sperry x Aritzia Authentic Original 2-Eye, which resembles a loafer (also very on trend), features premium leather, rawhide laces, and the brand’s signature “Razor-Cut Wave-Siping” outsole. These are available in brown and tan. Perhaps the most exciting part is that both these styles can be customized (and we love customization… hello shoe charm trend). They each come with three sets of interchangeable laces, including colorful ones, to make these shoes even more versatile… and spring-ready. All that’s left to do? Reel in and hook your pair before they vanish again. The limited restock goes live on Aritzia’s website April 26 at 12 a.m. PST. Shop full Sperry x Aritzia collaboration Like what you see?
