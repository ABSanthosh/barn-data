Cooler weather has finally arrived, which means it’s the perfect time to ready your seasonal wardrobe with some of the hottest trends for the season. Our bodies will shortly get swathed in fall jackets, cozy sweaters, and wide-leg jeans, but our feet are already crying out for trendy sneakers, chunky loafers, and cute boots for autumn.The biggest shoe trends for fall/winter 2024 are about as comfort-focused as we’ve ever seen, with perennial favorites like cowboy boots and over-the-knee boots making a major resurgence. There are also super-soft materials in the mix this season, like luxe suede, fuzzy shearling, and cushy puffer fabrics. Ahead, peep the best fall boots to slip into. We’ve rounded up a mix of everyday styles (for work and casual autumn activities) and occasion-specific footwear (for date nights and holiday parties). Whether you’re a comfort connoisseur who needs a slip-on shoe for errands or someone who wouldn’t be caught wearing a flat sole, there’s a new boot with your name on it to help you start the season on the right foot. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Boots Part outdoor shoes, part slippers, puffer boots are the cozy style that will keep your feet extra warm throughout the fall and into the winter. Pick from an array of insulated and waterproof snow booties in sporty and lifestyle silhouettes. You can also take on the trend in heeled or platform styles that come with detachable puffer leg warmers for extra coverage (and utility). DashDividers_1_500x100 Thigh-High Boots Over-the-knee boots are a given in any fall shoe roundup. Taylor Swift has only cemented their eternal popularity, recently wearing burgundy Giuseppe Zanotti Frannie High Boots to a football game. Thigh-high boots make any outfit seasonally appropriate, especially if you show them off with on-trend bubble skirts or comfy leggings. Look out for classic suede, trendy denim, and dramatic leather styles, as well as ones with low kitten heels and sky-high stiletto heels. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Boots Suede boots will also always be a fall fashion must-have, and they’re already everywhere you look. You can find these luxe-looking shoes at nearly every footwear retailer, especially in knee-high form (with popular kitten heels) — though you can also find block-heel booties and flat ankle boots for more casual fall ‘fits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Animal Print Boots Much like leopard-print sneakers are proving to be extremely popular this fall, leopard-print boots are also coming for the footwear crown… as are every kind of animal-print boot, for that matter. From zebra-print boots popping up in fashion week street-style looks and textured snakeskin boots making a comeback, you can (and should) go wild with your footwear this season. Take it a step further by trying more obscure giraffe-print and cow-print boots (perfect for your cowgirl Halloween costume). DashDividers_1_500x100 Western Boots Buckle up as we ride off into fall with the Western trend. Thanks to Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter, Bella Hadid’s adorable equestrian romance, and Kacey Musgraves’ new horse-girl inspired Reformation collaboration, cowboy boots — which have been back — are showing no sign of dosey-doeing away. From tried-and-true leather knee-high styles to kitschy metallic ankle-grazing ones, Western boots can be as “yeehaw” or as fashion-forward as your heart desires. DashDividers_1_500x100 Furry Boots Back in February, plush clothing made an impactful impression at the NYFW Fall/Winter 2024 shows, as did furry shoes. (The latter first gained traction in 2023, and continues strong for autumn.) Hop on the (definitely cute, possibly divisive) trend with a pair of cozy shearling booties for everyday activities or chic faux-fur stiletto boots for stylish parties. Like what you see?
