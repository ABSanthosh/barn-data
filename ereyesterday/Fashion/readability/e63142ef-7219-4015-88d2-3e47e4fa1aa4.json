Photographed by Mert \u0026 Marcus and styled by Jacob K, the campaign stars Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, Saskia de Brauw, Liu Wen, Mica Argañaraz, Anok Yai, Mila Van Eeten and Jacqui Hooper. \"The energy on this campaign was extraordinary. It was all about friendship, loyalty and love,\" Donatella said in a statement. \"These images were created to celebrate the soul of the Versace woman. Her strength, her spirit, her attitude and her heart. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future.\" {Fashionista inbox}Jonathan Anderson reboots namesake labelAfter making his Dior debut, Jonathan Anderson has revealed he is relaunching his eponymous brand JW Anderson with a new concept. \"If I don't feel like the underdog, I will never work. So, in a weird way, we had to rebuild a platform to become the underdog again,\" Anderson told Business of Fashion. When the website launches on Sept. 1, there will be around 560 items available, and once something sells out, it's gone. The label will stock a range of items from garden tools to jewelry, offering \"cabinets of curiosities\" that each have a unique story. For the re-brand's lookbook, Anderson selected 35 longtime collaborators and people he admires including Luca Guadagnino and his partner Pol Anglada. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Willy Chavarria responds to \"controversial\" moment at Paris Fashion WeekAt Willy Chavarria's Spring 2026 show at Paris Men's Fashion Week, men with shaved heads and all-white outfits knelt down on the runway and bowed their torsos and heads with their hands behind their backs. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele interpreted that as a reference to photos of El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, the maximum-security prison where Donald Trump has sent hundreds of immigrants, and criticized the show on social media. Chavarria said the show was meant \"to highlight the importance of an indisputable fact that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. That's really the foundation of the brand. In this moment, where we're seeing the degradation and deterioration of care for one another across the world, I had no choice but to highlight what we're seeing in the United States.\" {WWD/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesArmani posts 24% profit drop in 2024On Wednesday, Giorgio Armani said its core profit dropped 24% last year hit by declining revenues and a slight increase in operating costs. \"I am convinced that pursuing consistency and continuity and avoiding the pursuit of immediate gains is the best strategy to ensure long-term success,\" Chairman and CEO Giorgio Armani said in a statement. Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) at the Italian fashion house fell to €398 million ($468 million) in 2024, while net revenues were down 5% to €2.3 billion. {Reuters}Why Saint James' shirts, intended for America, sit in storageSeamstresses at the Saint James factory in France's Normandy region put the finishing touches on 50,000 striped shirts and sweaters to fill orders for American stores like Nordstrom and J. Crew, but those tops are sitting in the company's warehouse due to Donald Trump's tariffs. America's imposition of 10% tariffs on most goods from the European Union, and threats to push the rates to 20 or 50%, has led companies to freeze projects, seek exemptions and prepare to raise prices. The base tariff on the classic Saint James sailor shirt, which costs $139, was 16.5%. The tariff then jumped to 36.5%, and went back down one week later, \"but it was still 10% more than what we'd been paying,\" Luc Lesénécal, the company's chief executive, told The New York Times. {The New York Times/paywalled}Why younger patients are getting faceliftsThanks to advancing techniques, facelifts have a new look and more patients in their 40s and 50s are seeking out the procedure. Facelift patients were typically in the 60s-plus age bracket, but the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found in a 2024 survey that patients aged 35-55 now make up 32% of facelift patients. This rise in facelifts at a younger age speaks to the procedure's ability to deliver the more subtle results many patients crave. {Glossy/paywalled}Fashionista's audience includes 1 million site visitors, 110,000 newsletter subscribers and 4.74 million social media followers.
