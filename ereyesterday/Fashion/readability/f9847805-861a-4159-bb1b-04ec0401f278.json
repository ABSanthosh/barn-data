  "text": "This Pride Month, let your impulse purchases go to a good cause. Cult favorite New York City-based fundraising label Mother, Daughter, Holy Spirit (MDHS) has marshaled the forces (and celebrity power) of the city’s fashion industry to raise money and awareness for the Trans Justice Funding Project. Beginning today, you can shop the designer-filled closets of Julia Fox and Richie Shazam, who have donated pieces alongside models and icons including Tommy Dorfman, Chloë Sevigny, and Hari Nef. Founded by Bobbi Salvör Menuez and John Mollett, MDHS has been dedicated to advocating for trans rights. In the process, it has built a fiercely supportive community, attracting stars including Madonna and Alex Consani (who walked the organization’s secondhand-filled runway show in Valentino alongside actress Cynthia Nixon earlier this spring). “I think through the perilous times and the climate that we’re living in right now, community support is really vital. Whatever we can do to be of service is important,” model Richie Shazam tells ELLE. According to the ACLU, in the first half of 2025 alone, over 500 anti-LGBT+ bills have been introduced in the United States. She adds of the label, “This organization operates like a heartbeat in New York, filled with really incredible characters and personalities and people all working with a common goal.”In addition to the celebrity closet sale, from which you can snag archival Jean Paul Gaultier, Marni, Willy Chavarria, Tanner Fletcher, and more, MDHS tapped White Lotus actress Aimee Lou Wood and her sister Emily alongside City Girls rapper JT to design exclusive T-shirts as a part of the brand’s Pride Month initiatives. All profts of both sales will go directly to the Trans Justice Funding Project. Shazam and Fox’s closet items and the Pride Month T-shirts are available online now at motherdaughterholyspirit.nyc.",
