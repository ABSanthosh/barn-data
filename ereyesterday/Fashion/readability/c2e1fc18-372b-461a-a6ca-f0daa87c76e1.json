These festivities are a chance to play around with seasonal colors and dazzling fabrics — think velvet dresses, special-occasion jumpsuits, and sequin numbers that can go from day to night.We’ve rounded up 25 winter wedding guest outfit ideas for every dress code, budget, and personal style. We’ve got cold-weather dresses, jumpsuits, and pantsuits from reader-favorite retailers like Free People, Reformation, Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, and more that’ll get you on the best-dressed list for every party.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

There are velvet, metallic, floral, and striped sets that can be worn on their own with a statement necklace or with a blouse or vest underneath.

To stay warm and comfortable while looking stylish, seek out long-sleeved, high-neck silhouettes in rich velvets and luxe jersey knits. Keep it sleek in black, or test out emerald green, navy blue, or metallic silver.Old Navy Fit \u0026 Flare Velvet Jumpsuit, $, available at Old NavyCity Chic Attract JumpsuitCity Chic Attract Jumpsuit, $, available at City ChicFarm Rio Long Sleeve Knot JumpsuitFarm Rio Long Sleeve Knot Jumpsuit, $, available at Farm RioBar III Plus Size Metallic Jersey One-Shoulder JumpsuitBar III Plus Size Metallic Jersey One-Shoulder Jumpsuit, $, available at Macy'sAbercrombie \u0026 Fitch Contrast Strapless JumpsuitAbercrombie \u0026 Fitch Contrast Strapless Jumpsuit, $, available at Abercrombie \u0026 FitchBlack-tie Wedding Guest DressesFormal weddings likely require black-tie dresses, which should probably be floor-length but certainly don’t have to be black. Look out for rich jewel tones in satin or iridescent fabrics. We’re eyeing winter ruffles for extra dimension and drama. Throw on a faux-fur coat, slip into comfortable heels, and swipe on burgundy lipstick to complete your ensemble.Eloquii Dramatic Ruffle Gown, $, available at EloquiiStaud Calluna Iridescent DressStaud Calluna Iridescent Dress, $, available at StaudMichael Costello x Revolve Loren GownMichael Costello x revolve Loren Gown, $, available at RevolveShow Me Your Mumu Greta DressShow Me Your Mumu Greta Dress, $, available at Show Me Your MumuHouse of Harlow 1960 x Revolve Astra GownHouse of Harlow 1960 x Revolve Astra Gown, $, available at RevolveCocktail Wedding Guest DressesCocktail attire is one of the most popular special-occasion dress codes. Somewhere in between formal and casual, it allows you (and the party) to move from day to night, and it opens you up to more silhouettes, hemline lengths, and fabrics. For the winter, we recommend midi dresses with delicate lace and mesh trims or elevated bows and pearl embellishments.V.
