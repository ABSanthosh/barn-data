  "description": "Jeans are a classic, but aren’t always the most comfortable thing to wear. Is that why designers have started ‘faking’ them?Those of us who wear jeans tend to do so for the following reasons: they’re durable, versatile, and timeless. But when it comes to comfort, well, that is usually more of a rare quality. Who doesn’t own a pair of jeans that are difficult to sit down in? But now, a new jean is challenging this tradition – meet the jean-printed sweatpant.Gap’s £60 “jean joggers” look like a pair of loose-fitting jeans complete with five pockets, but are in fact cotton joggers with a hidden elasticated waist and faux fly.

Gap describes them as “jean adjacent.” Similar to fake news, they’ve quickly gone viral.On social media, these are being described as “gen Z jeggings”. However, unlike their predecessors, which clung from ankle to thigh giving the illusion of a skinny jean, these pairs hang loose.The American brand Rag \u0026 Bone, known for its traditional rigid fits and worn by celebrities including Kendall Jenner and Jennifer Aniston, now has an entire range dedicated to fake, easy-fitting denim. Its Miramar collection first launched with denim sweatpants in 2013 but has since expanded to include straight-legged styles, jean jackets and cropped shorts. “This is not denim. It only looks like denim” reads the tagline. The brand claims its printing techniques can make any material look like denim. Most recently it released a pair of denim-printed fleece joggers with a matching hoodie.On TikTok, users describe the jean lookalikes as a “favourite fashion hack”. The thrill seems to lie in their deception. “Would you believe me if I said I’m wearing sweatpants right now?” is the opening line in scores of videos.This type of subterfuge has a long history in fashion. The French courtier Elsa Schiaparelli, who founded her namesake brand in 1927, regularly employed the use of a trompe l’oeil (“deceive the eye”). The term was coined in 1800 by the French artist Louis-Léopold Boilly to describe a painting he created that on first glance looked like a tabletop scattered with coins and letters.Kate Moss in all leather at Bottega Veneta women’s spring/summer 2023 show in Milan. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APSchiaparelli’s optical illusions included a knitted jumper that looked like it came with a bow collar and a ripped evening gown that was in fact cut out and exposed lining. During his first catwalk show in 1989, Martin Margiela debuted his trompe l’oeil “tattoo T-shirt”, which is now widely copied, much like Jean Paul Gaultier’s illusory 90s “naked” dresses.But it was Matthieu Blazy’s debut show at Bottega Veneta that really put the art of visual fallacy back in the spotlight when he revealed backstage that a simple white tank top and straight cut jeans were made of leather. Speaking to Fantastic Man in 2022, he explained that he “wanted things to look very simple”. “Not simple … ” he paused to consider, “but fake-simple.” Fake jeans featured again in his second collection, this time paired with a fake flannel shirt and modelled by Kate Moss. The ensemble quickly went viral. Next came Balenciaga’s $27,000 linen pants, hand-painted to look like old worn jeans, and Valentino’s blue-wash jeans, which were actually composed of silk gazar that had been hand embroidered with glass beads. Even the inside selvedges of the jeans were embroidered with thread “to imitate the real frame of a pair of good jeans”.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionNaturally, fast fashion retailers including Amazon and Asos have been quick to attempt to replicate these illusory styles, with pull-on denim dummies for £10.
