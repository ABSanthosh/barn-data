  "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: Valentine’s Day outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Valentine’s Day is already less than a month away. That can mean only one thing: It’s time to start planning. And, no, we don’t mean your date or the gift you might want to get your significant other — or a friend or yourself — though, it’s probably for the best to be thinking about that, too. We’re talking about your February 14th look. The good news? Whether you will be heading out for a romantic evening with a partner, celebrating with friends, or having a self-care night in, the most stylish Instagrammers have plenty of fashion inspo to provide. Keep scrolling to discover 20-plus outfits — sleek sheer pieces, on-trend rosettes and bows, as well as pinks, reds, and every shade in between — that you might just fall in love with this Valentine’s Day and beyond. Valentine’s Day Outfit Ideas: Monochrome There’s something effortlessly striking about a monochrome outfit. Go for a Valentine’s Day-appropriate color, like the maroon pictured here, and add your own spin to the look. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Pink + White Keep your look classic — yet stylish — with a white button-up shirt and a pink skirt. We love the Peter Pan collar and puffed sleeves seen here, but go for what you already have in your closet, and accessorize to let your personality shine through. Valentine’s Day Outfit Ideas: Draped Dress Add a romantic flourish to your outfit by opting for a dress with draping — an attached scarf, cape, train, or anything that makes you feel like you're wrapped in elegance.  Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Lingerie As OuterwearWearing innerwear as outerwear has been a thing for a few years now, so whether you’ve already tried the trend yourself or are ready to push out of your comfort zone, Valentine’s Day is the perfect opportunity to style your laciest lingerie-esque clothing (or actual lingerie!) as a going-out look.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Sheer White Dress If full-out lingerie is a bit too much for you, try wearing a sheer white maxi dress that will show off whatever you choose to layer underneath it.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: All-In On Texture Add intrigue and dimension to your outfit with textural pieces — think layers and layers of voluminous tulle or fluffy teddy-style pieces. Want to be really bold? Mix-and-match textures, like seen with this look. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Red Tights Colored tights are still having a moment, which makes opting for a red pair a no-brainer. We love the bright and bold pop it adds to this sleek black outfit as well as the tone-matched shoes.Valentine’s Day Outfit Ideas:  All Leather There’s no rule that says your Valentine’s Day outfit has to be cutesy. A leather-on-leather look offers something different, and can be flexible based on pieces that already live in your wardrobe. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Red + Black Or bring a bit of edge to your Valentine’s Day red by using it as an accent color in your all-black outfit.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Lace Maxi Dress Is there anything else to say about a sexy sheer wine-colored maxi dress other than “Yes, please”?Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Bubble Skirt Make a statement with a bubble skirt (or dress) of any length. If you opt for a mini, we highly recommend wearing it with a pair of knee-high boots.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Rosettes Rosettes — which are always Valentine’s Day-ready — are a simple way to add a pretty touch to an outfit. This year, we say the more you have, the better. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: FrillsJust like rosettes, bows and ruffles are an easy way to dress up any outfit, especially if your aesthetic leans toward more girly trends. Add them to your clothes, weave them into your hair, use them to accessorize, and go forth.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Heart Patterns When it comes to romance and fashion, there’s no such thing as too obvious. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Off-the-Shoulder Dress What is it about an off-the-shoulder/one-shoulder silhouette that makes an outfit look so luxe? We love the red shade here but don’t be afraid to stray from on-theme Valentine’s Day colors.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Feathered Suit Nothing says flirty and thriving like hot pink feather embellishments. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Preppy Style Between rugby sweaters, windbreakers, jersey-style tops, and ever-ubiquitous Adidas sneakers, sporty style is on the rise in 2025. But if you don’t want to show up to your Valentine’s Day plans looking like you’re heading to catch the local sports team of your choosing, lean preppy by layering a chunky knit sweater over a collared top and styling with your go-to kicks and color-matched socks. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Soft Suiting Yes, trending soft suiting can work for a romantic date, especially with a silhouette and cut as interesting as the flowy short suit pictured here — plus a pair of Tabis, naturally.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Leopard Print + Pink Leopard print and pink is the color combo we’re not wearing enough of. Style the combo casually, like pictured here, or dress them up with fancier pieces.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Relaxed Loungewear A cozy-looking neutral, wide-legged matching loungewear set is for anyone who doesn’t want to make a fuss out of Valentine’s Day. After all, it’s just another day.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Heart Cut-Outs Forget wearing your heart on your sleeve — keep it on your chest with a cute cut-out on a chunky knit.Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Cutout Gown Take it from British singer-songwriter Mahalia: cut-outs on a gown make it all the more alluring, whether in red or any other color. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Black Mini Dress Because a Little Black Dress is a perennial wardrobe staple for a reason, right?Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Bright White If the Valentino runway is any indicator (and it usually is), we’re all about to be wearing a lot more — and significantly more vivid — whites. Why not start now? Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Pattern Mixing We don’t know what we love most about this Marimekko look: the fitted floral turtleneck, the billowing retro-esque maxi skirt, or the way the mismatched patterns come together. And that’s before we get to the fuzzy handbag. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Full Skirt Another major trend for 2024? Voluminous maxi skirts that demand attention. We’d say the ruffled purple one seen here (thrillingly paired with a tomato-red top!) fits the bill exactly. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Barbiecore Frills Not ready to say goodbye to Barbiecore pink just yet? Valentine’s Day offers the perfect cover — go as pink and frilly as your heart desires. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Pink Accessories Whether you’re opting to keep things low-key this year or don’t usually wear head-to-toe pink, you can still get in the Valentine’s Day spirit by adding soft touches of the hue to your outfit through accessories. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Red + Pink If you’re not going to pair red and pink together on Valentine’s Day, when are you going to do it? Look to see what you already have in your closet, and build your outfit from there. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Knee-High Boots Not 100 percent sure about what to wear? Make your footwear the star, like the metallic silver knee-high slouchy boots that complete this outfit. Valentine’s Day Outfit Idea: Oversized Blazer + Dress The officewear trend isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so embrace it this Valentine’s Day by pairing an oversized blazer with your go-to date-night dress. Bonus points if it’s red, like the one pictured here. Like what you see?
