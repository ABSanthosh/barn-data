Any products or services put forward appear in no particular order. if you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. In the wide, wide world of wardrobe basics, there’s one staple you don’t ever want to skimp on. That staple, of course, is underwear. No, really. You can’t do your bits and pieces like that. I won’t stand for it. To prove it, I’m even going to share my picks for the most comfortable underwear for men with you. They’re breathable, durable, thoughtfully designed, made of outstanding materials, and patiently awaiting their turn to spoil your nether regions. Which is only a weird sentence if you make it one. And as I’m wont to do, I’ve chosen my top picks across a diverse range of categories, from luxury boxer briefs to performance underwear and multiple points between. If you haven’t put any thought into how a quality pair of cozy underwear can improve your range of motion, temperature regulation, and overall comfort, it’s time to do exactly that. Key Takeaways To find the most comfortable underwear, I began by researching dozens of pairs and analyzing their materials, construction, customer reviews, photos, and my own stash of gear. The resulting 10 pairs are the best of the best based on factors that include but aren’t limited to comfort, breathability, fabrics used, price, and style. Edging out the competition is my top overall pick, the Cooper Boxer Brief from Wahts. On its heels is my budget pick, Fruit of the Loom’s Coolzone multipack of boxer briefs. In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsWhy You Should Trust Us Final VerdictFAQs meundies / Instagram 1. Best Overall: Wahts Cooper Boxer Brief Why they’re great: Men’s apparel brand Wahts is based in Amsterdam and has a global bricks-and-mortar footprint. It’s been elevating and updating anything from basics to outwear since 2012. The Cooper Boxer Brief, like other Wahts pieces, has outdone itself with a ridiculously soft cotton-elastane blend, outstanding breathability, and a design and colorways that deserve to be seen. How they feel: These are fitted boxer briefs that incorporate the perfect amount of elastane to provide an ample range of motion. The generous gusset and soft cotton construction provide a cozy, chaffe-free feel. When I’m looking for some underwear to wear on a Saturday or before I dig into a big meal, there aren’t many other options I’d reach for. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Your partner will love the low rise and tight fit of Wahts’ Cooper Boxer Brief when the clothes come off, but it’s a relatively specific fit and feel overall. Or am I projecting? Either way, there you have it. Sizes Available: S – XXL | Colors Available: 6 | Material: 95% Cotton, 5% Elastane | Style: Boxer briefs 2. Best Everyday: London Sock Co Seeing Double Boxers Why they’re great: London Sock Co’s boxers incorporate 95% lyocell—a highly breathable, luxuriously soft fabric. There’s just enough stretch in these understated, durable boxers to give them an invisible feel throughout the day, and their pouch shape and length help reduce chafing. How they feel: The most comfortable underwear should do its job in the background without you even knowing it’s there. These silky-soft lyocell boxer briefs do exactly that. Flaws but not dealbreakers: London Sock Co’s boxers come in three muted colors—black, gray, and navy. Look elsewhere if you’d rather lean into bold colors or designs. Sizes Available: S – XL | Colors Available: 3 | Material: 95% Lyocell, 5% Elastane | Style: Boxer briefs 3. Best Performance: CDLP Performance Boxer Brief Why they’re great: If you live an active lifestyle or are prone to chafing, put the ball powder down and proceed directly to CDLP’s Performance Boxer Briefs. This ready-for-action underwear features non-chafing seams and mesh panels for maximum breathability. The polyester-elastane blend is also sweat-wicking, odor-resisting, and quick-drying. How they feel: Every fiber of these performance boxer briefs was designed to keep you cool, dry, and moving freely throughout the day. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Similar to London Sock Co’s limited color choices, these briefs are only available in black. Sizes Available: XS – XXL | Colors Available: 1 | Material: 91% Recycled Polyester, 9% Elastane | Style: Boxer briefs 4. Best Budget: Fruit Of The Loom Coolzone Boxer Briefs Multipack Why they’re great: Fruit of the Loom, right? You knew it would sneak its reliable, well-constructed, old-school way into this list, didn’t you? I hope so, because the legendary brand’s Coolzone multipack offers an incredible value for unfussy guys in search of 100% cotton boxer briefs that are as comfortable as they are affordable. How they feel: These boxer briefs are designed to fade into the background in the best way possible. They’re soft, comfortable, sturdy, stretchy, and nothing to write home about. But again, that’s a good thing. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The Coolzone multipack is for the generalist. The every man who wants comfort, quality, and not much else. Those seeking technical performance, bells, or whistles won’t find them here. Sizes Available: S – 5XL | Colors Available: Dozens | Material: 100% Cotton | Style: Boxer briefs 5. Best Luxury: Tom Ford Velvet-Trimmed Stretch-Silk Satin Boxer Shorts Why they’re great: Tom Ford. Silk. Velvet. Yeah, these are your after-hours boxers. The ones meant to be seen. But until that point comes, allow yourself to be spoiled by the stretch-silk satin, velvet waistband, and airy, lightweight feel of these luxurious boxer shorts. How they feel: Every inch of these Tom Ford boxers has been designed with pampering your lower half in mind. Light as air, they’re all about comfort. Flaws but not dealbreakers: This one probably goes without saying, but paying over $300 for a pair of boxers is… not for everyone. Sizes Available: S – XXL | Colors Available: 2 | Material: 93% Silk, 7% Elastane | Style: Boxer shorts 6. Best On Amazon: Tommy John Second Skin 4” Trunks Why they’re great: A great deal of thought went into the contours, fabrics, and features of Tommy John’s Second Skin trunks. The four-inch inseam is great for guys who prefer less fabric around their thighs. Meanwhile, the modal-spandex blend is lightweight, soft, breathable, and provides just enough stretch. Ample room in the pouch keeps the goods secure but not cramped, and a unique horizontal fly provides easy access. How they feel: Modal does an excellent job of resisting piling, resulting in a smooth, even feel, and a generous amount of incorporated spandex increases your range of motion. Flaws but not dealbreakers: I personally love the idea of a horizontal fly for easy access. That said, there’s likely going to be a learning curve that may or may not cause some initial frustration. Sizes Available: S – XXL | Colors Available: 4 | Material: 90% Modal, 10% Spandex | Style: Boxer briefs 7. Best Fun: MeUndies Stretch Cotton Boxer Brief Why they’re great: MeUndies has developed a well-earned reputation over the years for making some of the most comfortable underthings featuring some of the most fun and interesting designs. Yes, the stretch cotton fabric of their boxer briefs is incredibly comfortable. Yes, the six-inch inseam provides outstanding protection against chafing. And yes, they come in gloriously ridiculous patterns featuring things like bananas, coffee, tacos, and foxes. How they feel: MeUndies’ cotton-spandex material is soft and smooth. Ample pouch room is incorporated to keep things fresh down there and the fabric resists bunching and riding up. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Like the four-inch inseam of Tommy Johns’ briefs, MeUndies’ six-inch inseam falls just north of the sweet spot for a lot of guys. This is a great length to help reduce chafing but won’t be right for everyone. Sizes Available: S – 4XL | Colors Available: 17 | Material: 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex | Style: Boxer briefs 8. Best Summer: Saxx DropTemp Cooling Mesh Boxer Briefs Why they’re great: Which brings us to Saxx and the Vancouver-based brand’s DropTemp Cooling Mesh Boxer Briefs. Of course, they do an outstanding job of wicking away sweat, regulating odor, and providing breathability. But my favorite feature of these boxer briefs is the Ballpark Pouch. It’s essentially a built-in hammock that cradles the boys and creates a physical barrier between them and the rest of your crotch. We’re talking peak netherregion innovation here—especially when it comes to reducing chafing and irritation during hot summer days. How they feel: Temperature regulation and anti-chafing are priorities for Saxx’s DropTemp briefs. They’ll keep you cool and dry when it’s hot out and cozy and relaxed in bed. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Though these briefs are versatile and ready for anything, they’re another niche pair that’s best suited for guys with active lifestyles. Sizes Available: XS – XXL | Colors Available: 6 | Material: 85% Recycled Polyester, 15% Elastane | Style: Boxer briefs 9. Best Quick-Drying: Bombas Active Flyless Boxer Brief  Why they’re great: At the heart of these super functional boxer briefs from Bombas is their micro-mesh material that quickly wicks away moisture. The flyless pouch is supportive and roomy and the leg openings are designed to stay put regardless of what you’re getting into. You’ve got six handsome colors to choose from and with available sizes of up to 3XL, they’re also a great option for big guys. How they feel: Ever worn Bombas socks? I sure have (which surely means you have too). Picture that feeling but a little bit higher. They’re soft, stretchy, lightweight, and won’t ride or bunch up. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Though I could make a number of cases for the overall versatility of these briefs, they’re a niche offering best deployed during workouts or other active scenarios. Sizes Available: S – 3XL | Colors Available: 6 | Material: 86% Recycled Polyester, 14% Elastane | Style: Boxer briefs 10. Best Winter: Mack Weldon 18-Hour Jersey Boxer Brief Why they’re great: Mack Weldon’s 18-Hour boxer briefs have a ribbed texture and a substantial, weighty feel to help keep you toasty when the temps drop. While I certainly wouldn’t drop your thermal underwear or thermal shirts in favor of these briefs or non-technical tops, they’re more than capable of keeping you cozy and warm during winter’s leisurely endeavors. How they feel: I’m trying to resist the urge to say something like, “They feel like a warm hug,” but it looks like that ship has just sailed. So there you go. I find them especially helpful for those late-night walks with my dog. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The 18-Hour brief features a two-button as opposed to the more common open fly. While this presents a cool, heritage look, it’s a significant departure from the easy access you’re likely used to. Sizes Available: S – XXL | Colors Available: 4 | Material: 47.5% Cotton, 47.5% Modal, 5% Spandex | Style: Boxer briefs saneldzubur / Instagram Buying Considerations For The Most Comfortable Underwear For Men Material From cotton to polyester, silk to lyocell, and every material in between, what’s comfortable to you depends on your personal preference. Cotton is incredibly soft and breathable. Silk is nearly unmatched in its luxurious skin feel. The nuances and characteristics go on and on—just make sure your skin type and the materials you choose get along. Features Pay attention to the features incorporated into your underwear. Are there strategically placed vents to help regulate temperature? Is the fly vertical or horizontal? How much spandex is in the fabric mix and will it provide an adequate range of movement for your lifestyle? Gone are the days of cookie cutter underwear. Now more than ever, advancements in technology and manufacturing processes are opening the door for some exciting and useful features. Style One of the most basic and important considerations for determining the most comfortable underwear for you is the style. Boxer briefs are one of the most popular options, but they’re not for everyone. Before honing in on some of your favorite pairs, figure out whether you prefer briefs, boxer briefs, boxer shorts, trunks, thongs (hey, to each their own), or all of the above. Why You Should Trust Us As a fashion and grooming writer at FashionBeans, I compare, test, and research the products that make a gentleman a gentleman. If it can be worn, carried, or used in a way that elevates your look and feel, I’m into it. For this review, I pored over trusted sources, dozens of pairs of underwear, fabrics, customer reviews, and my own cache of basics to understand what makes the most comfortable underwear for men. After comparing over 40 pairs, I chose the resulting 10 based on considerations like comfort, breathability, materials used, price, and style. Ultimately, I want to see everyone find the right essentials for them.   wahts_official / Instagram Final Verdict The most comfortable underwear for men should be breathable, durable, and made of outstanding materials. You’re spoiled for choice in the category, but my top pick—the Cooper boxer brief from Wahts—is the total package. Pun probably-definitely intended. FAQ The question of what is the most comfortable underwear for men is highly subjective and depends on your skin type, how prone you are to chafing, whether you run hot or cold, and many other factors. 100% cotton is generally going to provide the highest functional level of breathability and comfort. But from lyocell and silk to proprietary fabric blends, the comfort-sky’s the limit. Though this is another matter of personal preference, two of the most comfortable fabrics to sleep in are silk and cotton. As for style, some prefer boxer shorts due to how unrestrictive they are, others prefer boxer briefs which don’t tend to bunch up like looser styles.
