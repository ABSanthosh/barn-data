  "text": "They say the car we drive reveals something about us, whether it’s small and discreet, large and imposing, or sleek and aerodynamic. But if a vehicle can embody our personality, what happens when we wrap our body in the essence of an automotive brand?Ferrari, a company that has long risen to style challenges, presents its spring/summer 2025 collection with a bold and fascinating vision: our wardrobe as a space in which each garment mirrors the identity we wish to project. Under Rocco Iannone’s creative guidance, the Ferrari Cabinet takes shape with sinuous lines, dynamic volume, and harmonious curves, translating the fluidity of racing into textiles that caress the figure with all the grace of a luxury sports car on asphalt. The collection’s silhouettes trace and enhance the body’s contours without constricting them, elevating themselves with details that celebrate Italian artisanal savoir-faire. The Radica leather featured on several of the line’s pieces, inspired by 1970s steering wheels, is buffered and burnished by hand, and comes in a number of signature hues that match the classic Ferrari colors. The brand’s iconic red evolves into warm hues such as tobacco, leather, terra-cotta and ivory, while the richest fabrics utilize its brilliant yellow. Completing the narrative are the line’s handbags and accessories, true protagonists of Ferrari’s automotive soul. Inspired by the racing world’s mechanical instruments, they combine aesthetic and function, paying homage to the union of innovation and tradition that has always defined the Prancing Horse brand. It adds up to a statement not merely about fashion, but also about a legendary company’s bold identity.The Ferrari Cabinet’s creative essence comes to life in photographer Willy Vanderperre’s spring/summer campaign (his third for the Maison), in which wardrobe becomes an intimate space in which we can explore a silent dialogue with ourselves. Against a background of luxurious stage curtains, mirrors, and leather seats exemplifying the Ferrari style, the models admire their own reflected images: a symbolic threshold between the inner world and what we project to others. In this powerful visual narration, fashion and introspection intertwine to reveal the authentic beauty of those who wear Ferrari.Willy VanderperreWilly VanderperreEngineering Meets FashionWhat happens when the technical world of racing meets sartorial elegance? Nello, The Ferrari Tool Case is born: an iconic accessory reinterpreting the toolboxes of the company’s factory workers in Maranello, Italy, with a luxurious modern twist. This leather vanity, a tribute to Ferrari’s ingenuity, contains a story in its every detail, from its inner Alcantara fabric lining, to metal appliqués reminiscent of the rivets on the legendary cars, to flowing fringes made from regenerated leather—a nod to sustainability that doesn’t skimp on beauty. Nello is available in seven colors and materials, in an homage to Ferrari’s seventh collection, but also as a style manifesto for those seeking an accessory that blends character, artisanship, and elegance.courtesy of FerrariA silhouette that weaves together retro elegance and modernity, a rigid geometric shape defined by hand-painted edges: it’s La Ferrari Dino Bag, the handbag that celebrates the legendary Dino automobile presented by Enzo Ferrari at the 1969 Turin Motor Show. First launched as part of the 2024 autumn/winter collection, it returns in new guises: from the refined mini bag, made for grand occasions, to the versatile bowling bag and the spacious duffel bag, perfect for travel.courtesy of FerrariThe Convergence of Artisanship and Modern LifestyleIntimate and enveloping like the cockpit of a race car, the Ferrari Cabinet celebrates the deep connection between garment and body, turning a wardrobe into a narrative space conveying not just its wearer’s individuality, but also its stylist’s creative vision. The perfect balance of artisanship and modernity comes to life through iconic materials: soft, luminous Nappa leather envelops the body’s contours with discreet sensuality, while denim, reimagined through workwear sensibilities, reveals new facets thanks to a brushed finish that underscores its versatility. Three-dimensional embroideries with eye-catching sartorial details convey an air of couture elegance, turning the Maranello emblem into a refined macramé patchwork. This is a harmony of textures and details envisioned for those who wish to wear the Ferrari world, where innovation and tradition converse in perfect unison.courtesy of Ferrari",
