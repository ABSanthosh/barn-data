  "text": "For the fall/winter 2025 season in London, designers incorporated vibrant shades of color, such as blues and maroons, along with a variety of prints, like bold florals and classic plaids. Even though some key players were missing from the calendar (J.W. Anderson and Molly Goddard, to name a couple), brands managed to bring an exciting variety of trends to the runway. Here, eight trends to know from London Fashion Week.Icy BluesThis cool-toned shade of blue brought an icy punch of color to the catwalk. Designers managed to showcase the versatile hue through a variety of materials, including satins, sequin embellishments, and knitwear. Florals All Year Round Florals for spring? Not anymore. This season, designers didn’t hold back on this bold print, providing a vibrant pop of color to their collections and making our next winter wardrobe feel slightly warmer. Cinched TailoringDesigners managed to make tailoring feel slightly more sexy this season with an emphasis on the torso. Seen through a variety of coats and jackets, the pieces contoured nicely around the waist, allowing for a seamless fit. Winter PlaidsA classic British staple, plaids dominated this season’s collections. The timeless print was showcased in a variety of ways, from oversized wool coats to minidresses and more.Wine TonesWine tones, which have already gained popularity in the market, were back in full force in London. Exhibited through a variety of leather and knitwear, the deep color managed to bring a romantic feel to the dreary winter months.Endless Fringe Fringe managed to make its presence known yet again on the London runways. This dynamic embellishment brought some added movement, whether it be through hems on skirts or embellishments throughout a dress. The Full-Length SkirtThe length of skirts dropped to the floor this season. Emilia Wickstead, Mark Fast, Edeline Lee, and more brought extra length to their skirts while also managing to provide some extra warmth in the cold.Artistic ExpressionFashion has long been considered an art form. This interpretation was taken to the next level by displaying actual artistic works on the garments themselves. Take, for instance, a simple stroke of gold paint or a full-blown portrait.",
