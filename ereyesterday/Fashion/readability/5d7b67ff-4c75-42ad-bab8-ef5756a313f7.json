But a majority of sales over the past year have been at independent boutiques like Yucca, the store in Denver where Ms. Cohen bought them.“In my mind they defy logic,” said Kimberly Keim, the owner of Yucca, who started selling the socks two years ago. Their appearance has also confused some customers: “They are just so thin like a piece of paper,” she added. “A lot of folks pick them up and think they are single use.” (They are not.)Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
