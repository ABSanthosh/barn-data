Earlier this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s attempts to restart the deportations, which a federal judge had blocked earlier in March. On Friday, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to allow it to resume the deportations.At Cecot, as Ms. Noem filmed a video in front of a row of prisoners that were crowded tightly into bunks behind bars, her flashy watch bulged from her wrist, standing out in an austere scene.The display led to a great deal of criticism on social media from people who questioned the taste of wearing such a pricey watch for the visit. Cecot, which opened in 2023 and was designed to hold as many as 40,000 prisoners, was a signature initiative of Nayib Bukele, the El Salvadoran president who has gained an international reputation for dealing with his country’s gang problem through mass incarceration — a campaign that has been criticized by multiple human rights groups.In a statement about the watch, Tricia McLaughlin, homeland security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, wrote that Ms. Noem used the proceeds of her books “to purchase an item she could wear and one day pass down to her children.” Ms. McLaughlin did not address the decision to wear that potential heirloom to Cecot.ImageRolex Daytonas, like the one Ms. Noem wore in El Salvador, were first introduced in 1963.Credit...Pool photo by Alex BrandonThank you for your patience while we verify access.
