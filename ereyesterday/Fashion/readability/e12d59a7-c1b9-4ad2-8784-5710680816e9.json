If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here.Without fail, every holiday season, you have a few hard-to-shop-for folks — the ones with very specific tastes and interests, from the mom who wants nothing to the hard-to-please Gen Z friend — on your gift list. But also without fail, Free People’s Gift Shop saves the day: The edit is packed with picks for everyone from the passionate yogi and the cozy homebody to the hostess with the mostest and the doting pet parent. Since we know gifting can feel overwhelming, with endless options available and those looming shipping deadlines, we’ve scoped out Free People’s new arrivals and Gift Shop to curate a list of the best products for every giftee. From under-$50 finds (like candles and scarves) to splurge-worthy picks (like the retailer’s excellent bundles), read on to uncover presents that fit your budget and are guaranteed to spark a squeal on unwrapping day. If you’re hoping for free shipping and a quick turnaround, you’ll have to order your Free People gifts by the end of day on December 18 to have them arrive on December 24 — just in time for Christmas day and the start of Hannukah.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Free People Gifts For The Fashion Trendsetter If your giftee is devoted to following the latest trends, you’re in the right place: Free People has editor- and reader-favorite barrel-leg jeans, festive oversized scarves, and bag charms — all of which will put a smile their face.

DashDividers_1_500x100 Free People Gifts For The Cozy Homebody Free People has several gift bundles for the homebody, like the sleep set above.

The retailer also has loungewear sets and cozy slippers to elevate your giftee’s at-home style, without putting a strain on your wallet. DashDividers_1_500x100 Free People Gifts For The Host With The Most Every group has a Monica Geller, the one who assembles the perfect charcuterie board and has catalog-worthy decor. Show your appreciation with a gift as detail-oriented as they are, like a playful candle, chic fabric napkins, or a conversation-starting match cloche. These are also great for your holiday dinner hosts or that hard-to-shop-for mother-in-law. DashDividers_1_500x100 Free People Gifts For The Zen-Obsessed Yogi If your yoga-loving friend seems stuck in a black leggings rut, gift them a fresh workout set or onesie to enhance their flow.
