It is scheduled to run through April 27 and is the second in the “My World” series. The first, in 2022, matched jewelry makers with disabled residents of Finland.One of the new exhibits is a parure, or set, of matching jewelry, in amber, silver and 14-karat gold. It was designed by Kaisa Vuorinen, a goldsmith, and Ita Petrika-Lindroos, who moved to Finland from Latvia in 2009.The design of each piece features multiple strips of silver or gold wrapped around an amber bead, which, Ms. Vuorinen wrote in an email, symbolized the teachers and family members who had supported Ms. Petrika-Lindroos as she studied Finnish — a famously difficult language to learn — and worked as a cleaner and a waitress. She now has a career in human resources and, in 2022, earned a master’s degree in business administration.“I’ve felt exhaustion, fear, and uncertainty,” Ms. Petrika-Lindroos wrote in a note that visitors to the exhibition may access through a QR code. “But what has given me strength is the feeling that I am in the right place, surrounded by people who care about me.”ImageCuff bracelets by Inni Parnanen and Cleibe Tommila were created from plywood, ink and wax.Credit...Irene SemaThank you for your patience while we verify access.
