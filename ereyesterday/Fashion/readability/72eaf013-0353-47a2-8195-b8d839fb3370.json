We’re always more than happy to keep tabs on the best new Free People products to shop. While new releases can be overwhelming, we’re here to bring you the best-of-the-best options worth your attention and money.And now that summer is officially here, it’s a great time to take a deep dive into your closet to see what you need to re-stock. Do you need a new flowy dress? Maybe a new activewear set? What about a denim jacket for festival season? Free People has fresh styles that fit the bill.You’ll find many products coming from Free People’s fan-favorite collections like FP Movement, We The Free, and Free-est to suit any vibe you’re going for this summer. So without further ado, from clothing to accessories, here are the 15 best things to buy at Free People from its new arrivals section.Drea Sweater SetSpring may bring sunnier days, but the nights are still chilly. This 100% cotton set is the perfect in-between option for sleep and lounging; it’s a breathable, lightweight knit so you won’t overheat in bed, and the easy, oversized fit is comfy yet still refined. We’ve opted for this buttery yellow whilst we eagerly anticipate those longer days and lighter evenings.free-est Drea Sweater Set, $, available at Free PeopleOasis Midi DressEveryone needs that one throw-it-on-and-go dress — the kind that fits like a dream, is a complete outfit-in-one, and that works for all kinds of occasions. That’s what the Oasis Midi is; it’s not surprising that it’s one of Free People’s bestsellers. Now, it’s back for spring in an array of seasonal shades, like this crisp white, a soft periwinkle blue, warm dusty pink, and sage green.free-est Oasis Midi Dress, $, available at Free PeopleMy Time TeeA season of outdoor workouts, garden yoga sessions, and weekend hikes beckons. Get ready with warmer weather activewear, like this open-back top, perfectly suited for throwing over your sports bra and leggings.FP Movement My Time Tee, $, available at Free PeopleWe The Free Eden High Slouchy JeansThis season, it’s all about the slouch and drama when it comes to denim. Namely, Seventies-style flares and easy, low-rise bootcut fits (yep, think Kendrick at the Superbowl). We’ll be taking styling cues from Free People too, pairing our denim with pretty, feminine blouses and leather boots for a Western vibe.We The Free Eden High Slouchy Jeans, $, available at Free PeopleBlaze Pull-On BootsIf, like us, you’re perpetually refreshing Depop and eBay for a pair of vintage Frye boots, get excited. Free People has finally created its own Seventies-style campus boots that are a dead ringer. Wear now to face late-winter storms, and then later with your prettiest mini dress for a cool soft-meets-tough fit.FP Collection Blaze Pull-On Boots, $, available at Free PeopleForever Young PantsLast summer’s lace bloomer shorts trend isn’t going anywhere. Rather, it has grown legs — literally, taking on a more historic, Victorian trouser silhouette. Of course, Free People does vintage-inspired fashion the best. You can dress these down easily with a graphic tee and sneakers, or up for a date with ballet flats and delicate camisole.Intimately Forever Young Pants, $, available at Free PeopleNocturnal Solid CardiThis is about to become your most worn piece. Layer over dresses and camis, or button up and wear as a top with your favorite jeans or midi skirts. It helps that there are so many different shades to choose from too — Easter egg pink, Kelly green, buttercup yellow, lilac, heather gray… You name it.Free People Nocturnal Solid Cardi, $, available at Free PeopleWe The Free Easy That Canvas JacketSay hello to the perfect spring jacket. The boxy fit makes layering easy, but come warmer days, the sturdy canvas material won’t have you feeling overheated. Plus, plenty of pockets for stashing snacks when on your next hike!We The Free Easy That Canvas Jacket, $, available at Free PeopleQuick Step PantsThese lounge pants tick all the right boxes. They’re made in a lightweight, super comfy and breathable material, and they have a super flattering, cropped bell bottom fit. You’re bound to reach for these more than your old, tired leggings.FP Movement Quick Step Pants, $, available at Free PeopleRetro Heatwave Gingham One-PieceWhat better way to get ready for picnic season than donning head-to-toe gingham? Break up the print with colorful sneakers or ballet flats, and your fave denim jacket or oversized knit.Free People Retro Heatwave Gingham One-Piece, $, available at Free PeopleSelia SlipThough we’re desperate to throw on a summer dress, the weather won’t play ball for a few more months. To satisfy that itch, we’ll be styling our minis and tunics over jeans — also a great styling tip for lacey, barely-there slips like this.Intimately Selia Slip, $, available at Free PeopleEverette Platform ClogsUnconventional shoe fans rejoice, the reign of the clog is far from over. In fact, we anticipate seeing more of these bad boys stomping around this spring. Not sure how to style your pair?
