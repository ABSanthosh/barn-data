  "description": "Fall weather has brought all her wardrobe favorites with her. In addition to cardigan sweaters and boots, there’s the transitional jacket, a beloved autumnal classic. Whether you want something to just throw on for a quick dog walk in the early morning or a more buttoned-up (excuse the pun) style for evening events, there’s a topper out there for everyone.The best fall jackets (not to be confused with their heavier cousins, coats) are lightweight enough for layering when the temps aren't quite warm, but not yet cold — the Goldilocks of your seasonal closet, if you will.
