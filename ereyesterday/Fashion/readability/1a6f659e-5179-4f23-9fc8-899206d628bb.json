  "text": "I first learned the power of Tory Burch 14 years ago, when I brought a black clutch a chic friend had given me to a Christmas party—and the hostess said, “You can leave that here when you go home.”She was kidding. (I think.) But I took note that when I want to upgrade an outfit, a Tory Burch accessory helps. Which is how I found myself staring at the mother-of-pearl face of the Tory Burch Gold Pavé Oval Watch. Two rings of pavé stones circled the watch face—which in horological terms is, apparently, called “the dial.” They matched the halo around my engagement ring, so I slipped on the chain-link bracelet.I was marveling at the opalescent beauty of the dial when I suddenly realized why I could see it so clearly: It was practically naked. Not only were there no second hands, there were no minute hands. No numbers at all. The only markings were minimalist gold lines where the 3, 6, and 9 would be, and the 12 spot was marked by the stacked T's that make up the Tory Burch logo. Tory BurchFor a minute, I second-guessed (no pun intended) the watch I had just fallen in love with: How could I live without knowing the time down to the last second—not to mention my heart rate, how many steps I’d taken, and if I’d gotten a text message? Then a line popped into my head, something I read in a novel two, maybe three decades ago. “Beautiful women never run,” an older character told the young protagonist. “They don’t have to.”I remember puzzling over the phrase at the time. I took it to mean that when a woman is beautiful and confident, she doesn’t need to rush through her life, running to fit other people’s schedules. If she’s a few seconds, or even minutes, late, they’ll wait.I hadn’t thought of that book—whose title I don’t even remember—in years. But that was how this watch was making me feel: like I could slow down and take my time. It made me feel beautiful, made me believe I am someone who is worth the wait.Tory Burch Tory Burch Oval WatchAnd while the watch looks elegant—gorgeous, in fact, at a fraction of the price of most elite luxury timepieces—the gold-tone stainless steel is light and comfortable. When I wore it, the bracelet, pavé rings, and mother-of-pearl dial added just the right amount of gleam and sparkle to my otherwise everyday work-from-home ensembles. It glinted off the water when I walked around the reservoir in Central Park in the morning. It put a smile on my face, shining up at me, as I typed on my laptop. And when I met a work colleague for dinner downtown, it made me feel confident and self-assured.Now it’s not just the watch dial that’s streamlined; my style is, too. Whatever I’m wearing, this timepiece goes with it. It’s elegant enough for holiday parties, but understated enough for every day. It’s a no-brainer go-to, as smart as it is beautiful.And that’s because it doesn’t just look good, it makes me feel good. I had forgotten how nice it is to not wear a computer on my wrist. To not get zapped every time a text comes in or a new member of the cabinet is appointed, and rather to check my phone when I want to and respond to texts when I can. This Tory Burch watch helped me realize I don’t want a life that’s regimented down to the very last second. I’d rather have one where time is told in pavé stones—part of what makes this watch one that was well worth waiting for.",
