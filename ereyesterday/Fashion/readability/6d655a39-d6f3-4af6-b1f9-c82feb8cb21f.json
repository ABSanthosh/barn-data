Even if you already have a favorite, consider Nautica. I certainly have. Nautica is an ocean-themed lifestyle brand. Their cologne line focuses on a range of smells suitable for active, outdoor lifestyles, especially near the ocean, which, as we know, is a powerful draw for the head and the heart. Most of their smells work equally well in formal settings as some of the finest colognes for men. I went through their catalog and tested many of their products to find the ones I like most. Keep reading for my thoughts on the best Nautica colognes on the market. Key Takeaways I think Nautica’s Voyage Eau De Toilette is the best choice for most buyers thanks to its balance of price, smell, and size. The green apple in the top notes seals the deal here, as it’s a pleasant smell in practically every environment. As an alternative, the Nautica Blue is a safe bet and easily one of their most popular products. Both of those easily grace any list of the best Nautica colognes. In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsWhy You Should Trust Us Final VerdictFAQs nautica / Instagram Best Overall: Nautica Voyage Eau De Toilette Nautica’s Voyage is a lightly-scented Eau De Toilette, and in my experience, it’s one of the top colognes women love. The high notes include greenery (in the form of both leaves and lotus) mixed with green apples, while the cedarwood in the base reinforces the fruity smell. Why it’s great: Voyage is Nautica’s highlight smell and with good reason. Apple is a pleasant scent, natural and sweet without being too overpowering in nearly any situation. There’s a reason that apple juice is the base for many mixed-fruit drinks. Meanwhile, the light concentration means this perfume can avoid becoming too overpowering even if you wear it all day. Who is this for?: Nautica prices this reasonably for a perfume. I’ve seen much higher price tags for smaller bottles of weaker scents, so I usually feel like I’m getting a bargain whenever I’m picking this up. Nautica sells it in several sizes, including a larger 6.7 fluid-ounce container if you want to get it in bulk. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I think this is one of the best woody colognes. Fruit and wood smells go together in the wilderness, so they work on a fundamental level. However, some people find this sort of scent a turn-off. Know your audience. Top Notes: Green Apple, Leaves, Lotus | Middle Notes: Water Lotus | Base Notes: Cedarwood, Marine, Amber | Size: 3.3 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Summer Best Budget: Nautica Classic Eau de Toilette Nautica’s Classic fragrance is a comfortably sized spray bottle with a range of floral and tree scents to it. Beyond the top notes above, it features coriander, neroli, and lemon. I find that the higher notes complement the subtler ones well, melding together into a final, pleasant style. Why it’s great: Scent aside, the real reason to consider this perfume is its price. The Classic is one of Nautica’s most affordable products, despite the overall quality. I think it’s one of the best sandalwood colognes, which is rather high praise considering how common sandalwood is in perfumes. Who is this for?: That said, the one note that truly stands out to me is the cinnamon. In my experience, that’s kind of a love-it-or-hate-it smell (and flavor), by which I mean that most people like it or don’t. I think you’ll enjoy this cologne if you like cinnamon, but consider other options on this list if you don’t. You’ll usually find this Nautica cologne in 3.4-ounce containers, which is a common size for perfumes. The scent should last a full day with about five sprays, even with heavy exercise. Expect it to be stronger right when you use it but to quickly settle into something better throughout the day. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Five sprays is a lot, to some people. Keep that in mind if you’re aiming for all-day coverage. Top Notes: Bergamot, Cinnamon, Lime | Middle Notes: Geranium, Jasmine, Rose | Base Notes: Musk, Sandalwood | Size: 3.4 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Spring Best on Amazon: Nautica Blue Eau De Toilette This perfume is the only Nautica cologne that I didn’t pick with my criteria, and here’s why. I’ve handled perfumes and smells for most of my life, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the customer is always right in matters of taste. Overall product quality matters significantly less than whether someone likes it or not, so by public vote, this is the best of the best Nautica colognes. Why it’s great: That’s why I decided to balance my own opinions with the public’s choice. Nautica’s Blue cologne is one of the best overall choices, as evidenced by maintaining an exceptionally high rating on Amazon after more than 24,000 reviews. It’s one thing to distrust a high score with only a few reviews, but this is well past the point of doubt. Even better, Nautica offers the Blue scent in a range of sizes, from a 0.5-ounce sampler to a more traditional 3.4-ounce pack (the standard volume for most bottles). Although it’s not quite as budget-friendly as the Classic, it’s close to their other products and usually stays in an affordable range. Who is this for?: If you’re not sure which product to get, I suggest Blue. Most people enjoy the mix of sandalwood and pineapple as the main notes, and the sampler bottle is a great way to test its scent at minimal investment. I like the Voyage better, but it’s almost impossible to go wrong with the Blue. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The one possible downside of such a popular perfume is that you won’t be the only one in the room wearing it. If this bothers you, then perhaps consider going with something still distinctive but possibly less hot-thing-of-the-moment. Top Notes: Bergamot, Pineapple | Middle Notes: Jasmine, Water Lily | Base Notes: Sandalwood | Size: 3.4 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Summer Best Smelling: Nautica Voyage N-83 Don’t confuse the N-83 with the regular Voyage, as they have significantly different smells. A few things stand out about these bottles compared to the others I’ve discussed, but I want to call attention to the base notes. It’s one thing to look for the best musk cologne, but it’s unusual to see a single perfume also add cedarwood and sandalwood to musk. The reason Nautica does this is that the N-83 is a significantly more aquatic scent than the regular Voyage. Although my overall favorite has a pleasantly sweet aroma, the N-83 is saltier and smells much more like the ocean. If I’m being honest, I think I like it because I grew up near the coast, so it smells familiar to me. Why it’s great: The N-83 is relatively light for a perfume, with a milder overall scent than the regular Voyage. I think gentler scents work better than something overpowering, and the result is one of Nautica’s finest-smelling colognes. Who is this for?: As I said, though, this is mainly a matter of personal preference. Everyone has their own opinion on what smells best, so I suggest trying the smallest sizes of several products on this list, then choosing one to stick with. Flaws but not deal-breakers: As with a woody smell, the smell of the sea is not to everyone’s liking. Again, consider your audience. Top Notes: Aquaspace, Grain, Spearmint | Middle Notes: Cardamon, Lavender, Nutmeg | Base Notes: Cedarwood, Musk, Sandalwood | Size: 3.4 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Summer Best For Young Men: Nautica Life Energy Eau De Toilette The best cologne for young men can vary significantly from other demographics, and that’s okay. For younger men, stronger and sweeter colognes may end up being problematic. Why it’s great: Nautica’s Life Energy is a mild, clean-smelling cologne that can help mask some of the scents from school and provide a little refreshment throughout the day. It’s one of the mildest colognes on the list, with a primarily earthy and salty scent balanced out by the hint of grapefruit in the top notes. Who is this for?: Price-wise, it’s about average among the best Nautica cologne options. It’s a good fit for most young men. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The scent might be too mild for some. Top Notes: Bergamot, Grapefruit, Sea | Middle Notes: Ivy, Lily-of-the-Valley, Sage | Base Notes: Cedarwood, Musk, Vetiver | Size: 3.4 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Spring Best Nautica Cologne Set: Nautica Voyage Spray/Body Spray Set Voyage is my top choice from the best Nautica perfumes, and easily one of the best colognes under $50, so it’s probably no surprise that my favorite cologne set features it. This two-pack contains a regular Eau de Toilette bottle alongside the same scent in a six-ounce body spray. Why it’s great: Now, for those who aren’t familiar with these products, the main use of cologne is smelling good. In contrast, body sprays help stop bad smells. A good body spray will have chemicals that limit sweating, and in this case, it reinforces the cologne to provide a better overall smell. Who is this for?: Some people don’t need body sprays; others do. Factors like lifestyle, genetics, and environment affect your natural smell. If you use body spray, I can’t recommend this set enough. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The set contains both spray and body spray; if you or the person you’re buying for doesn’t use body spray, then maybe consider buying just the spray. Top Notes: Green Apple, Leaves, Lotus | Middle Notes: Water Lotus | Base Notes: Cedarwood, Marine, Amber | Size: 3.4 oz + 6 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette + Body Spray | Season: Summer Best Long-Lasting: Nautica Midnight Voyage Eau De Toilette As is the case with the Voyage N-83, Nautica’s Midnight Voyage is less like the original Voyage than you might expect from the packaging. All of its main notes are different. Why it’s great: The most accurate way I can describe this cologne is an earthier, somewhat more intense version of the Voyage. I instantly notice the difference when comparing them side-by-side, and this may be a good choice if you think the regular Voyage is too light or fruity. Who is this for?: Midnight Voyage is one of the best long-lasting colognes, making it ideal if you expect to be out for most of the day. Flaws but not deal-breakers: However, this cologne is half the size of most of Nautica’s products while being significantly more expensive at the same time. Midnight Voyage is essentially a premium fragrance, better for special occasions than everyday wear. It’s not absurd by industry standards, but this is worth mentioning in case you’re on a budget. Top Notes: Mint | Middle Notes: Pink Pepper | Base Notes: Amber | Size: 1.6 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Autumn Best Fresh Smelling: Nautica Voyage Sport Eau De Toilette Have you noticed a pattern in Nautica’s naming sense? The Voyage Sport is another in the line of similarly themed products that don’t smell too much like the original, though the apple remains a highlight. Still, its green pepper is much more unusual. Why it’s great: The Voyage Sport’s real highlight is its impressively fresh smell. The salt combines with citrus on the high notes to invoke a sense of being down on the Florida coast, while the flower, fruit, and vegetable scents augment the outdoor feeling. It isn’t my usual daily cologne, but I like using it on days when I want to feel a little fresher than usual. Who is this for?: This works well for someone wanting an all-day scent. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The green pepper scent might be too much for some. Top Notes: Citrus, Coriander, Sea Notes | Middle Notes: Apple, Geranium, Green Pepper, Palm Leaf | Base Notes: Brazilian Redwood, Musk, Patchouli, Vetiver | Size: 3.4 oz | Type: Eau de Toilette | Season: Summer nautica / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best Nautica Colognes Here are the three main things to consider when buying Nautica perfumes. Price Prices vary by store, but you can often find a bottle of the typical Nautica cologne for around $20 for 3.4 fluid ounces (the standard bottle size). Anything far below this is quite affordable for cologne; anything higher is on the more expensive side. Scent Scent is entirely a matter of preference. If you’re not sure you’ll enjoy the smell, try buying a small bottle first and going from there. Is it Long-lasting? Some people want longer-lasting colognes, so be sure to check reviews. That way, you’ll find the best Nautica men’s colognes rather than buy something that falls short of your expectations. perfumepalazzo / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us Jane Elmets knows fashion inside and out, having traveled the world and encountered many of the best scents out there. She has made a special study of men’s fashion, including colognes, and she is more than happy to share her expertise. At FashionBeans.com, we understand the importance of having just the right scent for the situation, no matter what that situation is, and we are dedicated to providing you with all the advice you want. Final Verdict I think Nautica Voyage is the best Nautica cologne for men because it has an excellent balance of price, size, smell, and longevity. It’s a great smell for most situations and a safe go-to choice. Remember, other people notice the way you smell, and one of the most effective ways to get noticed is with a good cologne. FAQ Nautica is a relatively new company in the perfume space, but I like that they have an excellent balance of price and quality. Good is a slightly subjective term for scents, but Nautica typically offers reliable quality and trustworthy manufacturing alongside a consistent smell. Colognes last for different amounts of time depending on things like the concentration and where you apply them. Some people find that it lasts about two hours for them, in which case touching it up throughout the day is prudent. Others can make it last for up to eight hours, meaning one application a day is enough.

Beyond the top notes above, it features coriander, neroli, and lemon. I find that the higher notes complement the subtler ones well, melding together into a final, pleasant style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: Scent aside, the real reason to consider this perfume is its price. The Classic is one of Nautica’s most affordable products, despite the overall quality. I think it’s one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-sandalwood-colognes/\" data-lasso-id=\"1356833\"\u003ebest sandalwood colognes\u003c/a\u003e, which is rather high praise considering how common sandalwood is in perfumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is this for?\u003c/b\u003e: That said, the one note that truly stands out to me is the cinnamon. In my experience, that’s kind of a love-it-or-hate-it smell (and flavor), by which I mean that most people like it or don’t. I think you’ll enjoy this cologne if you like cinnamon, but consider other options on this list if you don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll usually find this Nautica cologne in 3.4-ounce containers, which is a common size for perfumes.

I’ve handled perfumes and smells for most of my life, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the customer is always right in matters of taste. Overall product quality matters significantly less than whether someone likes it or not, so by public vote, this is the best of the best Nautica colognes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: That’s why I decided to balance my own opinions with the public’s choice. Nautica’s Blue cologne is one of the best overall choices, as evidenced by maintaining an exceptionally high rating on Amazon after more than 24,000 reviews. It’s one thing to distrust a high score with only a few reviews, but this is well past the point of doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven better, Nautica offers the Blue scent in a range of sizes, from a 0.5-ounce sampler to a more traditional 3.4-ounce pack (the standard volume for most bottles). Although it’s not quite as budget-friendly as the Classic, it’s close to their other products and usually stays in an affordable range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is this for?\u003c/b\u003e: If you’re not sure which product to get, I suggest Blue. Most people enjoy the mix of sandalwood and pineapple as the main notes, and the sampler bottle is a great way to test its scent at minimal investment.

A few things stand out about these bottles compared to the others I’ve discussed, but I want to call attention to the base notes.

Although my overall favorite has a pleasantly sweet aroma, the N-83 is saltier and smells much more like the ocean. If I’m being honest, I think I like it because I grew up near the coast, so it smells familiar to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: The N-83 is relatively light for a perfume, with a milder overall scent than the regular Voyage.

I’ve handled perfumes and smells for most of my life, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the customer is always right in matters of taste. Overall product quality matters significantly less than whether someone likes it or not, so by public vote, this is the best of the best Nautica colognes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: That’s why I decided to balance my own opinions with the public’s choice. Nautica’s Blue cologne is one of the best overall choices, as evidenced by maintaining an exceptionally high rating on Amazon after more than 24,000 reviews. It’s one thing to distrust a high score with only a few reviews, but this is well past the point of doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven better, Nautica offers the Blue scent in a range of sizes, from a 0.5-ounce sampler to a more traditional 3.4-ounce pack (the standard volume for most bottles). Although it’s not quite as budget-friendly as the Classic, it’s close to their other products and usually stays in an affordable range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is this for?\u003c/b\u003e: If you’re not sure which product to get, I suggest Blue. Most people enjoy the mix of sandalwood and pineapple as the main notes, and the sampler bottle is a great way to test its scent at minimal investment. I like the Voyage better, but it’s almost impossible to go wrong with the Blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFlaws but not deal-breakers\u003c/b\u003e: The one possible downside of such a popular perfume is that you won’t be the only one in the room wearing it.

Although my overall favorite has a pleasantly sweet aroma, the N-83 is saltier and smells much more like the ocean. If I’m being honest, I think I like it because I grew up near the coast, so it smells familiar to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy it’s great\u003c/b\u003e: The N-83 is relatively light for a perfume, with a milder overall scent than the regular Voyage. I think gentler scents work better than something overpowering, and the result is one of Nautica’s finest-smelling colognes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is this for?\u003c/b\u003e: As I said, though, this is mainly a matter of personal preference.
