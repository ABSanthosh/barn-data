If you thought you’d reached peak après-ski inspo on your Pinterest feed, think again: Skims just launched a collaboration with winter outerwear giant The North Face — and it’s giving chic, cozy chalet vibes. “This marks Skims first-ever foray into the world of winter wear, and partnering with The North Face allowed us to leverage their expertise in this category,” said Kim Kardashian, Skims co-founder and chief creative officer, in a press release. “I’ve spent a lot of time on the slopes, so I was definitely inspired when we were developing this collection and I can’t wait to wear these pieces on my next trip.”  The ski-inspired collection includes a range of cropped puffer jackets, skin-tight jumpsuits, layering tops, gloves, headwear, and more. It blends The North Face’s iconic, functional designs with Skims’ body-hugging silhouettes and signature neutrals. The result? Mixed-and-matched layers or striking monochromatic looks, perfect for winter activities — from ice skating and skiing to holiday shopping and hot cocoa dates.Sizes range from XXS through 3X in most apparel styles, and mule sizes 5 through 11; prices start at $60 for a beanie and go up to $1,200 for a down one-piece.“At The North Face, we always put innovation and functionality first, the collaboration space is no exception. With Skims, we maintained best-in-class constructions and materials and this collaboration came about from a mutual admiration,” said David Whetstone, North Face director of collaborations and energy, in the press release.  Whether you’re stocking up on cozy season essentials or leaning into Pantone’s Mocha Mousse, this collection will have you bundled up and looking good all winter long.
