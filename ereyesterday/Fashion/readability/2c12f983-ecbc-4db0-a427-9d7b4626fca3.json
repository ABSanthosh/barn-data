Christie’s is selling her collections, with sixteen of her jewels set to headline the auction house’s Magnificent Jewels sale on Dec. 10 in New York.Credit...D Gorton/The New York TimesNov. 28, 2024Mica Ertegun, the Romanian-born philanthropist turned globe-trotting New Yorker who died in December 2023, was a force. No idle lady who lunched, she set her discerning eye to work decorating her much-photographed homes and, as a founder of the celebrated interiors firm MAC II, the homes of her clients.Christie’s has been charged with selling her collections, which ranged from sculptures to silver, as well as her jewels, accents to a wardrobe that landed her in the International Best-Dressed List Hall of Fame. Sixteen of her treasures, including a pair of diamond earrings in what is called an old European cut and totaling more than 30 carats (estimated price $100,000-$150,000), and a coral and onyx necklace by Suzanne Belperron ($20,000-$30,000), are scheduled to headline the auction house’s Magnificent Jewels sale on Dec. 10 in New York.ImageA Cartier Art Deco brooch of ruby, pink tourmaline, diamond and onyx set in platinum, circa 1914, from Ms. Ertegun’s collection.Credit...Christie’sMuch like her interiors, Ms. Ertegun’s impulse was to mingle antique and contemporary elements in her jewels, such as a 19th-century suite of yellow gold, diamond and enamel jewels ($25,000-$35,000) and David Webb ear clips in pearl and rock crystal, circa 1970 ($6,000-$8,000). She was part of a “lost era of people who had their own taste and didn’t need anybody else’s approval or permission to be themselves,” said Claibourne Poindexter, a senior jewelry specialist and vice president at Christie’s. “They dressed for themselves.”Mr. Poindexter said there were several special pieces, including a torsade necklace of ruby beads ($80,000-$120,000) by JAR — the name by which Joel Arthur Rosenthal, a contemporary jeweler whose one-off pieces have a devoted following, was best known. “It’s obviously very unusual to have anything by JAR come up for sale,” he said. “I think for as long as I worked at Christie’s, maybe two JAR necklaces have come up for sale.” There is also a Cartier Art Deco brooch of ruby, pink tourmaline, diamond and onyx set in platinum, circa 1914.ImageA torsade necklace of ruby beads by JAR has an estimated auction price of $80,000 to $120,000.Credit...Christie’sThank you for your patience while we verify access.
