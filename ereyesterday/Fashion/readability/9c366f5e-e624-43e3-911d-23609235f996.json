Photograph: Gilbert Flores/WWD/Getty ImagesA global luxury slowdown has hit most fashion week brands hard but Coach is bucking the trend. It was the fastest rising name on the most recent quarterly index released by Lyst, which ranks brand “heat” based on sales and social media, using data from 200 million consumers.With demand up 332% year on year, Coach leapfrogged Alaïa, Gucci and Bottega Veneta to become the fifth hottest brand after Miu Miu, Saint Laurent, Prada and Loewe. The brand’s Brooklyn bag was named hottest product of the quarter in the rankings.Coach’s success speaks to fashion’s pricing problem. Many high-end luxury brands hiked prices in the years when demand was robust, a strategy dubbed “greedflation”, which is now backfiring. Consumers are now getting “sticker shock” – the phenomenon of being stunned by where price tags have reached – and not buying.The relatively affordable £250 starting price of the Brooklyn has put it on the map as a hero piece of the rising trend for “affordable luxury”.Coach’s fall 2025 RTW show drew on young adults’ preference for baggy clothes.
