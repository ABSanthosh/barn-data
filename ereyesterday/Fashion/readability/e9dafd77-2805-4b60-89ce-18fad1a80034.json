She must be wondering when they’ll move in together and get engaged. My son is not sure that “she’s the one,” but he hasn’t told her that. His reluctance to take their relationship to the next level is an indication, of course, but apparently, his girlfriend does not see this as a red flag. I assume that’s because she thinks things will change. I am very concerned for her: She’s 30 and wants marriage and children. I have told my son that he should end the relationship if he cares about her. Still, it continues. My husband says that I should stay out of this, but I’m wondering if I should push harder for my son to end things. Your thoughts?MOTHERI know you want to help. You also seem to have convinced yourself — in the absence of any request for advice or assistance from anyone — that intervening in your son’s relationship is required for his girlfriend’s long-term happiness. But no one has even whispered that she’s dissatisfied. To me, this looks like late-stage helicopter parenting: hovering so closely over your adult child that you also seek to control his romantic partner and their domestic timeline.Now, you’ve expressed these desires in altruistic terms: Let’s save the girlfriend! And that would be a generous impulse if your son’s girlfriend wanted saving. But I believe we should give a 30-year-old woman the agency to conduct her own affairs. Or at least let her own friends and family be the ones to meddle in them. Even if she has asked for your advice, which does not seem to be the case, send her to a neutral party for help — like a therapist or a couple’s counselor.I acknowledge the implicit premise that, in retrospect, many people believe they stayed too long in relationships. But ending love affairs is not a decision we get to make for other people. I hope your son and his girlfriend are communicating well. But projecting your assumptions onto them is not helpful. My advice for you is to back off and to work on creating healthier boundaries with your 29-year-old son instead.ImageCredit...Miguel PorlanJust an Early Jump on the TruthMy late brother had a son with another woman while he was married to his wife and now widow. We didn’t know anything about it. This nephew has since revealed himself to me, my children and my late brother’s children, and we have all come to love and accept him. Now he wants to introduce himself to my brother’s widow. She may accept him, as he hopes, but I expect she will be shocked and hurt by her husband’s infidelity and reject him. Should I discourage my nephew from telling her?Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
