The wiggly waistline was inspired by an lamp designed by the artist Alberto Giacometti.ImageAriana Grande’s Schiaparelli gown was decorated with more than 190,000 crystal sequins, rhinestones and beads.Credit...Nina Westervelt for The New York TimesImageErivo’s signature fingernails were decorated with elaborate, hand-sculpted gilded art, including a tiny watch and clock.Credit...Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York TimesMs. Erivo, who is nominated for best actress, opted for a shade of deep forest green, so dark it almost appeared black at first glance. But make no mistake, the subtle homage was intentional. Speaking with E! on the red carpet, she said the velvet Louis Vuitton gown — with an almost vampiric architectural collar — was a “nod to Oz, a nod to the green, and a nod to old Hollywood.” Her signature fingernails by the nail artist Mycah Dior were decorated with elaborate, hand-sculpted gilded art, including a tiny watch and clock.Over the course of the “Wicked” press tour, both stars regularly stepped out in styles that referenced their characters. At the premiere in Los Angeles, Ms. Grande wore a pink Thom Browne gingham dress, while Ms. Erivo donned a green vinyl Louis Vuitton number.Even at events not officially related to the film, the pair remained committed to the bit, like during an appearance at the Olympics in Paris where they each wore … well, you know.The second installment of “Wicked” comes out later this year. We’ll have to wait and see if the duo will still be holding space for pink and green come November.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
