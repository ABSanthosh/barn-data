Grenade previously served as Ba\u0026sh's CEO and oversaw the brand's revenues multiply by seven to more than €320 million in 2022. Following L Catterton's acquisition of a majority stake in APC last year, it's now tapping Grenade to boost APC's business. \"His mission is to expand and advance its creative dynamic, reinforce its financial structure and give it new selective growth opportunities,\" APC said in a statement. {WWD/paywalled}Who's winning the beauty retailer race for Gen Z?As Gen Z's spending power grows, retailers are increasingly trying to capture Gen Z's beauty spend, with Target and Walmart bringing buzzy brands into their stores as well as Amazon and TikTok Shop tapping into convenience and easy discovery. Competition between Ulta and Sephora is stiff, with Sephora dethroning Ulta as Gen Z's beauty retailer of choice in 2023. Target, Amazon and Walmart are also on the rise within the Gen Z market. {WWD/paywalled}Mulberry to cut handbag prices below £1,100 to boost salesIn an effort to boost sales, Mulberry aims to sell most of its luxury handbags for less than £1,095 ($1,383), according to the brand's new CEO Andrea Baldo. The brand's Bayswater bag retails for that price, and Baldo is trying to lower the cost of Mulberry's products so that 60% of the range retails for less than the Bayswater. Mulberry's pretax loss widened to £15.7 million ($19.9 million) in the 26 weeks to Sep. 28, and the brand has plans to cut about 85 corporate roles. This move to lower the cost of its handbags marks an attempt to reach customers looking for more affordable luxury goods. {Bloomberg/paywalled}Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
