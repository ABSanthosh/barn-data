You’ve struggled with cheap disposables, flirted with three-blades, and shelled out for far too many fancy cartridge systems. Nothing seems to quite cut it (pun intended), and you’re now ready to give something else a try. But before you switch to electric or settle on a sub-standard shaving kit, allow me to introduce Henson. With promises of a smoother, irritation-free shave and a design that lasts a lifetime, its popular razor could be the answer to all your shaving woes. But does it really live up to the hype? In this Henson razor review, I’ve personally put its AL13 to the test, giving you the real, unedited scoop, allowing you to decide your next move without any hesitation. I’ve sliced through the marketing claims (there I go again) to assess what really matters—comfort, performance, and value—and will guide you through its best features, where it falls short, and if it’s worth the money. Whether you’re a shaving newbie or a seasoned grooming enthusiast, keep reading and you might be able to banish bad shaves forever. In This ArticleHow We Tested About The ProductBuying ConsiderationWhy It's GreatHow To Use ItFlaws But Not DealbreakersAlternativesWhy Trust UsVerdictFAQs hensonshaving / Instagram How We Tested To give you a thorough Henson shaving review, I used it as my daily shaver over the course of several weeks, testing it on everything from a light stubble to a few days’ worth of growth to see how it handles different shaving challenges. I paid close attention to key factors like smoothness of the shave, how much irritation (if any) occurred, and how easy it was to maneuver around tricky areas like the neck and jawline. I also evaluated the overall design and build quality, looking at how comfortable the razor felt in my hand, how easy it was to clean, and whether the blades stay sharp over time. Cost was also factored in, comparing long-term value with other razors I’ve used in the past. This hands-on experience allowed me to get a true feel for the razor’s strengths and weaknesses, so I can provide you with an honest and well-rounded Henson razor review. About My Skin So you have a better idea of what I was testing on, let’s talk about my skin and usual routine before I get to the Henson safety razor review. Typically, I trim my stubble every three to five days and use a razor to tidy up my neckline and cheeks every other day. I tend to use unscented cream and often avoid a clean shave because my skin is on the sensitive side—especially in the chin and goatee area. Most razors leave me with breakouts in those spots, so I’ve learned to stick with light trims and avoid full passes. My neckline and cheeks, on the other hand, are a bit more forgiving—although I do get some occasional irritation, which I usually calm down with a good post-shave balm before waiting a while to apply my aftershave. For this Henson razor review, I went beyond my usual routine and gave the Henson razor a true test by clean shaving all over several times. This allowed me to see how it performed, not only with light maintenance but also with a full face shave on sensitive skin. TL;DR I’m focusing on the AL13 Medium Aggression Safety Razor for this Henson razor review. What’s good about it? Lightweight but sturdy, it’s extremely well-built, feels great in your hand, and is easy to maneuver. The shave is impressively smooth, and it’s particularly gentle on sensitive skin, which is a huge plus for me. Even when I went for a full clean shave (something I usually avoid), the Henson kept irritation to a minimum. Plus, it uses affordable double-edged blades, so long-term costs are way lower compared to fancy cartridge systems. The downsides? If you’re new to safety razors, there’s a learning curve. It’s not as quick as a disposable, and you’ll need a bit more precision to avoid nicks and cuts, especially in tricky areas like the chin. Bottom line for this Henson safety razor review: I’d recommend the Henson AL13, especially if you’ve got sensitive skin like mine. It’s a well-designed, cost-effective solution that gives you control over your shave. Having tested it personally—across different shaving routines and skin conditions—I can confidently say that it lives up to the hype. About the Henson AL13 Safety Razor The Henson AL13 is an aluminum, double-edged safety razor designed with a clear focus on precision, smoothness, and long-term value. Its primary goal? To give you a cleaner, more comfortable shave while keeping irritation and razor burn at bay. Made from lightweight aluminum, this razor is engineered for balance and ease of use, offering a shaving experience that’s both efficient and gentle—ideal for anyone with sensitive skin or prone to post-shave irritation. During this Henson razor review, what really stood out to me, right from the first, was the build quality. The aluminum body feels premium yet light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver around tricky spots. The razor head is designed at an angle that helps control the blade exposure (key for avoiding nicks and cuts), and the blade itself sits snugly, minimizing drag and reducing the risk of razor burn—something that immediately piqued my interest, given my sensitive skin. I’ve used plenty of razor brands that claim to be smooth operators, but the Henson AL13 genuinely lives up to that promise. From the first shave for this Henson razor review, I noticed how easily the AL13 glided over my skin without pulling or irritating. One feature worth highlighting is its use of double-edged stainless steel blades. Not only are they sharp and precise, but they’re also much more cost-effective than the expensive cartridge refills I’ve been stuck with in the past. Plus, the razor’s design ensures that the blade stays in place with minimal flex, giving you full control over each stroke. Before starting this Henson shaving review, I was admittedly concerned about switching to a safety razor since I usually avoid anything that might flare up my sensitive areas. However, after a few uses, it became clear to me that this razor was not only gentle but also incredibly efficient at reducing irritation. hensonshaving / Instagram What to Consider Before Buying Before you pull the trigger on the Henson AL13, there are a couple of things worth thinking about, especially when it comes to price and the kind of shave you’re after. First, let’s talk about price. The AL13 isn’t the cheapest option out there—it sits in the mid-range for safety razors—but when you factor in the durability of the razor and the fact that it uses affordable double-edged blades, it’s a smart long-term investment. Unlike disposable razors or costly cartridge systems, the upfront cost balances out over time, making this razor a solid choice if you’re looking for value. Now, on to the shave itself. This is a razor designed for a close, precise shave. If you’re someone who prefers a light trim or who’s used to quick, no-fuss cartridge razors, then the Henson might feel like a bit of an adjustment. The razor is crafted for control and precision, meaning that you’ll need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. But if you’re after a super smooth, irritation-free shave, it’s absolutely worth it. Who This Razor Would Work For It’s perfect for guys after an uber-close cut, especially if you have sensitive skin, and a great fit for those willing to invest a bit more upfront for a high-quality, long-lasting razor. If you’re tired of battling razor burn, ingrown hairs, or post-shave breakouts, this will minimize those issues while delivering a professional-level shave at home. Who This Razor Might Not Work For On the flip side, if you’re someone who just needs a quick trim or likes a low-maintenance shave, then the Henson might not be ideal. It requires a little more time and attention than your standard cartridge or electric razor. Why It’s Great/Why I Liked It/Didn’t Like it What really sold me on the Henson AL13 is how it delivers on both performance and comfort. I’ve tried a lot of razors that claim to minimize irritation, but this one genuinely does the job. The lightweight aluminum build makes it easy to control, and the razor head is designed in such a way that it almost forces you to shave at the perfect angle—resulting in fewer mistakes. For someone with sensitive skin, that’s a huge win. I also loved the close, smooth shave that the AL13 provided. It cut through several days’ worth of stubble with ease, leaving behind a clean finish with minimal irritation on my chin or neck, which are normally trouble spots for me. Add in the fact that it uses affordable stainless steel blades, and it becomes a solid investment that doesn’t rack up costs over time. What I didn’t love as much? If you’re new to safety razors, it does take a bit of time to get the hang of it. You can’t just rush through your shave like you would with a cartridge razor—you need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. So, if you’re in a hurry, this might feel a bit tedious at first. But once you get used to it, the payoff in terms of skin comfort is absolutely worth it. How to Use It This razor is perfect for a close, comfortable shave without irritation or the risk of razor burn that often comes with multi-blade cartridge systems. It’s ideal for guys who want more control over their shave and who value quality and longevity in their grooming tools. If you have sensitive skin, like me, or are prone to post-shave breakouts, this razor is going to help minimize those issues while giving you a clean, professional-grade finish. It’s also a great option for those looking to cut down on long-term shaving costs, as the double-edged blades are far cheaper than cartridges. To use the Henson razor, take your time. The key is to let the razor’s weight and design do most of the work. Start with short, controlled strokes, holding the razor at a shallow angle (around 30 degrees), and don’t apply too much pressure. It may feel different if you’re used to a cartridge razor, but once you adjust, you’ll notice how smoothly it glides over your skin. Always use a good shaving cream or soap for added slickness and less friction, especially around sensitive areas like the chin or neck. When it’s time to replace the blade, simply unscrew the razor head, swap out the old stainless steel blade for a new one, and screw it back on. It’s quick and easy, and with replacement blades being so affordable, it’s a hassle-free process that keeps the razor performing at its best. hensonshaving / Instagram Flaws but Not Deal-breakers Although the Henson AL13 has a lot going for it, there are a few aspects that might give you pause—though they’re far from deal-breakers. First, there’s the price. If you’re used to buying cheap, throwaway razors, the upfront cost of the Henson might seem steep. Although it’s an investment, it’s worth remembering that the double-edged blades are far more affordable in the long run compared to pricey cartridge refills. Still, for someone who’s been spending a few dollars on disposables, that initial cost can be a bit of a shock. Another potential downside is having to get used to a new way of shaving. If you’ve never used safety razors before, then you’ll likely find that the AL13 requires a more careful approach than a cartridge razor. It’s not something that you can rush through—you’ll need to be mindful of your angle and apply very little pressure. In a hurry? This might not be the best choice for a quick, slapdash shave. The need for precision and attention to detail could feel like a hassle to some. How to Care For Caring for this razor is simple, and with proper maintenance, it should last you a lifetime. You don’t need any special products—just water and a soft cloth will do—and you need to replace the blades only every 5–10 shaves, depending on hair thickness. After each use, give it a quick rinse with warm water to remove any shaving cream, soap, and stubble that might have built up. It’s also a good idea to unscrew the head and rinse the blade separately to ensure that nothing gets trapped. Once it’s clean, dry the razor thoroughly to prevent any water spots or residue from lingering on the aluminum body and store it in a dry, cool place. A bathroom drawer or a designated razor stand works well, as long as it’s away from constant moisture. hensonshaving / Instagram You Have Options Yes, this is a Henson razor review, but we always offer you alternatives as well. If the Henson AL13 isn’t quite what you’re looking for, there are a couple of solid alternatives to consider. Merkur’s 34C is a classic double-edged safety razor known for its weight and durability. Made from stainless steel, it offers a heavier feel, giving you more control during each shave. Its compact design and robust build make it a favorite among wet-shaving enthusiasts who appreciate a traditional razor with excellent balance and precision. Another option is the King C. Gillette double-edge safety, which combines modern design with classic shaving functionality. It features a sleek chrome finish and comes with sharp, platinum-coated blades for a smooth and comfortable shave. It’s a bit more budget-friendly and easily accessible, making it a great choice for beginners looking to try out safety razors without a hefty investment upfront.

As someone who regularly tidies up his own stubble, Billy brings a practical, hands-on approach to this Henson Razor review. His extensive experience, combined with his personal grooming routine, ensures that when he recommends a product, you can trust it’s been tested thoroughly and honestly. Verdict Last words in our Henson razor review: The Henson AL13 is a standout razor that delivers on its promises of a smooth, close shave while being gentle on sensitive skin. Its lightweight aluminum design and precision-engineered razor head make it easy to use, especially if you’re prone to irritation. With affordable, long-lasting double-edged blades and minimal maintenance, it’s a smart investment for anyone looking to upgrade their shaving routine. Although there’s a slight learning curve if you’re new to safety razors, the payoff is well worth the effort. If you’re after something a bit heftier, the Merkur 34C is another great option. With a heavier stainless steel build, it offers more weight and control, making it ideal for those who prefer a more traditional feel when shaving. Both razors are high-quality, but the Henson is best for those seeking comfort and ease of use. FAQ When comparing the Henson razor to Supply’s, it comes down to personal preference and shaving style. The Henson is lightweight, made from aluminum, and designed for a smooth, irritation-free shave with a minimal learning curve, especially for those with sensitive skin. The Supply razor, on the other hand, is bulkier, made from stainless steel, and features a single-edge design, offering more heft and control but requiring more precision. If you’re looking for an easy, gentle shave, the Henson is likely the better choice. Henson razor blades typically last between five to 10 shaves, depending on your hair thickness and how often you shave. If you have coarse or thicker hair, you might need to replace the blade closer to five shaves, whereas finer hair could allow you to stretch it to a lot more. For the smoothest and most comfortable results, it’s best to replace the blade as soon as you notice any tugging or reduced sharpness. Yes, you can definitely use the Henson razor on your legs. Its design, which focuses on precision and smoothness, works just as well on larger areas like legs as it does on the face or head.

I tend to use \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-unscented-shaving-creams/\"\u003eunscented cream\u003c/a\u003e and often avoid a clean shave because my skin is on the sensitive side—especially in the chin and goatee area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost razors leave me with breakouts in those spots, so I’ve learned to stick with light trims and avoid full passes. My neckline and cheeks, on the other hand, are a bit more forgiving—although I do get some occasional irritation, which I usually calm down with a good post-shave balm before waiting a while to apply my \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-aftershave-for-men/\"\u003eaftershave\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this Henson razor review, I went beyond my usual routine and gave the Henson razor a true test by clean shaving all over several times.

Plus, it uses affordable double-edged blades, so long-term costs are way lower compared to fancy cartridge systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downsides? If you’re new to \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-safety-razor-for-men/\"\u003esafety razors\u003c/a\u003e, there’s a learning curve.

It’s a well-designed, cost-effective solution that gives you control over your shave.

Its primary goal? To give you a cleaner, more comfortable shave while keeping irritation and razor burn at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMade from lightweight aluminum, this razor is engineered for balance and ease of use, offering a shaving experience that’s both efficient and gentle—ideal for anyone with sensitive skin or prone to post-shave irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this Henson razor review, what really stood out to me, right from the first, was the build quality. The aluminum body feels premium yet light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver around tricky spots. The razor head is designed at an angle that helps control the blade exposure (key for avoiding nicks and cuts), and the blade itself sits snugly, minimizing drag and reducing the risk of razor burn—something that immediately piqued my interest, given my sensitive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve used plenty of \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-razor-brands/\"\u003erazor brands\u003c/a\u003e that claim to be smooth operators, but the Henson AL13 genuinely lives up to that promise. From the first shave for this Henson razor review, I noticed how easily the AL13 glided over my skin without pulling or irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne feature worth highlighting is its use of double-edged stainless steel blades. Not only are they sharp and precise, but they’re also much more cost-effective than the expensive cartridge refills I’ve been stuck with in the past. Plus, the razor’s design ensures that the blade stays in place with minimal flex, giving you full control over each stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore starting this Henson shaving review, I was admittedly concerned about switching to a safety razor since I usually avoid anything that might flare up my sensitive areas. However, after a few uses, it became clear to me that this razor was not only gentle but also incredibly efficient at reducing irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180106\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180106\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater.jpg\" alt=\"cleaning the Henson Razor with running water\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-696x870.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180106\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTPX7cXHxLo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehensonshaving\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"buy-con\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you pull the trigger on the Henson AL13, there are a couple of things worth thinking about, especially when it comes to price and the kind of shave you’re after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s talk about price. The AL13 isn’t the cheapest option out there—it sits in the mid-range for safety razors—but when you factor in the durability of the razor and the fact that it uses affordable double-edged blades, it’s a smart long-term investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike disposable razors or costly cartridge systems, the upfront cost balances out over time, making this razor a solid choice if you’re looking for value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, on to the shave itself. This is a razor designed for a close, precise shave. If you’re someone who prefers a light trim or who’s used to quick, no-fuss cartridge razors, then the Henson might feel like a bit of an adjustment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe razor is crafted for control and precision, meaning that you’ll need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. But if you’re after a super smooth, irritation-free shave, it’s absolutely worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho This Razor Would Work For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s perfect for guys after an \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-razors-for-a-close-shave/\"\u003euber-close cut\u003c/a\u003e, especially if you have sensitive skin, and a great fit for those willing to invest a bit more upfront for a high-quality, long-lasting razor. If you’re tired of battling razor burn, ingrown hairs, or post-shave breakouts, this will minimize those issues while delivering a professional-level shave at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho This Razor Might Not Work For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flip side, if you’re someone who just needs a quick trim or likes a low-maintenance shave, then the Henson might not be ideal. It requires a little more time and attention than your standard cartridge or electric razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"great\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy It’s Great/Why I Liked It/Didn’t Like it\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really sold me on the Henson AL13 is how it delivers on both performance and comfort. I’ve tried a lot of razors that claim to minimize irritation, but this one genuinely does the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightweight aluminum build makes it easy to control, and the razor head is designed in such a way that it almost forces you to shave at the perfect angle—resulting in fewer mistakes. For someone with sensitive skin, that’s a huge win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also loved the close, smooth shave that the AL13 provided. It cut through several days’ worth of stubble with ease, leaving behind a clean finish with minimal irritation on my chin or neck, which are normally trouble spots for me. Add in the fact that it uses affordable stainless steel blades, and it becomes a solid investment that doesn’t rack up costs over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I didn’t love as much? If you’re new to safety razors, it does take a bit of time to get the hang of it. You can’t just rush through your shave like you would with a cartridge razor—you need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. So, if you’re in a hurry, this might feel a bit tedious at first. But once you get used to it, the payoff in terms of skin comfort is absolutely worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Use It\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6QJY4Z2?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180103-20\u0026amp;linkId=61904a8f5f82cdd88098bbc7a5a6a346\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor.jpg\" alt=\"Henson Shaving L13 Aluminum Duble Edge Safety Razor\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor.jpg 600w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis razor is perfect for a close, comfortable shave without irritation or the risk of razor burn that often comes with multi-blade cartridge systems. It’s ideal for guys who want more control over their shave and who value quality and longevity in their grooming tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have sensitive skin, like me, or are prone to post-shave breakouts, this razor is going to help minimize those issues while giving you a clean, professional-grade finish. It’s also a great option for those looking to cut down on long-term shaving costs, as the double-edged blades are far cheaper than cartridges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use the Henson razor, take your time. The key is to let the razor’s weight and design do most of the work. Start with short, controlled strokes, holding the razor at a shallow angle (around 30 degrees), and don’t apply too much pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may feel different if you’re used to a cartridge razor, but once you adjust, you’ll notice how smoothly it glides over your skin. Always use a good \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-shaving-creams-for-straight-razors/\"\u003eshaving cream\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-shaving-soaps/\"\u003esoap\u003c/a\u003e for added slickness and less friction, especially around sensitive areas like the chin or neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it’s time to replace the blade, simply unscrew the razor head, swap out the old stainless steel blade for a new one, and screw it back on. It’s quick and easy, and with replacement blades being so affordable, it’s a hassle-free process that keeps the razor performing at its best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180107\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180107\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor.jpg\" alt=\"man shaving beard using a black Henson Razor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_manshavingbeardusingablackHensonRazor-696x870.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180107\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CzmAYICMoRa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehensonshaving\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"flaws\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFlaws but Not Deal-breakers\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Henson AL13 has a lot going for it, there are a few aspects that might give you pause—though they’re far from deal-breakers. First, there’s the price. If you’re used to buying cheap, throwaway razors, the upfront cost of the Henson might seem steep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it’s an investment, it’s worth remembering that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-double-edge-razor-blades/\"\u003edouble-edged blades\u003c/a\u003e are far more affordable in the long run compared to pricey cartridge refills. Still, for someone who’s been spending a few dollars on disposables, that initial cost can be a bit of a shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother potential downside is having to get used to a new way of shaving. If you’ve never used safety razors before, then you’ll likely find that the AL13 requires a more careful approach than a cartridge razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not something that you can rush through—you’ll need to be mindful of your angle and apply very little pressure. In a hurry? This might not be the best choice for a quick, slapdash shave. The need for precision and attention to detail could feel like a hassle to some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Care For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaring for this razor is simple, and with proper maintenance, it should last you a lifetime. You don’t need any special products—just water and a soft cloth will do—and you need to replace the blades only every 5–10 shaves, depending on hair thickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter each use, give it a quick rinse with warm water to remove any shaving cream, soap, and stubble that might have built up. It’s also a good idea to unscrew the head and rinse the blade separately to ensure that nothing gets trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce it’s clean, dry the razor thoroughly to prevent any water spots or residue from lingering on the aluminum body and store it in a dry, cool place. A bathroom drawer or a designated razor stand works well, as long as it’s away from constant moisture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180108\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180108\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand.jpg\" alt=\"the Henson Double Edge Safety Razor on a stand\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_theHensonDoubleEdgeSafetyRazoronastand-696x870.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180108\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmMvkTgOurF/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehensonshaving\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"alternatives\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou Have Options\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, this is a Henson razor review, but we always offer you alternatives as well.

I tend to use \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-unscented-shaving-creams/\"\u003eunscented cream\u003c/a\u003e and often avoid a clean shave because my skin is on the sensitive side—especially in the chin and goatee area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost razors leave me with breakouts in those spots, so I’ve learned to stick with light trims and avoid full passes. My neckline and cheeks, on the other hand, are a bit more forgiving—although I do get some occasional irritation, which I usually calm down with a good post-shave balm before waiting a while to apply my \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-aftershave-for-men/\"\u003eaftershave\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this Henson razor review, I went beyond my usual routine and gave the Henson razor a true test by clean shaving all over several times.

If you’re new to \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-safety-razor-for-men/\"\u003esafety razors\u003c/a\u003e, there’s a learning curve.

Its primary goal? To give you a cleaner, more comfortable shave while keeping irritation and razor burn at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMade from lightweight aluminum, this razor is engineered for balance and ease of use, offering a shaving experience that’s both efficient and gentle—ideal for anyone with sensitive skin or prone to post-shave irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this Henson razor review, what really stood out to me, right from the first, was the build quality. The aluminum body feels premium yet light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver around tricky spots. The razor head is designed at an angle that helps control the blade exposure (key for avoiding nicks and cuts), and the blade itself sits snugly, minimizing drag and reducing the risk of razor burn—something that immediately piqued my interest, given my sensitive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve used plenty of \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-razor-brands/\"\u003erazor brands\u003c/a\u003e that claim to be smooth operators, but the Henson AL13 genuinely lives up to that promise. From the first shave for this Henson razor review, I noticed how easily the AL13 glided over my skin without pulling or irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne feature worth highlighting is its use of double-edged stainless steel blades. Not only are they sharp and precise, but they’re also much more cost-effective than the expensive cartridge refills I’ve been stuck with in the past. Plus, the razor’s design ensures that the blade stays in place with minimal flex, giving you full control over each stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore starting this Henson shaving review, I was admittedly concerned about switching to a safety razor since I usually avoid anything that might flare up my sensitive areas. However, after a few uses, it became clear to me that this razor was not only gentle but also incredibly efficient at reducing irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180106\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180106\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater.jpg\" alt=\"cleaning the Henson Razor with running water\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hensonshaving_cleaningtheHensonRazorwithrunningwater-696x870.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180106\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTPX7cXHxLo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehensonshaving\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"buy-con\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you pull the trigger on the Henson AL13, there are a couple of things worth thinking about, especially when it comes to price and the kind of shave you’re after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s talk about price. The AL13 isn’t the cheapest option out there—it sits in the mid-range for safety razors—but when you factor in the durability of the razor and the fact that it uses affordable double-edged blades, it’s a smart long-term investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike disposable razors or costly cartridge systems, the upfront cost balances out over time, making this razor a solid choice if you’re looking for value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, on to the shave itself. This is a razor designed for a close, precise shave. If you’re someone who prefers a light trim or who’s used to quick, no-fuss cartridge razors, then the Henson might feel like a bit of an adjustment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe razor is crafted for control and precision, meaning that you’ll need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. But if you’re after a super smooth, irritation-free shave, it’s absolutely worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho This Razor Would Work For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s perfect for guys after an \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-razors-for-a-close-shave/\"\u003euber-close cut\u003c/a\u003e, especially if you have sensitive skin, and a great fit for those willing to invest a bit more upfront for a high-quality, long-lasting razor. If you’re tired of battling razor burn, ingrown hairs, or post-shave breakouts, this will minimize those issues while delivering a professional-level shave at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho This Razor Might Not Work For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flip side, if you’re someone who just needs a quick trim or likes a low-maintenance shave, then the Henson might not be ideal. It requires a little more time and attention than your standard cartridge or electric razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"great\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy It’s Great/Why I Liked It/Didn’t Like it\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really sold me on the Henson AL13 is how it delivers on both performance and comfort. I’ve tried a lot of razors that claim to minimize irritation, but this one genuinely does the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightweight aluminum build makes it easy to control, and the razor head is designed in such a way that it almost forces you to shave at the perfect angle—resulting in fewer mistakes. For someone with sensitive skin, that’s a huge win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also loved the close, smooth shave that the AL13 provided. It cut through several days’ worth of stubble with ease, leaving behind a clean finish with minimal irritation on my chin or neck, which are normally trouble spots for me. Add in the fact that it uses affordable stainless steel blades, and it becomes a solid investment that doesn’t rack up costs over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I didn’t love as much? If you’re new to safety razors, it does take a bit of time to get the hang of it. You can’t just rush through your shave like you would with a cartridge razor—you need to slow down and be mindful with each pass. So, if you’re in a hurry, this might feel a bit tedious at first. But once you get used to it, the payoff in terms of skin comfort is absolutely worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Use It\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6QJY4Z2?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180103-20\u0026amp;linkId=61904a8f5f82cdd88098bbc7a5a6a346\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor.jpg\" alt=\"Henson Shaving L13 Aluminum Duble Edge Safety Razor\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor.jpg 600w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HensonShaving_DoubleEdgeSafetyRazor-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis razor is perfect for a close, comfortable shave without irritation or the risk of razor burn that often comes with multi-blade cartridge systems. It’s ideal for guys who want more control over their shave and who value quality and longevity in their grooming tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have sensitive skin, like me, or are prone to post-shave breakouts, this razor is going to help minimize those issues while giving you a clean, professional-grade finish. It’s also a great option for those looking to cut down on long-term shaving costs, as the double-edged blades are far cheaper than cartridges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use the Henson razor, take your time. The key is to let the razor’s weight and design do most of the work. Start with short, controlled strokes, holding the razor at a shallow angle (around 30 degrees), and don’t apply too much pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may feel different if you’re used to a cartridge razor, but once you adjust, you’ll notice how smoothly it glides over your skin.

First, there’s the price. If you’re used to buying cheap, throwaway razors, the upfront cost of the Henson might seem steep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it’s an investment, it’s worth remembering that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-double-edge-razor-blades/\"\u003edouble-edged blades\u003c/a\u003e are far more affordable in the long run compared to pricey cartridge refills. Still, for someone who’s been spending a few dollars on disposables, that initial cost can be a bit of a shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother potential downside is having to get used to a new way of shaving. If you’ve never used safety razors before, then you’ll likely find that the AL13 requires a more careful approach than a cartridge razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not something that you can rush through—you’ll need to be mindful of your angle and apply very little pressure. In a hurry? This might not be the best choice for a quick, slapdash shave. The need for precision and attention to detail could feel like a hassle to some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow to Care For\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaring for this razor is simple, and with proper maintenance, it should last you a lifetime. You don’t need any special products—just water and a soft cloth will do—and you need to replace the blades only every 5–10 shaves, depending on hair thickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter each use, give it a quick rinse with warm water to remove any shaving cream, soap, and stubble that might have built up. It’s also a good idea to unscrew the head and rinse the blade separately to ensure that nothing gets trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce it’s clean, dry the razor thoroughly to prevent any water spots or residue from lingering on the aluminum body and store it in a dry, cool place.
