If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. You’ve watched all the trailers, you’ve giggled at the charming cast interviews, you’ve practiced “Defying Gravity” in the mirror — you’re ready to hop on the train to Oz in November. There’s perhaps one more thing you can do to prep, though: Shop one of the many, many excellent Elphaba and Glinda-themed collaborations ahead of Wicked‘s November 22 release in theaters.Inspired by the leading witches played by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, these fashion-forward Wicked collections are worth ogling over, whether you’re in the market for a classic logo T-shirt or are looking for dazzling shoes, bags, and jewelry to feel like you’re part of the ensemble. Wear them around the house, to the theater, or for Halloween. We promise that these limited-edition products from brands like H\u0026M and Béis are “gonna be popular.”We’ve rounded up the best Wicked collaborations on the market and ones that are dropping soon, from Forever21 to Camilla, ahead of the film’s debut. DashDividers_1_500x100 Rebecca Minkoff x Wicked Before running to the theater, you’ll want to grab one of Rebecca Minkoff’s Wicked handbags. The designer released two special-edition styles, inspired by Elphaba and Glinda, each as enchanting as the other. Channel Elphaba with a gold-studded leather shoulder bag or Glinda with a crystal-adorned pink mini bag. “This collaboration allowed us to merge fashion with a narrative that celebrates individuality, friendship, and the strong female leads that are Elphaba and Glinda,” Minkoff said, in a press release.  Shop full Rebecca Minkoff x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Target x Wicked What happens when you put Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell and beloved retailer Target together? Well, you get magic (at an affordable price point). In a video, Tazewell said he wanted to create contrasting pieces that could complement each other, incorporating “grounded” textured knits to represent Elphaba and “airborne” sheer fabrics for Glinda. The adult and kids collection includes cozy season staples like sweatsuits, slippers, and blankets. Shop full Target x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Crocs x Wicked After last summer’s wildly popular Barbie x Crocs collaboration, the foam footwear brand is back with quirky Wicked styles. Channel Elphaba in the brand’s classic clogs with a metallic green upper, patterned sole, and textured heel strap. Alternatively, you can reinterpret Glinda’s style in pink platform clogs with a glimmering patterned upper and 3-D bubble sole. Each style comes with six themed Jibbitz charms. (You can also purchase a separate Wicked charm pack to clip onto the Crocs already in your closet, or add onto these new specialty shoes.) Shop full Crocs x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Béis x Wicked Although Elphaba and Glinda take to the skies in brooms and bubbles, you can still fly in style… with stunning luggage. Béis has a Wicked luggage collab that sees the brand’s best-selling hard suitcases, weekender bags, totes, and toiletry bags rendered in limited-edition pinks, sold-out greens, plus magical ombré. You can also look forward to the new small carry-on rollers releasing on December 4, just in time for holiday travel. Shop full Béis x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M x Wicked Another brand that knows a thing or two about creating lust-worthy collaborations is H\u0026M. The R29 reader-favorite retailer recently dropped a whimsical Wicked capsule that includes pieces you can wear to the theater, as well as styles that Glinda or Elphaba may don themselves. While many of the accessories and beauty products have sold out, you can still wave your wand (read: credit card) to graphic T-shirts, an edgy asymmetrical dress, and a silk makeup hair band. Shop full H\u0026M x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Bombas x Wicked Keep your toes warm (and stylish) this fall with Bombas socks in Wicked-ified designs. Get yourself individual pairs of striped and sparkling ankle, crew, or calf socks, or consider gifting four-style packs to your besties for the holidays. The brand’s do-good mission also extends to this collection: Just as Wicked is “a story that shows us the power of inclusion, and what’s possible when people connect and stick together,” the brand vows to donate a pair of socks to organizations like Miracle Messages, Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, and River Fund for every pair purchased, per a press release. Shop full Wicked x Bombas collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Lele Sadoughi x Wicked While most brands have collaborated with Wicked the movie, accessory brand Lele Sadoughi worked with the Broadway musical in honor of its 21th anniversary. The 12-piece collection is inspired by Glinda and Elphaba’s iconic styles, featuring statement headbands, bedazzled hair bows, and wand-inspired earrings. The pink-striped organza headband is even crafted from the same fabric used in Glinda’s on-stage dress, which any theater kid could cry over. Shop full Lele Sadoughi x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Vera Bradley x Wicked Enchanting and opulent, Vera Bradley’s Wicked collaboration is split up into the rosy Glinda Collection and hypnotic Elphaba Collection. The 35-piece assortment includes travel bags and accessories, handbags, apparel, and home décor in whimsical patterns inspired by the Emerald City and its characters. Shop for a weekender, jewelry pouch, silk scarf, and matching umbrella for your travels, or slip into a robe and slippers with a throw blanket and printed tumbler for cozy days in. Shop full Vera Bradley x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Aldo x Wicked Step into the Land of Oz… in spellbinding heels! Aldo’s Wicked collaboration is full of bewitching shoes, handbags, jewelry, and more accessories, like hair bows and sunglasses. Choose whether you want to channel Elphaba or Glinda in emerald green and black or head-to-toe bubblegum pink and white. (Don’t worry: Both are dripping in crystals, pearls, and gold charms.) There are even men’s shoes and a unique advent calendar. The collection is also Ariana Grande-approved — she wore custom Aldo pumps inspired by the collaboration on Saturday Night Live. Shop full Aldo x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Cambridge Satchel x Wicked If you’re looking to sport a style from the actual film, you’ll be delighted to know that British heritage brand Cambridge Satchel has a bag and accessory collection that includes the pink Binocular Bag that Grande as Glinda is seen wearing in the trailer. There are several leather, velvet, and glitter-finish handbags, pouches, and charms that take inspiration from Glinda, Elphaba, Shiz University, and the Grimmerie spell book. Whether you reach for a jet black messenger or a green-and-pink colorblocked crossbody, any of these styles will transport you into the world of Wicked.  Shop full Cambridge Satchel x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Foster Grant x Wicked Seeing through rose-colored glasses never looked so good. Throw on a pair of spellbinding sunnies from Foster Grant’s eight-piece Wicked collection. The playful frames feature whimsical details (i.e. green lenses and butterfly motifs) and quirky names (i.e. Not Your Basic Witch and Ozmopolitan). Whether you desire a chunky green-and-black Elphaba-inspired style or a dainty pink Glinda-inspired design, it’ll be hard to pass up on these $40 frames.  Shop full Wicked x Foster Grant collaboration Eugenia Kim x Wicked You may not want to walk around in a witch hat like Elphaba, but you can still sport Wicked-inspired headwear this fall and winter. Eugenia Kim just released elevated hats, headpieces, and cool-weather accessories like scarves and fingerless gloves inspired by the film. To channel either Elphaba or Glinda, pick between sultry dark green or sweet light pink beanies, berets, wide-brim hats, and headbands. Many styles even include gold and silver Oz logo plates. Shop full Eugenia Kim x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Claire’s x Wicked Get into the spirit of the much-anticipated film with cutesy costume jewelry and accessories from Claire’s. The brand’s new Wicked merchandise includes necklaces, earrings, scrunchies, and pins that you can wear together or split with your bestie. There are also several bow clips, a charm keychain, and on-theme stationery. The full collection launches on November 7, so keep an eye on this space to shop. Shop full Claire’s x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Aerie x Wicked Aerie’s Wicked capsule was one of the first collaborations to drop, which means many styles have been selling out. But you can still feel cute and cozy in several of the collection’s logo sweatshirts, sweatpants, T-shirts, and crew socks. Lounge around your home in style bubble-printed boxer shorts and oversized tees. Shop full Aerie x Wicked collaboration DashDividers_1_500x100 Forever 21 x Wicked Want to cop all your Wicked merch in one place? Then you may want to hold off until November 7, when Forever 21 releases 80+ styles across womenswear, menswear, childrenswear, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Full of statement pleats, lace, organza, rosettes, and embellishments, the texture-forward pieces draw from Wicked’s costumes and aesthetic. Considering how fast Forever 21’s Elphaba and Glinda jerseys sold out, you’ll want to hop on this trendy collaboration (which will range between $9 and $90) as soon as it goes live.  Shop the Forever 21 collaboration on November 7 DashDividers_1_500x100 Camilla x Wicked If you want to embrace the fantastical imagery of the Land of Oz, you’ll want to keep a lookout for Australian brand Camilla’s upcoming Wicked collaboration, which launches on November 13. The luxurious 85-piece collection across womenswear, menswear, childrenswear, and accessories comes in three new prints: Defy Gravity (inspired by Elphaba and Emerald City), Totally OZmopolitan (inspired by Glinda), and Munchkinland. “Our journey to the vibrant world of Oz is a visual feast,” said designer Camilla Franks, in a press release.  Shop the Wicked x Camilla collaboration on November 13 Like what you see?
