At a deeply polarized time and in a conservative-leaning era, the editors of People magazine were never going to go for a sex-in-the-hot-tub candidate in selecting the latest “Sexiest Man Alive.” And so it was hardly a surprise when, on Tuesday night, during an episode of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” the host revealed that this year’s crown had gone to the actor and filmmaker John Krasinski.An amiable hunk and devoted family man with the requisite multiplatform audience appeal (“The Office,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and “The Quiet Place,” among other star vehicles), a cozy throwback celebrity marriage (his wife is the actor Emily Blunt), two young daughters and solid East Coast roots (a Boston boy, he lives in a multimillion dollar apartment in Brooklyn) — Mr. Krasinski exudes an erotic energy suggestive less of the bedroom athlete than of the proverbial stable provider. His vibe, riffed the social media gadfly Blakely Thornton, is “giving country home, Volvo hybrid and a 401(k).”Naturally, fans of the actor Glen Powell were distressed about the decision. Why Mr. Krasinski and not Mr. Powell, the “Twisters” actor, with his V-shaped physique and a smile that seems to encourage moral delinquency? But what were they expecting? In a nation battered and exhausted by a grueling political season, Mr. Krasinski was the ideal middle-of-the-road ticket, visually coded as preppy adjacent, in affect both familiar and humorous, evidently secure in his heterosexual identity and so generally inoffensive as to be the Switzerland of onscreen virility.And what he is clearly not is one of the scandal-plagued hunks (Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck), serial Lotharios (Richard Gere, George Clooney, again Johnny Depp) or obvious thirst traps (Michael B. Jordan) who have been anointed the world’s sexiest by People in the decades since the publication inaugurated its popular “Sexiest Man Alive” franchise with Mel Gibson back in 1985.ImageWhile his stylist prefers to keep him away from black-and-white clothing, Mr. Krasinski was dressed in a bird’s eye tweed jacket over a basic white T-shirt on the cover of People.Credit...Julian Ungano, People MagazineAt 45, Mr. Krasinski also lands in the franchise’s demographic sweet spot. If he was the obvious choice in that sense, his low-key sexiness also developed out of fashion choices that evolved through a collaboration with the stylist Ilaria Urbinati over the past decade and produced their own form of curb appeal.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
