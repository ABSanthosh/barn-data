  "text": "Lea Michele is making a triumphant return to Broadway this fall in the revival of Chess, and what better place to celebrate than at the Tony Awards? Last night, the actress appeared at Radio City Music Hall, where she joined co-star Aaron Tveit to present the trophy for Best Revival of a Musical. Together, they announced the winner: the Nicole Scherzinger-led Sunset Boulevard. For the big event, Michele wore a custom Michael Kors Collection look: a black halter tuxedo jacket with a plunging lapel neckline, paired with a pleated chiffon skirt featuring a thigh-high slit. She accessorized with classic black pumps and shimmering silver jewelry—including earrings, a bracelet, a bangle, and a ring—all by EFFY Jewelry. Consider it a seductive spin on the classic tailored suit.For the uninitiated, Chess is a musical set against the backdrop of the Cold War, revolving around an intense chess championship—and a complicated love triangle—between an American and a Russian. Joining Michele and Tveit is Nicholas Christopher (known for Miss Saigon and Hamilton), completing the trio. The production features a score by ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, with lyrics by Tim Rice. The book for this iteration is penned by Danny Strong (Dopesick) and Michael Mayer will direct. (He previously collaborated with Michele on Spring Awakening and Funny Girl, according to The Hollywood Reporter.) The cast already had a 29-hour reading earlier this month. “I am beyond excited to be returning to Broadway this fall with my amazing new co-stars in Chess,” Michele tells ELLE. “I made my Broadway debut when I was 8 years old, and I’ve had the pleasure of being a part of this community for 30 years now. I cannot wait to get back onto the stage.” Before Chess opens at the Shubert Theatre, Michele will be gracing stages elsewhere—she’s currently in the midst of a solo concert tour across the U.S. and Canada.“I’m having so much fun on tour singing songs that are so special to me,” she says of the shows. “It’s a mix of songs from Broadway shows that I have been in, some songs from my studio albums, as well as songs from Glee! We also included a fun new section that we think Rachel Berry would sing currently, and I think fans have really enjoyed that part of the show. I also tell a lot of stories and have fun interactions with the audience.”Michele wasn’t the only former Glee star at the Tonys last night—Darren Criss (who won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical) and Jonathan Groff (who was nominated in the same category and performed in the Hamilton reunion) were also in attendance. Famous guest stars including Kristin Chenoweth, Lea Salonga, and Adam Lambert rounded out the crowd.Below, see how Michele got ready for Broadway’s biggest night.",
