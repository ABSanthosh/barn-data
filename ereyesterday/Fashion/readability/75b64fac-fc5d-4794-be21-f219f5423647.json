  "description": "It was only months ago that Kendrick Lamar told the world to pop out in his controversial, chart-topping diss track to Drake \"Not Like Us,\" and he's been at the top of our playlists ever since. Prior to both artists' rap beef, the Compton-born lyricist has consistently produced cultural records that amplify the Black experience from \"Alright\" and \"Humble\" to \"Father Time\" and \"Dodger Blue\" - even earning him a spot at this year's Super Bowl halftime Show (his performance being the most watched in history). Whether you've been a faithful K-dot fan for years or you're a newbie, there's no questioning his imprint on the music industry. Apart from his unrivaled flow and thought-provoking lyrics, we're even more excited about his joint tour with Grammy-winning singer and longtime collaborator SZA. The dynamic duo's \"Grand National Tour,\" which was announced just days after the aforementioned history-making halftime show, includes 39 shows across North America and Europe starting April 19. Of course, news of a tour can only mean one thing, besides singing your heart out: shopping. And while the rapper might not have been referencing clothing in the indicting record (sorry Drake fans), we're taking it as our sign to do exactly that with our outfits for the tour - pop out - and, well, you know the rest. Similar to their careers, both artists' styles have enjoyed an evolution that's worth taking notes from. Lamar depicts pride for his homeland with many of his looks, from the Balenciaga bomber, flare jeans, and New Era LA Dodgers hat combination he donned on the \"GNX\" album cover to the Maison Margiela Canadian tuxedo he wore to the 2025 Grammys (a look fitting for winning five awards in one night). Meanwhile, the R\u0026B songstress is a sartorial chameleon with a penchant for sultry silhouettes. She's worn everything from Jaded London plaid minis to archive designer frocks; like her 2024 Met Gala afterparty outfit that consisted of a plunging purple-and-green Versace dress from the house's spring/summer 2004 collection. Whether you want to nail one of your favorite ensembles piece by piece or are just in need of a new trucker hat, we've done all the legwork to ensure that your \"Grand National Tour\" look is Lamar- and SZA-approved. Keep reading to shop our top picks for the best \"Grand National Tour\" outfits, with selects inspired by the duo and exact pieces they've worn.",
