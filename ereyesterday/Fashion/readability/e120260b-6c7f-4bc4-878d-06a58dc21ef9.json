This stacked set includes all of the brand's best-selling tools and then some: The Comb No. 001, The Brush, The Oil, The Towel, The Scrunchie N0.001, 3-minute hourglass timer, reusable cloth travel pouches, and keepsake box. (If you're not looking to splurge, then we suggest going straight for its editor-favorite detangling comb.)The practicality proof is all in the rave-reviewer pudding: \"I have to say, the whole set was a complete game-changer for me.Overall, my hair feels and looks the best it has in a very long time since I started using Crown Affair. It’s finally growing and getting back its shine; I don't see as many strands in the drain after showering, which I assume is due to me brushing out all the dead hair every single day; It dries super quick with the towel which leads to less drying time. I use a blow-dryer and straightener each time I wash; I used to wash my hair every other day. I now wash it about 2 times per week; I imagine from brushing, my hair doesn’t get as oily as quickly as it used to – which is why I wash it way less than I used to. Overall - I love my hair so much and I literally owe it all to Crown Affair. I have also bought The Set as a gift so many times because I actually feel that so many people and different hair types can benefit from these products.\"Shop Crown Affair Crown Affair The Set, $, available at Crown AffairOpen Spaces Entryway RackCrafted from smooth painted steel, this three-tier entryway rack is a sharp-looking and useful dual-purpose home surprise.

The nightlight creates a soft glow that's soothing before bed, and there's just something nice about being able to turn off the alarm by reaching over and pressing down on its bar (great haptics) without having to look for my phone in the morning.The two-phase alarm is genius — I usually hate waking up in the morning, but the initial \"wake up\" sounds are pleasant \u0026 they don't jar me out of bed because I know I have another few minutes to sleep before I have to actually 'get up' with the second phase. I also really love the soundscapes, particularly the water-based ones, and the brown noise.Finally, I track my sleep with a FitBit, and I've noticed that when I do breathwork before bed, I get more deep sleep and have a lower sleeping heart rate.
