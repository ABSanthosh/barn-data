  "description": "It’s officially awards season, and that doesn’t only mean celebrating the latest and greatest in movies and TV, but the songs and artists who also got us through the year. Enter: The Grammys. As music’s biggest night, the annual awards ceremony is known for giving fans a little bit of everything — from exciting performances and history-making wins, to another Beyoncé Album of the Year snub (come on Recording Academy, it’s *time*). And, without fail — great fashion. Style-wise, the Grammys red carpet is known for being a little adventurous, with celebs taking the opportunity to have fun with their sartorial choices. From JLo debuting her now iconic and internet-breaking plunging Versace gown in 2000 (which led to the creation of Google Images) to pop princess Miley Cyrus channeling Barbarella at last year’s carpet, the looks are always serving. And this year was no different. With famous faces and style icons like Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, and Beyoncé nominated, it’s no surprise that this year’s red carpet was a lesson in A+ style. Ahead, check out the best red carpet looks from the 67th annual Grammy Awards (so far). We'll be updating this list throughout the night so stick around!Charli XCX in Jean Paul GaultierPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Sabrina Carpenter in JW AndersonPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Doechii in Thom BrownePhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Olivia Rodrigo in vintage VersacePhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Chappell Roan in Jean Paul GaultierPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Cardi B in Roberto CavalliPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Taylor SwiftPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Photo: Jon Kopaloff/WireImage.Coco JonesPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Miley Cyrus in YSLPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Lucky DayePhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Billie Eilish in PradaPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Amy AllenPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Paris HiltonPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.TemsPhoto: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Lady LondonPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Lainey WilsonPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.ShaboozeyPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Trevor NoahPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.J BalvinPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Cynthia ErivoPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Madison BeerPhoto: Jon Kopaloff/WireImage.Muni LongPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Troye SivanPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Avery WilsonPhoto: Gilbert Flores/Billboard/Getty Images.Jaden SmithPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Willow SmithPhoto: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Kelsea BalleriniPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Kacey Musgraves in Ralph LaurenPhoto: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.KehlaniPhoto: Gilbert Flores/Billboard/Getty Images.Tori KellyPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.ClairoPhoto: Gilbert Flores/Billboard/Getty Images.Teddy SwimsPhoto: Gilbert Flores/Billboard/Getty Images.Kylie CantrallPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.RAYEPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Sheryl CrowPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Gracie Abrams in ChanelPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Noah KahanPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.John Legend \u0026 Chrissy TeigenPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.St. VincentPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.JaNa CraigPhoto: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Nikki GlaserPhoto: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.Mon LafertePhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images/The Recording Academy.MustardPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Markos D1Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images.Like what you see?
