These are the seven best everyday watches that regular collectors like you and me actually want to wear and that you might not even have heard of or considered yet for your own collection. Key Takeaways The Casio Beside BSL100 is an elusive, affordable quartz watch that looks surprisingly luxurious. Kuoe’s Old Smith Field Watch offers vintage inspiration with modern customization options. The Serica 6190 MSL Chronometer features a unique “bone clip” bracelet and COSC-certified movement. Laco’s Pilot Watch is a faithful interpretation of historical aviation timepieces. The Tenet Somerset combines modern and retro design elements for a unique aesthetic. Kurono Tokyo Seiji showcases a perfect teal lacquer dial from a master watchmaker. The Rolex Oyster Perpetual 116000 is an approachable, reliable, entry-level luxury watch. ClickyBezel In This ArticleOur PicksVideo ReviewConclusion Casio Beside BEM-SL100: The Elusive Beauty ClickyBezel ProsLooks surprisingly luxurious for an affordable quartz watch.Reminiscent of high-end brands like Grand Seiko and Patek Philippe.A rare and unique piece for collectors who enjoy a watch hunt.ConsNo longer in production, making it difficult to obtain.The price on the pre-owned market is significantly higher than its original retail price. Now, I need to preface this by saying that my first watch is, unfortunately, one of Casio’s most elusive, but I promise that it’s worth it if you hear me out on this one. That would be the Casio Beside BEM-SL100. What is it exactly? I didn’t know much about this watch when I first laid my eyes on it a few years ago, so it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve never heard of this watch, either. Nonetheless, it has all the makings of an excellent daily driver – if you can get your hands on one, of course. Rumor has it that Casio produced the Beside for a short time for the Southeast Asian market and Middle Eastern markets. Sadly, it’s no longer in production, and Casio has even stated that it has no plans to re-release it, either. So, if you enjoy a good watch hunt for an everyday watch for men, the Beside might be the one worth looking into. ClickyBezel For me, this one’s a curious watch because it looks quite expensive for what it is, which is an affordable base-level quartz and stainless steel timepiece. In fact, the Casio Beside is the cheapest watch on this entire list, yet it’s somewhat reminiscent of what we would see in watches for everyday wear from the likes of Grand Seiko, Zenith, and (dare I even say it) Patek Philippe. Looking closer at the Beside, you can see what I mean. Although not executed to nearly the same level, the flaky texture dial reminds me of Grand Seiko, and the finish and integrated shape of the case have a Tissot or Patek Philippe vibe. It looks surprisingly luxurious once it’s on the wrist, but with the carefree attitude of an entry-level quartz watch. I still wouldn’t knock it around too much, though, because you might never get the chance to buy another one of these again, and these watches will still set you back around $500 on the pre-owned market at the time of writing this article. Kuoe Old Smith Field Watch: Vintage Inspiration, Modern Appeal ClickyBezel ProsOffers customization options (crystal, lume, size, strap).Features a reliable Seiko NH35 automatic movement.Combines vintage field watch aesthetics with modern finishing.ConsLimited brand recognition compared to more established field watchmakers.Base model uses mineral glass instead of sapphire crystal. This everyday watch for men is from a newer brand out there in Kyoto, Japan, called Kuoe. They have a broad range of classically designed timepieces that I would definitely recommend checking out, but to me, it’s their Old Smith Field watch modeled after vintage British military watches that caught my eye. Field watches, in general, are some of the best daily watches because, well, they’re durable and easily read. The wearers of these watches from decades ago were quite literally in the trenches and required a watch that was easy to read with a quick twist of the wrist. That’s exactly what we have here, but reimagined for the modern collector. Kuoe offers a few different upgrades for the reference 902, which is nice for people who like to customize their watches. I opted for the base model with a domed mineral glass crystal and orange-tinted luminescent paint. If you prefer, you can swap the crystal for sapphire and the lume for Swiss Super-LumiNova in a hue called “Old Radium Light.” ClickyBezel The upgraded models have a remarkable grainy texture that adds a lot of depth to the watch face, which is slightly present on non-upgraded models but not nearly as obvious. Enthusiasts also have the choice of:   Dial: date or no-date.   Case: 35mm or 38mm.   Bracelet: nylon, leather, or 316L stainless steel. A Seiko NH35 automatic mechanical movement with a 40-hour power reserve and hacking seconds function powers each variant. Kuoe is staunchly dedicated to using Japanese movements, so it makes sense that they would choose a caliber produced by Seiko for this everyday watch for men. Now, what I like about the Old Smith is the juxtaposition of different finishing techniques. It has the matte finish style that we would expect from a vintage-inspired field watch but with a polished stainless steel case, for a bit more glitz when you want to dress up your watch. In my opinion, it’s perfect for those who want a versatile automatic field watch for under $500 but prefer something other than a Hamilton. Serica 6190 MSL Chronometer: Funky and Functional ClickyBezel ProsCOSC-certified movement for high accuracy.Unique \"bone clip\" bracelet design for optimal sizing.Limited production of 500 pieces, adding exclusivity.ConsMay be difficult to obtain due to limited quantities.Unconventional design might not appeal to all tastes. I’m excited to share my next pick, the 6190 MSL Chronometer from French brand Serica. It’s a serious tool watch with a COSC-rated mechanical movement and a retro bracelet that is so funky and unique that I can’t help but absolutely fall in love with it. As of the writing of this article, it’s Serica’s latest offering and will be produced in limited quantities of just 500 pieces throughout this year and with three different dial colors: storm gray, polar white, and enamel black. ClickyBezel Now, if you’re already familiar with Serica, you might have gathered that this watch hails from the broader 6190 Field Chronometer series but with a slightly different dial decorated with long applied lollipop-style hour markers. It also carries a new distinction—MSL—which is an acronym for a measurement of elevation and altitude called “mean sea level.” This distinction helps tie the watch back to its tool watch origins despite its somewhat ambiguous aesthetic. And speaking of aesthetics, there sure is a lot to unpack here. The case of this everyday watch for men is relatively modest at 37.7mm in diameter but has some remarkable finishes and design elements that will improve the overall daily wrist-wearing experience. The lugs twist inward and feature dual brushed and polished finishes to match the bezel, which reminds me of the bezel on Casio mentioned previously in this video. It’s very Patek Philippe with a matte top surface and shinier beveled edges. And then there’s that bracelet, known in watchmaking as the “Bonklip.” It’s been making a comeback in recent years, with Serica leading the charge. Much like the earliest instances of the bracelet, which date as far back as the 1920s, the bone clip on Serica’s 6190 MSL has links consisting of interlocking bars and sleeves. This design allows the clasp to be placed anywhere along the length of the bracelet between any two links, for the ultimate sizing experience. Not to mention, the hollow links feel much lighter on the wrist for everyday wear. Laco Pilot Watch: A Piece of Aviation History ClickyBezel ProsFaithful interpretation of historical aviation watches.Features a hacking seconds function for precise time-setting.100m water resistance, making it suitable for daily wear.ConsIt may be pricey for some collectors.Large onion crown might not suit everyone's taste. The Laco Pilot watch is easily the sportiest of the bunch. It will also appeal to history buffs as a faithful interpretation of a wartime observation watch, also known as the “Beobachtungsuhr,” developed for the German Ministry of Aviation. Now, Laco was among the few watchmakers trusted to produce this type of watch during that era. Although it doesn’t have the same robust 55mm diameter as the original 1940s model, it follows a similar design and blueprint. ClickyBezel For example, you’ll notice that the leather strap still has double rivets, which were once necessary to hold a strap to fixed bars on vintage models but are now just purely decorative thanks to the invention of handy spring bars. This everyday watch for men also sports that unmistakable onion-shaped crown that the wearer can easily manipulate even when wearing pilot gloves. Now, two dial variations exist, each aimed at providing perfect legibility. There’s the Type A dial, a simpler one with single chaptering, and the Type B with an inner hour ring and an outer minute track. For this list, I chose my personal favorite, the Type B dial. It has a hand-wind Laco 210 movement based on the Sellita SW210, and it features hacking seconds, which was a staple for many pilots used back in the day for navigation. Featuring 100m of water resistance, the Laco Pilot deserves a spot on my list. Tennet Somerset: Modern Retro Aesthetics ClickyBezel ProsUnique design with dynamic textures and dial furniture.Combines modern and retro aesthetics.Comfortable 38mm case size.ConsAs a newer brand, it may lack the heritage of more established watchmakers.Fashion-forward design might not appeal to traditionalists. The next everyday watch for men comes to us from a newer independent watch boutique in Singapore, the Tennet Somerset. What I like about this young brand is its desire to think outside the box. It isn’t enough to just display the time on a classic sector dial; instead, they’ve opted for dynamic textures and dial furniture, such as teardrop-shaped indices and skeleton delta hands, for a watch that is just as enjoyable to look at each day as it is reliable. As a result of this unique design language, the Tennet Somerset has a modern retro aesthetic about it that I find quite fascinating, particularly the various design elements of the case. The bezel has a concave shape that swoops gently away from the crystal, and the lugs, inspired by vintage watch horn lugs, add to the inherently sporty feel of the watch. ClickyBezel Most notable is the crown, which forgoes a traditional fluted design for one decorated with domino holes for maximum grip when winding the manual wind movement. It’s a fashion-forward timepiece, yet I think it will appeal to vintage watch lovers who appreciate nods to the past. One of the best everyday men’s watches, it’s also comfortable, too, measuring 38mm in diameter and featuring a supple leather strap provided by renowned strap retailer Delugs. Kurono Tokyo Seiji: The Perfect Teal ClickyBezel ProsStunning teal lacquer dial created by a master watchmaker.Limited production of 500 pieces adds exclusivity.Versatile 37mm case size.ConsInitially restricted to women buyers, which may have limited its market reach.Already sold out at retail, interested buyers are forced to go to the pre-owned market. On the heels of Tennet Somerset is another visually striking watch, this time the Kurono Tokyo Seiji, which master watchmaker Hajime Asaoka thoughtfully developed to achieve the perfect blue-green watch face. It’s only the second time that the brand has released a solid lacquer dial watch, and I have to say, they really nailed the teal hue. It almost reminds me of the Tiffany Blue, which had a lot of watch collectors in a chokehold. It has a vintage-inspired vibe, from the arrow silver minute rings to the unsigned crown and cambered sapphire crystal. The Kurono Tokyo Seiji was initially developed for female collectors, featuring a 37mm case and a white leather strap. The brand even went so far as to restrict the sale of the watch to only women, which is a bit curious because 37mm is pretty standard for men’s dress watches. ClickyBezel Still, I can see what they were trying to achieve with the case size and overall soft color palette. Overall, I think that all fans of Japanese watchmaking—men and women alike—will like this watch, particularly people who appreciate the value of an affordable timepiece designed by a master watchmaker. The Kurono Tokyo Seiji was initially produced in limited quantities of just 500 watches and has, unfortunately, already sold out on the retail level. However, if you’re interested in adding one to your watch box, a few examples have already popped up on various reselling platforms, such as Chrono24. The great news is that men and women can both buy it without restrictions at the pre-owned level. Rolex Oyster Perpetual 116000: The Classic Daily Driver ClickyBezel ProsReliable and prestigious brand with excellent craftsmanship.Versatile design that flies under the radar.Features Rolex's self-winding \"Perpetual\" technology.ConsHigher price point compared to other watches on the list.As a popular model, it might be considered too common for some collectors seeking uniqueness. Now, I know that people will hate my last watch because it’s a Rolex, but let’s be honest here—no list of the best everyday watches would be complete without one of Rolex’s most popular entry-level dress watches, the Oyster Perpetual. More specifically, reference 116000. This model is perfect as an everyday watch for men because the stainless steel finish and matching silver dial fly a little more under the radar than other Rolexes. It’s the kind of watch you don’t easily get tired of wearing. The OP is also incredibly approachable at 36mm in diameter. It’s comfortable on the wrist and appeals to a broad range of wrist sizes, sandwiched between the midsize 34mm and 41mm models. ClickyBezel Of course, there’s the matter of reliability, which this Rolex has in spades. The Oyster case, named after its incredible water resistance, is hermetically sealed up to 100m via a Twinlock crown. “Twinlock” is just Rolex jargon for a crown with double seals to protect the movement from moisture and dust. It was introduced in 1953 and is a staple on modern Rolex Oyster watches like the 116000 that I have right here. And it helps that it’s waterproof enough to wear throughout the day without a care in the world. That alone would make it one of the best everyday watches. That brings me to the movement, which operates on Rolex’s self-winding or “Perpetual” technology. If you wear this Rolex regularly, you don’t have to worry about winding it, which is quite convenient. It has a straightforward time-only movement—no extra bells and whistles, just fine Rolex craftsmanship. And I know I sound like a Rolex fanboy—I promise I’m not. I just really love this watch. But anyway, I think that it’s the perfect watch for people who want to get into Rolex ownership and see what it’s like. Video Review Conclusion Well, that’s it for this list of the best everyday watches. If you stuck around to the very end, thanks so much! I hope that I’ve helped you find the perfect everyday watch for your collection, or if you’re just starting your collection, I hope this gives you a little more inspiration. If not, hopefully, you learned something new about some lesser-known gems in the realm of watchmaking. 7 Best Everyday Watches That Collectors Actually Want to Wear SHARE ON We independently evaluate all recommended products and sercives.

I didn’t know much about this watch when I first laid my eyes on it a few years ago, so it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve never heard of this watch, either. Nonetheless, it has all the makings of an excellent daily driver – if you can get your hands on one, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumor has it that Casio produced the Beside for a short time for the Southeast Asian market and Middle Eastern markets. Sadly, it’s no longer in production, and Casio has even stated that it has no plans to re-release it, either.

In fact, the Casio Beside is the cheapest watch on this entire list, yet it’s somewhat reminiscent of what we would see in watches for everyday wear from the likes of Grand Seiko, Zenith, and (dare I even say it) \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/most-complicated-watches-ever-made/\"\u003ePatek Philippe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking closer at the Beside, you can see what I mean. Although not executed to nearly the same level, the flaky texture dial reminds me of Grand Seiko, and the finish and integrated shape of the case have a Tissot or Patek Philippe vibe. It looks surprisingly luxurious once it’s on the wrist, but with the carefree attitude of an entry-level quartz watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still wouldn’t knock it around too much, though, because you might never get the chance to buy another one of these again, and these watches will still set you back around $500 on the pre-owned market at the time of writing this article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kuoe-en.com/old-smith-90-002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKuoe Old Smith Field Watch: Vintage Inspiration, Modern Appeal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180486\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180486\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kuoe-en.com/old-smith-90-002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"the Kuoe Old Smith Field Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180486\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOffers customization options (crystal, lume, size, strap).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeatures a reliable Seiko NH35 automatic movement.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCombines vintage field watch aesthetics with modern finishing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLimited brand recognition compared to more established field watchmakers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBase model uses mineral glass instead of sapphire crystal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis everyday watch for men is from a newer brand out there in Kyoto, Japan, called Kuoe. They have a broad range of classically designed timepieces that I would definitely recommend checking out, but to me, it’s their Old Smith Field watch modeled after vintage British military watches that caught my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eField watches, in general, are some of the best daily watches because, well, they’re durable and easily read. The wearers of these watches from decades ago were quite literally in the trenches and required a watch that was easy to read with a quick twist of the wrist. That’s exactly what we have here, but reimagined for the modern collector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuoe offers a few different upgrades for the reference 902, which is nice for people who like to customize their watches. I opted for the base model with a domed mineral glass crystal and orange-tinted luminescent paint. If you prefer, you can swap the crystal for sapphire and the lume for Swiss Super-LumiNova in a hue called “Old Radium Light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180487\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180487\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"wearing the Kuoe Old Smith Field Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180487\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upgraded models have a remarkable grainy texture that adds a lot of depth to the watch face, which is slightly present on non-upgraded models but not nearly as obvious.

Kuoe is staunchly dedicated to using Japanese movements, so it makes sense that they would choose a caliber produced by Seiko for this everyday watch for men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, what I like about the Old Smith is the juxtaposition of different finishing techniques. It has the matte finish style that we would expect from a vintage-inspired field watch but with a polished stainless steel case, for a bit more glitz when you want to dress up your watch. In my opinion, it’s perfect for those who want a versatile automatic field watch for under $500 but prefer something other than a Hamilton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.serica-watches.com/en/collection-6190/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSerica 6190 MSL Chronometer: Funky and Functional\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180484\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.serica-watches.com/en/collection-6190/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"Serica 6190 MSL Chronometer\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCOSC-certified movement for high accuracy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnique \u0026#34;bone clip\u0026#34; bracelet design for optimal sizing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLimited production of 500 pieces, adding exclusivity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMay be difficult to obtain due to limited quantities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnconventional design might not appeal to all tastes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m excited to share my next pick, the 6190 MSL Chronometer from French brand Serica.

It also carries a new distinction—MSL—which is an acronym for a measurement of elevation and altitude called “mean sea level.” This distinction helps tie the watch back to its tool watch origins despite its somewhat ambiguous aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of aesthetics, there sure is a lot to unpack here. The case of this everyday watch for men is relatively modest at 37.7mm in diameter but has some remarkable finishes and design elements that will improve the overall daily wrist-wearing experience. The lugs twist inward and feature dual brushed and polished finishes to match the bezel, which reminds me of the bezel on Casio mentioned previously in this video. It’s very Patek Philippe with a matte top surface and shinier beveled edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s that bracelet, known in watchmaking as the “Bonklip.” It’s been making a comeback in recent years, with Serica leading the charge. Much like the earliest instances of the bracelet, which date as far back as the 1920s, the bone clip on Serica’s 6190 MSL has links consisting of interlocking bars and sleeves. This design allows the clasp to be placed anywhere along the length of the bracelet between any two links, for the ultimate sizing experience. Not to mention, the hollow links feel much lighter on the wrist for everyday wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.laco-watches.com/en/watches/pilot-watch-original\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaco Pilot Watch: A Piece of Aviation History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180482\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180482\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.laco-watches.com/en/watches/pilot-watch-original\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"Laco Pilot Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180482\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFaithful interpretation of historical aviation watches.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeatures a hacking seconds function for precise time-setting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e100m water resistance, making it suitable for daily wear.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt may be pricey for some collectors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLarge onion crown might not suit everyone\u0026#39;s taste.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Laco Pilot watch is easily the sportiest of the bunch.

For this list, I chose my personal favorite, the Type B dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has a hand-wind Laco 210 movement based on the Sellita SW210, and it features hacking seconds, which was a staple for many pilots used back in the day for navigation.

What I like about this young brand is its desire to think outside the box. It isn’t enough to just display the time on a classic sector dial; instead, they’ve opted for dynamic textures and dial furniture, such as teardrop-shaped indices and skeleton delta hands, for a watch that is just as enjoyable to look at each day as it is reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of this unique design language, the Tennet Somerset has a modern retro aesthetic about it that I find quite fascinating, particularly the various design elements of the case.

The Oyster case, named after its incredible water resistance, is hermetically sealed up to 100m via a Twinlock crown. “Twinlock” is just Rolex jargon for a crown with double seals to protect the movement from moisture and dust. It was introduced in 1953 and is a staple on modern Rolex Oyster watches like the 116000 that I have right here. And it helps that it’s waterproof enough to wear throughout the day without a care in the world. That alone would make it one of the best everyday watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings me to the movement, which operates on Rolex’s self-winding or “Perpetual” technology. If you wear this Rolex regularly, you don’t have to worry about winding it, which is quite convenient. It has a straightforward time-only movement—no extra bells and whistles, just fine Rolex craftsmanship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know I sound like a Rolex fanboy—I promise I’m not.

promise that it’s worth it if you hear me out on this one. That would be the Casio Beside BEM-SL100.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it exactly? I didn’t know much about this watch when I first laid my eyes on it a few years ago, so it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve never heard of this watch, either. Nonetheless, it has all the makings of an excellent daily driver – if you can get your hands on one, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumor has it that Casio produced the Beside for a short time for the Southeast Asian market and Middle Eastern markets. Sadly, it’s no longer in production, and Casio has even stated that it has no plans to re-release it, either. So, if you enjoy a good watch hunt for an everyday watch for men, the Beside might be the one worth looking into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180489\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180489\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"wearing the Casio Beside BEM-SL100\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Casio_Beside2_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180489\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this one’s a curious watch because it looks quite expensive for what it is, which is an affordable base-level quartz and stainless steel timepiece. In fact, the Casio Beside is the cheapest watch on this entire list, yet it’s somewhat reminiscent of what we would see in watches for everyday wear from the likes of Grand Seiko, Zenith, and (dare I even say it) \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/most-complicated-watches-ever-made/\"\u003ePatek Philippe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking closer at the Beside, you can see what I mean. Although not executed to nearly the same level, the flaky texture dial reminds me of Grand Seiko, and the finish and integrated shape of the case have a Tissot or Patek Philippe vibe. It looks surprisingly luxurious once it’s on the wrist, but with the carefree attitude of an entry-level quartz watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still wouldn’t knock it around too much, though, because you might never get the chance to buy another one of these again, and these watches will still set you back around $500 on the pre-owned market at the time of writing this article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kuoe-en.com/old-smith-90-002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKuoe Old Smith Field Watch: Vintage Inspiration, Modern Appeal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180486\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180486\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kuoe-en.com/old-smith-90-002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"the Kuoe Old Smith Field Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180486\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOffers customization options (crystal, lume, size, strap).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeatures a reliable Seiko NH35 automatic movement.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCombines vintage field watch aesthetics with modern finishing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLimited brand recognition compared to more established field watchmakers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBase model uses mineral glass instead of sapphire crystal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis everyday watch for men is from a newer brand out there in Kyoto, Japan, called Kuoe. They have a broad range of classically designed timepieces that I would definitely recommend checking out, but to me, it’s their Old Smith Field watch modeled after vintage British military watches that caught my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eField watches, in general, are some of the best daily watches because, well, they’re durable and easily read. The wearers of these watches from decades ago were quite literally in the trenches and required a watch that was easy to read with a quick twist of the wrist. That’s exactly what we have here, but reimagined for the modern collector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuoe offers a few different upgrades for the reference 902, which is nice for people who like to customize their watches. I opted for the base model with a domed mineral glass crystal and orange-tinted luminescent paint. If you prefer, you can swap the crystal for sapphire and the lume for Swiss Super-LumiNova in a hue called “Old Radium Light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180487\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180487\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"wearing the Kuoe Old Smith Field Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kuoe_OldSmith2_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180487\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upgraded models have a remarkable grainy texture that adds a lot of depth to the watch face, which is slightly present on non-upgraded models but not nearly as obvious.

It has the matte finish style that we would expect from a vintage-inspired field watch but with a polished stainless steel case, for a bit more glitz when you want to dress up your watch. In my opinion, it’s perfect for those who want a versatile automatic field watch for under $500 but prefer something other than a Hamilton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.serica-watches.com/en/collection-6190/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSerica 6190 MSL Chronometer: Funky and Functional\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180484\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.serica-watches.com/en/collection-6190/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"Serica 6190 MSL Chronometer\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Serica_6190MSL_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180484\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCOSC-certified movement for high accuracy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnique \u0026#34;bone clip\u0026#34; bracelet design for optimal sizing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLimited production of 500 pieces, adding exclusivity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMay be difficult to obtain due to limited quantities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnconventional design might not appeal to all tastes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m excited to share my next pick, the 6190 MSL Chronometer from French brand Serica.

It also carries a new distinction—MSL—which is an acronym for a measurement of elevation and altitude called “mean sea level.” This distinction helps tie the watch back to its tool watch origins despite its somewhat ambiguous aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of aesthetics, there sure is a lot to unpack here. The case of this everyday watch for men is relatively modest at 37.7mm in diameter but has some remarkable finishes and design elements that will improve the overall daily wrist-wearing experience. The lugs twist inward and feature dual brushed and polished finishes to match the bezel, which reminds me of the bezel on Casio mentioned previously in this video. It’s very Patek Philippe with a matte top surface and shinier beveled edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s that bracelet, known in watchmaking as the “Bonklip.” It’s been making a comeback in recent years, with Serica leading the charge. Much like the earliest instances of the bracelet, which date as far back as the 1920s, the bone clip on Serica’s 6190 MSL has links consisting of interlocking bars and sleeves. This design allows the clasp to be placed anywhere along the length of the bracelet between any two links, for the ultimate sizing experience. Not to mention, the hollow links feel much lighter on the wrist for everyday wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.laco-watches.com/en/watches/pilot-watch-original\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaco Pilot Watch: A Piece of Aviation History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180482\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180482\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.laco-watches.com/en/watches/pilot-watch-original\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"Laco Pilot Watch\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Laco_PilotWatch_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180482\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFaithful interpretation of historical aviation watches.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeatures a hacking seconds function for precise time-setting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e100m water resistance, making it suitable for daily wear.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt may be pricey for some collectors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLarge onion crown might not suit everyone\u0026#39;s taste.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Laco Pilot watch is easily the sportiest of the bunch.

What I like about this young brand is its desire to think outside the box. It isn’t enough to just display the time on a classic sector dial; instead, they’ve opted for dynamic textures and dial furniture, such as teardrop-shaped indices and skeleton delta hands, for a watch that is just as enjoyable to look at each day as it is reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of this unique design language, the Tennet Somerset has a modern retro aesthetic about it that I find quite fascinating, particularly the various design elements of the case.

More specifically, reference 116000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis model is perfect as an everyday watch for men because the stainless steel finish and matching silver dial fly a little more under the radar than other Rolexes. It’s the kind of watch you don’t easily get tired of wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe OP is also incredibly approachable at 36mm in diameter. It’s comfortable on the wrist and appeals to a broad range of wrist sizes, sandwiched between the midsize 34mm and 41mm models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1180477\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1180477\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches.jpg\" alt=\"holding a Rolex Oyster Perpetual 116000\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-675x380.jpg 675w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rolex_Oyster116000_2_EverydayWatches-696x392.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1180477\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ClickyBezel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eClickyBezel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there’s the matter of reliability, which this Rolex has in spades. The Oyster case, named after its incredible water resistance, is hermetically sealed up to 100m via a Twinlock crown. “Twinlock” is just Rolex jargon for a crown with double seals to protect the movement from moisture and dust. It was introduced in 1953 and is a staple on modern Rolex Oyster watches like the 116000 that I have right here. And it helps that it’s waterproof enough to wear throughout the day without a care in the world. That alone would make it one of the best everyday watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings me to the movement, which operates on Rolex’s self-winding or “Perpetual” technology. If you wear this Rolex regularly, you don’t have to worry about winding it, which is quite convenient. It has a straightforward time-only movement—no extra bells and whistles, just fine Rolex craftsmanship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know I sound like a Rolex fanboy—I promise I’m not. I just really love this watch. But anyway, I think that it’s the perfect watch for people who want to get into Rolex ownership and see what it’s like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"video-review\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Review\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Top 7 Best Everyday Watches\" width=\"604\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAeG5rFkHHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fin-ver\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that’s it for this list of the best everyday watches.
