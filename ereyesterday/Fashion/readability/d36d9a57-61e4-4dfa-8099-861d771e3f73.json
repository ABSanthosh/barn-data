According to Pinterest's Summer 2025 Trend Report, the briny green hue is this season's must-have shade, which is sure to delight pickle lovers everywhere.\"Dill green is a soft, earthy shade of green with a hint of yellow, similar to the color of fresh dill or the briny tone of a pickle,\" Sydney Stanback, Pinterest's Global Trends \u0026 Insights Lead, tells Fashionista via email. \"It's not too bright or bold, but it has just enough warmth to make it feel unique and fresh.\" It's a \"vintage-inspired,\" garden-ready color, directly referencing its namesake leafy herb. In the 2025 Pinterest Palette where the social media platform predicts the year's trending colors, \"dill green\" first emerged as one of the top contenders, alongside other flavorful options like cherry red, butter yellow and Alpine oat. Now, the green thumb-approved hue is on track to become a wardrobe staple.\"While colors like cherry red and butter yellow are bright and energetic, and aura indigo brings deep tones, dill green feels more natural, which is something people really seem to be looking for right now,\" Stanback explains.Pinterest cited an 80% rise in searches for \"green vibe,\" 155% in \"green kitchen designs\" and 100% in \"pickle margarita,\" fueling dill green's emergence as the shade of the summer. Plus, the entire spectrum of green hues filled the Fall 2025 season's runways across fashion's capitals, with dill green-adjacent shades popping up across the Lacoste, Saint Laurent, Hermès and Bally collections.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesStyling dill green may seem intimidating for anyone but the Green Lady of Brooklyn, but its earthy undertones make it fairly versatile for a range of aesthetics.Go full monochromatic with a head-to-toe coordinating set, or incorporate a key garment in the trending shade by building an outfit around baggy cargo pants, a printed maxi skirt, an olive-toned tank top or a billowing blouse. Pinterest noted the color's many potential style variations, with searches for \"green sequin skirt outfit\" increasing by 601% and \"green linen pants men\" increasing by 37%.Dill green also pairs well with Pinterest's other green thumb-approved summertime predictions, such as Gen Z's growing interest in garden parties, nature bathing and the \"Martha Stewart aesthetic\" (i.e. garden-to-table farming).\"I think people are really drawn to dill green this summer because it feels familiar but fresh at the same time,\" Stanback says. \"It has that natural, earthy vibe that's comforting. Plus, with all the throwbacks to early 2000s and vintage looks, this shade fits perfectly.\"Fashionista's audience includes 1 million site visitors, 110,000 newsletter subscribers and 4.74 million social media followers.
