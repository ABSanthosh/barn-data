  "description": "Lengthy trips call for breaking out our best rolling luggage, but for a quick two- to three-day getaway, we need a travel bag that lets us sail smoothly through various micro-jaunts — whether they’re via plane, train, or automobile — without getting in the way or weighing us down. This is where the weekender bag shines. Weekenders run the gamut in terms of size and shape, so what’s right for you depends on your personal packing preferences: There are durable duffles ripe for overstuffing, large canvas totes perfect for folding in an extra outfit or two, and structured bags that sit neatly on your suitcase handle. No matter which one you choose, rest assured you’ll be able to flutter to and from all your adventures with ease by slinging one over your shoulder.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
