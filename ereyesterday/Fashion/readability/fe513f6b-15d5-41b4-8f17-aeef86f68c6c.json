Some employees say working there wasn’t as great as it looked on social media.Matilda Djerf has said her lifestyle company, Djerf Avenue, is more of a community than a brand. A tabloid report about the company included accusations of workplace bullying.Credit...Loulou d'Aki for The New York TimesDec. 17, 2024If you don’t know Matilda Djerf by name, you might know her by her hair.Blonde and thick with swoopy bangs, Ms. Djerf’s hair has inspired many TikTok-motivated haircuts in recent years. A Swedish influencer, she began a fashion brand, Djerf Avenue, in 2019 through which she sold glorified basics — think gray trousers and simple button-up shirts — to a growing and devoted fan base seeking to emulate her Scandi-style. The line has since expanded to include home goods and loungewear, with a cosmetics spinoff, Djerf Beauty. (Yes, there are hair products.)Ms. Djerf — the D in her last name is silent — is 27 and has 4.5 million followers between TikTok and Instagram. In 2023, she was featured on the Forbes “30 Under 30” list.“We try to be more than a fashion brand,” Ms. Djerf told The New York Times in 2022. “We are just as focused on building a community.”This week, however, Ms. Djerf posted a lengthy apology on social media after the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet published a report in which 11 anonymous current and former employees said they were mistreated while working for Djerf Avenue. The report accused Ms. Djerf of bullying staff and said she had a special toilet reserved for herself and a small group of employees. When someone outside the group used the private toilet, that person was made to clean it, according to Aftonbladet.While her brand was built at least partly by promoting inclusivity and a wide size range — “Do I want to be at a catwalk show and see only size 00s walk the runway? Not really,” Ms. Djerf told The Times in 2022 — one person quoted in the Aftonbladet report claimed that Ms. Djerf, using an expletive, referred to a plus-size model as “too fat” while reviewing photos.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
