Carried by company directors and mafioso’s en-route to a sit-down, they were seen as practical, not polished. But times have changed. Today, briefcases like Roderer’s have evolved from pure corporate baggage into sleek, stylish companions for city-bound commuters, creative professionals, and guys who simply appreciate the finer things. Whether you’re dashing between meetings, hopping on the subway, or just want something that brings a bit of luxe to your everyday life, a well-crafted briefcase is the ultimate accessory. And Roderer’s version? It hits every note—luxury, function, and a punch of personality. Let’s unpack it (pun fully intended), with this detailed review. Watch our Review  In This ArticleWho Is RodererFirst ImpressionsInside The BriefcaseStyle ScenariosThe Verdict Who is Roderer? If you haven’t heard of Roderer, consider this your introduction. Founded in 2016 by French designer Olivier Birault, Roderer was born out of a desire to elevate everyday essentials for the contemporary gentleman. Inspired by years of globe-trotting as a Formula 1 executive and CEO of a watch company, Birault saw a glaring gap: men who dressed impeccably were often stuck lugging around poorly designed leather goods. So, he decided to do something about it. Roderer embodies the mantra “less is more,” blending minimalist sophistication with timeless elegance. The brand creates staples that are functional and iconic, offering a permanent collection of wallets, bags, bracelets, and accessories that transcend fleeting trends. Each piece is carefully handmade from the finest materials, reflecting an unwavering commitment to quality. First Impressions: All About the Exterior View More on Roderer One look, and it’s pretty obvious that this isn’t the same thing your father used to leave by the front door; Roderer’s design is classy (sorry, pops), elegant, and eye-catching without being fancy or flashy. At the heart its sophistication lies the Italian leather—a hallmark of craftsmanship revered the world over. Italy’s storied history with the material goes beyond just fashion; it’s about tradition, precision, and an almost obsessive dedication to quality. The leather on this bag feels genuinely soft yet reassuringly durable—like the handshake of a seasoned diplomat. It’s tactile and refined, with a texture that speaks of luxury, but tough enough to handle the everyday demands of day-to-day life. Thanks to its stabilizing pads, the Award Briefcase stands tall wherever you set it down—no sagging, tipping, or awkward collapsing when you’re at a meeting or grabbing coffee. Those little beauties are the unsung heroes, giving it structure without bulk, so it always looks polished and professional, even when fully loaded. But the real MVP for the jet-setting gent? The trolley strap at the back. It lets you securely hook it onto your suitcase, sparing you the awkward balancing act of juggling handles through a busy terminal. Whether you’re dashing to catch a flight or wheeling your way to a weekend getaway, this feature makes travel effortless—and lets you keep one hand free for your coffee or boarding pass. There’s also the double carry handles. Sturdy yet comfortable, they’re kind to your hands even on the longest days. And finally, the front zip pocket; a thoughtfully placed detail for all the essentials you need at hand, from business cards and charging cables to a quick snack to keep you going. Inside the Briefcase: Room to Spare View More on Roderer The inside of a bag is just as important as the outside. What’s the point of looking good if you can only hold car keys and a mobile phone? This is one of those deceptively big bags that somehow fits everything you need without bursting at the seams. It holds your laptop, tablet, a pair of glasses, headphones, a sketchbook, wallet, and there’s still space left over. I mean, what kind of wizardry is this? Roderer has nailed it with the layout—plenty of room, but the compartments are organized enough to prevent the “endless pit” effect. Each item has its place, and yet there’s flexibility to fit in an extra file or two when you’re really maxing it out. The materials inside match the elegance on the exterior, with a lining that feels durable and upscale without the risk of fraying or scratching up your tech. If you’re the sort of guy who likes to have his belongings in pristine condition, Roderer has your back. Style Scenarios: From Office to After-Hours The Award briefcase is versatile; I’m talking navy blazer or white sneaker level of adaptability. Whatever the look, it just works. Which, if I’m being honest, I definitely didn’t expect. Pair it with a tailored suit, and it’s right at home in any corporate setting, giving off major “I’ve  arrived” energy. But don’t mistake it for an office-only affair; this briefcase transitions beautifully to more casual settings, too. Imagine: you’re meeting a client in a fancy lunch spot, or heading to a cafe in jeans, Chelsea boots, and a lightweight sweater. This briefcase doesn’t miss a beat. It’s luxurious enough to feel elevated in any situation, from boardrooms to brunches, but thanks to its color and style, it never feels pretentious. The Verdict: Is It Worth It? Absolutely. Roderer’s Award briefcase is big on quality with a side of quiet confidence. It’s for the guy who understands the value of essentials that don’t just get the job done but do so with style. Luxurious without being delicate, spacious without straying into luggage territory, and effortlessly stylish, this is a bag that checks every box. And here’s the kicker: it’s not just a smart purchase for yourself—it’s the kind of gift that’ll make you the holiday hero. Available in a versatile navy blue, it’s the perfect everyday companion that provides the perfect balance of design and function. Trust me, whoever unwraps this will be looking for reasons to take it out. Billy is a content specialist and social media manager. His portfolio includes articles for publications such as British GQ, Esquire and Men’s Health. A self-confessed lover of luxury streetwear, he admits to an unhealthy obsession for baseball caps and high-end sneakers.

Carried by company directors and mafioso’s en-route to a sit-down, they were seen as practical, not polished. But times have changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, briefcases like Roderer’s have evolved from pure corporate baggage into sleek, stylish companions for city-bound commuters, creative professionals, and guys who simply appreciate the finer things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re dashing between meetings, hopping on the subway, or just want something that brings a bit of luxe to your everyday life, a well-crafted briefcase is the ultimate accessory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Roderer’s version?

Founded in 2016 by French designer Olivier Birault, Roderer was born out of a desire to elevate everyday essentials for the contemporary gentleman. Inspired by years of globe-trotting as a Formula 1 executive and CEO of a watch company, Birault saw a glaring gap: men who dressed impeccably were often stuck lugging around poorly designed leather goods. So, he decided to do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderer embodies the mantra “less is more,” blending minimalist sophistication with timeless elegance. The brand creates staples that are functional and iconic, offering a permanent collection of wallets, bags, bracelets, and accessories that transcend fleeting trends. Each piece is carefully handmade from the finest materials, reflecting an unwavering commitment to quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"impressions\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFirst Impressions: All About the Exterior\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1184452\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1184452\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.roderer.co/products/award-briefcase-italian-leather-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer.jpg\" alt=\"the Award Briefcase by Roderer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer.jpg 1000w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_theAwardBriefcasebyRoderer-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1184452\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.roderer.co/products/award-briefcase-italian-leather-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eView More on Roderer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne look, and it’s pretty obvious that this isn’t the same thing your father used to leave by the front door; Roderer’s design is classy (sorry, pops), elegant, and eye-catching without being fancy or flashy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the heart its sophistication lies the Italian leather—a hallmark of craftsmanship revered the world over. Italy’s storied history with the material goes beyond just fashion; it’s about tradition, precision, and an almost obsessive dedication to quality. The leather on this bag feels genuinely soft yet reassuringly durable—like the handshake of a seasoned diplomat. It’s tactile and refined, with a texture that speaks of luxury, but tough enough to handle the everyday demands of day-to-day life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to its stabilizing pads, the Award Briefcase stands tall wherever you set it down—no sagging, tipping, or awkward collapsing when you’re at a meeting or grabbing coffee. Those little beauties are the unsung heroes, giving it structure without bulk, so it always looks polished and professional, even when fully loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the real MVP for the jet-setting gent? The trolley strap at the back. It lets you securely hook it onto your suitcase, sparing you the awkward balancing act of juggling handles through a busy terminal. Whether you’re dashing to catch a flight or wheeling your way to a weekend getaway, this feature makes travel effortless—and lets you keep one hand free for your coffee or boarding pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also the double carry handles. Sturdy yet comfortable, they’re kind to your hands even on the longest days. And finally, the front zip pocket; a thoughtfully placed detail for all the essentials you need at hand, from business cards and charging cables to a quick snack to keep you going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"inside\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eInside the Briefcase: Room to Spare\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1184453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1184453\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.roderer.co/products/award-briefcase-italian-leather-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase.jpg\" alt=\"putting a phone in the pocket inside the briefcase\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase.jpg 1000w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roderer_puttingthephoneinthepocketinsidethebriefcase-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1184453\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.roderer.co/products/award-briefcase-italian-leather-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eView More on Roderer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of a bag is just as important as the outside.

It holds your laptop, tablet, a pair of glasses, headphones, a sketchbook, wallet, and there’s still space left over. I mean, what kind of wizardry is this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderer has nailed it with the layout—plenty of room, but the compartments are organized enough to prevent the “endless pit” effect. Each item has its place, and yet there’s flexibility to fit in an extra file or two when you’re really maxing it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe materials inside match the elegance on the exterior, with a lining that feels durable and upscale without the risk of fraying or scratching up your tech.
