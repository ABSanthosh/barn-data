  "description": "Bubble hems had their breakout moment last year. But if you thought they were a fleeting trend, think again. What started with a few puffed-up skirts and dresses in the fall of 2024 has officially snowballed into a full-blown takeover: bubble-hem tops, shorts, matching sets — you name it. But if you’re a purist (or just love a good aughts throwback), the bubble skirt remains the gold standard for making a voluminous statement. Designers have doubled down for spring 2025, delivering everything from Chloé’s dreamy high-low dresses to Alaïa’s sculptural duvet-like skirts, diaphanous draped versions at Stella McCartney, and cocktail-ready takes (hello, wedding guest season) at Emilia Wickstead and Dries Van Noten. The best part? Bubble skirts are surprisingly wearable and easy to style. Pair a midi with a simple tank and loafers, layer a mini with a spring jacket and ballet flats, or throw one on with sneakers and a sweater tossed over your shoulders (so street style coded)  — the drama’s built in.  Ahead, 16 bubble-hem skirts and dresses that’ll have you swishing through spring and beyond. Bubble Hem Mini Dresses From Free People’s bright red stunner to Reformation’s gingham drop-waist and Gap’s tie-strap mini, these bubble-hemmed dresses deliver maximum impact with minimal effort. Crisp cottons, airy prints, and easy silhouettes make them feel light, playful, and ready for every spring plan. Bubble Hem Mini Skirts The 2000s fashion favorite is officially back — and looking fresher than ever. Think utilitarian-inspired pleats, pinstripes, and pouffed-up color pops made for movement (and a good twirl). Bubble Hem Midi Dresses Bubble midis are getting the 2025 upgrade: dreamy draping, voluminous hems, and punchy tones built for sunny days and RSVP season alike. Whether you’re after floaty pastels, sleek sheers, or something in between, there’s a bubble midi for it. Bubble Hem Midi Skirts The silhouette that started with crisp black and white is getting a colorful refresh. This season’s bubble midis come in bright cottons, bold prints, and easy neutral shades, made for spring days, rooftop hangs, and everywhere else you want to make a sartorial statement.
