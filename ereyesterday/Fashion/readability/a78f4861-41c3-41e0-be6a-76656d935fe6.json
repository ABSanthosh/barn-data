Our students understand that their appearance tells a story about who they are and where they're headed.\" Visit here to see Vogue's photo story on Morehouse's students and faculty and their thoughts on the college's sartorial history, their personal style and how they're honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. {Vogue/paywalled}Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesBeauty brands are shifting to social commerce platform OrmeWith TikTok's future still largely uncertain, some beauty brands are turning to new social commerce platforms. Orme has emerged as a top contender for a replacement platform as it \"drives higher ROI for both brands and influencers while prioritizing user privacy,\" the company claims. The Orme marketplace was co-founded by Xcel Brands and Kconnect Bio, and the platform aims to cultivate interest-based communities while not sharing any customer data. \"By connecting with audiences that share common interests, brands can enhance their ROI and build deeper, more authentic relationships with their customers,\" Robert D'Loren, chairman and CEO of Xcel Brands, told WWD. {WWD/paywalled}Marine Serre and Repetto launch footwear collaborationMarine Serre is teaming up with Repetto, a brand known for its ballet shoes and dancewear, on a capsule collection featuring two Repetto styles: the Lilouh (in black, silver and fire red) and the Camille featuring Marine Serre's All Over Moon print (in denim, black, white and fire red). \"As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,\" Marine Serre said in a statement. Ranging in price from $500 to $525, the ballet-style shoes are available now on both Marine Serre and Repetto's websites. See the styles from the collaboration, below. {Fashionista inbox}Fashion's most anticipated M\u0026A hot spots in 2025With low interest rates and a seemingly \"business-friendly\" Trump administration, 2025 is poised to see plenty of mergers and acquisitions. Kapital, True Religion and Bonpoint have recently changed hands, while Versace may find a new home after its current owner Capri Holdings is reportedly shopping around. Skims and Vuori both have multi-billion-dollar valuations and have been waiting for the right moment to hold their initial public offerings. Most desired brands are holding out for a more favorable environment (aka even lower interest rates), and investors expect the deals in 2025 will feature companies in need of a cash infusion to either reach a new level of growth or survive. There's also a potential for more public market brands to go private as well as a continued rise in licensing firms acquiring distressed independent labels. {Business of Fashion/paywalled}Ganni signs four-year deal with polyester recyclerGanni has signed a four-year agreement to use Cycora, a recycled polyester created by L.A.-based material innovation startup Ambercycle. Ganni agreed to purchase Cycora before Ambercycle had produced it, and Ganni's co-founder Nicolaj Reffstrup says he believes in the material's potential to \"change the game\" when it comes to textile-to-textile recycling. Cycora is made from a mix of post-consumer and post-industrial polyester textile waste, but Ganni has chosen to only use Cycora from post-consumer textile waste. Ambercycle also has ongoing partnerships with Inditex, Arc'teryx, Reformation and Gap Athleta. {Vogue Business/paywalled}The wellness fertility boom is just getting startedFor some, fertility journeys can be a costly endeavor, especially since health insurance may not cover fertility treatments until after a year of trying to get pregnant. Frida, a parenting brand known for its postpartum products, offers an at-home insemination kit at CVS for just $49.99 for those looking to jumpstart their fertility journey. The wellness industry has already covered gut health and stress, and now it's moving onto fertility and conception. For example, supplement brand Perelel launched fertility-supporting antioxidants, supplement brand Ritual released a fertility-boosting powder and fertility-tracking app Premom also launched a line of fertility-aiding supplements and an at-home ovulation tracker. {Glossy/paywalled}Tune into the Fashionista Network to join the conversation with fashion and beauty industry leaders.

Kapital, True Religion and Bonpoint have recently changed hands, while Versace may find a new home after its current owner Capri Holdings is reportedly shopping around. \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/skims\"\u003eSkims\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/vuori\"\u003eVuori\u003c/a\u003e both have multi-billion-dollar valuations and have been waiting for the right moment to hold their initial public offerings. Most desired brands are holding out for a more favorable environment (aka even lower interest rates), and investors expect the deals in 2025 will feature companies in need of a cash infusion to either reach a new level of growth or survive. There\u0026#39;s also a potential for more public market brands to go private as well as a continued rise in licensing firms acquiring distressed independent labels. {\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/direct-to-consumer/fashions-most-anticipated-ma-hot-spots-in-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBusiness of Fashion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"ganni-signs-four-year-deal-with-polyester-recycler\"\u003eGanni signs four-year deal with polyester recycler\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fashionista.com/designers/ganni\"\u003eGanni\u003c/a\u003e has signed a four-year agreement to use Cycora, a recycled polyester created by L.A.-based material innovation startup Ambercycle. Ganni agreed to purchase Cycora before Ambercycle had produced it, and Ganni\u0026#39;s co-founder Nicolaj Reffstrup says he believes in the material\u0026#39;s potential to \u0026#34;change the game\u0026#34; when it comes to textile-to-textile recycling. Cycora is made from a mix of post-consumer and post-industrial polyester textile waste, but Ganni has chosen to only use Cycora from post-consumer textile waste. Ambercycle also has ongoing partnerships with Inditex, Arc\u0026#39;teryx, Reformation and Gap Athleta. {\u003ca href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/ganni-inks-four-year-deal-with-polyester-recycler\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eVogue\u003c/em\u003e Business\u003c/a\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-wellness-fertility-boom-is-just-getting-started\"\u003eThe wellness fertility boom is just getting started\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some, fertility journeys can be a costly endeavor, especially since health insurance may not cover fertility treatments until after a year of trying to get pregnant. Frida, a parenting brand known for its postpartum products, offers an at-home insemination kit at CVS for just $49.99 for those looking to jumpstart their fertility journey. The wellness industry has already covered gut health and stress, and now it\u0026#39;s moving onto fertility and conception. For example, supplement brand Perelel launched fertility-supporting antioxidants, supplement brand Ritual released a fertility-boosting powder and fertility-tracking app Premom also launched a line of fertility-aiding supplements and an at-home ovulation tracker. {\u003ca href=\"https://www.glossy.co/beauty/wellness/the-wellness-fertility-boom-is-just-getting-started/\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGlossy\u003c/a\u003e/paywalled}\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://f.chat/S522\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTune into the Fashionista Network to join the conversation with fashion and beauty industry leaders.
