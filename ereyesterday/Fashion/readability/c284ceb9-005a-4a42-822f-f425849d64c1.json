  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Skims x Roberto CavalliYour swimsuit collection just got an upgrade courtesy of Skims x Roberto Cavalli. Kim Kardashian’s brand has teamed up with the Italian label to create a collection of form-fitting swimwear with archival Cavalli prints — think a scoop-neck one-piece splashed with a tiger face, separates adorned with florals, and matching flowy coverups. “We paired Cavalli’s most iconic prints with our signature swim silhouettes to deliver a sexy collection that empowers everybody to own swim season, no matter where they vacation,” Kardashian said in a press release. Shop on June 27 at Skims Hill House Launches Event Dressing Capsule Get ready to take your Nap Dress outside, because Hill House has debuted a capsule collection for event dressing.

Shop on June 3 at Isabel Marant and June 5 at Converse.Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid BlushCream blush has been on trend, but some find the staying power lacking. That’s why cream-to-powder products are on our radar this summer, including Kylie Cosmetics' latest Hybrid Blush. Combining the easy-to-blend nature of cream makeup and the smoothing effect of a powder, the new product brands itself as “mistake-proof.” Available in eight different shades, our favorite hues include Sienna (a terracotta orange) and Slow Jam (a punchy grape shade).Available to shop now at Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid Blush, $, available at Kylie CosmeticsLevi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sAnastasia Beverly Hills Smooth Blur Contour StickStick applicators have redefined contouring, making it easier than ever to accentuate cheekbones and add dimension to the face.
