If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Frost is nipping at our noses, which means our slouchy jackets and over-the-knee boots are back in the wardrobe rotation. As you swap out your fall dresses with their winter counterparts, consider upgrading some of your favorite styles. Throughout the chilly months ahead, you might opt for long-sleeve sweater and velvet dresses for a more festive feel, or maxi dresses for extra coverage and warmth. We’ve rounded up a range of trending silhouettes appropriate for various occasions, from casual get-togethers and work to NYE parties and winter weddings. Shop the best cool-weather styles from reliable reader-favorite brands like J.Crew, Anthropologie, Zara, and Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 New Years Eve Dresses New Years Eve celebrations always call for some sparkle, so we’re beelining for the chunky sequins and glitter. From mini dresses fit for rooftop bars and clubs to midis appropriate for lavish restaurant reservations, you’ll be dressed to the nines and ready to ring in the new year. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sweater Dresses Whether you’re dressing for the office, casual dinners, log cabin escapes, or window shopping, a sweater dress will serve you well. There’s a lot of variety, from jersey to cashmere, lightweight to thick knits — but all these cozy styles will keep you warm and comfortable throughout the season. We’ve found the best new sweater dresses in a range of lengths and colors, such as a button-up cardigan for work, a red maxi for winter festivities, and an off-the-shoulder mini for date night. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Wedding Guest Dresses If you’ve got weddings approaching and still don’t have your look, we’ve got you: Seek out rich jewel tones and classic black dresses with a twist (think bows and off-the-shoulder necklines). If the nuptials require cocktail attire, consider a mini or midi dress that’s versatile enough to wear again for other winter parties. A black-tie dress code calls for a gown, but you get bonus points if it’s in a festive color or bedazzled to the max. DashDividers_1_500x100 Velvet Dresses When we think of winter fabrics, our minds automatically go to velvet. It’s soft, smooth, and simply scrumptious — a great option for cocktail events and winter weddings, especially in a fitted midi or maxi silhouette. We also found minis with fun details like fluttery sleeves and lace collars for a range of other seasonal festivities, like potlucks and at-home NYE parties.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Maxi Dresses Maxi dresses aren’t just for the summer — in fact, they’re arguably ideal for winter, as the ankle-skimming, floor-grazing styles will keep your legs shielded from the frigid air. For casual occasions, lounge dresses and long sweater dresses are great. For more formal events, look for elevated one-shoulder and off-the-shoulder necklines. Like what you see?
