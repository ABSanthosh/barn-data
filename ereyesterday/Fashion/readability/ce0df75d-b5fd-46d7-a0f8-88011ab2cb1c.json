  "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: summer work outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Getting dressed every day — for work, in particular — can be a chore. Fashion decision fatigue can make it feel like you have nothing to wear, when really your style inspiration has just run dry, especially in the summer, when the steaming-hot temperatures don’t care about your office dress code. But the solution doesn’t have to be stuffing shopping bags (or virtual carts) full of new clothes (though adding a few thoughtfully selected items might not hurt); instead, you just have to try to style your existing wardrobe in fun and creative ways. Thankfully, there’s plenty of inspiration to be found on our Instagram feeds, which are full of the hottest summer trends — think: polka dot patterns, boho silhouettes, and sporty styles — and fashion staples, like oversized blazers and crisp button-front shirts. Ahead, find 20 summer-ready outfits that you can wear to the office and beyond.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Matching Set Because there’s more to matching sets than coordinating loungewear and tailored suits. Seek out a set in luxe, heat-friendly materials, like the textured two-piece seen here, for a low-effort, put-together look.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Skirt SetIf pants are not your summer vibe, make skirt sets your best friend. Layer wisely so you can adapt your outfit for the office and happy hour drinks that evening. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Wide-Leg JeansIf your office is casual enough, make your go-to work uniform a breezy button-up and pair of wide-leg jeans. It’s a timeless, confidence-boosting outfit that also creates some breathing room. Summer Work Outfit Idea: CulottesJeans a no-go at your workplace? Make a statement with a pair of flowy culottes instead. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Polka DotsIt’s not often that a current fashion trend can be worn in most workplaces, but polka-dot patterns are the exception to that unwritten rule. Why not get a little playful at the office for once?Summer Work Outfit Idea: Drop-Waist DressBring your European summer dreams to work with you with a cute drop-waist dress. Throw a blazer over it if you would like more coverage for the office setting (or that AC).Summer Work Outfit Idea:  Blouse + Maxi Skirt When it comes to getting dressed for both work and summer temperatures, you can’t go wrong with a blouse and maxi skirt. We love the floral pattern on the vintage piece pictured here.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Oversized Blazer + Skirt      Lean into your preppy side with a classic skirt suit (necktie optional), but add cool factor with an oversized blazer. We love how dynamic the extra-long sleeves seen here are.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Two-Tone Blazer Have the kind of job where wearing a blazer is a must? Bring more variety to your look and make things more interesting by opting for a two-tone option instead. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Two-Tone Suit Or go the extra mile and make your entire office-ready matching set two-tone.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Cropped Blazer Your 9-to-5 will go from blah to cool with a cropped blazer adding just enough businesscore edge.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Denim Midi Skirt Because denim is definitely more dressed up and work-appropriate when it comes in the form of a midi skirt, right? Swap out the sweater seen here for a lighter layer, and you’re summer-ready. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Dressed Up Patchwork Denim You can even take it a step further and push office-attire boundaries with a trendy patchwork denim set or dress. Bonus points for the equally on-trend colored tights and matching shoes. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Black + White It’s hard to go wrong with a classic black-and-white look — we love the shade contrast between the outfit and accessories in this Paris street style look.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Trench Coat Because any outfit feels a tad more sophisticated when topped up with a trench coat — an essential warm-weather layer for rainy days. Keep your commute casual by adding your favourite baseball cap, like seen here. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Dress + Collared Top Style your go-to workwear dress by layering it over a lightweight top with a statement collar. It’s a simple way to make a tried-and-true piece feel new again.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Waistcoat Vests and waistcoats are continuing their dominance into this summer, and, luckily, this is a trend that makes perfect sense in an office setting.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Sweater Vest If a structured waistcoat feels a bit too stuffy for your liking, try putting on a stylish sweater vest over your favorite white button-up.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Touches of Leopard Print The leopard-print trend is, undeniably, harder to incorporate into a work-ready outfit. But if you’re all in on the print, fret not: Sprinkle touches of it into your look — on a collar, a handbag, or even a pair of shoes — and you’re good to go.Spring Work Outfit Idea: Matching Suit Set Picture this: It’s a sunny Monday morning and you want nothing to do with work. Put on a matching suit — in whatever pattern or hue you prefer — and you’ll instantly feel ready for the week ahead, even if you’d rather be on vacation.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Oversized Button-Up Because nothing says “effortlessly chic” like an oversized button-up shirt. Opt for a linen version to stay cool.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Pastel Midi Dress Midi dresses are rightfully a workwear staple. Add some seasonal fun to your wardrobe by opting for one in a pretty pastel hue. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Puffy Sleeves Voluminous sleeves will ensure the only drama you’re creating at the office is through your outfit.Summer Work Outfit Idea: Peplum Top We don’t mean to alarm you, but the early 2010s are calling and telling you that it is indeed time to break out the peplum tops again. Spring Work Outfit Idea: Metallic ShoesWhy not make the shoes the star of your outfit — especially when you have a covetable metallic pair to work with. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Collared Mini Dress This Lauren Chan look is the ideal summer fashion inspo: a warm weather-ready dress and cute ballet flats. Pro-tip: Experiment with the color and pattern of the socks to bring a bigger pop of personality to your outfit. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Tenniscore  If your sense of style leans more sporty-chic, channel the tenniscore aesthetic by throwing a blazer over a court-ready dress. Just switch out the sneakers for a pair of office-friendly shoes. Summer Work Outfit Idea: Floral Jumpsuit Do we really have to say anything more? Spring Work Outfit Idea: Ruffles Because how could you not have a good day while wearing frills and ruffles? Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?Outfit Inspo For Styling A Waistcoat This SeasonFestival Outfit Ideas To Inspire Your Summer StyleTop Spring Clothes \u0026 Accessories For 2024",
