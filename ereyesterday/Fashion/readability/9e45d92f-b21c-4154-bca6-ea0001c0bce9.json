It’s not always as simple as buying the things you like. There needs to be extra thought put into your purchases to ensure you’re investing in clothes that are not only stylish but comfortable and flattering too. Footwear is no different. Mess it up and you (and your feet) will suffer the consequences that come with backing the wrong horse. To help, I’ve done my homework to pull together the best shoes for overweight men. Keep reading for my detailed round-up, including different types of shoes for every budget and occasion. From gym sneakers to walking boots, you’re sure to find something that fits. Key Takeaways Finding shoes that offer comfort and support is a crucial mission for anyone. But for overweight men, it becomes even more important. The right footwear not only offers comfort and stability, it also plays a pivotal role in foot health and easing the strain on joints. I’ve been searching for the best shoes for overweight men and found the finest footwear money can buy. Considering factors such as cushioning, durability, and fit, I’ll be presenting the styles every guy needs, including Columbia’s Tamiami boat shoes and Cariuma’s OCA Low sneakers. In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsWhy You Should Trust Us Final VerdictFAQs extra_inches_plussizeblo / Instagram Best Overall: Columbia Tamiami PFG Boat Shoes Why it’s great: This is versatility at its best. A wide-fitting sneaker, boot, and shoe all in one, it’s casual enough to wear with sweatpants but won’t feel out of place with jeans or khakis. Deceptively light with plenty of cushioning, they’re actually designed for anglers, but will serve you just as well for days in the city or summer vacations. Bonus points are awarded for the water and stain-resistant fabric. How it feels: They may not look it, but these bad boys are super light. The outer features mainly mesh and the Techlite midsole gives you that cushion-like feel. Flaws but not dealbreakers: I’m struggling with this one. There’s an argument for them needing to be a little more robust. I’m nitpicking, though. Sizes Available: 7-17 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 8 | Slip resistant: Yes Best For Travel: Tropicfeel Monsoon Sneakers Why it’s great: Allowing you to stay light on your feet wherever you end up, the Monsoon sneakers from Tropicfeel are an all-terrain design that’s water-friendly (you can swim in them if you like), quick-drying, and slip-resistant. Lightweight and packable, they feature an ultra cushioning sole that’ll look after your feet and make long days traveling less painful. How it feels: Weighing only 0.2kg, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing them. That is until you feel a little breeze that’ll make its way through the soft mesh upper. Flaws but not dealbreakers: The slip-on construction and sprint laces are a nifty feature but may take a little getting used to if you consider yourself old school. Sizes Available: 6-12.5 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 5 | Slip resistant: Yes Best on Amazon: TIOSEBON Knitted Shoes Why it’s great: At this price, you’ll struggle to find another shoe that provides as much comfort. Breathable, lightweight, and flexible, they feature a stretchy knitted upper that expands with your feet as you move. Better yet, they have an EVA sole that supports and cushions impact. How it feels: Soft and skin-friendly, you’ll probably liken them to a pair of compression socks (albeit a little thicker). Thanks to the light and airy upper, you don’t have to worry about breaking them in. Flaws but not dealbreakers: While there’s some cushioning to help with comfort, they do lack support. You’ll also need to go up half a size if your feet are particularly wide as they only offer one type of fit. Sizes Available: 7-14 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 5 | Slip resistant: Yes Best Walking Boots: Oboz Bridger Mid B-Dry Hiking Boot Why it’s great: Equipped with a supportive and protective outsole, as well as an insole designed to put your feet in a natural position, they’re ideal for big guys who experience overpronation. They’ll ensure a smooth and comfortable walk as you explore the great outdoors. Meanwhile supporting your ankles and keeping moisture out using a waterproofing system. For those that need it, you can choose the wide version. How it feels: These are probably the best walking shoes for heavy men, just what you’d expect from a pair of quality walking boots. Seriously tough but with a soft side (thanks to the nubuck sections). Flaws but not dealbreakers: Some reviewers have complained they feel a little tight, so I’d suggest opting for the wide fit or go half a size up. Sizes Available: 7-15 | Fit: Standard, Wide | Colors available: 3 | Slip resistant: Yes Best Running: ASICS Men’s Gel-Nimbus 26 Why it’s great: With over 400 five-star reviews on Amazon, it’s clear I’m not the only one who loves these ASICS running shoes. Offering maximum cushioning thanks to its GEL technology, the award-winning sneaker has been rated as the most comfortable running shoe—making it the perfect option for big guys looking to clock up a few miles. Thankfully, they’re available in a ‘wide’ and ‘extra wide-fit’ too. How it feels: I’ve never walked on clouds, but I imagine it would feel a little like walking in these shoes. Soft, squishy, and lightweight, you’ll often forget you’re even wearing them at all. Flaws but not dealbreakers: A sneaker like this doesn’t go unnoticed. Sizes can sell pretty fast and chances are you’ll probably see some fellow runners rocking these on your next outing. Sizes Available: 7-15 | Fit: Standard, Wide, Extra Wide | Colors available: 10+ | Slip resistant: Not specified Best Shoes for Men Who Are on Their Feet All Day: Brooks Beast ’20 Running Shoes Why it’s great: Most overweight guys roll too far inward with each stride, causing havoc on their ankles and feet. Sneakers like this give you the stability and support you need to avoid serious damage, especially when you’re standing all day. They’re available in wide and extra-wide and are designed to remove impact from running or long periods on your feet. The specialized cushioning deserves an honorable mention. How it feels: The engineered mesh upper allows breathability, while the cushioning gives you a super soft, luxurious feeling underfoot. Flaws but not dealbreakers: They’re quite expensive. But can you really put a price on comfort? I think not. Sizes Available: 8-16 | Fit: Standard, Wide, Extra Wide | Colors available: 4 | Slip resistant: Yes Best Luxury: Norda 001 Mesh Running Sneakers Why it’s great: Inspired by Canada’s toughest conditions, these ultra-light Norda running shoes aren’t afraid to take on a heavy load. They’re the first sneakers in the world to be made from a bio-based mesh material that provides unrivaled performance and abrasion resistance (no rubbing). You can wear them for pounding pavement (of course) but they’re a comfy choice for the gym or weekend walks too. How it feels: Norda’s sneakers are made with custom TPU insoles, which give them insanely good energy absorption—meaning they feel a bit like wearing a couple of squishy sponges on your feet. Heaven. Flaws but not dealbreakers: Norda’s sneakers come up a little small, so take a half size larger than normal. You’ll also need to Sizes Available: 7-13 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 4 | Slip resistant: Yes Best for Work: URRAX Orthopedic Shoes Why it’s great: The perfect option for casual days in the office, these are undoubtedly one of the best shoes for overweight men. They come with a cushioned midsole that helps to relieve metatarsal arch and heel pain, while correcting the abnormal walking patterns often used by heavyset guys. They’re light, but durable enough to cope with long-term wear. How it feels: The soft foam layer makes it feel like you’re walking on air. I’m sure you’ve heard that one before, but it really does. Flaws but not dealbreakers: These may be a little too casual for some offices, so you’ll need to get the bosses blessing first. I’m sure they will understand once you tell them just how comfortable they are. Sizes Available: 8-14 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 3 | Slip resistant: Yes Best Workout Shoes: Nobull Gum Trainer+ Why it’s great: With its supportive structure and cushioning, these training shoes will help you start shifting some of that extra weight. Made using a super tough (practically indestructible) upper and molded, anatomical insole, they’re guaranteed to be your go-to for years to come. How it feels: If you thought your workouts were tough, wait until you see these. They’re certainly not soft on the outside but the inner cushioning will come in handy as your feet begin to tire. Flaws but not dealbreakers: These are designed for high-impact workouts. If you’re taking your training in another direction, you might want to find an alternative. Sizes Available: 8-18 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 6 | Slip resistant: Not specified Best Sneakers: Cariuma OCA Low Sneakers Why it’s great: Not only are these one of the best shoes for heavy guys, but they’re an eco-friendly option that allow you to leave behind a smaller footprint. For every pair of Cariuma sneakers you buy, the brand commits to planting two trees in the Brazilian rainforest. Pretty cool, right? Once you slip them on, you’ll sink into the memory foam insole and enjoy all-day comfort whether you’re grabbing lunch with friends or heading to the office. How it feels: The canvas uppers offer ultimate style and versatility, while being strong enough to give you support needed when you’re overweight. Inside they’re super soft and have some cushioning around the ankle area. Flaws but not dealbreakers: While there’s nothing stopping you wearing these year-round, I’d say they’re more of a warm-weather shoe. They’ll survive in the rain but really thrive in the sunshine. Sizes Available: 5-13 | Fit: Standard | Colors available: 10+ | Slip resistant: Not specified kelvindavis / Instagram Buying Considerations For Supportive, Comfortable Shoes Support For overweight individuals, proper support and cushioning are crucial to prevent foot, ankle, and joint discomfort. Look for shoes with adequate arch support and cushioning in the midsole and heel areas. A well-cushioned shoe will help absorb impact and reduce stress on the joints, making walking and standing more comfortable. Shoes with features like gel inserts, memory foam, or air cushioning can be particularly beneficial for those carrying a little timber. Stability Men that are overweight often have a tendency to overpronate or underpronate (foot rolling inward or outward excessively). This can lead to alignment issues and potential injuries. Shoes with stability features, such as reinforced midsoles and firmer materials on the medial (inner) side of the shoe, can help control pronation and improve overall stability during walking or running. Material  Durability is vital for any pair of shoes, but especially for overweight men who may exert more wear and tear on their footwear. Look for shoes made from high-quality materials, such as genuine leather or durable synthetic fabrics. Reinforced stitching and a sturdy outsole are also essential for long-lasting shoes that can withstand the extra weight. Investing in well-constructed shoes may be costlier upfront, but they are likely to provide better support and last longer in the long run. Why You Should Trust Us I haven’t found the best shoes for heavy guys by chance. It took me endless hours and hundreds of styles later to pull together a shortlist of just 10. By carefully considering specific factors such as comfort, material, longevity, and support, I’ve been able to narrow down the options that alleviate the extra pressure on the feet and joints, as well as look great. This guide aims to promote overall foot health and enhance the enjoyment during your daily activities. columbiapfg / Instagram Final Verdict The journey to finding the best shoes for big men finishes here. After giving thoughtful consideration and attention to what makes the perfect option for big guys, Columbia’s Tamiami boat shoes are what I suggest considering first. A versatile addition to any footwear collection, they feature plenty of cushioning, ample support, and protection. You can wear them on the weekend, on vacation, or to the office. And they look great with pretty much any pair of pants. Wherever you decide to show them off, rest assured you’ll be getting the comfort you deserve. FAQ The best shoes for overweight men will vary depending on their specific needs, activities, and foot characteristics. However, there are some general factors to consider. These include the fit, cushioning, support, and material. Sneakers often offer the most comfortable choice, but ultimately, it’s important to work out what options are most suitable for your specific needs.
