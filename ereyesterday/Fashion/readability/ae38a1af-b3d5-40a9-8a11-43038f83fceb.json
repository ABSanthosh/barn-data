He said he hopes to learn from his show’s guests.Before his downfall, Armie Hammer was a prominent actor known for his roles in “The Social Network” and “Call Me by Your Name.”Credit...Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images,Oct. 29, 2024Armie Hammer announced this week that he started a podcast.The actor, who was once a rising star in Hollywood, has laid low in recent years after a sexual assault accusation that contributed to the derailing of his career. But on Monday he announced his new show, called “The Armie HammerTime Podcast,” on Instagram.“Some of you are going to love this and some of you are going to hate it,” Mr. Hammer said, using an expletive, in the video announcement.“Throughout the course of the day, every single person you interact with knows at least one thing that you don’t, so teach me what that one thing is,” Mr. Hammer said, describing the format of the podcast. His first guest was Tom Arnold, the ex-husband of Roseanne Barr and co-star of the 1994 action flick “True Lies,” who discussed sobriety and childhood sexual abuse with Mr. Hammer.In the announcement video, Mr. Hammer, who did not respond to an interview request, appears to be skateboarding on a California boardwalk. He describes his new venture as a diary of sorts — “a chronicling of putting my life back together.”Mr. Hammer, who had a breakout role as both Winklevoss twins in “The Social Network,” had his career quickly unravel after a series of accusations involving sexual assault and comments related to cannibalism.In July 2020, Elizabeth Chambers, a television personality and Mr. Hammer’s wife of a decade, filed for divorce. In January 2021, an anonymous Instagram account posted direct messages it claimed had been written by Mr. Hammer. In the messages, Mr. Hammer purportedly said, “I need to drink your blood” and “I am a 100% cannibal.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
