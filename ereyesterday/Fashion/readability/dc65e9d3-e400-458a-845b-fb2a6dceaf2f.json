As you wear it, “keep an eye out for changes in character, intensity and longevity, to make sure it’s exactly what you’re looking for”, Catalani advises. And remember that if the brand has a hair mist or body spray version, it will often be a much cheaper way to try a scent before you commit to the full perfume purchase. It could also be worth trying a monthly scent subscription through Scentaddict, which curates edits of popular scents and delivers them by post. Most of the big perfume houses offer fragrance consultations and Penhaligon’s even offers a digital consultation to find your ideal scent.

Catalani adds: “As your olfactory system adapts to the constant presence of a scent, it becomes less sensitive to it.”",
