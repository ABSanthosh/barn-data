  "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bandage-dress-trend-49446365",
  "description": "As complex as the trend cycle may seem, it's not all that hard to understand. Most trends are just reimagined versions of styles we've seen before. (See: TikTok's diaper shorts, which are really just a modern take on 1800s bloomers.) Brands depend on innovative design treatments or collaborations for many of these trends to land successfully, but the No. 1 thing that makes them impossible to resist? A celebrity cosign. Similar to cutouts and jorts, another style has regained popularity amongst the stars: bandage dresses. While tons of celebrities have rocked the silhouette throughout the years, Hailey Bieber and Kaia Gerber's recent embrace of the trend is especially referential. Gerber wore a bandage dress from Hervé Léger at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, while Bieber wore a burgundy Saint Laurent iteration at this year's Fashion Trust U.S. Awards - both showcasing the style's relevance. What Are Bandage Dresses? Bandage dresses have been around long before TikTok had a say in what's trending. The silhouette took off in the early '90s, when Léger helped popularize the look with elastic detailing, draped necklines, and tightly fitted bodices. You can think of the bandage dress as the original bodycon dress that represented class, glamour, and confidence for the wearer. The iconic fashion label gained recognition for this innovation in womenswear, with stars like Cindy Crawford, Rihanna, and Kim Kardashian wearing the style on and off the runway. Today, bandage dresses have evolved in many forms, from mini and maxi lengths to bandeau and halter styles. Whether you're hunting for the right figure-flattering piece or looking for your next date-night dress, we've curated the ultimate guide to bandage dresses for every shape and occasion. From affordable picks from our favorite retailers like Nordstrom to splurge-worthy designer picks (including a rare Léger find), shop the best bandage dresses to wear this summer and beyond.",
