After hitting it off, they became separated for the rest of the night. They reconnected days later through a mutual friend and went on their first date.Ms. Lejava, who moved from Tbilisi, Georgia, to the United States in 2006 to study ballet at the now-closed Kirov Academy in Washington, said she felt a special kinship with Mr. Calbos, who also grew up abroad.
