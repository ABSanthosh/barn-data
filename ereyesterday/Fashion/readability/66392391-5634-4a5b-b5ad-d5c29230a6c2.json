His family said Kylie Jenner volunteered to pay his funeral expenses.Jesus Guerrero was a hairstylist for several celebrities. His death was announced by his family on Sunday.Credit...Gabe Ginsberg/Getty ImagesFeb. 26, 2025, 5:02 p.m. ETJesus Guerrero was not necessarily a household name, but he was a hairstylist to the stars, working with people like Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Jenner and Rosalía. So when his family announced on Sunday that he had died at 34, the tributes from his famous clients immediately began to flood social media.His sister, Gris Guerrero, started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for funeral expenses, and while she did not share the cause of death, she called it “unexpected.” Then, on Tuesday, Ms. Guerrero shared an update on the GoFundMe: Ms. Jenner, a close friend and client, had offered to cover the funeral expenses.The family turned off further donations, with Ms. Guerrero, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, saying in the update that the $96,000 raised would go toward getting Mr. Guerrero’s belongings back to his family home and other expenses associated with his death.Ms. Jenner posted a tribute to Mr. Guerrero on Instagram in which she attached several photos and videos of them together.“The pain of losing you is just unbearable and i don’t know how to move forward without you but I know great grief is born only of great love. and I loved you so much,” Ms. Jenner wrote. “I wish I could hug you again. I laid in your bed the way you used to lay in mine, talking for hours.”Ms. Jenner did not attend the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, where her boyfriend, Timothée Chalamet, won best actor for his performance in “A Complete Unknown.” She did not publicly state a reason for her absence, but there was a great deal of speculation that the show being on the same day that Mr. Guerrero’s death was announced had played a role.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
