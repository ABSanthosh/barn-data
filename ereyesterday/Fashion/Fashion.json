    "description": "This chic yet practical addition to your holiday wardrobe will accentuate your swimwear rather than conceal itWhat you see here is a newfangled invention. The beach dress – specifically designed to turn your swimsuit into an outfit you can wear to lunch – is a wardrobe category that didn’t really exist until about a decade ago. I mean, obviously, it was not unknown to wear your bikini as undies en route to the beach. But this was a DIY form of outfit-wrangling, a way of fudging the awkward transition from swimwear to actual clothes without resorting to changing underneath a towel. The vibe was lo-fi: a sarong, an oversized T-shirt, wriggling out of a wet one-piece to avoid a damp patch where you sit on your dress.The new beach dress is not remotely lo-fi, no sir. It is, in fact, summer fashion’s most glamorous category. Walk on to any shopfloor and you will find a world bedazzled by dresses that have cocktail-hour detailing but are intended to be worn on a beach. The sunlounger is to this decade what the bar stool was to the 00s: the place to showcase your hottest looks. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Sneakers get their fair share of fashion love, but there’s one version that stands the test of time as a shoe-rotation regular: the white sneaker. These classic kicks are one of the most enduring sneaker trends to date because of their versatility. White sneakers are a year-round staple, but they especially shine in the warmer months — complementing everything from summer dresses to denim shorts. Whether you’re looking for bright-white platform sneakers, timeless tennis shoes to create the perfect dress and sneaker combo or are in need of sleek trainers for outdoor adventures, we’ve rounded up the best styles to cart up right now. Click through to find the best women’s white sneakers — from streamlined, modern styles to chunky, retro designs. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Tennis Shoes Whether you want an old-school pair of slim white sneakers for your vacation (à la Baby in Dirty Dancing) or to actually play tennis in, a pair of white tennis shoes scream “summer.” From bright-white canvas styles to off-white leather and suede versions, you can go as preppy or modern as you like on your next summer outing. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Leather Sneakers Perfect for elevating casual outfits or making your refined looks more relaxed, leather sneakers are versatile, durable, and super chic. Opt for a chunky court style as a goes-with-everything option or try a slim retro runner for a sporty touch. And if genuine leather isn’t your thing, consider faux leather, which also tends to be more affordable and easier to clean. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Platform Sneakers Get an extra boost this summer — without sky-high stilettos — with a pair of platforms. From standard platform soles to extra-stacked styles and even nostalgic wedges, these sneaker options run the gamut from subtle to dramatic. DashDividers_1_500x100  White Designer Sneakers If you’re looking to invest in designer sneakers, there’s no doubt that a white pair will be a classic that you’ll reach for time and time again (and get your money’s worth!). Rep your favorite luxury designer with a logo-heavy design or pick a more demure style that channels quiet luxury. DashDividers_1_500x100 White High-Top Sneakers High-top sneakers are trending this season, so why not get the best of both worlds and buy a crisp white pair? If you love the retro basketball vibe of this style (or have been immersed in “Knicks in six!” chants and want a new pair for game days), high-tops are the ideal choice for you. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Running Sneakers If you’re heading outside to get active this summer, white athletic sneakers are perfect for long walks, hikes, and runs. We’ve rounded up some extra-comfy styles that’ll go the distance and effortlessly transition from workouts to daily errands.  Like what you see?

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. The arrival of the first Monday in May meant one thing: The 2025 Met Gala returned to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The annual fashion event celebrated the Costume Institute’s newest exhibition —  “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” inspired by Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity by Monica L. Miller — and saw Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams join Anna Wintour as co-chairs, as well as Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Janelle Monáe, Tyla and more as part of the host committee.Following the night, we turned our attention to the new fashion and beauty launches making waves this month.

Joining the colorful Chance cohort, Splendide’s lilac liquid is both fruity and floral, blending sparkling raspberry with powdery violet. Its heart notes include sweet rose geranium, some of which was even grown in Chanel’s perfumery garden in the South of France. Notes of cedar and white musk round out the fragrance.

    "description": "The cutout dress has proven to be one of 2025's most beloved trends, and we're here for it. Though cutouts have been everywhere these past few seasons, they're getting more inventive and unique by the day. Jennifer Lopez gave her stamp of approval on the fad with two of her eight alluring ensembles at this year's American Music Awards - both of which featured cutouts all over. For one red carpet look, she wore a neutral Defaïence dress with gold hoops, forming cutouts that plunged all the way down to her stomach, while another outfit change ushered in an ab-baring Bronx and Banco dress, adorned with sparkly fringes and an embellished cross. Cutout dresses now come with accents across the stomach, collarbone, chest, shoulders - you name it. If you've been seeing the viral fashion trend all over TikTok and in red carpet photos and want to try it on for size, here are 15 sexy styles that are worth scooping up. From statement minidresses and comfortable maxis to body-hugging cutout dresses and everything in-between, we've got standout pieces for a variety of styles and outings. Whether you're heading out to your favorite neighborhood bar or glamming up for a night out, there are multiple options for you. A few standouts include a side cutout dress that's polished but reveals just enough to turn heads, an edgy leather dress with unexpected cutouts, a comfortable sweater dress that's wearable throughout the season, and a playful back cutout dress that's demure from the front but super-sexy from the back.
