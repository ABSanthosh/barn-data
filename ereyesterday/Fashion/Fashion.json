    "description": "This chic yet practical addition to your holiday wardrobe will accentuate your swimwear rather than conceal itWhat you see here is a newfangled invention. The beach dress – specifically designed to turn your swimsuit into an outfit you can wear to lunch – is a wardrobe category that didn’t really exist until about a decade ago. I mean, obviously, it was not unknown to wear your bikini as undies en route to the beach. But this was a DIY form of outfit-wrangling, a way of fudging the awkward transition from swimwear to actual clothes without resorting to changing underneath a towel. The vibe was lo-fi: a sarong, an oversized T-shirt, wriggling out of a wet one-piece to avoid a damp patch where you sit on your dress.The new beach dress is not remotely lo-fi, no sir. It is, in fact, summer fashion’s most glamorous category. Walk on to any shopfloor and you will find a world bedazzled by dresses that have cocktail-hour detailing but are intended to be worn on a beach. The sunlounger is to this decade what the bar stool was to the 00s: the place to showcase your hottest looks. Continue reading...",

Borrowing the original working title of Federico Fellini’s film 8 ½, Maria Grazia Chiuri, designer of Dior since 2016, called it “the Beautiful Confusion”.She was talking about Rome, with its heady jumble of art, culture, faith and mopeds, and about a collection in which haute couture pieces were mixed with theatrical costumes. But there was also an inescapable allusion to the question of her own future of Dior. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. The arrival of the first Monday in May meant one thing: The 2025 Met Gala returned to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The annual fashion event celebrated the Costume Institute’s newest exhibition —  “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” inspired by Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity by Monica L. Miller — and saw Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams join Anna Wintour as co-chairs, as well as Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Janelle Monáe, Tyla and more as part of the host committee.Following the night, we turned our attention to the new fashion and beauty launches making waves this month. From a new spring scent to a major designer collaboration, click through the slideshow ahead to learn about everything that landed this May.Tory Burch x BonBonSummer just got a little sweeter thanks to the Tory Burch x BonBon collaboration. The American brand has teamed up with the Swedish candy company for a limited-edition collection (and a campaign starring Riverdale’s Madelaine Petsch!) that includes joyful twists on house styles — think vibrant handbags “dipped” in beads that resemble a sugar coating, marshmallow-y puffed sandals in soft pastel hues, candy-shaped earrings and charms, and more.

The new Puzzle, meanwhile, is dubbed the Confetti and is covered in colorful rounds of leather in delightful candy colors. The Loewe Puzzle 10 Collection will be available to shop in select stores.Chanel Eau SplendideA new season often calls for switching up your scent, and Chanel’s latest fragrance couldn’t have come at a better time. Joining the colorful Chance cohort, Splendide’s lilac liquid is both fruity and floral, blending sparkling raspberry with powdery violet. Its heart notes include sweet rose geranium, some of which was even grown in Chanel’s perfumery garden in the South of France. Notes of cedar and white musk round out the fragrance.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-shorts-for-women?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "A true summer staple, denim shorts always have your back for music festivals, farmers market strolls, vacations, and more. They’re a foundational piece, so it’s worth having at least one (or two or three) pairs that can anchor your entire warm-weather wardrobe. And while dresses and skirts in the same iconic fabric are still going strong, think of these as the natural next step in your summer lineup.All signs point to nostalgia this season, with once-polarizing low-rise waists and Bermuda shorts firmly back in rotation. Dark, tailored options are also trending — great for the office (depending on your dress code) or dressed up with thong kitten heels for dinner. No matter your vibe, we’ve found a range of rises, inseam lengths, and washes to suit your style. Bonus: we even included the comfiest pull-on pairs to keep your summer extra breezy.Read on for 35 denim shorts that deserve a prime spot in your closet. DashDividers_1_500x100 Jorts There’s no denying it: Jorts are back, and Refinery29 editors are fully on board. Once deemed uncool, the longline silhouette is fully in the spotlight, now a favorite among influencers and fashion girlies alike. If you’re ready to join the movement, these just-above-the-knee styles feel effortlessly cool and are surprisingly versatile to style. DashDividers_1_500x100 Low-Rise Denim Shorts If you’re channeling early-aughts energy this summer, low-rise shorts are a must. Go ultra-mini with cutoffs made for festival season (hello, Cowboy Carter tour), or lean into the Y2K revival with a low-rise Bermuda for a fresh take on the throwback. DashDividers_1_500x100 Mid-Rise Denim Shorts Like a good white tee, mid-rise denim shorts are timeless. Stick with classic blue washes for everyday wear, or try something with a twist — embroidered cherries, silver studs, and other playful details are trending big time. DashDividers_1_500x100 High-Rise Denim Shorts For a snatched waist and easy styling, you can’t beat high-rise denim. Whether you gravitate toward A-line shapes, sailor-style pockets, or frayed cutoffs, these styles are made to pair with your favorite summer tops and statement belts. DashDividers_1_500x100 Denim Pull-On Shorts When the heat hits hard, pull-on denim shorts are the answer. Elastic waistbands and lightweight fabrics make these feel like loungewear — but they still look put-together enough for casual Fridays, brunch dates, and everything in between. Like what you see?

    "description": "The cutout dress has proven to be one of 2025's most beloved trends, and we're here for it. Though cutouts have been everywhere these past few seasons, they're getting more inventive and unique by the day. Jennifer Lopez gave her stamp of approval on the fad with two of her eight alluring ensembles at this year's American Music Awards - both of which featured cutouts all over. For one red carpet look, she wore a neutral Defaïence dress with gold hoops, forming cutouts that plunged all the way down to her stomach, while another outfit change ushered in an ab-baring Bronx and Banco dress, adorned with sparkly fringes and an embellished cross. Cutout dresses now come with accents across the stomach, collarbone, chest, shoulders - you name it. If you've been seeing the viral fashion trend all over TikTok and in red carpet photos and want to try it on for size, here are 15 sexy styles that are worth scooping up. From statement minidresses and comfortable maxis to body-hugging cutout dresses and everything in-between, we've got standout pieces for a variety of styles and outings. Whether you're heading out to your favorite neighborhood bar or glamming up for a night out, there are multiple options for you. A few standouts include a side cutout dress that's polished but reveals just enough to turn heads, an edgy leather dress with unexpected cutouts, a comfortable sweater dress that's wearable throughout the season, and a playful back cutout dress that's demure from the front but super-sexy from the back.
