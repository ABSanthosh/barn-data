    "description": "This season’s three hot looks: the barn jacket, the leather blouson and the haute anorakThe summer jacket is one of the trickiest bits of your wardrobe to get right, because nobody really wants to wear one. I mean, isn’t summer supposed to be lovely and warm? Isn’t that sort of the whole point of a summer wardrobe? Sandals and shorts exist to celebrate carefree, balmy days. Sunshine is the raison d’etre of a sundress. The very existence of a jacket is a summer buzzkill. But you need one. Sorry, but you do. Seasons are unpredictable, heatwaves break, darkness brings a chill. So you definitely have to put some thought into a summer jacket unless you want your fabulous summer outfits to end up hidden beneath some random hoodie you grabbed off the banister.Your summer jacket needs to do two things. It needs to keep you warm and dry when the weather turns chilly or wet. And somehow, at the same time, it needs to keep your summer vibe bouncing along, rather than kill the mood. Like I said: tricky. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Tarnish-free gold jewelry sounds like the ultimate cheat code — pieces that won’t fade, dull, or turn your skin green, no matter how much you wear them. But do they exist on a budget? The short answer: kind of. Unless you’re investing in solid gold (which is expensive), no jewelry is completely resistant to wear over time. But thanks to smarter materials and better plating techniques, you can get long-lasting shine without the hefty price tag. “‘Tarnish-free’ means the jewelry is resistant to discoloration from air, moisture, or skin oils,” explains Jennie Yoon, founder and CEO of Kinn Studio. “While no jewelry material is completely immune to wear over time, tarnish-free pieces are designed to maintain their original appearance for much longer.” The key? High-quality base metals, thicker gold layers, and protective coatings that help plated pieces hold up to daily wear. One of the biggest game-changers in affordable jewelry is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a high-tech plating method that makes gold layers tougher, thicker, and more resistant to fading. “Recent advancements like PVD coating, thicker micron plating, and anti-tarnish treatments allow us to create beautiful, long-lasting pieces at a price point that is accessible to more people,” Yoon explains. But longevity isn’t just about the plating method — it also comes down to how you wear and care for your jewelry. “Avoid exposure to water, sweat, and chemicals like perfumes or cleaning products,” Yoon advises. “Storing your pieces in a cool, dry place and cleaning them with a soft cloth can make a huge difference in keeping them looking new… A well-made piece of plated jewelry can last for years with proper care.” So what’s the difference between gold plating, vermeil, and solid gold? Gold plating is the most affordable, but it’s also the least durable — just a thin layer of gold over brass or stainless steel. Vermeil is a step up, with a thicker layer of gold over sterling silver, making it more resistant to tarnishing. And solid gold? That’s literally the gold standard for jewelry that stays pristine forever — but at a cost. Ahead, we’re breaking down the best tarnish-free gold jewelry brands for everyday wear — whether you’re looking for an investment piece, fun heart-shaped design, or an everyday go-to that won’t quit. Mejuri By far one of the most beloved jewelry brands, Mejuri makes some of the best everyday jewelry — from delicate and sparkly to bold and lustrous. With a commitment to 95% recycled gold, the brand blends sustainability with durability, offering everything from solid 14K gold designed for nonstop wear to 18K gold vermeil layered over sterling silver for long-lasting shine. Whether you’re finally splurging on that investment piece or adding to your daily stack, these designs are made to go the distance. Ana Luisa Mega-affordable and packed with all the hits, Ana Luisa delivers sparkly hoops, delicate studs, dangly earrings, and layerable chains alongside solid gold, pearl, and diamond pieces — all without the steep markup. Known for its tarnish-free, hypoallergenic, and waterproof edits, the brand rigorously tests every piece to ensure it holds up to daily wear. With a focus on recycled materials and responsible sourcing, plus a two-year warranty and over 50,000 five-star reviews, these are the kind of staples you can count on. Missoma From bold, trendy statements to timeless classics, Missoma has made demi-fine jewelry a must-have. Designed in London and handcrafted for stacking, the brand delivers statement chains, bold hoops, and stackable rings in recycled 18K gold vermeil, gold plated, and sterling silver. Covetable collaborations with fashion notables like Lucy Williams and Harris Reed — as well as an appearance in the Barbie movie — only add to its cult status. And for those ready to invest? The Missoma Fine collection elevates bestsellers in recycled 14K solid gold and diamonds — classic, with a twist. Jenny Bird Every fashion insider knows that Jenny Bird delivers the bold hoops, eye-catching chains, and sleek cuffs that instantly pull a look together. R29 editors, including fashion director Irina Grechko, swear by the brand for pieces, such as the water-durable collection, that can handle nonstop wear. Crafted from recycled 14K solid gold and ultra-durable stainless steel, these essentials bring the statement without tarnish or green marks.  Catbird The purveyors of all things teensy, delicate, and just left of center, Catbird makes cool person jewelry — the kind you collect, stack, and never take off. Designed in Brooklyn and crafted with over 95% recycled 14K solid gold and recycled diamonds, the brand’s whisper-thin rings, glimmering chains, and tiny starry diamonds won’t tarnish, fade, or lose their glow. Catbird also practically invented the stacking game — and changed jewelry again with its Forever Bracelet, a clasp-free solid gold chain custom-fitted and welded directly onto your wrist for a seamless, always-on look that’s become a signature of the effortlessly stylish. Monica Vinader Monica Vinader reimagines fine jewelry through the lens of fluid, organic shapes and nature-inspired textures, resulting in pieces that feel both effortless and quietly striking. From sculptural pearl drops and softly contoured gold bands to gemstone beaded bracelets with molten-like detailing, each design embraces natural irregularities that set it apart. Crafted from 100% recycled gold and sterling silver, the brand’s jewelry doesn’t just look refined — it’s made to last, tarnish-resistant, and designed for everyday wear. And now, traceable lab-grown diamonds bring high-wattage shine to the mix. BaubleBar You know and love BaubleBar for its playful pieces and budget-friendly price tags, but, as part of its fine jewelry collection, the brand also delivers on tarnish-resistant jewelry crafted from 14K and 18K gold-plated sterling silver for a luxe look without the splurge. From layer-ready chains and sleek gold rings to statement earrings that sparkle, these pieces let you pile on the shine without the stress — just fun, accessible, and mixable staples. Electric Picks You’ve likely spotted Electric Picks on your favorite influencers and celebs — the brand has a way of making jewelry feel personal, storied, and achingly cool. With 14K solid gold and 14K gold-plated styles, these pieces are tarnish-resistant and built for daily wear. The vibe spectrum is just as dynamic — the New Collection mixes fresh chains with natural elements like pearls and shells, while the Vintage Collection transforms charms, tokens, and coins from around the world into modern heirlooms. Hey Harper Not all gold-plated jewelry can handle real life — but Hey Harper can. Known for its waterproof, tarnish-resistant designs, the brand has perfected PVD-coated jewelry that won’t fade, chip, or turn your skin green. With prices starting around $25, it’s an easy choice for everyday staples, from stackable bracelets and bold rings to layer-ready chains.  Kinn Kinn is redefining modern heirlooms with fine jewelry crafted to stand the test of time. With solid gold as the foundation — the ultimate standard in tarnish-free wear — and high-quality vermeil built for longevity, these pieces are designed to be worn daily rather than saved for special occasions. “Balancing affordability with quality requires a commitment to using high-quality materials, such as sterling silver bases for vermeil or thicker gold plating,” explains Yoon. The result? Investment-worthy staples that won’t lose their luster, whether you wear them for years or pass them down for generations. Like what you see?

    "description": "As a team with several editors and contributors under 5’4”, we believe that good things can come in small packages. Check back for our go-to places and styling advice on petite denim, outerwear, and so much more. As a chronic over-heater, few things are more essential to my summer wardrobe than light, airy fabrics — like linen. Up top, I’m looking for blouses and shirts that are fashionable and forgiving when sweat stains inevitably bloom. For bottoms, I’m all about a good pair of shorts and, perhaps more importantly, a great pair of linen pants that are versatile and keep me cool. But there’s a catch: I’m also 5’4” and don’t want my pant legs dangling halfway down my feet (or to be headed to the tailor with every purchase I make).  While many inseams are around 30 to 32 inches long, many of us petite shoppers are looking for something in the 25 to 29 inch range. Naturally, the standard pant inseam can vary depending on the label and style. (Any person who wears women’s clothing knows this: sizing varies drastically between brands.) This is why I sought out to find the overall best brands for petite linen pants for women. I spent weeks researching, shopping, and testing linen pants in a range of styles — from casual pairs that work for errands to tailored trousers that’d do well at an outdoor work event. After trying 11 pants, I selected my favorites. Read on to see the best brands and styles to shop for petite linen pants that’ll keep you looking cool and feeling cooled off all summer long.  Best Overall Petite Linen Pants: Everlane Everlane has some great styles and options for linen pants, especially casual and streetwear-adjacent styles. To me, cargos are the ultimate pick: Where many pants barely have pockets, this style has several, and they’re usually deep, too. Everlane’s cargo curve bottoms were one of the best pairs of petite linen pants I tried, period. Their 26.25″ inseam and drawstring ankles make these a natural fit for petite shoppers, similar to other top picks from the brand. Best Casual Petite Linen Pants: Buck Mason For those who enjoy a more relaxed look, Buck Mason also stands out for its bonfire crosshatch pants. These have a 29” inseam, so rather than wearing them low around my hips, I hiked them up to get a super high-waist look. I love how long these make my legs look, giving me the illusion of height. It makes sense that Buck Mason would offer great linen pants; various drawstring trousers from the brand have been a petite-friendly go-to of mine for years. Best Everyday Petite Linen Pants: Eileen Fisher  For an everyday linen pant that’s unfussy, Eileen Fisher’s options win. Not only are the pants made to last (which is exactly the kind of durability I’m looking for when it comes to an everyday style), but the fabric itself is made from organic fibers and dyed with safer colorants that use less water. These are perfect as a closet staple — classic silhouettes that are easily dressed up or down to transition from day to night.  Best Investment Petite Linen Pants: Cos Anyone who is petite knows a thing or two about improvising, which is exactly what I did with my favorite pair of linen pants by Cos. Rather than getting specially “petite” bottoms, I love how the regular inseam culottes fit. These feel like wide-leg pants on my body, with all the drama of palazzo pants. The brand’s other high-waisted picks work well for petites, too, and if you’re on the taller end of the spectrum, you won’t have to improvise as much. Prices range between $100 and near the $150 mark, making the brand a solid investment choice.  Best Variety for Petite Linen Pants: Abercrombie and Fitch Abercrombie and Fitch has a wide selection of petite linen trousers, including high-waist, low-slung, casual styles with drawstrings, and tailored options. Of all the brand’s warm-weather-friendly bottoms, I most enjoy the belted, butter yellow pair. These feel a little more versatile since the belt can add a formal or playful edge, depending on how you style them. Personally, I shifted the belt to the left to add balance with my asymmetric top, which added an edgy yet still soft touch. The short inseam on these fully linen trousers hits just the right spot, whether I pair them with sneakers or heeled sandals. Best Affordable Petite Linen Pants: Old Navy Old Navy’s petite linen pants are winners when it comes to affordability, with most styles under $50 or even less, since the retailer often has promotions. Plus, there are more than basic silhouettes and colors available. Options include harem and palazzo shapes, statement colors, neutrals, and prints. While most are linen blends (rather than 100% linen), these Old Navy pants still feel airy and good on the skin. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shop Petite Linen Pants Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/reformation-swimwear-review-49365986",
    "description": "It may come as no surprise that Reformation's swimwear comes with new and improved materials. The line, which retails from $68 to $168 in sizes XS-XL, is made from a renewable and bio-based fiber called EVO by Fulgar. And, according to Reformation's chief innovation officer Alison Melville, the product will only grow more sustainable with each seasonal drop (check out their most recent drop here!). The first range incorporated deadstock fabric from the brand's debut swimwear collection in 2019, and Reformation promises to \"continue innovating and trying out new materials until we create the most sustainable swimwear possible,\" according to Melville. Instantly attracted to the striking bikinis and one-pieces, PS editors were eager to get our hands on the swimwear designs, many of which were influenced by bestselling products across other categories. \"We designed Ref Swim to complement and round out our customers' existing Ref wardrobes,\" Melville tells PS. \"Throughout the design process, we were inspired by the concept of outfitting and looked to the silhouettes of some of our top performing apparel items to create complementary swim pieces.\" For example, the Bryson Dress is one of their most popular styles in 2025 so they carried the vibrant red color and the sweetheart neckline detail through in the Soleil Bikini Top. Melville confirms that the success of the drops has exceeded expectations, with solid colors being most popular - a trend that speaks to the Ref shopper's love for '90s minimalism. The Tossa Top (now out of stock), Azure Bottom, and Soleil Top were within the top five SKUs at the original time of publishing this story, and they just so happen to be three of the pieces we selected to try at PS. Ahead, you'll hear from four different editors about their experiences trying Reformation swimwear with one shared sentiment: the quality is in the fabric and the fit. Plus, we've added a couple more styles for you to shop from. Update on June 18, 2025 at 2:00 PM ET: Updated prices and checked stock for all products. @ps.feelgood Reformation's revamped swimwear might be giving the brand's dresses a run for their money, and we're here for it! The swimwear comes with new and improved sustainable materials. These four editors give a more in-depth review at our 🔗 in bio. #Reformation #Swimwear #Summer ♬ original sound - Popsugar",
