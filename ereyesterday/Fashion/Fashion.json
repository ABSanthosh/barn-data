But now, as the Ozempic craze takes hold and six-year-olds share skincare routines on TikTok, I wonder whether that was the right thing to do• An expert on how to talk to kids about body imageMy seven-year-old daughter is playing a game on my husband’s phone. A punky, doll-like character has a dirty face, with green oozing spots and patches of brown dirt, bed-head hair sprouting from her head in crude black lines. My daughter dutifully selects a sponge from the toolbar and wipes off the spots, as if in a car wash. The game prompts her to cleanse and moisturise the cartoon face, and then apply layers of makeup. Giant comedy eyelashes, with gems, pop-coloured lips and blush. Then she selects an extravagant hairstyle, like a My Little Pony, and tops it with a tiara. “Now she’s pretty,” she says. I mentally add it to my ever increasing list of motherhood feminist fails.Raising a daughter in an age where the cult of beauty is all encompassing and extreme perfectionism is gamified feels increasingly fraught. Raising a daughter having spent two decades as a fashion writer feels like a double twist of hypocrisy. In truth, working in fashion should make anyone feel like a hypocrite. I always have. Wear what you like and express yourself! Except also, wear these commodified trends invented to make you spend. But don’t shop! Because excessive consumption is killing the planet. But here are some cute new shoes! Continue reading...",

    "description": "When it comes to shopping for that \"perfect\" swimsuit, it can seem like a daunting challenge to browse every brand and site across the internet. But thankfully, we've done the hard work for you and have rounded up a few of our favorites ahead. Firstly, you'll want to think about your personal swimsuit requirements. While you want something that's flattering, stylish, and comfortable (we love a one-piece for this reason), you also want one that will make you feel your very best. Most of the time, that comes down to fit, and not all suits are made the same. To help you find a style that you'll be excited to pack for your next vacation, or any time you find yourself relaxing by the water, we enlisted Kalani Miller, swimwear expert and cofounder of Mikoh, for expert recommendations on the year's biggest swimwear trends, along with what shoppers should consider when scoping out the best swimsuit for their body type. What to Consider When Shopping Out the Best Swimsuit For Your Body Type For Miller, finding the perfect swimsuit starts with honing in on the exact occasion she's shopping for. \"When I'm shopping for a new suit, I always like to think of where I am wearing it the most - is it a girls' trip? A romantic getaway? Or a family vacay with your in-laws? From there, I let it guide what styles and coverage I gravitate to,\" she explains. As far as finding the best swimsuit for your body type or frame, Miller believes that confidence is key and recommends that shoppers experiment with as many different types of silhouettes and structures as possible. \"Make sure to try on lots of different cuts - skimpy, full-coverage, high-waisted. You never know what will look best until you give it a go, and you may be surprised to find a new silhouette can quickly become your favorite,\" she says. What Types of Swimsuits Are Trending For 2025? If you're looking to find a more seasonally relevant style that'll tap into the year's biggest swimwear trends, Miller also notes that there are plenty of fun options to play around with this year. \"Earthy neutrals, pops of blue, and poppy orange prints are here to stay. This season, we're seeing silhouettes with sleeves and multi-use pieces,\" she explains. With all of Miller's expert recommendations in mind, we curated a guide to the perfect swimsuits for every type of frame and build, including the best swimsuits for curvy women, the best one-piece bathing suits, and a variety of other choices that range from sultry bikinis to fun monokinis. Regardless of the piece you're looking for, these styles will surely end up in your shopping cart. Keep reading to glean an expert's dos and don'ts, and browse through our picks for the best swimsuits to stock up on this year.

    "description": "You can find me in loungewear pretty much any day of the week - and 90 percent of the time, there's a bathrobe thrown over it. Over the years, my robe has become what I lovingly refer to as my \"house jacket,\" because I'm always cold. Recently, I decided to retire all my worn-out ones and invest in something I actually love. Enter: the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe ($103, originally $129). I'd seen it during boutique hotel stays and all over my social feeds, so I finally gave in. What sold me? Shoppers won't stop raving about it - and now, neither can I. The best part? Now through May 1, you can grab it for 20 percent off, plus free shipping. That's a total steal. Available in 10 stunning colors, it's also the perfect gift for your mom this Mother's Day - and yes, I'd 100% recommend it.",

    "description": "After originally selling out in five hours — and again on Sperry’s own site — the Sperry x Aritzia boat shoes are getting re-stocked on Aritzia’s website on April 26 at 12 a.m. PST.  While spring 2024 brought us the surprising return of the Clarks Wallabee, spring 2025 is bringing another prep-school classic: the boat shoe. Then again, maybe we shouldn’t be surprised. The “fisherman aesthetic” started trending on TikTok this past January, casting its net as one of the biggest spring trends and putting nautical styles back into the spotlight. And the newest ones you should test the waters with are from the Sperry x Aritzia collaboration. Sperry, the nostalgic original boat shoe brand founded in 1935, teamed up with Aritzia, the modern “elevated essentials” fashion brand, to reimagine the latter’s iconic boat shoes with two new styles.  “The boat shoe is more than just a trend — it’s a timeless staple that has defined style for nearly nine decades,” said Sperry’s president Jonathan Frankel in a press release. “This partnership is a perfect fusion of heritage and modernity, bringing fresh versatility to an enduring icon.” The Sperry x Aritzia Slim Boat has a sleek, narrow toe box and anti-slip outsole (because functional fashion is at the heart of the fisherman trend). It comes in full-grain leather, and is available in brown and light brown colorways. Meanwhile, the Sperry x Aritzia Authentic Original 2-Eye, which resembles a loafer (also very on trend), features premium leather, rawhide laces, and the brand’s signature “Razor-Cut Wave-Siping” outsole. These are available in brown and tan. Perhaps the most exciting part is that both these styles can be customized (and we love customization… hello shoe charm trend). They each come with three sets of interchangeable laces, including colorful ones, to make these shoes even more versatile… and spring-ready. All that’s left to do? Reel in and hook your pair before they vanish again. The limited restock goes live on Aritzia’s website April 26 at 12 a.m. PST. Shop full Sperry x Aritzia collaboration Like what you see?
