    "description": "Need a classic swimsuit for less than £40? A hat that’s easy to pack? Or the perfect beach-to-bar T-shirt? Make this summer a breeze with our fashion experts’ top tipsThere is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.The truth is that aside from the fact that people equate wearing fewer clothes with being cooler – not true! – it’s very hard to know what to wear when the sun comes out. So we are here to help. How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear? Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/amaya-espinal-muumuu-dress-love-island-usa-49452354",
    "description": "It's no secret that \"Love Island USA\" is impacting current culture as we know it. While it's far from the first love-centered reality show that we've seen, its popularity is especially referential. The show's foundational concept is unusual alone - being secluded on an island away from the outside world to find the love you've been looking for all your life. Islanders also played a significant role in season seven's massive impact, including Olandria Carthen and Nicolas Vansteenberghe's kiss that caused a massive crash-out at \"Love Island\" watch parties. Another highlight from the show that's still on our minds? Amaya Espinal (aka our sensitive gangster) wearing a muumuu in episode 28. While the New Yorker's bubbly personality and witty candor have given us plenty of meme-worthy moments to reflect on, her muumuu is far from just another piece of clothing that's passed the TikTok viral test. In an interview with the Today show, Espinal revealed that she only had a day to prepare for the show before being flown to Fiji, so she threw a bunch of clothing in a suitcase - including the muumuu she got during a trip to Portugal. \"Bringing that piece back to the villa reminded me of my travels and reminded me of the good days whenever I was having a bad one,\" she says. \"It was more than a dress for sure - it really made me feel grounded.\" @dontask724 just a girl and her moo moo against the world #amaya #amayaloveisland #amayapapaya #loveislandusa #loveisland #usa #fyp #viral ♬ original sound - 𓇼 Apart from the sentimental value it holds for Espinal, the muumuu bears cultural significance that's particularly noteworthy. The comfortable piece can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Christian missionaries in Hawaii influenced native women to wear the silhouette to further cultivate modesty. Hawaiian women adapted a more casual, sleeveless version - the \"holokū\" - for everyday wear, before it was renamed the muumuu. Fast forward to present day, the dress style is still acceptable in Western culture, and often a go-to purchase for vacations, Hawaiian-themed parties like luaus, and more. And of course, celebrities have proudly embraced the muumuu - most recently, Kris Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, and Gayle King were seen wearing them on a Mallorca getaway. Espinal wearing her own speaks to the diversity we need to see more of on reality shows, and is a surefire way to exhibit the fact that modesty is still attractive. During the scene in which she wore it, her partner, Bryan Arenales, complimented her look (despite her labeling it as a \"grandma dress\"). His support proves that you don't always need to show skin to be deemed attractive or desired - especially in the eyes of your romantic partner. While her exact dress isn't available to shop, we found similar picks that evoke the same level of style and confidence: Unique Kaftans Floral Print Long Tunic Dress ($3, originally $10), JaipurCraftandArt Cotton Kaftan ($27, originally $75), and H\u0026M Oversized Kaftan Dress ($75).

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/iris-kendall-shorts-love-island-usa-49452227",
    "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" may be over, but we're still digesting it all. After all, the show ran every day - except for Wednesdays - since its premiere on June 3, and each nearly two-hour episode showcased some of the worst (and best) of what America's current dating pool has to offer. The series has even left us with a slew of aftermath moments to hold us over until the season's Aug. 25 reunion, from embracing the beauty of being a sensitive gangster like Amaya Espinal to fan-favorite couple Nicolandria trekking to Disneyland. Another item to stoke the post-Love Island obsessive madness? Iris Kendall's boy shorts. After entering the villa as a bombshell in episode nine, the Los Angeles-born star proved to be one of the most enduring islanders, as she diligently explored multiple connections before making it to the final four with partner Jose \"Pepe\" Garcia. Kendall's style is another element we're reflecting on, but not for the reason you think. Naturally, she wore many looks that reflected the carefree California vibe (like bikinis and frilly dresses), but her pajama wardrobe was especially impressive. As islanders got ready for bed each night, fans quickly noticed that Kendall often wore the Skims Soft Smoothing Seamless Boy Short ($22) and the Skims Fits Everybody Lace Short ($24) - and for good reason. Not only are they super lightweight, but they're constructed with high-quality cotton and nylon that provides full coverage and a confidence-boosting silhouette. They even range from size XXS to 4X, making them accessible for all. @megannicklas Give me all of them @SKIMS @Iris Kendall 🤭🧚‍♀️🖤 immediately ordered #skimsboyshorts #loveislandusa #irisandpepe4life ♬ Iris - Goo Goo Dolls To no one's surprise, the affordable bottom has gained TikTok approval, with many users flocking to the Skims website to get the Iris Kendall look for themselves. Between their great quality and budget-friendly price point, purchasing these boy shorts is only right - whether you're a \"Love Island USA\" fan or not.
