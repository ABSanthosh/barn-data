    "description": "This is not just about whether short skirts suit you or not. Being interested in new perspectives looks good on anyoneSkirts are getting shorter. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but I didn’t want to bring it up until I was sure. At fashion week, the skirts I see on catwalks have been getting shorter for ages, but it’s only in the past year that I’ve really noticed skirts in the wild, the ones that live on pavements and in offices and on trains, following suit. Fashion week is a bubble that doesn’t mean all that much on its own. Lovely clothes on a catwalk are not actually fashion. Fashion is when people start wearing something in real life.The return of the miniskirt has been happening on the catwalk for three years, at least. Back in 2021, as soon as Paris fashion week came roaring back to life post-pandemic, Dior did a whole collection based on the miniskirt. This felt like it might be significant, because Dior have form for setting hemlines that come to rule the world, from 1947’s full-skirted New Look to the between-knee-and-ankle midi length that dominated the years before Covid blanketed the world under sweatpants. But those immediate post-pandemic years were a funny old time in fashion, where we all talked a good game about being desperate to dress up again but pretty much carried on wearing nap dresses and lazy-girl drawstring-closure stuff.

    "description": "The original was pricey and ineffective. It’s still exorbitant but the personally programmable upgrade is a major improvementI’m frequently out of step with the beauty community, never more so than on the release of the original Dyson Airwrap hot-air hair styler. While I have girlfriends who would sooner surrender their dishwasher or telly than their beloved and more expensive Airwrap, I gave mine away after a handful of attempts, having found it a faff with limited rewards. Bouncy curls dropped limply to nothing in minutes; the drying time seemed interminable. I couldn’t get the multi-use tool to do any one job as well as a single-use tong, wand or dryer could.I never imagined an upgrade would make enough of a difference for me to take another look. I think I was wrong. The new Airwrap i.d. has ironed out most kinks in the user experience. As with so many beauty gadgets these days, it involves downloading an app, but registration is quick and leads the user to a short questionnaire about their hair. This information is then used to design the right curling cycle for the owner, combining temperature, airflow and duration of hot-air styling v cool shot setting (remember: in hairdressing it’s always “hot to mould, cold to hold”). If you’re sharing – and for £479.99, you should – each family member can be added under their own profile. Continue reading...",

Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here and shop this gift guide on Pinterest here.Gone are the days when secondhand meant second-best. Climate-conscious shoppers are embracing circular fashion, luxury resale has become a favorite among trendsetters, and secondhand clothes and accessories have transformed into both acceptable and highly desirable gifts. This holiday season, more and more people are maximizing their gift budgets with pre-loved treasures.Thanks to thrift stores and resale platforms like Depop, The RealReal, and eBay, you can score designer handbags and shoes, quality winter accessories, and cult pieces from beloved brands — all for a fraction of the retail price. Gifting someone a secondhand item may take a little extra effort — like knowing their style preferences and clothing or shoe size — but it’s a meaningful way to show you care about both them and the environment. “There’s a real romance in gifting something that has lived a previous life,” vintage seller Erin Murphy tells Refinery29. “With secondhand gifts, you’re gifting the story of the piece with someone who means something to you.” Whether you’re shopping for the person who “doesn’t want anything” or one with a taste for luxury, here are 15 secondhand treasures every fashion-lover will adore this season.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While 2024's biggest shopping day is tomorrow, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that start now and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans.
