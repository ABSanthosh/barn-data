    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/and-just-like-that-season-3-carrie-fashion-costumes?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In the third season of the Sex and the City sequel series, And Just Like That, the quippy humor and hijinks-filled storylines feel like throwbacks to the OG show. See: Carrie’s (Sarah Jessica Parker) wisecrack to Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) in the premiere — “I don’t know which is worse… that you slept with a nun, or that you slept with a tourist.” Or: Carrie’s visit to Virginia, which brings to mind Season 4’s Episode 9 in which Carrie goes to the country home of Aidan (John Corbett) in Suffern, New York. This season, as Carrie faces the uncertainty of a long-distance relationship with Aidan, she tries to move forward — and out of her comfort zone. Having left her longtime Upper East Side haven for a Greek Revival house in Gramercy, she tries her hand at writing historical fiction. Reflecting these changes, Carrie’s always-discussion-starting fashion breaks new ground, while also revisiting the past. Ahead, And Just Like That’s costume designers, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, discuss some of their favorite looks from the season so far. Carrie’s Victorian Sensibility Carrie opens the season by writing vintage postcards to Aidan, who is living in Virginia. Her circa-1840 house complements the old time-y pastime — along with her romantic, rose-adorned jacket-and-dress set from London designer Simone Rocha’s ethereal Spring 2024 collection, which nods back to Carrie’s former signature look.  “We got excited because it kind of moved the needle on the tutu… we thought that was a more adult [take on the] look,” says Rogers. The puff-sleeves, full skirt, and corsetry also hint at Carrie’s late-1800s-referential wardrobe evolution to come as she attempts to write a period novel. Inspired by the avant-garde John Galliano’s Maison Margiela 2024 Artisanal collection, Rogers and Santiago imagined Carrie’s sartorial interpretation of the horse-and-carriage era.  In episode two, she wears a Donna Karan beige bodysuit and white Mary Jane pumps by Paula Votteler with a raw-hem Margiela denim skirt with Victorian bustle-style draping. In episode five, for a truce/brainstorm dinner with her neighbor Duncan Reeves (Jonathan Cake), Carrie further explores period dressing in vintage khaki riding jodhpurs and an off-the-shoulder Jean Paul Gaultier top. “She’s thinking about her novel that’s looking back at this time,” says Santiago. “So some of her fashion decisions are based on her research.” Carrie’s Controversial Hat Along with sky-high Manolo Blahnik heels and Fendi baguettes, statement headwear has long been Carrie’s calling card. Outdoing herself again, she kicks off Season 3 with a sculptural, pink gingham hat by Maryam Keyhani paired with a vintage Ossie Clark dress with an inverted basque waistline and pannier-like skirt silhouette. “We wanted something that felt very light, airy, fresh, and playful,” says Santiago, about aligning the look with the summer day in the park setting. “There is a nod to that [late-19th-century] period, especially the hat. She’s in her inspiration period right now.” But Carrie’s whimsical hat — aptly-named “Head in the Clouds” by the brand — seems to have caused even more discussion than her up-in-the-air relationship status with Aidan, with many poking fun of the look, which surprised Rogers. “I’m shocked that at this point that people even bat an eye at Carrie in some wackadoodle great hat,” says Rogers.”Do you want us to put her in a canvas sun hat? The alternative is not Carrie cool.” Carrie’s Travel Outfit In episode four, Carrie wrangles a speaking gig that’s conveniently located in Virginia near Aidan’s farm, where she’s hoping to stay on an extended visit. Carrie dresses as only Carrie would for treks through sprawling airports and waits in rental car lines: head-to-toe Vivienne Westwood. “We’ve had historical costume moments with Westwood all through the original series,” says Rogers, adding that the team also wanted to honor the legendary designer who died as they were prepping for the season. After pairing Westwood’s Victoriana-meets-punk Panther dress with a chevron cardigan, Rogers and Santiago decided to go all-in with the British designer. “I think it’s the only time Carrie has worn one designer head-to-toe,” says Rogers. “That’s a big Easter egg.”  Carrie somehow fits all her travel essentials into a circular Orb tote from the brand, and dashes to the car in strappy, five-inch brown platform sandals that would not be conducive to a mile-long walk (or ATV drive that she later takes) through the countryside. “The strappy shoes used to be [Parker’s] favorite shoe in the entire world,” says Rogers, who unearthed the Westwood heels from the SATC costume archive. “After she had filmed in them for a week, she said, ‘I never want to see those again. They were so painful.’” Carrie’s “Carrie On The Prairie” Dresses After Aidan finally invites her to stay at his farm, Carrie, who lost her luggage, swaps out her Westwood outfit for Aidan’s son Homer’s (Corbin Drew Ross) baseball uniform — paired with her Westwood heels, naturally — to get new clothes. After inquiring about nearby retail options, she heads to Daisy’s Dress Shop, which apparently only carries floral maxi dresses and nightgown-like frocks. After purchasing a few styles, Carrie refers to her new look as “Carrie on the Prairie.” Even though their prep coincided with the Nap Dress craze and cottagecore trend, with plenty of current options available for the costume designers to pull, Santiago says the costume designers decided to go “the vintage route” to avoid associating any one brand with the episode that pokes fun at the fashion available in Aidan’s rural home. “Please don’t say ‘Summer’s Eve,’” says Carrie, referencing the floral fashion in the brand’s cringe-y ‘80s commercials. In the end, her ’70s-inspired dress — with flowy sleeves, ruffles, and pink florals on chevron stripes — walked the fine line of looking unexpectedly cool in that Carrie way while still providing comedic relief necessary for the episode that sees Aidan struggling to parent his son Wyatt (Logan Souza). “There were so many jokes written for that scene,” says Rogers. “But honestly, in the end, it looked like something that came out of Saks or Zimmermann.” Carrie’s Offscreen Shoe Outfits Carrie does not believe in a shoe-free home and insists on stomping across her hardwood floors in various heels in episode five. This, much to the consternation of her downstairs neighbor, Duncan, who’s suffering from a case of writer’s block.  “We were hoarding shoes from day one,” says Rogers of the envy-inducing montage of shoe close-ups. “We were calling everyone and saying, ‘Send us your best shoe. Make sure it’s the latest and greatest, and it has to be, not clunky, but it has to make noise.’” If you play the montage in slo-mo and use your imagination, maybe you’ll catch some of the full looks that only Carrie would wear at home. If you ask the costume designers? “There’s the day-glow Rene Caovilla heels with the Isabela Capeto charm dress,” says Rogers. “I bought it in the Hamptons with SJ.” The outfit combos also include: Aquazurra yellow slingbacks with a vintage pink dress, Rene Caovilla pink crystal bow-adorned heels with a Bob Mackie opera coat, a Missoni crochet dress and white Manolo Blahnik thigh-high boots, Maskit overalls and turquoise Alexander McQueen western-style heels, Ralph Lauren Polo boxer shorts lined with vintage crinoline and customized Gucci patent Mary Jane pumps, and sweatpants with red sock booties that were designed by Rogers and Santiago for Parker’s SJP Collection. Despite knowing that these looks would not appear in full onscreen, Santiago and Rogers felt it was important to create them regardless for the purpose of storytelling.  “They wanted us not to put these outfits together,” says Santiago. “We ended up styling every single one of those shoes and made outfits to go with them.” Let’s start a petition to #ReleaseTheFullOutfitCut.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-summer-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Shoes — sandals, ballet flats, loafers, you name it — have the potential to make or break your whole look. As such, if you’re on a mission to level up your summer style, you can’t go wrong with refreshing your footwear rotation. Though there’s always a time and place for, say, classic white sneakers, we suggest taking a step — quite literally — outside your comfort zone by trying out summer’s biggest shoe trends, which are all over the map.  Firstly, designers are harking back to the past, introducing new iterations of footwear from bygone decades. One notable example? Retro sneakers. With slim silhouettes and bold, punchy colors, these vintage-looking kicks are real head-turners, as proven on the spring/summer 2025 runways at shows like Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler, and Loewe. Meanwhile (perhaps much to the dismay of some millennials out there), late-2000s-inspired gladiator sandals have made a major comeback this season. However, the latest styles are a far cry from the uber-high silhouettes once loved by the likes of Kourtney Kardashian, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Rihanna. And for something a bit more refined, turn your attention to of-the-moment woven shoes — from ballet flats to slide-on sandals, footwear is getting the artisanal treatment this summer.  Without further ado, scroll onward for a rundown of summer 2025’s top shoe trends. Put your best (and most stylish) foot forward this season. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Gladiator Sandals The rumors are true: Gladiator sandals of yore are popping up everywhere this summer, albeit in shorter variations than the knee-length styles popular in the 2000s and 2010s. In step with the return of the boho fashion aesthetic, the trend ran the gamut on the runways, spotted in the form of studded versions (at Isabel Marant) and minimalist looks (debuted at Khaite). To keep the look more grounded, style the shoes with a slouchy bag and denim shorts. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Retro Sneakers Following 2024’s Puma Speedcat craze, more low-profile retro-inspired runners — many of which look like they’re straight out of the ‘70s — are now infiltrating the fashion scene, thanks to the style’s strong presence on the catwalks. Always ahead of the curve, Miu Miu introduced the vintage vibe in vibrant shades like hot pink, turquoise, and butter yellow. Miuccia Prada also designed deep purple suede sneakers with a metal toe for Prada. And should you prefer a high-top silhouette, there’s a good chance the ultra-colorful pairs at Loewe will strike your fancy. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Woven Styles Woven accessories are synonymous with summer, so it makes perfect sense as that homespun-looking footwear is in high demand this season. For spring/summer 2025, the look made an appearance at Jacquemus, Stella McCartney, and Gabriela Hearst shows. One major draw of a woven shoe? They provide the breathability and drama of the mesh look without being entirely see-through. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Boat Shoes The fisherman aesthetic has taken over every facet of our wardrobes, and footwear is no exception. From the white and navy boat shoes at Loewe to Monse’s shiny brown pair, these new summer silhouettes have made one thing clear: Designers want you to set sail in style. And if you’re not near the beach or lake this season, you can give these practical shoes a downtown chic vibe with a breezy button-up and edgy leather shorts.   Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Embellished-Toe Pairs For spring/summer 2025, luxury labels gave the term “twinkle toes” a new meaning. At Chanel, Fendi, and Balmain, shoes festooned with rhinestones, pearls, and beads took center stage. Whether in the form of flat sandals or heeled mules, consider these babies the perfect plus-one for an upcoming wedding — they won’t go unnoticed. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Jelly Sandals Ready or not, the jelly sandals trend is back for round two this summer, with big-name designers turning the cute style on its head. Chloé, for one, propelled the look into high-fashion territory with its heeled thong sandals. Lacoste, meanwhile, leaned into the trendy fisherman sandal look. Though these shoes may conjure up images of frivolous childhood moments, they are more than apt for adults now, too, with a silhouette for every aesthetic. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Snakeprint Styles Snakeskin is giving leopard print a run for its money — at least in the footwear department. This season, fashion houses cracked the code for timeless yet fresh silhouettes featuring the sumptuous design. Jil Sander did so with its Western-esque boots, while Dries Van Noten designed a slingback wedge with a curvy heel. Make a snakeskin shoe the pièce de résistance of your summer outfits, whether you’re dressing for the office or a date. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/taylor-swift-eb-denim-dress-49448948",
    "description": "Apart from her obsession with a red lipstick from MAC, there's another item that Taylor Swift doesn't mind repeating without shame - a denim dress. Most recently, the \"Eras\" singer showed her support for boyfriend Travis Kelce at his benefit concert for Tight End University. Her outfit? A denim dress, of, course. The EB Denim Polka Dress ($495) consisted of a lace-up corset bodice and pleated miniskirt that's made entirely of recycled denim. She teamed the flirty frock with black, knee-high leather boots from Versace, a Steven Battelle pendant necklace, Jacquie Aiche hoop earrings, and a Deborah Drattell Western belt. It was an outfit very befitting of her surprise performance of \"Shake It Off.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kane Brown (@kanebrown) This clothing combination is nothing new for Swift, as she wore the same exact dress in blue at the 2023 MTV Awards (because denim just screams red carpet, right?). She even wears denim minis for rehearsals - one acid-wash style from Wiskii in particular, which our editor tested out. Corsets are also a sartorial comfort zone for the artist, with this soft blue one from Reformation being a recent favorite. Surprisingly, Swift's denim LBD is still available, but of course, we scoured the internet for more options. For the Swifties who can't resist another chance to shop on the singer's influence, we found these similar options that nail the same vibe without the hefty price point. If you're more of a classic blue denim girl, consider the UO Darryl Denim Drop Waist Tube Mini Dress ($59), PLT Label Denim Blue Tailored Bust Detail Pleated Hem Bodycon Dress ($60, originally $120), and the Gap Denim Mini Dress ($80, originally $90). And if you want to get the same edgy look with a darker shade, these picks are sure to be approved by the star: the Lioness x Revolve Biker Mini Dress ($99) and the Free People Astrid Oxford Mini Dress ($108).

    "description": "At this point, every day feels synonymous with a new fashion trend. Whether it's a resurgence or something entirely fresh, you can expect to see at least one hot topic du jour on your FYP each morning. In case you've been living under a rock, this month alone has brought an influx of trends redefining our shopping identity: bandage dresses (really the Hervé Léger dress), recession core, and the \"New England Summer\" aesthetic. And, as if we're not already spending enough, there's yet another trend tempting us to swipe our cards: jelly shoes. Of course, jelly shoes are far from new. While the popular footwear style is undeniably equal parts chic and comfortable, it's more than just a PVC shoe. The look originated post-World War II as a cost-effective alternative to shoes made from natural textiles such as leather and cotton. The first PVC shoe is believed to have been created by the French company Sarraizienne in the 1950s, often worn by fishermen due to their affordability and easy-to-clean design. By the '80s, PVC footwear had evolved to the term \"jelly shoes\" when Tony Alano and Nicolas Guillon launched their company of the same name. Major fashion houses, such as Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, started incorporating the style into collections. (Gaultier even collaborated with jelly shoe icon Melissa in May 2023.) Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Rihanna have also embraced the trend, proving its staying power. If you couldn't tell, jelly shoes are back, and we're here for it. Today's versions go far beyond the fisherman sandal, with silhouettes ranging from ballet flats to platform heels featuring playful details like hearts. Whether you want to nail the TikTok fisherman aesthetic in a chic way or simply want another fun summer shoe, shop our curated guide of the best jelly shoes ahead.",

    "description": "Most guys use hair product on autopilot. A scoop, a rub, a quick style — done. But here’s the thing: even the best product won’t work if your technique is off. Flat, greasy, crunchy, or stiff hair is rarely the product’s fault. More often, it’s about how and when it’s applied.
