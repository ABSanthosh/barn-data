We all leaned into it back in lockdown, and with today’s barrage of terrifying news, it’s unsurprising we still feel in need of extra TLC.

Over 1,000 revellers joined our party in Palm Springs to celebrate Refinery29’s 20th anniversary and the return of 29Rooms, our interactive, interconnected experience and the ultimate pit stop where beauty, art, and wellness collide.  In the desert heat – temperatures soared to an almost record of 104 F (!!) during the day — our party goers showcased their best festival fits. Their looks featured some of the season’s top trends: from fringe, wide-brim hats, and cowboy boots to comfy matching sets like a crochet matching set or a sea-through maxi dress. Perfect for jumping right in the pool at your hotel after the last set. (Just us?) Among our fave looks: Caroline Stern’s bedazzled jacket and matching hair gems, which she wore during our TIkTok Live from our Beauty Space Station. And stylist Ivy Coco’s sequined skirt and crop top combo. The Lunar Lounge was our first stop on our epic 2025 29Rooms road trip, which is popping up across the country this summer.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/spanx-sculpting-jeans-review-49438249",
    "description": "Booty-lifting clothing and butt-enhancing shapewear is having a moment, which is why Spanx's introduction of its SpanxSculpt ReDefine denim is hardly a surprise. The renowned brand has been perfecting smoothing undergarments since 2000 under founder Sara Blakely's lead, and is only expanding further. While Spanx has been producing pull-on denim for several years, SpanxSculpt ReDefine takes things to the next level - the material is constructed to actively enhance the natural shape, while delivering the look of traditional denim. \"The combination of sculpting technology and classic denim detailing has driven incredible excitement and strong customer engagement,\" Spanx Chief Merchandising Officer Kiana Miree says. \"It's clear that this collection is becoming an essential wardrobe piece for so many, thanks to its perfect blend of shape-enhancing benefits and incredible comfort.\" The line launched with two silhouettes, the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans ($158), which I'm wearing in Dark Indigo, and the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Slim Straight Jeans ($158). Miree says it's an equal 50/50 split in popularity based on different customer preferences, but the darker wash reigns supreme. \"The flare style creates a leg-lengthening, shape-enhancing silhouette, while the slim straight style creates a figure-flattering leg shape that we obsessed to get just right,\" she says, confirming that the company is actively looking to expand even further into new styles and washes that align with upcoming trends. While I'm not necessarily in the market for a bigger butt, I'm not opposed to a little rounding and shaping - which is exactly why I was down to try out these jeans. Ahead, you can compare my figure in before-and-after photos and read a full and thorough review of Spanx's latest viral product that has the internet in a frenzy. Expert Featured in This Article Kiana Miree is the Chief Merchandising Officer at Spanx. About the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans The jeans are available in Dark Indigo (the more popular shade according to the brand) and Medium Indigo with a regular inseam of 32\", which is described as \"slightly long.\" Available in sizes 0 to 26, the jeans run small due to their strong compression and LYCRA FitSense® denim technology; check out the size chart and take accurate measurements before purchasing. They have a five-pocket design with a zip and button closure and targeted, integrated sculpting zones for tummy control, thigh shaping, and a booty-lifting effect. The jeans are designed to be snug - they're in the right place when you can feel the sculpting zones at the upper thigh lifting your booty. The jeans have a high-rise at 11.5 inches and the flare leg opening is 21 inches. Machine wash on a cold, gentle cycle with like colors and tumble dry on low; do not iron, steam, or dry clean. Spanx offers free returns or exchanges on these jeans and your purchase can be financed with four interest-free installments. A side view in standard denim flares vs. the SpanxSculpt ReDefine jeans. What I Like About the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans These jeans definitely do their job to enhance, ultimately making my backside appear a lot rounder than I'm used to when I'm wearing regular denim. \"The best feedback we've heard is, 'Wow, my butt has never looked this lifted,'\" Miree says. I personally love the feeling of compression fabric, and I definitely notice a similar effect to that of my lymphatic drainage catsuit and leggings. The squeeze of material is somewhat energizing with every step I take. Of course, the best part is these look like jeans, so I'm able to construct a much more sophisticated, everyday look around them whether I'm dressing them up or down. They're just as cute styled with a going-out top as they are with a simple white T-shirt. What to Consider Before Buying the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans As mentioned in multiple places, these jeans do run small, so you should size up. I took one size larger than I usually do, but honestly could have sized up even further for comfort. However, it's important to note that the tighter they feel, the more they're doing their work to sculpt your curves. Because they only come in one standardized inseam, you may need to get them shortened if you're petite. (I'm 5'1\" and these were the perfect length with three-inch heeled boots, but they'd likely be dragging if I'd worn flats.) I should also mention that because of the numerous targeted sculpting zones, I did notice what I can only describe as extra lines or creases toward the top of my thighs at the back, which you can make out in the above photo. So while the sculpting technology is seamless, it doesn't exactly go unnoticed in certain lighting. Finally, there is a CA warning attached to this product, which means that the brand is advising customers of potential exposures to chemicals that may contribute to an individual's overall lifetime risk of cancer or risk of birth defects or other reproductive harm. You can review the Proposition 65 list of chemicals to better understand this warning. Where Are the SpanxSculpt ReDefine Flare Jeans Available? SpanxSculpt ReDefine denim is available exclusively on the brand's website. Rating: Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of shopping at PS.

    "description": "The cutout dress is getting a 2025 makeover, and we're here for it. Though cutouts have been everywhere these past few seasons, they're getting more inventive and unique by the day. Paris Hilton and Cardi B donned alluring ensembles with cutouts all over at this year's Coachella and Revolve Festivals, giving their stamp of approval on the trend (wearing Givenchy and Rick Owens, respectively). Cutout dresses now come with accents across the stomach, collarbone, chest, shoulders - you name it. If you've been seeing the viral fashion trend all over TikTok and in red carpet photos and want to try it on for size, here are 15 sexy styles that are worth scooping up. From statement minidresses and comfortable maxis to body-hugging cutout dresses and everything in-between, we've got standout pieces for a variety of styles and outings. Whether you're heading out to your favorite neighborhood bar or glamming up for a night out, there are multiple options for you. A few standouts include a side cutout dress that's polished but reveals just enough to turn heads, an edgy leather dress with unexpected cutouts, a comfortable sweater dress that's wearable throughout the season, and a playful back cutout dress that's demure from the front but super-sexy from the back.
