    "description": "From the sisters in Nobody Wants to Ashley Jensen’s detective in Shetland, one hairstyle dominated ambient TV this yearThe 2024 Netflix series Nobody Wants This was widely adored for many reasons – not least the concept of the Hot Rabbi, the renaissance of its star, former The OC geek-hearthrob Adam Brody, and the soothing LA lifestyle porn. But, for many of us, through Brody’s co-stars Kristen Bell and Justine Lupe, it was simply another 2024 example of what has become known in some quarters as “TV hair”.Throughout the series, Bell and Lupe, playing two very LA sisters who co-host a podcast about sex and relationships, sport a very specific brand of subtly waved hair. Neither ringlets nor straight, it’s glossy and well-styled, done but not too “done”. And it’s in any TV series where white women are the main characters – see Meghann Fahey in The Perfect Couple; Rose Byrne in Platonic; or even, back in 2021, Anna Kendrick in Love Life. It’s arrived in the UK too – Ashley Jensen has TV hair in Shetland, which crucially remains immaculate even on the windswept isle. Far away from the ultra-glam tresses seen on Love Island, this look may be subtly “done”, but – make no mistake – it is definitely “done”. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Apps like Depop and Vinted are hugely popular, but an online culture of scams, rage and suspicion is now the default between buyers and sellers, with communications quickly descending into hurling abuse at a strangerHere is a real-life conversation on a secondhand shopping app: a buyer of two items asks if a seller could combine postage costs. The petulant seller refuses. After a grating plea from the buyer, the seller retorts, “Fine, I’ll refund you, but I’m doing it my way.” Eventually, the buyer receives a large piece of card with a load of grubby coppers stuck to it with Sellotape. On the back it says, “Enjoy the refund!”And there’s nothing odd about this – these sorts of exchanges between Brits on marketplace apps are so commonplace they have become part of the texture of the shopping experience. Maybe even part of the fun. But why do we communicate like this? What is happening that we can’t be remotely polite and normal? Where have our famous manners gone? Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/New-Year-Eve-Underwear-Color-Meaning-36317927",
    "description": "How you end the year may influence how the entire year ahead turns out. Specifically, when we're talking style, some people believe the color underwear you choose for New Year's Eve could be potentially prophetic. Whether you're attending a party or lounging at home to watch the ball drop, if you want to put thought into the color of your panties and what that hue could symbolize, keep reading. The idea? Each color is associated with a specific quality you hope to embody in 2025. Founder of PSYKHE and fashion psychologist Anabel Maldonado explains that the superstition ties into the concept of \"enclothed cognition.\" This theory argues that how we dress informs our psychological processes, thoughts, and feelings. Two researchers at Northwestern University, Hajo Adam and Adam Galinsky, coined the concept after their studies showed that people wearing white doctor's coats were more attentive during a series of tasks than those wearing white painter's coats. The reason tied back to their prior assumptions about a doctor's heightened ability to focus. \"While the superstitions have a much more metaphysical interpretation - aka the color will magically make things happen for you - I believe our ancestors were just missing the middle step: the fact that if we think it and believe it, we're halfway there to what we desire,\" Maldonado says, sharing that some of the women she grew up with in her Latin culture wore red underwear on New Year's Eve for a good love life. Ahead, discover the different colors and what they are said to symbolize. Then, shop selects from popular lingerie brands once you decide what you're manifesting for 2025. Expert Featured in This Article: Anabel Maldonado is the founder of PSYKHE and a fashion psychologist.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Unlike, say, a graphic tee from an Instagram ad or the workout leggings your favorite TikToker is currently raving about, a handbag usually isn’t a random impulse purchase. Considering it houses your most prized possessions (i.e., driver’s license, credit cards, etc.), the accessory serves as one of the most important building blocks in your wardrobe. In addition to its functionality, it has the potential to amp up your outfit game tenfold. The ascendant 2025 handbag trends strike the balance between practical and attention-grabbing, seeing you through any occasion on the docket. For the office, the up-and-coming silhouettes run the gamut, from the oversized slouchy carryalls (spotted at Proenza Schouler) to briefcase-esque totes (seen at Hermès). For an evening out on the town, set your sights on the high-shine purses, as modeled on the Chanel and Louis Vuitton runways. And a quick weekend trip? Perhaps one of the chic backpacks demo’d by Miu Miu, Bottega Veneta, or Coach will strike your fancy.  Scroll ahead for a rundown of eight of 2025’s buzziest bag trends. New year, new purse. 2025 Handbag Trends: Fringe Bags The boho renaissance isn’t exiting the chat in the coming months — at least, not if luxury labels have anything to say about it. Fringe bags, in particular, are shaping up to be especially in demand amongst the style set. Nordstrom’s Associate Fashion Director, Linda Cui Zhang is here for it: “Fringe adds movement and a crafty element to classic bag shapes,” she says. The likes of Isabel Marant, Michael Kors, and Tory Burch are diving headfirst into the trend, showcasing fringe-heavy creations for spring. These bags are sure to add personality and intrigue to every outfit, in all their free-spirited, funky glory. 2025 Handbag Trends: Glitter Bags Dial up the drama with a glistening, light-reflecting bag. On the runways, the in-your-face look has come in many flavors: Louis Vuitton and Chanel bring the glamour with carryalls dripping in rhinestones and sequins, while Gucci delivers a silver purse festooned with tiny circular disks all over. These eye-catching bags are real conversation-starters — the perfect plus one for a swanky soirée.  2025 Handbag Trends: Suede Bags Suede has already dominated fall wardrobes, especially when it comes to outerwear. There’s also an appetite for suede carryalls, confirms Will Cooper, GMM Designer at Saks.  “It has been a few years since we have seen suede prevalent in handbags, and our customers are loving them!” he says. “Based on its popularity, many designers are expanding their offerings in suede bags for 2025.” On the runways, we’ve seen colorful iterations be a throughline for spring — at Burberry in hunter green and JW Anderson in navy blue, as well as Miu Miu (in brown) and Stella McCartney (cream). Style tip: Team the purse with another luxe texture, like leather or velvet, for extra oomph. 2025 Handbag Trends: Green Bags Brat Girl summer and Wicked sold the fashion scene on green in 2024. Designers don’t seem to be leaving it in the new year, especially not when it comes to the handbag department.
