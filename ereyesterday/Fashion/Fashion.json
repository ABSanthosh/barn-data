But London fashion week, which took place in the capital this weekend and focuses on womenswear, is noticeably lacking when it comes to Black female designers. Out of a total of nearly 60 shows, only two were the work of Black women.Relative newcomer Abigail Ajobi showed her luxury streetwear on Friday afternoon, while the more established British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker – who has dressed the likes of Maya Jama and Rihanna – had a presentation on Sunday.

    "description": "From The Hair Bros to Charlotte Mensah’s Hairlounge, London is home to some truly excellent hair salons — something that becomes especially evident at London Fashion Week when the city’s most stylish descend on the streets. Last season, we spotted street stylers with choppy bobs, mid-length chops, and long layers aplenty. This time around, the cuts are proving just as cool and effortless. Whether you’re keen for a total hair refresh or prefer something subtle, let the best haircut trends from London Fashion Week street style inspire you. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.The “snack-size” bob, aka the “kick” bob, is a short, sharp style that grazes the jawline and flicks out at the ends. We love the addition of the thick, stretchy headband. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Another day, another bob — and no, we’re not tired of them yet. This sleek, slicked-back style shows that short cuts can be styled in endless ways.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Curls and layers are a perfect pair, and here’s all the proof you need.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Say hello to the midi-flick: a mid-length cut with flicked, kicked-out ends. The slightly wet finish is an edgy final touch.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The French bob has ruled both the runways and street style this season. This deep side parting is the perfect finishing touch.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Embellished balaclava? Bow-adorned plaits? It's safe to say that this is one of the most eye-catching looks we came across at London Fashion Week. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Add a little flair to a mid-length cut with embellished hair slides, just like this LFW guest.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.A blunt cut creates the illusion of fuller hair. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We've lost count of the straight-across fringes seen at London Fashion Week, proving the style is well on its way to dethroning curtain bangs.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hairstylists agree: Choppy pixie cuts are poised to dominate in the coming months. This style boasts a textured fringe and edges for an accidentally perfect finish. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The best way to show off curls and ringlets? A towering updo, of course.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Brushed-out natural textures are reigning supreme on and off the catwalk this season. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Introducing the “mixie” — a mullet and pixie hybrid. “It’s essentially an outgrown pixie with soft edges around the hairline,” Anita Rice, hairstylist and cofounder of Buller + Rice told R29 recently. “The length at the back can be kept longer to create a wolf cut variation,” she added.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Speaking of the “wolf” cut, this style features choppy layers, flicked-out ends, and a textured fringe.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hairstylists predicted that the modern curly mullet would dominate 2025 — and it seems they were right. We’re obsessed with the chocolate cherry color here, too. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The micro fringe, sharp blunt ends, and painterly auburn highlights made a statement this weekend.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.These “bottleneck” bangs, essentially a fringe that occupies a cozy space between a curtain fringe and a fuller fringe, complement this guest’s layered, mid-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Isabella Charlotta Poppius showcases how face-framing layers and caramel highlights can add dimension and elegance to long hair. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Mid-length styles are back. These curly micro braids spotted on a guest this weekend are beautiful. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Ask your hairstylist for “invisible” layers — a subtle cutting technique that adds volume and movement without compromising length. It involves strategically placing a few shorter layers underneath while keeping the top section the same for a seamless, natural look.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Meet the “boxie”, a cross between the bob and pixie haircut. The choppy fringe and ‘90s highlights are the cherry on top of this unique style. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The beveled bob is so back. It’s a sharp jaw-length cut tucked under either using a straightener (try ghd Chronos Max, $349) or a heated round brush. It’s the ultimate style to pair with an oversized collar. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hip-grazing goddess braids were spotted at New York Fashion Week — and now in London. If you want to head in the complete opposite direction, consider the goddess braid bob. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The “mod” bob, the “mushroom” bob, the bowl cut… Whatever you call this spherical style, there’s an air of the ‘60s to it — but the slightly parted, straight-across fringe lends this particular chop a modern edge. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.This is picture proof that side fringes are versatile. We love the soft, piecey texture of this look combined with the bold red highlights.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Natural hair is taking center stage on London’s streets and runways this week, making waves at Fashion East, Harris Reed, and Richard Quinn.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Protective styles, like these stunning Koroba braids, have been turning heads both on and off the runways this season.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We love this choppy fringe and the even edgier, textured layers.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.We're obsessed with this cut, dubbed the \"boyfriend” bob by stylists. It's short, sharp, and effortlessly undone, with shorter front pieces adding a touch of ‘90s boyband floppiness.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Like what you see?

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And the latest iteration is \"The Ultimate Butt\" drop featuring shorts, leggings, and bodysuits with built-in butt pads. Almost as soon as Kardashian announced the new collection on Instagram, fans responded with strong opinions, some praising the campaign rollout (\"The marketing is simply genius,\" one commenter wrote) and others questioning how the shapewear will fare IRL (\"and then you take it off to hook up and then what,\" one critic posted). No matter where you fall on the butt-padding debate, you can't ignore the numbers: most of the drop is already sold out. Some other favorites from Skims? The Skims Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. It should come as no surprise that you can now shop these pieces in person. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and the below assortment is it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available online at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
