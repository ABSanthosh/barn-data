    "description": "You can always rely on monochrome for an event look, but texture keeps it interestingWe’re a week into December and the party season is in full swing. If you’re struggling with the age old ‘what to wear’ conundrum, keep it simple. Stick with black and white and experiment with texture, it’s a versatile way to supercharge your outfit. Dolce and Gabbana’s AW24 collection is a master class in how to nail the look. Aim for contrasting textures to layer up: silk under wool, or velvet with lace adds a modern edge to the party look. Look for black-on-black embellishment for a timeless look you can wheel out every year. Reiss’s black sequin shirt (4) adds flair without being out-and-out showy, style with black trousers and loafers. Next’s subtle glitter tuxedo (8) is another affordable take on the look. For more adventurous dressers, one of the key runway trends was sheer – from full-on chest revealing transparency to more wearable gauzy shirts, like Allsaints lace one (£119) and River Island’s white lace (£46, main image above).If embellishment is too seasonal look for interesting detailing, like Represent’s zip-up jacket (2) that will look sharp long after the last champagne cork has popped on NYE . Ditto Zara’s tailored separates and Daily Paper’s chess board patterned pieces, style with a gauzy shirt for a night out, but swap in a sweater for spring. For more formal events, velvet blazers always look super chic over a fine-gauge black rollneck. Continue reading...",

    "description": "In 2024, we’re living our tween dreams, with bag charms being one of this season’s hottest — and most endearing — handbag trends. And while the playful accessories have been on the runways for the past few seasons, if the spring 2025 trends are any indication, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon.Janitor-style keychains and rope-and-chain clusters first made a splash at Balenciaga’s and Miu Miu’s spring 2024 shows, respectively. Then, Coach’s oversized pretzel-, apple-, and taxi-shaped charms jangled down the brand’s New York-themed fall 2024 runway. The cutesy look was soon adopted by fashion insiders as a street-style mainstay and given the seal of approval by celebrities like Gigi Hadid and Dua Lipa. This trend comes at a time when style personalization and mood-boosting fashion are on the rise. While bag charms aren’t new — people have been adorning outfits with scarves, keychains, and memorabilia for years, with Jane Birkin being a notable example for the way she decorated her Hermès namesake with personal tokens — the recent wave of the maximalist fashion movement has inspired more individuality in fashion than in years past. Now, brands are selling everything from micro replicas of popular bags (could it get more meta?), adorable fruit and plush toys, intricately beaded trinkets, and even mini Eiffel Towers and Lady Liberties to customize our handbags to our heart’s content. Whether you’re looking to max out your favorite handbag or to add just a couple darling additions, scroll on to find 18 bag-and-charm combinations for every fashion aesthetic.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

In fact, many of the picks on this list are under $100. Instead of price, it's about opulent-feeling (read: cozy, plush, soft) fabrics, thoughtful gifts, personalized touches, elevated versions of wardrobe essentials that your giftee would never get for themselves, and, most importantly, pampering presents that will help them indulge in some self-care to start 2025 in a more relaxed state.With that in mind, ahead, find the best luxury gifts for the most deserving people on your list.

If your wallet allows, consider splurging on the Ultimate Set — in addition to the serum, it features a cleanser and an essence — which has visibly improved my parched skin and made it radiant after a few weeks of use alone.Vintner's Daughter Active Botanical Serum, $, available at RevolveOlive Oil SetFor the at-home cook, this set from premium olive oil brand Graza includes two bottles of Drizzle finishing oil, as well as two brightly hued half-circle serving trays and two dipping bowls made in collaboration with Areaware.Graza The “Drizz \u0026 Dip” Olive Oil Set, $, available at GrazaOlive Oil SetFor the at-home cook, the first delivery from the subscription set from premium olive oil brand Graza includes a Sizzle (cooking oil) and a Drizzle (an oil for salad dressings, bread, etc.) bottle, two refill cans, and a funnel.

Not only is the silhouette incredibly comfortable regardless of whether you’re running or doing a HIIT workout, but it also looks sleek thanks to the knit upper and comes in many different colors (which might explain why I frequently wear them out when I am not exercising, too).APL TechLoom Zipline Running Shoe, $, available at NordstromBoxer ShortsBoxer shorts will continue to trend next year, and these ones from Hommegirls are the fashion-insider favorite.

    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($49, originally $78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It comes in eight different colorways, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice), grey eucalyptus and bone, flush pink and bone, and nightfall and lilac ether, among others.
