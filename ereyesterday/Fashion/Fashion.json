These high-rise performance leggings are designed to feel comfortable all day long. Since the material is stretchy, the brand recommends sizing down if you’re in between sizes, whether you pick a short, regular, or long length.“These leggings are actually comfy enough to wear for all day vs the traditional leggings that fit more snug,” one customer explained. Many have noted that they own several pairs of this style, with one writing: “Love these leggings. Second pair I own. Gifted a pair to my sis and she too loves them.”Shop VuoriVuori AllTheFeels Legging, $, available at VuoriVuori Long Sleeve Halo CrewThe Best Workout-to-Weekend CrewneckThe Hype: 4.8 out of 5 stars, 3,207 reviewsGo from the gym to brunch to the airport in a performance crewneck that’s as soft and cozy as it is stylish and sleek. This one is available in so many fall-ready colorways, it’ll be hard to narrow down which to pick (or force you to add multiple to your collection).From customer reviews, we can surmise that this top is heavier than the Daydream Crew, but lighter than the Essential Hoodie. “Perfect for fall or spring days. Heavier than a T-shirt but not a sweatshirt. I have short arms so I only buy shirts with a band at the sleeve. Going to have to get more colors,” one customer wrote. Another said: “Great fitting/feeling top. These wash so well, always look brand new. So versatile dress up or dress down.”Shop VuoriVuori Long Sleeve Halo Crew, $, available at VuoriVuori Performance JoggerThe Overall Best Vuori StyleThe Hype: 4.8 out of 5 stars, 43,831 reviewsWith an outstanding rating and over 43k reviews, you can be confident that you’ll also love Vuori’s best-selling jogger. Made from the brand’s signature moisture-wicking DreamKnit stretch fabric, you can take these pants out for your hot girl walks (or keep them inside to cuddle up on your couch). They’re available in regular and long lengths.One happy customer wrote, “These are soft, comfortable and actually flattering. They're the only joggers I wear out and about (as opposed to just house pants). I like that it's recycled material. Wash and wear beautifully.” Another added: “I have gone back \u0026 forth on the joggers due to a higher price but finally bought a pair \u0026 am glad I did. They are so soft \u0026 comfortable. I won't hesitate now on future purchases. Worth it.”Shop VuoriVuori Performance Jogger, $, available at VuoriVuori Restore Half Zip HoodieThe Softest Half-Zip StyleThe Hype: 4.8 out of 5 stars, 492 reviewsVuori knows a thing or two about soft materials, and the organic French terry on this half-zip hoodie is no exception.

All three of my girls love the style and the color,” one customer shared. Another further explained the hoodie’s pros: “This is the best sweatshirt. Comfy, cozy, warm.

    "description": "When it comes to Halloween costumes, you obviously want to nail your spooky (or stylish) look, but that doesn't mean practicality has to go out the window. If you're unsure of what to wear or who to dress up as, we recommend making use of a crimson-colored fashion item that's likely already a staple in your fall wardrobe: aka a classic red dress. A red-dress Halloween costume provides a wide range of styling options that'll allow you to easily look the part of your favorite pop culture figures or fictional characters this spooky season - and all on a budget, no less. Landing on a costume idea for a red dress may seem daunting, but there are many reasons such a bold piece can work. The color alone exudes confidence, edge, and power, making red dresses a wardrobe essential. You can go the classic red-dress costume route with ideas like Pebbles from \"The Flintstones\" or Lydia Deetz from \"Beetlejuice.\" Or you can get creative and channel an icon like Lil' Kim or a cartoon character like Didi Pickles from \"Rugrats.\" Need an extra push? Many costume options require a red dress while allowing you to stick to your authentic style. If you're obsessed with sultry silhouettes, take Heidi Klum as the perfect example. As the unofficial queen of Halloween, she's nailed the fiery color multiple times, including the Betty Boop spaghetti-strap dress she wore in 2002 and her jaw-dropping transformation into the iconic Jessica Rabbit in 2015. Ahead, you'll find plenty of unique red-dress costume ideas, plus affordable red dresses you'll want to purchase for this Halloween and beyond.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($48). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It comes in eight different colorways, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice), grey eucalyptus and bone, flush pink and bone, and nightfall and lilac ether, among others. Where Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Available to Shop? This accessory is available to shop exclusively at Lululemon.
