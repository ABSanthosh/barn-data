We don’t have to take our clothes off to have a good time. I’m talking about fashion, naturally. If you want to tap into the most fun update happening in style right now, you can do so without changing a single item of clothing. Because the party is happening in your jewellery box, not your wardrobe.Fun jewellery is back, and I am thrilled. I love a hoop earring as much as anyone, but I think it is time to admit to ourselves that the hoop has got a little tired at this point. For several months last year, the biggest thing that was happening in earrings was that the precise shape of the hoop had changed a tiny bit. Instead of being shaped like car tyres, they had a melted quality, heavier at the bottom. Before that, they had shrunk slightly, into huggie hoops that tightly clasped the lobes. They had switched from gold to silver, and sometimes to a combination of gold and silver.

It’s time to stop mocking florals for spring (à la Miranda Priestly), and start celebrating their enduring beauty — because, news flash: florals are back in full bloom.LoveShackFancy is beloved for its dreamy floral prints and spring-ready pastels, but the brand also has a knack for viral collaborations — from Gap staples and Kendra Scott jewelry to Stanley reusable bottles. Its next partnership, set to be an instant fan favorite and sell-out hit, is with Hunter on an all-new boot collection.“Part of the magic of LoveShackFancy is bringing our whimsical aesthetic into everyday life,” said LoveShackFancy founder and creative director Rebecca Hessel Cohen in a press release. “So being able to bring our signature heirloom florals to boots as functional and timeless as Hunter’s feels like the ultimate blend of romance and practicality.”The limited-edition collection will feature eight new boot styles “that marry Hunter’s renowned craftsmanship with LoveShackFancy’s distinctive, romantic aesthetic.” Signature Hunter boot styles (including the Original Tall Rain Boots) will be covered in iconic LSF prints (Confetti Bloom, Rose Heart, and Rosa Beaux) for both women and children, with prices ranging between $95 and $215. “By blending our signature strengths, we’ve created a collection that speaks to a new generation of trendsetters […] who want to look effortlessly chic — rain or shine,” said Shanya Perera, senior vice president, marketing, advertising \u0026 PR at Marc Fisher footwear, US licensee of Hunter footwear, in the release.Beyond their enchanting looks, these boots are incredibly practical for spring showers, gardening, and alfresco backyard parties The Hunter x LoveShackFancy collab drops on April 10, online at several retailers, including LoveShackFancy, Hunter, Free People, Nordstrom, Shopbop, Bloomingdale’s, and Journeys.

A hot new sneaker collaboration has entered the chat — arriving just in time to conquer bold spring sneaker trends. Hoka is becoming expert in viral limited-edition sneaks, partnering with R29 reader-favorites like FP Movement and Reformation (congrats to those who scored a pair). Its latest link-up, though, is by far the most high-fashion — and surprising — collab yet.The California-based brand teamed up with luxury label Marni to create a sneaker that fuses Hoka’s performance expertise with the Italian house’s maximalist aesthetic. The result? A fresh, puffy, monochromatic twist on the unisex Bondi B3LS lifestyle sneakers, launching today.In a press release, Marni Creative Director Francesco Risso described the collaboration process as “exhilarating — an exchange of energy where their technical mastery met Marni’s instinct for shape, color, and emotion.” The co-designed style features durable rubber soles, cushioned EVA insoles, and padded polyester uppers built for all-day activity — a bold, totemic design that  Risso calls “a fearless expression of movement, volume, and identity.”Perhaps the most exciting twist is the new color palette: Poinciana red, Bracken charcoal, Tourmaline blue, and Straw beige — hues that beautifully echo Marni’s Fall 2025 collection from Milan Fashion Week. Plus, each pair comes with three sets of laces, giving shoppers the freedom to customize and switch up their look. The Marni x Hoka sneakers are available for $395 both on Hoka’s and Marni’s websites now. Like what you see?

    "description": "Ever since Beyoncé's critically acclaimed - and now, Grammy award-winning - \"Cowboy Carter\" album debuted, social media has been abuzz about Queen Bey's potential return to the stage. Now, we can officially prepare for the tour as the music legend announced on Feb. 1 that she is indeed taking the \"Cowboy Carter\" show on the road in 2025. Of course with any Beyoncé concert, attendees are guaranteed a couple things: an otherworldly performance filled with stadium-shaking vocals, high-energy dance routines, and an electric setlist of back-to-back hits that only one of the world's greatest entertainers could nail nightly. While Beyoncé's concert outfits are always a topic of conversation, the visuals for her \"Cowboy Carter\" album have provided a whole new category of style inspiration for BeyHive members looking to mirror the star's inimitable aesthetic. Stylistically, fans' \"Cowboy Carter\" outfits are bound to pay homage to the star's most beloved eras - think lots of glitzy, latex bodysuit looks á la \"Renaissance\" mixed with \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\"-inspired metallics and \"Cowboy Carter\"-esque country vibes. Much like her previous tours, we predict a sea of rhinestone-embellished ensembles teamed with cowgirl hats and statement pieces that play into the superstar's looks both on and off the red carpet - like over-the-knee boots, curve-defining dresses, denim jumpers, and bold jewelry. Whether you want to channel the magic of a Beyoncé concert or immerse yourself in it for the first time, we've rounded up the best concert outfit ideas that are all inspired by the star herself - and perfect to wear to any upcoming stops on her \"Cowboy Carter\" tour. From Levi's jeans and crystal Betsey Johnson boots to rhinestone-tassel cowgirl hats, these are looks you'll be excited to dance and scream-sing in all night long.
