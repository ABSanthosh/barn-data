If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In any given year, there are a few banner moments that bubble up in the fashion world well before they take over the zeitgeist. (One obvious example: Valentino’s entirely pink fall/winter 2022 collection showed more than 16 months before Barbie hit theaters and Barbiecore became inescapable.) While there are myriad elements that factor into the trend cycle, spring collections are typically most indicative of the moments that will define the following year. And if the latest crop of shows is any indication, there’s no shortage of optimism going into 2025 (in spite of…everything).  There are more than enough trends that feel like walking contradictions. (For example, traditionally grungy plaid takes on a more refined approach at Bottega Veneta and Burberry.) Still, many sartorial threads point to a more whimsical, almost idiosyncratic take on dressing in 2025: Once-sharp suiting is softened; athleisure enjoys a palpable, office-ready refinement; and undeniably joyous, more-is-more magpie moments rule at brands like Schiaparelli, Prada, and Louis Vuitton. (It’s impossible to take yourself too seriously in a bubble skirt.)  Some may posit that we’ve over-indexed on fantasy — however, there are plenty of more wearable trends set to ascend in the new year that you can start shopping now. Discover them ahead, along with the exact styles we’re eyeing to get a jump on 2025 dressing.  Fashion Trend 2025: At The Cape An unexpected offshoot of the ladylike trend, the swift rise in capes, capelets and similar silhouettes points to a deeper refinement of quiet luxury. This really took hold in the form of outerwear on the fall/winter 2024 runways of Bottega Veneta, Proenza Schouler, Alberta Ferretti, and Chloé, and it continues into the spring. Scandi darling Totême proposes a draped “goddess dress” featuring a layer of gathered fabric that curls quietly around the neck, while Chanel has a more literal take on the look, complete with a superhero-in-training-style necktie.  Fashion Trend 2025: The New Neutrals A typical capsule wardrobe features black, white, and perhaps a pop of navy but designers are expanding the definition of neutral. We’ve reached meme-levels of saturation on brown suede, and the most mellow of the earth tones — rich camels, chocolates, butter yellows and even burgundies — seem to be having their moment in the sun.  At Hermès, camels step in where creams or blacks once dominated, while Bottega Veneta’s ultra-saturated wine red finds its way to dresses and blazers. The latter hue peppers collections from Tibi, Simkhai, and Tanner Fletcher, too. For its part, Max Mara relies upon deep chocolate browns and khakis for the better half of its most recent offerings. For a truly modern take on the trend, try mixing each with black — it’s refined, elevated, and just the right amount of unexpected. Fashion Trend 2025: Bubbling Up If the unlikely comeback of the bubble skirt — an ‘80s relic and much-slandered, socialite-favorite silhouette of the early aughts — is any indication, fashion has traded its love affair with the ‘90s for the decade prior.  The item entered the sartorial ether earlier this year but spring/summer 2025 sees its test run evolve into a fully fledged curve obsession. At Stella McCartney, toga-like dresses drape over the shoulder and sweep the torso to reveal a bubbled-hemmed mini. Similarly, Nicklas Skovgaard — an early adopter of the trend back in 2023 — offers generous iterations of his signature silhouette. Meanwhile, hoop skirts, impossibly voluminous dresses and a general embrace of curves make their way into collections from JW Anderson, Who Decides War, Erdem, Loewe, and Junya Watanabe (though time will tell if those are runway exclusives). Fashion Trend 2025: Power Leg Every season introduces a true, capital-F Fashion trend. Fall 2023 saw the rise of hot pants. Before that, it was the micro-mini. Spring/Summer 2025 is shaping up to be the season of the power leg.  Designers love a hybrid (see: the scarf coat) and while this trend isn’t exactly rooted in practicality, it’s nothing short of fun. Victoria Beckham, Bottega Veneta, Polo Ralph Lauren, Courrèges and Coperni are all riffing on the same idea in varying iterations: Beckham slices a pair of burgundy trousers from shin to mid-thigh to reveal a sliver of black satin shorts, Coperni put Amelia Gray Hamlin in a slim-legged style, and Matthieu Blazy dressed models in a three-way pants-shorts-skirt hybrid that reveals only one calf in full. The favoritism lives on at Courrèges and Proenza Schouler, where asymmetrical silhouettes, which also included skirts, showcase a single gam. Credit should go to Eckhaus Latta and Maryam Nassir Zadeh, who each had one-legged looks in their respective spring 2023 shows — 2025, though, may be the year it finally goes mainstream (hey, a girl can dream). Fashion Trend 2025: Sheer Genius The sheer trend has had a chokehold on fashion for a few seasons now, but designers aren’t just leaning into it for spring/summer 2025 — they’re building entire collections around fluid, diaphanous fabrics that are made to move.  At Totême, Dries Van Noten, Marina Moscone, and Simone Rocha, gossamer-light silks that catch the slightest breeze take center stage in the form of twisted tulle skirts and sheer, sheathlike overdresses cut on the bias that lend an ephemeral feel to a simple silk gown. Sure, we’ve seen the soft power of a layer of tulle, romanticized to show the female form; even more relevant are the gauzy maxi dresses, button-downs and flowing pants that let underthings shine through. Fashion Trend 2025: All The Accoutrements It’s as if bag charms were just a foreshadowing. Never mind that Nicolas Ghesquière’s Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2025 and cruise 2025 collections are lessons in over-layering, or that Ann Demeulemeester found inspiration in a Bella Donna-era Stevie Nicks for its most recent outing. The vibe for the new year is more is more is more is…well, you get it.  A direct challenge to quiet luxury, it’s as though designers finally discovered the antithesis of that oft-maligned Coco Chanel quote — and they found it in bows, brocades, bowling bags, and other magpie moments that would typically age you. The only rule is that there are no rules, so go ahead —  wear the stripes and the polka dots and the sparkles with the three necklaces. Fashion Trend 2025: Sporty Spice As a concept, athleisure — which began as a trend among Los Angeles twentysomethings of wearing leggings and sports bras outside of Pilates — has morphed into a full-blown style profile. For spring, it’s finally dipping its feet into office-appropriate territory, as pioneered by Miu Miu, Ralph Lauren, Tolu Coker, Tommy Hilfiger, and The Attico. We’re seeing colorblocked windbreakers paired beautifully with evening wear-forward midi and maxi skirts (a banner silhouette of the season). Meanwhile, funnel-neck anoraks, jersey-style tunics, track separates, short-sleeve polo dresses and details like a contrast half-zip offer a more subtle take at Lacoste, Ganni and Ferragamo. Miu Miu is even turning its now-infamous boy shorts into a sport-utility version of the trend, so you know it’s real. Fashion Trend 2025: Soft Suiting After consecutive seasons of sharp tailoring comes a welcome turn toward softness. Saint Laurent’s billowing, oversized suits lead the charge, though it isn’t hard to find softer edges, slouchier trousers and silken suit shorts, if you’re looking for them. (See: Dries Van Noten, Stella McCartney, Carven.) While lapels are still cut with precision, bottoms enjoy a drapey, almost juvenilely baggy fit, as though some of the models at Loewe and Tibi had popped on their dads’ Wall Street uniforms two decades too soon. They’re pieces that would struggle to keep their shape off the hanger — which is exactly the kind of softness we’re craving. Fashion Trend 2025: She’s A Lady  The jacket silhouette that’s held strong at Chanel for decades has made headlines in the last few seasons. This time around, it serves as the foundation of a ladylike look that’s rounded out by accessories like modern pillbox hats (as seen at Chloé, Marni and Loro Piana) and ruffle and lace collars, sometimes of the Peter Pan variety (Ganni, Jil Sander). At Acne, a bubble-hem dress is accented with floral gloves and peep-toe heels, signaling a return to refinement. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Frost is nipping at our noses, which means our slouchy jackets and over-the-knee boots are back in the wardrobe rotation. As you swap out your fall dresses with their winter counterparts, consider upgrading some of your favorite styles. Throughout the chilly months ahead, you might opt for long-sleeve sweater and velvet dresses for a more festive feel, or maxi dresses for extra coverage and warmth. We’ve rounded up a range of trending silhouettes appropriate for various occasions, from casual get-togethers and work to NYE parties and winter weddings. Shop the best cool-weather styles from reliable reader-favorite brands like J.Crew, Anthropologie, Zara, and Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 New Years Eve Dresses New Years Eve celebrations always call for some sparkle, so we’re beelining for the chunky sequins and glitter. From mini dresses fit for rooftop bars and clubs to midis appropriate for lavish restaurant reservations, you’ll be dressed to the nines and ready to ring in the new year. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sweater Dresses Whether you’re dressing for the office, casual dinners, log cabin escapes, or window shopping, a sweater dress will serve you well. There’s a lot of variety, from jersey to cashmere, lightweight to thick knits — but all these cozy styles will keep you warm and comfortable throughout the season. We’ve found the best new sweater dresses in a range of lengths and colors, such as a button-up cardigan for work, a red maxi for winter festivities, and an off-the-shoulder mini for date night. DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Wedding Guest Dresses If you’ve got weddings approaching and still don’t have your look, we’ve got you: Seek out rich jewel tones and classic black dresses with a twist (think bows and off-the-shoulder necklines). If the nuptials require cocktail attire, consider a mini or midi dress that’s versatile enough to wear again for other winter parties. A black-tie dress code calls for a gown, but you get bonus points if it’s in a festive color or bedazzled to the max. DashDividers_1_500x100 Velvet Dresses When we think of winter fabrics, our minds automatically go to velvet. It’s soft, smooth, and simply scrumptious — a great option for cocktail events and winter weddings, especially in a fitted midi or maxi silhouette. We also found minis with fun details like fluttery sleeves and lace collars for a range of other seasonal festivities, like potlucks and at-home NYE parties.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Winter Maxi Dresses Maxi dresses aren’t just for the summer — in fact, they’re arguably ideal for winter, as the ankle-skimming, floor-grazing styles will keep your legs shielded from the frigid air. For casual occasions, lounge dresses and long sweater dresses are great. For more formal events, look for elevated one-shoulder and off-the-shoulder necklines. Like what you see?

We find that fashionable walking shoes are the perfect happy medium, because they not only look good with all of your favorite outfits, but they're also the exact type of shoe we want to slip into for a concert or when we're out exploring a new city.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown. Find your favorites and shop this season's best comfortable work shoes for standing all day.",
