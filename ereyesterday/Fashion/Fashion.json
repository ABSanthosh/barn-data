They do it a lot, this so-called “mini-me dressing” – via tartans and tiaras, nautical details and nifty colour accents.She’s not the only one.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/reformation-swimwear-review-49365986",
    "description": "It may come as no surprise that Reformation's swimwear comes with new and improved materials. The line, which retails from $68 to $168 in sizes XS-XL, is made from a renewable and bio-based fiber called EVO by Fulgar. And, according to Reformation's chief innovation officer Alison Melville, the product will only grow more sustainable with each seasonal drop (check out their most recent drop here!). The first range incorporated deadstock fabric from the brand's debut swimwear collection in 2019, and Reformation promises to \"continue innovating and trying out new materials until we create the most sustainable swimwear possible,\" according to Melville. Instantly attracted to the striking bikinis and one-pieces, PS editors were eager to get our hands on the swimwear designs, many of which were influenced by bestselling products across other categories. \"We designed Ref Swim to complement and round out our customers' existing Ref wardrobes,\" Melville tells PS. \"Throughout the design process, we were inspired by the concept of outfitting and looked to the silhouettes of some of our top performing apparel items to create complementary swim pieces.\" For example, the Bryson Dress is one of their most popular styles in 2025 so they carried the vibrant red color and the sweetheart neckline detail through in the Soleil Bikini Top. Melville confirms that the success of the drops has exceeded expectations, with solid colors being most popular - a trend that speaks to the Ref shopper's love for '90s minimalism. The Tossa Top (now out of stock), Azure Bottom, and Soleil Top were within the top five SKUs at the original time of publishing this story, and they just so happen to be three of the pieces we selected to try at PS. Ahead, you'll hear from four different editors about their experiences trying Reformation swimwear with one shared sentiment: the quality is in the fabric and the fit. Plus, we've added a couple more styles for you to shop from. Update on June 18, 2025 at 2:00 PM ET: Updated prices and checked stock for all products. @ps.feelgood Reformation's revamped swimwear might be giving the brand's dresses a run for their money, and we're here for it! The swimwear comes with new and improved sustainable materials. These four editors give a more in-depth review at our 🔗 in bio. #Reformation #Swimwear #Summer ♬ original sound - Popsugar",

    "description": "Your eyes are precious, so it’s important to keep ‘em as healthy and stylish as possible. On those supremely bright and sunny days, that means putting on a pair of trendy sunglasses to protect your delicate pupils from harmful UV rays, glare, dust — or paparazzi flashes when out with your digital camera friend.We know that the world of shaded eyewear can be overwhelming, with sunglasses coming in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and widths. That’s why we put together this mini guide to the best sunglasses to look out for, categorized by style, lens type, and activity — and with options for every budget. Whether you're looking for a pair of statement sunglasses for your next vacation, prescription glasses to give your eyes a rest from contacts, or colorful frames to match your wardrobe, there are plenty of options out there. We've even got you covered with polarized styles, sporty shades, and designs for wider faces. So, if one style doesn’t work for you, we guarantee there’s another pair of sunnies around the corner that will. Now, go forth and keep those rays at bay.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The Best Brands For Prescription SunglassesAs any glasses-wearer will know, shopping for a new pair of prescription sunglasses is a major decision. Not only are you committing to a pair of frames if and until your prescription changes, but it’s a choice that will cost you a pretty penny. This is why we’re such fans of Pair Eyewear, a brand all about choice and customization at affordable prices. You can choose from a variety of prescription frames — prices starting at $60 — and select from hundreds of customizable “tops”; aka magnetic, flat frames that cover the front of your glasses to instantly change their appearance. This means that using the same stylish frame as a base, you can switch seamlessly between eyeglasses and sunglasses, or between different colored and patterned options — ideal for matching your specs to your outfit! (There are also plenty of sunglasses-only options available, too.)If you have a higher budget, there are several other luxury brands always on our rotation: Ace \u0026 Tate, Warby Parker, and Cubitts offer chic, stylish frames within the $200 to $300 price range.Pair Eyewear The Payton, $, available at Pair EyewearWarby Parker Lupin, $, available at Warby ParkerCubitts Grimaldi, $, available at Cubittsace \u0026 tate Selma, $, available at ace \u0026 tateThe Best Brands For Polarized SunglassHeard of polarized sunglasses but are not sure of their benefits?
