    "description": "It’s worn by everyone from French mechanics to Harry Styles. What is it about the chore jacket that makes it so enduring – and can a modern version ever be truly authentic?Look around you and before too long you are likely to spot a chore jacket. I saw a particularly fine example on a dad last weekend at a heritage railway. As warm days stretch into still-cold evenings, beer gardens are full of them. They are worn down allotments and in towns, and I have a few in my own wardrobe. Because what began as everyday workwear for French factory employees more than a century ago has today become a wardrobe stalwart. You can even find chore jackets in the supermarket, with Sainsbury’s Tu and Asda’s George offering the cheapest – the simple design lends itself to mass production.They march across my Instagram feed, from workwear-inspired brands LF Markey, Folk or Uskees, down through high street stores such as Zara and John Lewis, as well as at hyper-expensive label The Row – your French machinist might have muttered a piquant “dis donc!” at its chore, with pockets too close together and a £1,500 price tag. The jacket has been worn by the likes of Brooklyn Beckham and Hailey Bieber, while Harry Styles is often seen in a version by SS Daley, the label inspired by British class tensions (and in which he has a financial stake).

    "description": "H\u0026M has been releasing exciting and showstopping designer collaborations for just over 20 years — the most recent collections being with Mugler, Paco Rabanne, and Rokh. The latest, however, marks a first for the brand: Partnering with a Polish designer, Magda Butrym, whom H\u0026M creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson calls an “emerging icon.”The Silesia-born designer and 2018 LVMH-prize finalist — known for her “signature blend of femininity, boldness, and intricate craftsmanship” — is celebrating her brand’s 10-year anniversary with an H\u0026M collection reinterpreting bestsellers like delicate 3D floral dresses and oversized structured coats, according to a press release. “It was great for me, as a designer, and my team to look back and see all the pieces that were loved by clients,” said Butrym at an H\u0026M conference.Roses are at the heart of this collection, as Butrym sees them as a “symbol of womanhood: both soft and confident, delicate and independent, arresting and ever-growing.” How poetic. It’s also intended to be a “celebration of femininity in bloom,” which couldn’t be any more apparent through the blooming catsuits, headscarves, and mini dresses (which model Vittoria Cerreti gave us a taste of), as well as the rosette-covered bodysuits, gowns, and heels.   “I really see this collection as a chance to invite people into our world — and to celebrate femininity, and the flower,” said Butrym in the release.  “When I design, I always think about these three words: Dreamy, romantic, Slavic,” she added at the conference.While the collection has a classic and timeless appeal, it also maintains Butrym’s modern edge — aka the thing that’ll make you stand out (err, bloom) from the crowd. Think: rosette denim corsets, rose-printed tights, and hat-headscarf hybrids. So, whether you’re looking for meticulously tailored outerwear, a sweeping sequin gown, or cozy matching sets, the H\u0026M x Magda Butrym collaboration has a mix of statement-making and casual styles that promise to elevate your spring outfit rotation. Click on to preview the H\u0026M x Magda Butrym collection.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-outfit-ideas-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: spring outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Dressing for a new season can be equal parts exciting and challenging. It’s an opportunity to store away some of the well-loved pieces you’ve been constantly re-wearing in favor of wardrobe staples you’ve maybe been ignoring, while also a challenge to navigate the changing of seasons and unpredictable weather. The creative part of your brain probably needs some time to adjust to the newness when actually planning outfits that are both fashionable and practical.That’s where we come in: We scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled through our Instagram feeds, searching for spring outfit ideas and inspiration. What we found were takes on some of the year’s budding trends — ruffles, oversized suits, leopard print, and more — that will have you in the mood for transitional-weather dressing. Ahead, find 23 looks worth adding to your moodboard this season. Spring Outfit Idea: Barrel Sleeves The barrel-leg trend is moving on up, resulting in air balloon sleeves on tops that will make a statement in any room you walk into. Spring Outfit Idea: Waistcoat A tailored vest or waistcoat will offer structure to any look, whether you style it with trousers, jeans, or warm-weather-ready linen. Spring Outfit Idea: Butter Yellow We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: Butter yellow is the sunny color trend for just about any occasion. Spring Outfit Idea: Chocolate Brown If you’d rather dress in a more subdued shade, chocolate brown is here to stay for another season. Add a dose of spring cheer by pairing it with light blue and casual sneakers, like seen here.  Spring Outfit Idea: Bright Suiting Who said office-appropriate outfits have to be boring? Push the edges of corpcore with suits in fun, cheery, spring-ready colors.Spring Outfit Idea: Soft Suiting  We understand if a highlighter-adjacent suit isn’t in your comfort zone — or if you’re not able to push the office dress code quite that far. Opt for less structured, more oversized suiting to add some softness to your 9-to-5 look. Spring Outfit Idea: Corpcore With a Twist A skirt suit is a classic springtime option. Take yours up a notch by going for more unconventional officewear-inspired pieces, like this cropped top with an attached tie.Spring Outfit Idea: Skirt Over PantsYes, this divisive trend has returned to the fashion week runways — and we say: go for it. We especially love the idea of double layering with a corset over a button-up top, as seen here. Spring Outfit Idea: Dress Over PantsAlternatively, how about a dress worn over a pair of trousers? Spring Outfit Idea: Mocha Mousse Neutral hues are in for spring, and there’s something that feels both comforting and luxe about this matching Mocha Mousse loungewear ’fit — just like the team at Pantone said there was when it was crowned the color of the year.Spring Outfit Idea: Pops of Color Monochromatic neutral may be the look of the season, but we wouldn’t deny the opportunity to add some color to our wardrobes. We love how the richness of the red handbag pictured here pops against the gray tones. Spring Outfit Idea: Capri Pants After reemerging last year, capri pants remained popular at London Fashion Week this past month. Whether you go for a wide-leg or more fitted pair, they give plenty of flexibility when it comes to getting dressed for transitional weather. Spring Outfit Idea: Frog Green Move over, brat green. A grassier, more subtle — yet still bold — frog green is on the rise for 2025, and it’s perfect for warm-weather dressing. We love the idea of wearing a pair of tights in the vibrant hue under a sheer skirt. Spring Outfit Idea: Leopard-Print Accessories Leopard print still isn’t going anywhere, but, this season, we’re taking a more subtle approach to the pattern, adding it to our outfits through spirited accessories like hats, bags, or shoes. Spring Outfit Idea: Lightweight Scarves Speaking of accessories, put the finishing touch on your outfits this spring with a thin, lightweight scarf to achieve instant Cool French Girl vibes. Spring Outfit Idea: Layering Sweaters Take your styling cues straight from the runways of New York Fashion Week by using your winter sweaters as spring accessories. Drape your favorite knits or cardigans over your shoulders, or tie them around your waist (or wherever else the mood may strike). Plus, it’s nice to have an extra layer handy for those crisper days. Spring Outfit Idea: Double Denim This season, we’re asking one very important question: Can you ever have too much denim? We’re leaning towards “no.” Expect to sport a bunch of double denim outfits — which can be customized to your own preferences, whether you prefer barrel-leg jeans, flares, dark washes, or anything else. Spring Outfit Idea: Tiered Dresses Our motto when it comes to picking out dresses to wear this spring? The more volume, the better. This long-sleeve white dress is the ideal place to start — the tiered skirt is full, but not too puffy, for those who prefer something slightly more understated. Spring Outfit Idea: Leather Jacket + Sleeveless Dress Break out your summer dresses a bit early by wearing a leather jacket (or any other go-to warm layer) over them. Spring Outfit Idea: Ruffled Blouse Take a classic outfit formula — white shirt plus jeans — and zhuzh it up with some ruffles. Thank us later.Spring Outfit Idea: Dressed-Up JumpsuitIt’s hard to go wrong with a pretty jumpsuit, but we especially love the flowy, exaggerated sleeves on this chocolate brown one. Spring Outfit Idea: Polo Sweater Polos and rugby sweaters are continuing to have their moment. Add a twist to the look with a colored collar (as opposed to the traditional white shade) matched to another piece of your outfit, like a pair of pants. Spring Outfit Idea: Midi Skirt + Boots Wearing a midi skirt with a pair of knee-high boots is an easy way to experiment with the balance and proportions of an outfit while also elevating the overall look.

    "description": "Magda Butrym is bringing her signature rose motif to H\u0026M with a collaboration of ready-to-wear, accessories, and jewelry, hitting HM.com and select stores on Apr. 24. It features some of the key wardrobe staples H\u0026M is known for - bomber jackets, mini dresses, fitted tops, one-pieces - all reimagined with Butrym's whimsical, romantic flair. Think a cocktail dress covered in roses to mimic a bouquet, clear sandals with floral heels, and a rose-print turtleneck-and-leggings set. As Magda Butrym is celebrating its 10-year anniversary this year, the H\u0026M collab features archival pieces which fans of the luxury brand will recognize. The beloved halter top, for example, is here with its iconic ruching and rose emblems featured on the bodice. \"Each piece brings its own sense of Slavic romance, while paying homage to the history of our brand,\" the designer said in a press release. \"I really see this collection as a chance to invite people into our world – and to celebrate femininity, and the flower.\" In the past, H\u0026M collaborations have included such iconic brands as Mugler, Rabanne, and Brock Collection. Notably, this partnership marks the first time the retail behemoth has collaborated with a Polish designer. Ahead, see our editors' honest thoughts about the new collection - and keep scrolling to see the full lookbook with pricing and get your shopping lists ready for the debut on Apr. 24.",

    "description": "Nik Bentel is the genius designer behind the TikTok-viral pasta bag (which he confirms is his bestselling item to date), and his wheels keep spinning - literally. The Nik Bentel RC Car Bag ($251, originally $295) launched in February and has already outpaced most of the brand's past product drops in terms of day-one performance, according to Bentel himself. \"It's definitely one of our fastest-moving designs,\" he jokes of the statement piece that's part handbag, part remote control car with four-wheel drive. \"What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved?\" Like most of his projects, this accessory is made to get you noticed, which is exactly why I was committed to taking it out on the town for dinner and drinks. Of course, I also love the fact that it's inspired by vintage toy cars, a nod to nostalgia I can definitely get behind. \"My inspiration tends to come from everyday objects that feel overlooked or oddly iconic - things we see all the time but don't usually imagine as wearable or collectible,\" Bentel says, naming Moschino and Chanel as brands that have a similar imaginative approach. \"With the RC Car Handbag, I was thinking about motion and creating a little chaos. What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved? That sparked the idea of taking a remote control car - something playful and nostalgic - and merging it with the functionality of a handbag. It became an object that turns sidewalks into runways.\" I wasn't surprised that the moment I sat down at a bar with my partner for cocktails al fresco on the first truly warm spring day, cheerful onlookers to my left and right begged me to send my bag in motion. They were close enough to notice the wheels and intrigued by the functional object. Needless to say, this was definitely Bentel's intention. \"People love the chaos of it! We've had people racing them in their offices, at galleries, and even just using them as shelf pieces,\" he says, continuing, \"Some carry it, some drive it - and some do both at once. The reactions are usually split between 'Wait . . . it moves?' and 'I've never seen anything like this.' It's been really fun to watch how people interpret and interact with it.\" In just two months, the RC Car Bag has become a beloved piece of art spotted on artists, influencers, and editors alike, from Kitty Lever and Taylor Quitara to Emma Orhun and now even me! Ahead, you can read my full review of the intriguing design and watch it in motion. About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag The bag is crafted from matte black genuine leather with mechanical wheels and a battery powered motor; handheld controller included. The remote control can power the car from up to 30 feet away at 9 mph. The wheels have silver rims and rubberized tread for drifting control. The bag measures 7.25\" x 3\" x 12.5\". AA batteries are included (standard and rechargeable). A limited edition quantity of 300 bags were produced for this project. There's an interior clasp to keep belongings secured, including the remote control while you're carrying it like a handbag. Each piece is handmade, with the bag and remote control weighing just over 1 pound together. What I Like About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag Obviously, this bag is a conversation-starter, which for me makes an accessory worth the splurge. The matte black colorway is versatile while the avant-garde structure of the bag is currently on-trend. Funnily enough, Bentel allowed the shape to be fully dictated by the car itself, or as he describes, \"almost like the bag was hijacking another object's identity.\" While this isn't necessarily a statement piece you'd wear to a wedding, it can complete many casual outfits from athleisure to jeans and a tee. I also love that the wheels are small and subtle - up-close, you can tell the style is much more than just a purse, but from across the room it might as well be any other coveted designer handbag on the market. Finally, all the pieces included are lightweight - the bag weighs 1 pound and 3 ounces when the remote control is stored inside - so it's not like you're lugging around a huge satchel. In fact, the bag and remote control together weigh a lot less than some of the other purses I own. What to Consider Before Buying the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag If you like to keep your belongings protected, note that this bag does not come equipped with any interior pockets and there's no secure closure aside from a thin snap tab that arches over the top. When the remote control is stored inside, there's also not much room for anything else. I personally carried two credit cards, some gum, and hand sanitizer and wouldn't have had room for my chunky keychain (luckily, I was out with my partner who had his own keys to get us back into the apartment). While currently marked down, the bag is also somewhat of an investment being that it's probably not appropriate for every occasion or event on your calendar. That being said, it's important to remember the thought-provoking and somewhat kitschy nature of Nik Bentel's viral pieces - they aren't exactly built for convenience, and that's sort of the point. For a similarly shaped bag without the eccentric twist (aka four-wheel drive), get the look with the Coperni Swipe Leather Top Handle Bag ($710), JW Pei Carly Saddle Bag ($67), Freja Mini Chrystie Bag ($268), Charles \u0026 Keith Perline Sculptural Top Handle Bag ($66), or Mas Laus Asymmetrical Shape Shoulder Bag ($390). Where Is the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag Available? The Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag is available on the brand's site. Rating Sarah Wasilak (she/her) is the associate director of PS Shopping.
