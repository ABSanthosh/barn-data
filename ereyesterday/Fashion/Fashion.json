    "description": "Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is estimated to cost women $2.5bn a yearMany shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same, just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s been a few seasons since Allison Bornstein’s wrong shoe theory — the idea that a surprising shoe choice can anchor a look — entered the social zeitgeist and took the fashion world by storm. While its intention was to encourage experimentation with footwear when the impetus strikes, there’s something about the upcoming crop of shoe trends that might have us calling on this nugget of sartorial wisdom on the regular.  The top styles emerging in 2025 offer an exciting look back on silhouettes we’d never thought would see a comeback. Case in point: the clunky-but-chic clogs revival (as seen at Chloé’s spring/summer 2025 show, as well as Hermès and Burberry runways), plus the improbable resurgence of the peep toe (ushered in by labels like Tory Burch, Miu Miu, and Acne) and the low-profile sneaker silhouette that’s finally unseated the Gazelle at Stella McCartney, Dior, and Loewe. So far, we have a healthy mix of polarizing, surprising and delightful, all at once. At the core of the styles that are defining 2025, though, is function — after all, it’s reasonable to expect you’ll be able to walk in them, albeit not always comfortably. Ahead, 2025’s top shoe trends, plus the exact styles we’re eyeing.  2025 Shoe Trend: Peep Toe One of the more divisive shoes on the rise, the peep-toe heel is making its triumphant return. It almost feels inevitable: After years of an early-aughts revival with low-rise pants, baby tees and butterfly clips, the footwear silhouette is the banner style at Tory Burch, Miu Miu, Prada, Acne Studios and Copenhagen Fashion Week darling Remain; it’s also been worn by the likes of Addison Rae and Amal Clooney. One thing’s for sure: We’ll be seeing a lot more of it soon. 2025 Shoe Trend: Transparency Coming on the heels of quiet luxury, see-through shoes of all kinds are no longer just a Disney princess’ dream. Glass, lucite, and otherwise transparent footwear is taking hold at Rabanne, Victoria Beckham, Giambattista Valli, and Gucci, the latter of which debuted a curved lucite wedge heel alongside its range of sneakers and loafers. Meanwhile, Brandon Maxwell’s iteration — a netted-upper flat — feels like a natural progression of the mesh shoe trend. 2025 Shoe Trend: Back-To-School Loafers How long does a style have to be relevant for its trend status to be revoked? Whatever it is, loafers are about a season away from cementing their status as a permanent, all-season favorite. This year’s take on the ever-chic shoe came in the form of platform brogues at Chanel, a cut-out iteration at Simone Rocha and two-tone Oxfords at Loewe. Willy Chavarria’s take boasts a knee-high sock, and there are still plenty of hosiery-and-loafer combinations that have yet to be seen. 2025 Shoe Trend: Boxing-Style Sneakers Some seasons tend to play to the fantastical, while others veer more practical. Adidas Gazelles have had more than a few seasons as the pragmatic sneaker du jour; now it’s time for something even more low-profile: the boxing sneaker.  The telltale marker of the tall sports shoe isn’t its lace-up ankle protection but rather its hyper-thin sole that allows for quick, agile feet. Labels like Miu Miu, Stella McCartney, Dior, Ann Demeulemeester, and Loewe all debuted similar, performance-minded styles. While those have yet to hit stores, Adidas reissued its Japan VH shoe, which also showed up at Caroline Hu’s spring 2025 presentation complete with floral embroidery and bow embellishments. Expect to see more and more similar styles crop up over the coming months. 2025 Shoe Trend: Reimagined Thong Sandals Brat summer ushered in many an unlikely trend but it also welcomed the resurgence of old favorites, like the ‘90s-era thong sandal. While Havaianas’ stock steadily rose, so did fashion’s interest in the easy-wearing, minimalist shoe. Designers like Tibi, Alaïa, Carven, and Sportmax reimagine the faithful silhouette — once marked by a foam sole and plastic upper — with a platform and triangle upper, each begging to find a home next to loose-fit suiting separates, pedal pushers or tiered maxi skirts. 2025 Shoe Trend: Nouveau Heel This trend lands right in the sweet spot between fantastical and practical. We’ve seen our fair share of nontraditional heels in seasons past but this year’s bunch feels even more creative. A bulbous, rock-hard clementine or a sleek, undulating wedge may seem like a bizarre (and squarely artful) thing to walk on but this new crop of heels often boasts a larger surface area, thereby increasing walkability. Tory Burch’s sculptural, curved heel made its way down the runway with ease, while Victoria Beckham’s chunky lucite heel is as sturdy as it is divine. 2025 Shoe Trend: Clogs A token of the bohemian aesthetic that took off in the early aughts around the same time Coachella became a household name, the lowly clog — which originated in 13th-century Amsterdam to protect the feet of farmers and workers — often gets a bad rap. These days, clogs take on a more towering, aesthetically grounded shape that, well, isn’t for everyone. Still, Chloé’s front-row stunt proved successful: Liya Kebede, Sienna Miller, Kiernan Shipka, Georgia May Jagger, and even Pat Cleveland showed up wearing the brand’s signature platform wedge clogs. Meanwhile, other labels like Burberry and Miu Miu put their own spin on the shoe. Resist the urge to wear them with a romantic, sweeping maxi and a wide-brimmed hat, and instead style them as you would a slingback for a truly modern take. 2025 Shoe Trend: All Tied Up Balletcore may be cooling off but something more romantic — and, dare we say, sexy — is bidding for its prime placement. Unapologetically chic, the tie-up shoe has its origins in the delicate trends that came before it. At Proenza Schouler, a round-toe sandal has strings that crisscross and gather at the ankle, while Ferragamo’s thong sandal-ballerina hybrid features true-to-form grosgrain ribbon up to the calf. Meanwhile, Ann Demeulemeester is holding onto the shoe’s ballet roots with a square-toe style laced up a thin-ribbed sock for a more performance-minded take. Like what you see?

    "description": "There's no doubt about it, Lewis Hamilton is a driving force in the world of fashion. The Formula 1 driver has become almost as famous for his love of bright, bold, and eccentric outfits as he has for his many championship titles, and there's no sign of him putting the brakes on his wardrobe choices anytime soon. With a number of races under his belt this season, Hamilton has regularly been spotted in the paddock wearing an array of looks that put him in first place in the fashion stakes. Notably, he did so before it became a trend among athletes as fashion pages dedicated to driver style like F1 Paddock Fits can attest. The 40-year-old has regularly discussed his personal style, which often includes a mix of emerging, diverse designers and pieces from larger fashion houses. In a previous interview with Vogue, Hamilton said: \"[F]ashion is about freeing yourself - it's about self-expression; it's about you; it's about slowly, over time, evolving and learning more about yourself and what you like and how you want to show up - how you want to be seen. What makes you feel great? It's a great feeling when you put on a piece of clothing and throw your shoulders back and are just like: I feel great today. That's what fashion does.\" Hamilton works with stylist Eric Mcneal; is conscious of the environmental impact of fashion; and is constantly striving to promote more diversity, both within motorsport and the fashion industry. He's cohosting the Met Gala in May 2025 and he's a fitting choice for the theme \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which celebrates the history and enduring impact of Black dandyism. When the famed driver attended the Met Gala in 2021, he used his platform to invite three emerging Black designers to his table (Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson, and Jason Rembert of Aliétte). He was also cast as the star of Valentino's Fall 2022 campaign, modeling Pierpaolo Piccioli pink alongside Zendaya, chosen for his influence beyond the race track. As he makes his bid to bag another championship this year, take a pit stop and scroll ahead for all the times Hamilton has turned the paddock into a runway.",
