    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Both awards season and Fashion Month are drawing to an end, which means leaving red carpet glam, eye-catching street style, and show-stopping runway looks in the rearview mirror.

Sabrina Carpenter is helping debut new Prada Beauty products, Refinery29-favorite brand Aligne is making its foray into bridal, and Glow Recipe is furthering its stronghold on the skincare-meets-makeup category with its latest cheek tints — and that’s just the start.

Designed to be versatile, bold, and tradition-skewing, the line is made up of four pieces that can be worn during or beyond wedding celebrations: a satin mini dress with bows on the shoulders, a peplum top with ribbon detailing, a satin mini dress with puff sleeves, and, of course, a tailored satin blazer that ties at the front.

The Australian designer’s eponymous brand has just dropped its first-ever collection of denim, and it includes 15 pieces for a range of occasions — think high-waisted straight-leg jeans, cinched dresses, oversized jackets with cocoon sleeves, and a denim blazer. “Denim has always been a staple in everyday wardrobes, and I wanted to create pieces that can be seamlessly integrated into our customers’ existing collections while still offering the signature sophistication and elevated style that they expect from the brand,” Vallance said in a press release.

Enter: Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush. The tinted cheek serum combines the rosiness of a soft blush with skin-boosting ingredients, like brightening and smoothing niacinamide and calming centella asiatica to hydrate skin, refine the appearance of pores, and impart a natural flush. Available in two shades — peachy Watermelon Flush and warmer Berry Flush — the formula is also buildable, so you can opt for a dewy and sheer look or a more pigmented finish. Shop now at Glow RecipeGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush, $, available at Glow RecipeZara x Style Not Com When Beka Gvishiani, founder of the mega-popular fashion Instagram account Style Not Com, was approached by Zara, he started the conversation by saying: “Let’s talk about fashion.” That phrase is now at the heart of the resulting Zara x Style Not Com collection, which takes the account’s signature cobalt blue hue and bold white text and splashes them across a variety of apparel. Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraK18 AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray Fed up with using multiple products in your hair care routine?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-outfit-ideas-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: spring outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Dressing for a new season can be equal parts exciting and challenging. It’s an opportunity to store away some of the well-loved pieces you’ve been constantly re-wearing in favor of wardrobe staples you’ve maybe been ignoring, while also a challenge to navigate the changing of seasons and unpredictable weather. The creative part of your brain probably needs some time to adjust to the newness when actually planning outfits that are both fashionable and practical.That’s where we come in: We scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled through our Instagram feeds, searching for spring outfit ideas and inspiration. What we found were takes on some of the year’s budding trends — ruffles, oversized suits, leopard print, and more — that will have you in the mood for transitional-weather dressing. Ahead, find 19 looks worth adding to your moodboard this season. Spring Outfit Idea: Bright Suiting Who said office-appropriate outfits have to be boring? Push the edges of corpcore with suits in fun, cheery, spring-ready colors.Spring Outfit Idea: Soft Suiting  We understand if a highlighter-adjacent suit isn’t in your comfort zone — or if you’re not able to push the office dress code quite that far. Opt for less structured, more oversized suiting to add some softness to your 9-to-5 look. Spring Outfit Idea: Corpcore With a Twist A skirt suit is a classic springtime option. Take yours up a notch by going for more unconventional officewear-inspired pieces, like this cropped top with an attached tie.Spring Outfit Idea: Skirt Over PantsYes, this divisive trend has returned to the fashion week runways — and we say: go for it. We especially love the idea of double layering with a corset over a button-up top, as seen here. Spring Outfit Idea: Dress Over PantsAlternatively, how about a dress worn over a pair of trousers? Spring Outfit Idea: Mocha Mousse Neutral hues are in for spring, and there’s something that feels both comforting and luxe about this matching Mocha Mousse loungewear ’fit — just like the team at Pantone said there was when it was crowned the color of the year.Spring Outfit Idea: Pops of Color Monochromatic neutral may be the look of the season, but we wouldn’t deny the opportunity to add some color to our wardrobes. We love how the richness of the red handbag pictured here pops against the gray tones. Spring Outfit Idea: Capri Pants After reemerging last year, capri pants remained popular at London Fashion Week this past month. Whether you go for a wide-leg or more fitted pair, they give plenty of flexibility when it comes to getting dressed for transitional weather. Spring Outfit Idea: Frog Green Move over, brat green. A grassier, more subtle — yet still bold — frog green is on the rise for 2025, and it’s perfect for warm-weather dressing. We love the idea of wearing a pair of tights in the vibrant hue under a sheer skirt. Spring Outfit Idea: Leopard-Print Accessories Leopard print still isn’t going anywhere, but, this season, we’re taking a more subtle approach to the pattern, adding it to our outfits through spirited accessories like hats, bags, or shoes. Spring Outfit Idea: Lightweight Scarves Speaking of accessories, put the finishing touch on your outfits this spring with a thin, lightweight scarf to achieve instant Cool French Girl vibes. Spring Outfit Idea: Layering Sweaters Take your styling cues straight from the runways of New York Fashion Week by using your winter sweaters as spring accessories. Drape your favorite knits or cardigans over your shoulders, or tie them around your waist (or wherever else the mood may strike). Plus, it’s nice to have an extra layer handy for those crisper days. Spring Outfit Idea: Double Denim This season, we’re asking one very important question: Can you ever have too much denim? We’re leaning towards “no.” Expect to sport a bunch of double denim outfits — which can be customized to your own preferences, whether you prefer barrel-leg jeans, flares, dark washes, or anything else. Spring Outfit Idea: Tiered Dresses Our motto when it comes to picking out dresses to wear this spring? The more volume, the better. This long-sleeve white dress is the ideal place to start — the tiered skirt is full, but not too puffy, for those who prefer something slightly more understated. Spring Outfit Idea: Leather Jacket + Sleeveless Dress Break out your summer dresses a bit early by wearing a leather jacket (or any other go-to warm layer) over them. Spring Outfit Idea: Ruffled Blouse Take a classic outfit formula — white shirt plus jeans — and zhuzh it up with some ruffles. Thank us later.Spring Outfit Idea: Dressed-Up JumpsuitIt’s hard to go wrong with a pretty jumpsuit, but we especially love the flowy, exaggerated sleeves on this chocolate brown one. Spring Outfit Idea: Polo Sweater Polos and rugby sweaters are continuing to have their moment. Add a twist to the look with a colored collar (as opposed to the traditional white shade) matched to another piece of your outfit, like a pair of pants. Spring Outfit Idea: Midi Skirt + Boots Wearing a midi skirt with a pair of knee-high boots is an easy way to experiment with the balance and proportions of an outfit while also elevating the overall look.

    "description": "If you were already toying with the idea of braving the naked dress trend, catching a glimpse of Halle Bailey and Emily Ratajkowski sporting the look at the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar party may just seal the deal for you. As someone who has thrown a birthday party for myself solely so that I could have a reason to wear a naked dress, I get it. When I scrolled past a reel of model Chloe Lecareux wearing Onarin's Ms. Hearts bustier and fishtail skirt a few months ahead of my birthday month, the wheels started spinning. By the end of the week, I had at least five different restaurants in mind and a guest list of my closest friends at the ready. Maybe it was the Taurus in me, but I was hell-bent on pulling off this set - and it was only after I ordered the look that I really began to process just how sheer the silk-chiffon fabric actually was. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet. \"Welp, I guess I'm trying this whole naked dress thing,\" I thought to myself as I pulled up Commando's site to track down the right underwear. In preparation, I placed an order for the classic control thong and shaping brief, unsure just how cheeky I might go in this decidedly revealing, ultrafitted ensemble. The Stolen Stores team assured me that the retail site's in-house made-to-measure team would develop a personalized size for me, so the co-ords would fit me just right. But at the end of the day, they were still see-through. People were going to see my underwear, and I was probably going to feel pretty naked. Truthfully, I thought this all to be a fun, timely experiment, especially since the naked dress trend has become standard among celebrities and mere mortals alike. Sheer fabrics are a common detail, and I think there's something to be said for having the confidence to show off your body - however much or little you like. When the Onarin pieces finally arrived, I abandoned my doubt and slipped into the outfit, only to find that both separates were a little snug. (Quick tip: if you're already thinking about ordering the set, add an inch to your usual measurements upon placing your order.) Luckily, the exchange for a new, customized size was coordinated in more than enough time for my birthday dinner. I was excited to deliver the shock factor; to bravely show off my curves when I hit the street the way celebrities do on the red carpet.
