    "description": "The high-couture styles of the film version of the hit show reflect a trend of designer daring on the stageMusicals used to be associated with glee club kids more likely to be wearing jazz shoes than anything cutting edge from the catwalks. But with the film version of Wicked – which was released this weekend and was expected to take more than $100m (£80m) at the US box office alone – promoted by global pop star Ariana Grande and actor Cynthia Erivo ­wearing Vivienne Westwood, Schiaparelli and Louis Vuitton, musicals are having a pitch-perfect style moment.Even before it opened, there was a glut of Wicked collaborations across skincare, haircare and hoodies – more than 400 in total, including Gap, Kipling, Crocs, H\u0026M, Claire’s Accessories and Marks \u0026 Spencer. Fancy London department store Liberty, with its tasteful Tudor-beamed building, has teamed up with Universal Pictures to make over its windows Wicked-style. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Madfabulous explores story of flamboyant 19th-century marquess of Anglesey, and offers an ‘overdue celebration’ of his lifeIt’s the costume drama plot with the startlingly up-to-date twist: the fifth marquess of Anglesey, a scandalously extravagant, cross-dressing peer of the realm, who cavorted around north Wales in the late 19th century, now has his own biopic – and it is a tribute he surely would have relished. The makers of Madfabulous, which has just filmed on location in Anglesey (Ynys Môn), believe their starry version of his extraordinary story is an overdue celebration of the non-conforming aristocrat, born Henry Paget and nicknamed “Toppy”.Revealing details of the opulent new film for the first time this weekend, the director Celyn Jones said the germ of the project was the moment when he came across a photograph of the flamboyant Paget dressed in one of his elaborate outfits – and then Jones noticed the date: “I looked at the photo again, checked Henry’s story and thought: hang on this is 1890 – and in Anglesey!” Continue reading...",

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While we're still a little over a week out from 2024's biggest shopping day, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that span the entire month of November and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans. Regardless of what you're in the market for, you can save big on it right now. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best early Black Friday fashion deals. Looking for something specific?

    "description": "You can never have enough pairs of comfortable and stylish jeans, and as shopping editors, we're always on the hunt for the best ones. TikTok has been obsessed with Abercrombie's assortment of jeans for quite some time. In fact, the brand gained a whole new crop of fans and admirers after they spotted the brand's Curve Love straight jeans on Francia Raísa's character in \"How I Met Your Father.\" Even our editors are fans of the brand's wardrobe essentials and the new NFL collection, both of which pair beautifully with the brand's denim lineup. If you want to try these fan-favorite jeans for yourself, we curated some of the top styles you need in your closet. Standout denim styles include the editor-backed '90s straight jeans and mom jeans. The Curve Love collection is also on sale and it has an additional two inches at the hips and thighs, giving you a comfortable yet figure-flattering look that hugs your curves in all the right places. Each pair comes in a variety of washes and designs, too. Whether you're in the market for a crisscross waistband or a distressed look, the list ahead includes all the latest denim trends. These styles also accommodate height with length options ranging from extra short to long. Ahead, you can shop our favorite denim shorts and timeless jeans from Abercrombie. Some washes and styles are on sale too, so stock up while you can!",
