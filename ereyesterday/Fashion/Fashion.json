    "description": "I'm trying to be more mindful about how and where I spend my money these days, while also making a conscious effort to support Latine entrepreneurs, creators, and business owners as often as possible. Latine fashion designers and clothing brands are not something we hear about often, but they exist and are out here making some seriously stylish and thoughtful clothing. There was definitely a time when even the idea of buying clothes, shoes, and accessories from a Latine-owned shop, let alone created by Latine designers, wasn't even on the radar, largely because representation was severely lacking. But now, we know that sometimes in order to support each other, we have to do a little digging and find those small businesses ourselves. And celebrities are getting in on the fun, from Mariah Carey in Flor de Maria heels to Blue Ivy Carter carrying a Ciriaco leopard print bag at the Super Bowl.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If 2024 was defined by leopard print, 2025 will be the year of cow spots. Let us explain. Last fall, Google searches for “cow print” hit a peak, perhaps because of the Western fashion comeback for the last several seasons. All of a sudden, there was more cow-print outfit inspiration on our Pinterest feeds, plus more cow-print clothing and accessory options in retail. (I personally wore a calfhair top-handle bag and cow-print Mary Jane flats for NYFW.) With festival season and Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour on the horizon, we only expect for it to become even more mainstream. Don’t get us wrong, leopard is still and will forever be going strong (see: the Fall/Winter 2025 NYFW collections and most recent Fashion Month street style). But we’re also seeing loads of faux fur, snakeskin, zebra stripes, and other animal patterns. Cow prints, though, might be the most playful and youthful one of the bunchWe’ve scoured the internet for the best pastoral-inspired fashion on the market — cow-print shoes, bags, jackets, dresses, and jeans — so you can get ahead of the trend. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Shoes The easiest way to sport such a bold print is through accessories, since they can make a big statement on a smaller scale. We also found that shoes make up the most cow-printed fashion on the market — from rustic cowboy boots and chic kitten heels to preppy chunky loafers and bold running sneakers — making it extra easy to step into (get it?!) the trend. You can even choose between vegan printed fabrics or genuine calf hair styles with furry textures. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Bags We’re seeing many mini, shoulder, and top-handle cow-print bags, both bold black-and-brown patterns and small spots. I personally own two cow-print top-handle purses and find them to be as wearable and versatile as leopard ones. (And, no, they don’t err too Western.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Jackets No, you don’t have to be a cowboy to confidently walk around in a cow-print jacket. There are several sleek faux fur coats and shearling vests boasting the pattern that are perfect for the winter, as well as many playful denim jackets for transitional dressing. We predict that the latter will especially be popular throughout festival season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Dresses Slip into a dress covered in an all-over cow print this spring, because go big or go home, right? Whether you opt for a flirty mini, classy midi, or slinky maxi dress, you can style this statement piece with complementary black and brown accessories, or treat the spotted print like a neutral and add pops of color. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cow-Print Jeans Much like how leopard-print jeans exploded in popularity, we think cow-print denim will be all the rage in 2025. Again, there’s a large range of colors and sizes, as well as both realistic and cartoonish renderings of the pattern. You can find them across fits, from skinny and straight to barrel-leg, and wide-leg. Style them with a matching printed jacket, or keep your top half simple with a solid that lets your pants shine.

    "description": "For decades, A-listers have glammed up for the Golden Globes, turned out for the SAGs, and pulled out almost all the stops for the Grammys. But the mother of all award shows is the Oscars, where the all-star Hollywood glamour is always on full display.From couture gowns to custom-made looks, the Oscars red carpet at the Oscars showcases the best, most unforgettable fashion, from Audrey Hepburn's white Givenchy dress in 1954 to the Dior gown Jennifer Lawrence wore to accept her Academy Award in 2013. It has also given us  outfits that pushed the limits of what’s considered formalwear: Take, for example, Sharon Stone's 1998 Gap-shirt-and-Vera-Wang-skirt combo or Ariana De Bose's Valentino crop top-and-pants look, which she paired with a long train, in 2022.While we patiently wait for this year’s Oscars — happening this Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, FYI — we’re brushing up on our Academy Awards fashion history with a trip down memory lane. Ahead, reminisce over the best Oscars red carpet looks of the past few decades, according to our fashion team. Audrey Hepburn, 1954It never took much to make the late Audrey Hepburn look glamorous, but in this Givenchy gown, Hepburn, glowing from winning an Oscar for Roman Holiday, is nothing short of perfection.Photo: NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images. Grace Kelly, 1955Designed by arguably the most famous costumer in history, Edith Head, Grace Kelly's Oscars look was, like most of her outfits, an absolute winner.Photo: Silver Screen Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images. Madonna, 1991Dripping in Old Hollywood glamour, this Bob Mackie ensemble was a feast for the eyes, featuring sparkle and fur aplenty.Photo: Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images. Winona Ryder, 1994Who doesn't love a Gatsby-esque gown at the Oscars?Photo: Ron Galella Collection/Getty Images.Elizabeth Hurley, 1995Head-to-toe white Versace? Sweetheart neckline? Floor-length sequins? Check! Check! Check!Photo: Jim Smeal/WireImage/Getty Images. Winona Ryder, 1996While we're used to seeing '90s-era Winona Ryder donning all black, it was an unexpected surprise to see her in this champagne-colored vintage gown.Photo: Jim Smeal/WireImage/Getty Images. Courtney Love, 1997The queen of grunge got all dolled up by Versace for the 1997 Academy Awards — and we support it 100%.Photo: Jim Smeal/WireImage/Getty Images. Sharon Stone, 1998When it's combined with Vera Wang and draped on Sharon Stone, it's hard not to be convinced that Gap belongs on the red carpet. Photo: Mychal Watts/WireImage/Getty Images. Celine Dion, 1999A woman wearing a suit on the red carpet is hardly surprising in 2025. But, in 1999 — and styled backward — well, let's just say our minds were blown upon seeing Celine Dion in this John Galliano set.Photo: SGranitz/WireImage/Getty Images.
