    "description": "Nightdresses are set to follow pyjamas out of the bedroom as daywear, with sales up on the UK high streetIn the first episode of Lena Dunham’s new Netflix sitcom Too Much, viewers might be taken with cameos from Dunham, Jessica Alba and the model Emily Ratajkowski, or the burgeoning romance between Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe. But – as far as fashion is concerned – it’s nighties that have a starring role.Early in the episode, Stalter wears a short frilled red nightie, with her dog in a matching design. Later, she wears a white frilled floor-length design, and it’s clear the item is something of a signature. If it’s a cute quirk for a character, it’s also in line with wider trends.

    "description": "Time to sign out of your Work Bag, sling a straw basket bag over your shoulder and feel your pulse slow downIs there any point putting an out of office on your emails when you go on holiday any more? “I won’t have access to emails.” Yeah, right. Sorry, you aren’t fooling anyone: no one goes on holiday without their phone in 2025. Your office know perfectly well that if you don’t answer emails, they can still reach you by text or direct message. Even, theoretically, by actually calling you, although obviously that won’t happen because that’s another thing that no one does in 2025. Tweak your out of office message as much as you like – you might as well stick your fingers in your ears.No, the best way to set your brain to holiday mode is by signing out of your Work Bag. Swapping the bag you take on your daily commute for a free-and-easy alternative is more effective as a psychological gear change than logging out of your emails. In day-to-day life, I change handbags as rarely as possible, the potential for leaving keys in an inside pocket and getting locked out being just too real. But when you get home after work and you aren’t going back for a week or two, there is something very pleasing about marking that moment by throwing away leaky pens, marvelling at how you managed to accumulate 14 hairbands, and then shaking the bag over the bin and feeling disproportionately thrilled when a pound coin falls out. Stashing the bag – with your office pass inside – is very out of sight and out of mind. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" may be over, but we're still digesting it all. After all, the show ran every day - except for Wednesdays - since its premiere on June 3, and each nearly two-hour episode showcased some of the worst (and best) of what America's current dating pool has to offer. The series has even left us with a slew of aftermath moments to hold us over until the season's Aug. 25 reunion, from embracing the beauty of being a sensitive gangster like Amaya Espinal to fan-favorite couple Nicolandria trekking to Disneyland. Another item to stoke the post-Love Island obsessive madness? Iris Kendall's boy shorts. After entering the villa as a bombshell in episode nine, the Los Angeles-born star proved to be one of the most enduring islanders, as she diligently explored multiple connections before making it to the final four with partner Jose \"Pepe\" Garcia. Kendall's style is another element we're reflecting on, but not for the reason you think. Naturally, she wore many looks that reflected the carefree California vibe (like bikinis and frilly dresses), but her pajama wardrobe was especially impressive. As islanders got ready for bed each night, fans quickly noticed that Kendall often wore the Skims Soft Smoothing Seamless Boy Short ($22) and the Skims Fits Everybody Lace Short ($24) - and for good reason. Not only are they super lightweight, but they're constructed with high-quality cotton and nylon that provides full coverage and a confidence-boosting silhouette. They even range from size XXS to 4X, making them accessible for all. @megannicklas Give me all of them @SKIMS @Iris Kendall 🤭🧚‍♀️🖤 immediately ordered #skimsboyshorts #loveislandusa #irisandpepe4life ♬ Iris - Goo Goo Dolls To no one's surprise, the affordable bottom has gained TikTok approval, with many users flocking to the Skims website to get the Iris Kendall look for themselves. Between their great quality and budget-friendly price point, purchasing these boy shorts is only right - whether you're a \"Love Island USA\" fan or not.

    "description": "If there's any celebrity you can count on to nail any and every aesthetic, trend, or fad, it's Lady Gaga. The Grammy-winning singer is completely unabashed when it comes to taking risks in her artistry as a whole, but her style, perhaps most of all, knows no bounds. Of course, we all remember her iconic outfit for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards - a dress, hat, boots, and purse made entirely out of raw beef, designed by Franc Fernandez. The look garnered so much attention that it was listed by Time as the top fashion statement of that year (and it has its own Wikipedia page!). Fast-forward to present day, and the artist born Stefani Germanotta is still crafting her own lane of style as she promotes her latest album, \"Mayhem,\" which she'll be taking on the road starting in July. Apart from the otherworldly visuals, surrealist dance routines, and captivating vocals, you can expect Lady Gaga's tour outfits to deliver just as much drama for us to be inspired by for years to come. In true Gaga fashion, she's created mind-blowing visuals to accompany the album's most major hits, like \"Abracadabra.\" In the video, we see the singer's limitless sartorial abilities even more, namely a custom Samuel Lewis x Suman Gurung x Ilona lace ensemble accompanied by a stiffened, dramatic collar and tiered train - giving us firsthand inspiration for the tour. In case Elizabethan-inspired clothing isn't exactly your style, you can take notes from Gaga's previous eras while planning your concert look. Think exaggerated denim and embellished accessories inspired by her \"Marry the Night\" video, or loud, leopard looks like the jumpsuit she wore in her and Beyoncé's boundary-pushing anthem \"Telephone.\" And if you can't make a strict decision on which Gaga-approved aesthetic to channel, we've done the legwork and rounded up the best concert outfit ideas for you to shop. From gaudy jewelry to dramatic denim from favorites like Nordstrom and Revolve, these are the best Lady Gaga-inspired fashion finds to get for The \"Mayhem\" Ball.",

    "description": "As of June 21, the sun has officially moved into its Fourth House (where it will stay until July 22) and, naturally, Cancerians (including me) are thriving. The universe has aligned to center the qualities that define the water sign: beach days are abundant, Love Island continues to generate heat post-finale, and the current trend cycle is all about aquatic motifs.  If you were to combine this season’s buzziest fashion trends, the resulting ensemble would resemble the world’s chicest aquarium. Sardine motifs are everywhere, clam diggers are trending, and virtually every sandal on the market has been topped with bubble-like metallic orbs.  The presence of these glitzy baubles can be traced back to the runways of Tory Burch and Khaite, when the two designers introduced metallic embellishments into their respective collections — Khaite, via its studded Benny Belt and Elena Bag, and Burch through the viral Pierced Mules. Individually, each of these styles inspired countless duplications and new iterations. Together, their widespread popularity influenced brands across the board, eventually culminating in the oceanic shoe trend we’re seeing today.  Today’s adornments boast a three-dimensional, spherical shape, giving shoes an overall air of ethereal effervescence. The look is bubbling up in every corner of the footwear space — from Paris Couture Week runways to your local shopping mall — and is shoppable at every possible price point. Here are the most stylish styles.  Sandals With Organic Metal Embellishments While some baubles currently trending are perfectly symmetrical, certain shoemakers have chosen to embrace embellishments with more natural-looking, organic shapes. Options may resemble a sea-smoothed pebble or a hammered-textured button. The subtle detail furthers this trend’s earthy undercurrents, giving wearers that Chloé-chic, boho look that’s likewise trending. Sandals With Orb Toe Toppers It’s a toe-forward summer in more ways than one, and this look plays directly into those themes. One of the season’s most prevalent sandal styles features reflective marble-like spheres affixed to a lone strap, giving the illusion of an oversized toe ring. Though they all have this element in common, silhouettes run the gauntlet — from delicate and strappy to chunky slides and beyond. Sandals With Spherical Heels Though these orb-like additions are typically used as the proverbial cherry on top, some sandals utilize the detail in more minimalistic ways. If you’re shopping for an understated interpretation (say, for work), consider shoes with spherical heels. Styles still retain that distinct, fresh-from-the-sea feel, but in a much more inconspicuous way. Strappy Sandals With Metal Detailing A good pair of strappy sandals can get you through every wedding, grad party, and backyard barbecue of the summer. These metallic-detailed styles provide the same versatility as their more minimalist counterparts, but with a posh, metallic component. It’s a small detail that makes a considerable impact.  Like what you see?

    "description": "Move over Love Island, there’s another group of heartthrobs taking over our screens. The third season of The Summer I Turned Pretty (based on the novels by Jenny Han) has launched on Amazon Prime, with two episodes released so far — and we’re fully tangled in the web of its love triangle. Who will Belly (played by Lola Tung) choose in the end? Whether you’re team Conrad (Christopher Briney) or team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), we’re all team TSITP. So, of course, we want to proudly show off our adoration for the characters. Luckily, several brands (including Gen Z-approved and Refinery29-reader favorites) have recently released TSITP fashion collaborations. From Finch College polo tops and daisy bag charms to infinity symbol rings and nautical bikinis, there are plenty of references to the series. So whether you’re looking for kitschy, on-the-nose details or subtle nods to the character’s wardrobes, the five collaborations below (most of which are available on a dedicated Amazon storefront) will fill your heart.Read on to shop preppy, breezy, and romantic jewelry, shoes, swimwear, and more to have yourself an East-Coast-beach-town-coded summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Coach x The Summer I Turned Pretty Collab Coach has been on the bag charm train for a while, and it’s continuing to release new viral designs, like TSITP-exclusive ones. From sentimental daisies and infinity symbols to seashells and peaches (foreshadowing a scene from the third book), the charms are equally chic and versatile, effortlessly complementing any summer outfit (and that can only be eagle-eyed by avid fans). You can even shop limited-edition versions of the Tabby and Dinky bags with charms attached, plus (nearly sold-out) Coachtopia styles. Shop full collection at Coach and Amazon DashDividers_1_500x100 American Eagle x The Summer I Turned Pretty Collab Following a successful 2023 collaboration, American Eagle is back with its new TSITP collection. Entitled “Belly’s Closet,” the first drop features tons of preppy gingham, argyle, and stripes as well as dainty florals, eyelet details, and ruffles that could easily be worn by Belly. Several styles have sold out — including ones with graphics of Cousins Beach, Whale of a Tale, and Team Conrad — but you can still get your hands on a bunch of pieces, including pajama sets. Plus, more drops and new styles will be coming soon, so keep your eyes open and your credit card close by. Shop full collection at American Eagle DashDividers_1_500x100 Steve Madden x The Summer I Turned Pretty Collab Step into your favorite character’s shoes (literally) with Steve Madden’s TSITP-inspired collections, curated to reflect some of the main characters’ styles. We’re particularly drawn to Belly’s and her best friend Taylor’s shoe selections, which don’t venture into the kitschy merch category. Check out the trendy platform sandals, gingham mesh flats, kitten heels, and velcro sneakers — even if you’re not playing volleyball like the duo. Shop full collection at Steve Madden and Amazon DashDividers_1_500x100 Catbird x The Summer I Turned Pretty Collab Catbird loves a collaboration, and its latest for TSITP is a love letter to the whimsical fictional world.
