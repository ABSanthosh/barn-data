It’s a vibe, not just a trend, meaning it takes tectonic rumblings in culture and gives them expression in what we wear and say and drink and watch on TV.Boom boom is a new weather system that is sweeping away pretty much everything we thought we knew about modern fashion (gender fluidity, quiet luxury, elevated basics, ethical brands) and replacing it with ambitious power dressing for day, and traditional tropes of feminine and masculine sexual allure for evening. It is fur (real or fake), gold watches, big hair, wearing ties, sexy dancing. It is a silhouette that has inflection points at the shoulders (big), the breasts (important) and the waist (tiny) instead of worshipping a peachy bum or flat abs. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Whether you’re looking for a last-minute Mother’s Day find, a graduation gift, or are hoping to treat yourself to a new accessory, Coach has tons of fresh styles to take you through the warm-weather months ahead. From bestsellers in updated fabrications and colorways to recent launches (like the Twisted Tabby and the Jet), the brand’s new arrivals section is stacked with statement-making options. Coach touches on several spring handbag trends like breezy, slouchy silhouettes and retro east-west styles. There’s also a focus on more playful designs like butter-yellow shoulder bags and nostalgic bag charms. And you can’t escape the denim craze, because the brand continues to elevate its popular styles with the classic fabric. Below, shop some of our favorite Coach handbags and charms to upgrade your everyday and evening wear looks this spring and summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 East-West Bags The east-west bag has made its comeback, and Coach has jumped on the retro-inspired baguette trend. From oblong bodies (like the Jet Shoulder Bag) to extra-long straps (on the Swing Zip Bag), these new Coach finds are great for elevating spring outfits, especially in the bright white and bubblegum pink colorways. DashDividers_1_500x100 Butter Yellow Bags We can’t help but smile when seeing people drenched in butter yellow clothing and accessories. The trending color is joyful and playful but chic, and now you can own a Coach bag in the new “Moonlight” colorway. For an everyday look, opt for a hobo silhouette or a curved zip-up style. For a night out, consider the iconic Tabby style in its new “twisted” design or a slim shoulder bag. DashDividers_1_500x100 Slouchy Shoulder Bags A slouchy bag is an effortlessly cool style you need in your closet. One viral style in particular — the Brooklyn Bag — is a key silhouette, and it just became spring-ready with a new “Bluebell” color. From durable canvas and polished pebble leather to trendy suede, Coach’s casual-yet-chic, slouchy styles are perfect for day-to-night wear. DashDividers_1_500x100 Denim Bags Preparing for festival season or the Cowboy Carter tour? Consider sporting a Coach denim bag (an editor favorite) for a pop of Western flair or a bold denim-on-denim look. The brand has given its popular crossbodies and shoulder bags the denim treatment through nostalgic patchwork and logo-covered designs that are begging to be shown off. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bag Charms Last spring, bag charms skyrocketed in popularity, and this spring, the quirkier they are, the better. Coach’s newest bag charms are nostalgic (think: iconic NYC symbols) and foodie-approved (lemons and pretzels). The brand also sells them in curated charm clusters or as bundles paired with a bag to get an all-in-one look. Shop all new Coach handbags Like what you see?

    "description": "Long gone are the days of fashion having strict rules. Many trends have come and gone and resurfaced again, from outlandish styles like the skirts-over-pants look of the 2000s to more practical aesthetics like the Sofia Richie-inspired quiet luxury. Of all the popular styles of the moment, we can't seem to escape the no-pants trend. While in the past, it was rare to step out without pants, celebrities have shamelessly and successfully produced several style moments that exclude the wardrobe essential. The 2025 Met Gala proved it's okay not to wear pants (once again), from Sabrina Carpenter's tuxedo bodysuit to Helen Lasichanh and Lisa's sheer monogrammed tights - all Louis Vuitton ensembles.Image Source: Getty While this trend is currently enjoying a moment in the spotlight, going pantless got popular as early as 2012. Miley Cyrus was among the first to try the bold styling method at the Billboard Music Awards that year, wearing a white Jean Paul Gaultier blazer with black-and-white striped heels. More stars eventually caught on, wearing oversize tops and jackets to give off the no-pants illusion throughout the years, from street style to Met Galas past - including Rihanna, Hailey Bieber, and Lizzo, just to name a few. Whether you're feeling a bit risqué or are inspired by this year's Met Gala red carpet, we've rounded up some of the best pieces to shop for your no-pants era, from sheer tights to bodysuits. And while you're at it, scroll through some of our favorite celebrity takes on the trend throughout the years.",

    "title": "Kylie Jenner and Halle Berry Hit the Met Gala in Naked Dresses - Shop the Trend Here",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/sheer-trend-49440961",
    "description": "The 2025 Met Gala brought a slew of trends for us to gawk over (and raise eyebrows at) from durags and pinstripes to no-pants ensembles. Although this year's theme, \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which highlights Black Dandyism, was far too specific to miss, some stars took the standard approach with sheer dresses. For what seems like the umpteenth year in a row, many industry figures donned the trend in all different silhouettes, from Kylie Jenner's gray-and-black custom Ferragamo ensemble, to Halle Berry's vagina-baring dress by LaQuan Smith. While sheer dresses were ever-present during fashion's biggest night, the look isn't exactly new. It's most popularly referred to as the \"naked dress\" trend, which is beloved by celebrities for not only many Met Galas past - from FKA Twigs's bejeweled co-ord in 2024 to Beyoncé's sequin gown in 2015 - but every major red carpet. Throughout the years, they've graduated from your average see-through slip to ensembles adorned with revealing details. From cutouts with sheer overlays in full-coverage dresses to see-through catsuits, the sheer trend is clearly here to stay. And of course, we've gathered some of the best sultry styles that will help you nail it. From understated dresses that feature subtle sheer moments to figure-flattering pieces that leave little to the imagination, these picks will work for every style, shape, and occasion. Whether you're headed to a much-needed girls' night out or gathering looks for your bestie's tropical bachelorette, we have options just for you. And in case you're on a budget, we've got you covered with offerings as low as $20. From an unconventional take on the LBD to sheer pants for your warm-weather evening soirées, shop our top sheer finds ahead.",
