You likely already figured this out, as having a pet is a major part of, if not their whole personality. I say this because that’s very much me: My life revolves around two 11-lb. Chihuahuas that I would do anything for, and the gifts I’m most excited to receive are those that are either for them or about them. (Their sweater collection is way better than my own, I must admit.) So, I’ve curated some of the most delightful products on the market right now for the dog owner, cat owner, or simply animal lover on your shopping list.   All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While 2024's biggest shopping day is still a few days away, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that span the entire month of November and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans. Regardless of what you're in the market for, you can save big on it right now. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best early Black Friday fashion deals. Looking for something specific?

TikTok has been obsessed with Abercrombie's assortment of jeans for quite some time. In fact, the brand gained a whole new crop of fans and admirers after they spotted the brand's Curve Love straight jeans on Francia Raísa's character in \"How I Met Your Father.\" Even our editors are fans of the brand's wardrobe essentials and the new NFL collection, both of which pair beautifully with the brand's denim lineup. If you want to try these fan-favorite jeans for yourself, we curated some of the top styles you need in your closet. Standout denim styles include the editor-backed '90s straight jeans and mom jeans. The Curve Love collection is also on sale and it has an additional two inches at the hips and thighs, giving you a comfortable yet figure-flattering look that hugs your curves in all the right places. Each pair comes in a variety of washes and designs, too. Whether you're in the market for a crisscross waistband or a distressed look, the list ahead includes all the latest denim trends. These styles also accommodate height with length options ranging from extra short to long. Ahead, you can shop our favorite denim shorts and timeless jeans from Abercrombie.
