    "description": "Show dips into lucrative holiday market with butter-yellow, lilac and gold lamé outfits reflecting beauty of the backdropChanel has a fresh-faced, avant garde new designer but it still stands for classic glamour. This was the loud and clear messaging at the first Chanel show since Matthieu Blazy took up his role. The show was held at Villa d’Este, the Lake Como palace hotel where Elizabeth Taylor, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich holidayed and which Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed The Pleasure Garden there, pronounced the most beautiful place on earth.The location, booked a year in advance, provided the theme: life in a grand hotel. Think White Lotus on Lake Como, art directed by Slim Aarons. First on to the pebbled catwalk weaving through the hotel’s terrace was a white bathrobe-style coat. Then there were capri pants in the butter yellow of the hotel parasols, and a lilac tweed suit to match the wisteria trailing overhead. Models swung tote bags big enough for pool towels, while gold lamé cover-ups glinted as dazzling as sun on the lake. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Charity shops won’t take them. Councils incinerate them. Retailers dump them on the global south. We’re running out of ideas on how to deal with our used clothes – and the rag mountain just keeps growingIn February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury’s. A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be shipped overseas or incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffield all general waste is incinerated as ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as damaging to local air pollution as burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "Heading off on a trip and don’t know what to wear? Whether you’re venturing to the airport, the train station, or in the car, one thing’s for sure: Comfort is non-negotiable. Sure, trusty leggings and cozy sweats are MVPs, but, sometimes, you want to look a little more “effortless jet-setter” and a little less “just rolled out of bed.” Enter: travel pants. When curating our list of the best travel pants, we held them to sky-high standards: They needed to be versatile enough to wear straight off the plane and into whatever adventure awaits, comfy enough for the bizarre yoga-esque positions you’ll find yourself in while attempting to sleep on a long-haul flight, and stylish enough to pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe (and avoid the dreaded overpacking guilt). Bonus points to pants with practical perks like wrinkle resistance, technical fabrics, and — the holy grail — pockets.Meet our 27 favorite travel pants below. Once you experience the magic of sweat-wicking, breezy, and polished bottoms that don’t scream “athleisure overload,” we promise you’ll never look back.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

    "description": "Some collaborations set off a frenzy — and Gap x Dôen’s first drop was one of them, selling out before you could even hit “add to cart.” Now, the two brands are back with a second collection of breezy, summer-ready staples that are sure to go fast.Both labels joined forces last year for what became a wildy successful collaboration, so it only makes sense that they’d return for a second. “We were overwhelmed by the excitement and success of our first collection with Gap,” said co-founder and CEO of Dôen, Margaret Kleveland, in a press release. “Our second collaboration blends the effortless femininity and timeless style of both brands, while celebrating the incredible community that has shaped Dôen.”The campaign imagery features some of Dôen’s muses, specifically the women who served as supporters, according to the release. This time around, the collection marks a first: The introduction of menswear, including summer-ready poplin and eyelet shirts. Plus, there are seriously precious baby and toddler styles, so the whole family can coordinate. “The second collection of California vintage-inspired classics celebrates timeless femininity,” the release states, in “an ode to both brands’ effortless and easy dressing, introducing new silhouettes and prints.”From reimagined denim staples to coastal essentials, the collection stands out with idyllic takes on nautical colors, gingham prints, airy eyelets, and elevated blue-jean washes. Whether you’re in the market for a nostalgic spring dress or an easy matching set, these designs will have you planning your next weekend picnic or seaside getaway. The 38-piece Gap x Dôen collection will be available globally online and in select Gap stores starting May 2 at 12 p.m. EST. (Gap cardmembers can shop early via the app on May 1.) Like what you see?

    "description": "Magda Butrym is bringing her signature rose motif to H\u0026M with a collaboration of ready-to-wear, accessories, and jewelry, currently on sale at HM.com and in select stores. It features some of the key wardrobe staples H\u0026M is known for - bomber jackets, mini dresses, fitted tops, one-pieces - all reimagined with Butrym's whimsical, romantic flair. Think a cocktail dress covered in roses to mimic a bouquet, clear sandals with floral heels, and a rose-print turtleneck-and-leggings set. As Magda Butrym is celebrating its 10-year anniversary this year, the H\u0026M collab includes archival pieces which fans of the luxury brand will recognize. The beloved halter top, for example, is here with its iconic ruching and rose emblems featured on the bodice. \"Each piece brings its own sense of Slavic romance, while paying homage to the history of our brand,\" the designer said in a press release. \"I really see this collection as a chance to invite people into our world – and to celebrate femininity, and the flower.\" In the past, H\u0026M collaborations have included such iconic brands as Mugler, Rabanne, and Brock Collection. Notably, this partnership marks the first time the retail behemoth has collaborated with a Polish designer. And while most of the products are sold out, you can check your local H\u0026M for further shopping. Ahead, read our editors' honest thoughts about the new collection - and keep scrolling to shop our favorite pieces from the Magda Butrym x H\u0026M collab.",

    "description": "When it comes to shopping for that \"perfect\" swimsuit, it can seem like a daunting challenge to browse every brand and site across the internet. But thankfully, we've done the hard work for you and have rounded up a few of our favorites ahead. Firstly, you'll want to think about your personal swimsuit requirements. While you want something that's flattering, stylish, and comfortable (we love a one-piece for this reason), you also want one that will make you feel your very best. Most of the time, that comes down to fit, and not all suits are made the same. To help you find a style that you'll be excited to pack for your next vacation, or any time you find yourself relaxing by the water, we enlisted Kalani Miller, swimwear expert and cofounder of Mikoh, for expert recommendations on the year's biggest swimwear trends, along with what shoppers should consider when scoping out the best swimsuit for their body type. What to Consider When Shopping Out the Best Swimsuit For Your Body Type For Miller, finding the perfect swimsuit starts with honing in on the exact occasion she's shopping for. \"When I'm shopping for a new suit, I always like to think of where I am wearing it the most - is it a girls' trip? A romantic getaway? Or a family vacay with your in-laws? From there, I let it guide what styles and coverage I gravitate to,\" she explains. As far as finding the best swimsuit for your body type or frame, Miller believes that confidence is key and recommends that shoppers experiment with as many different types of silhouettes and structures as possible. \"Make sure to try on lots of different cuts - skimpy, full-coverage, high-waisted. You never know what will look best until you give it a go, and you may be surprised to find a new silhouette can quickly become your favorite,\" she says. What Types of Swimsuits Are Trending For 2025? If you're looking to find a more seasonally relevant style that'll tap into the year's biggest swimwear trends, Miller also notes that there are plenty of fun options to play around with this year. \"Earthy neutrals, pops of blue, and poppy orange prints are here to stay. This season, we're seeing silhouettes with sleeves and multi-use pieces,\" she explains. With all of Miller's expert recommendations in mind, we curated a guide to the perfect swimsuits for every type of frame and build, including the best swimsuits for curvy women, the best one-piece bathing suits, and a variety of other choices that range from sultry bikinis to fun monokinis. Regardless of the piece you're looking for, these styles will surely end up in your shopping cart.
