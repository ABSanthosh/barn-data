In reality, there is no such thing that can be grouped under one name; there are only themes or regional concentrations. North Africa tends to favour a one-piece – a gallabiya, kaftan or head-to-toe swaddle of cloth. Sub-Saharan Africa is less categorisable, with bold prints and waxy or stiff material in west Africa, white linen in east Africa and intricate beadwork in the south. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paige-desorbo-summer-house-fashion-brand-daphne?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Over the last seven years on Summer House, the reality TV star Paige DeSorbo has become known for her distinctive fashion sense, quick-witted one-liners… and her love of the bed. Following DeSorbo’s departure from the Bravo show, which she announced in an Instagram Story post on Thursday, the host of the Giggly Squad podcast (which she runs with former castmate Hannah Berner) is not planning on changing her ways. “It’s such a bittersweet feeling because I am truly so grateful to Summer House,” DeSorbo tells Refinery29. “It sounds so cliche, but I’m so excited to spend more time with my family this summer, and not have a schedule, and wake up late, and not worry that anyone’s mad at me that I’m still in bed.” Now, more than ever before, she has a reason to stay horizontal: On June 10, DeSorbo is launching her loungewear brand Daphne.  Even after a sold-out Radio City Music Hall Giggly Squad tour and How to Giggle: A Guide to Taking Life Less Seriously becoming a New York Times best-selling book, DeSorbo calls the 12-piece sleepwear label, which she started designing a year and a half ago, the “peak” of 2025 for her: “Coming out with a clothing line has been something I’ve wanted since I was like five years old.” Created in partnership with Concept Brands and named after her beloved cat — “she’s our president, CEO, and founder, and she has mandatory naps during the day, and we love her for that” — Daphne (the brand) is made up of sleep-to-street pieces like matching sets, shirting, and bottoms ranging from poplin pants to shorts. View this post on Instagram A post shared by PAIGE DESORBO (@paige_desorbo) “I got a lot of inspo from pajamas from my childhood. I had this one pair of pajama pants for like 15 years, and they ended up becoming capri pants. And so we came out with a capri pant situation,” says DeSorbo. “There are so many times where I have pajamas on and I’m like, ‘I’m hot, but I don’t want to wear like a short short. I want a comfortable long short, but like I don’t want to look like a cobbler’s apprentice.’” Some of the other pieces from the line, which starts from $58 and goes to $230, include a sleeveless top with ties on the side that pairs back with the poplin pants — “I had a top like that when I was younger, and I just wore it all summer” — and a thigh-grazing T-shirt named “Hannah” in an homage to Berner who during COVID-19 pandemic, according to DeSorbo, would “wear the same T-shirt every single day.” “I was like, ‘We’re all going through a time, it’s fine,’ but I just started thinking about how, when you get one really good T-shirt, that’s all you want to wear. I spray tan a lot, so my spray tan T-shirt is very important to me. And I also just love wearing a big T-shirt and not having to put pants on. And I like a getting-ready T-shirt. I like a morning T-shirt. Maybe you’re going out to the pool, and you’re not trying to put a cover-up on, and you’re just like, ‘I need a T-shirt,’” DeSorbo says. “Of course, we wanted to make our pajamas cute and like you can wear them out, but a true bed rotter knows: It doesn’t matter what you’re wearing as long as you’re comfortable.’” DeSorbo looked to her own past experiences with loungewear and closet needs when designing the collection. “After going to the Hamptons for so many summers, I was thinking about pajamas in the summer and going and staying at someone else’s house,” she says. “I wanted loungewear and pajamas that were functional for sleeping obviously, but also, if you woke up late and you had to go to the kitchen, you looked presentable.” That said, she also kept her community at the forefront of her mind. “Hannah and I are so connected to the Gigglers. It truly does feel like we started this like sorority-slash-cult [laughs], so when I was designing and coming up with Daphne, it was for them. Every piece we came up with, I was like, ‘But will the Gigglers wear this, and where are they wearing it, where are they going?’ So I was really creating a story for them,” she says. “The line is for them.”  A true bed rotter knows: It doesn’t matter what you’re wearing as long as you’re comfortable. Though DeSorbo would love to see it go beyond her fandom: “If I saw Victoria Beckham out in the poplin pink pant with a little kitten heel just like doing whatever she’s doing in London, I think I would pass away.” While the initial drop is a tight edit — “I was like, ‘If it’s not exactly what I want, we can’t put it out’” — DeSorbo is looking at future Daphne offerings that could even include SKUs outside of the loungewear space. “I see us having more options or different clothing things, but, for right now, I think the loungewear is perfect for me,” she says. “For the fall, I want to get more cozy, comfy sets.” In addition to embracing Daphne, those who are currently mourning DeSorbo’s departure from Summer House should take solace in the fact that she is not leaving without spreading the gospel of bed rot, following a season that included a “Snoozefest” party and a bed-inspired Reunion set. “Years ago, I could never understand people hating on the bed. It still hasn’t clicked in my brain. Nothing bad has ever happened to me whilst lying in my bed. So I’m happy people are catching on. I can’t believe it took so long.” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Right in time for festival season, the fashion icon herself, Kate Moss, is collaborating with Zara (who are celebrating 50 years) for The Festival Collection. Following the success of the supermodel’s first Studio 54-inspired collaboration in 2024, these rock ’n’ roll styles reminiscent of her Glastonbury days are sure to excite everyone when they drop on June 9.Moss, who designed the collection with long-time stylist Katy England, was inspired by “some of her most favorite festival pieces, including styles from thrift stores of small-town America to the most elevated boutiques of Paris and Milan,” according to a press release. Think: sparkly mini dresses, embroidered vests, biker boots, and stacked bangles.Speaking on these limited-edition pieces, Moss says: “Nothing matches the feeling of finding a one-off piece. Just wow. The piece that only you own.” And while others may cart up the same item from the collection as you, the nostalgic designs feel exclusive and help you stand out from the crowd thanks to the supermodel’s inimitable style.The womenswear collection — which is modeled by Moss’ equally cool daughter, Lila Moss — will feature everything from flowy blouses and lace matching sets to androgynous silk suits and go-go boots, with prices ranging from $25 to $400. Meanwhile, the menswear collection was designed by Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie — Moss’ friend and England’s husband. Moss spoke about Gillespie’s influence on her own collection, explaining: “I expected it to be more about wafty dresses. But it’s a bit tougher than that. That’s because all the masculine energy was coming in from Bobby doing his collection at the same time […] We ended up going somewhere quite unexpected that I didn’t think we would.”As you plan your festival outfits, mark June 9 to shop the collection online and in select stores. Whether it’s a statement belt or moto jacket, Kate Moss x Zara promises to bring your ’90s off-duty supermodel dreams to life. Shop all Zara Like what you see?

    "description": "In our opinion, boots are a great footwear option year-round. We love that we can wear them with everything from jeans to skirts to shorts and even jorts -even in the summer, when it's blisteringly hot, having a closed toed shoe at a concert, bar, or event can be a lifesaver. While the Western-inspired boot has been popular for some time now, this season, we're going full cowboy boots, and we couldn't be more excited about it. These boots are statement-making yet surprisingly wearable, and frankly, they'll make you feel like a badass. Because there are a lot of options out there, we've narrowed it down to these 12 top pairs of cowboy boots. These are our favorites on the market; some are short, some are tall, some are neutral, and some are printed, but they're all going to add a cool touch to any look. We're eyeing a black cowboy boot we can wear everywhere, a pink cowboy boot that's fun and whimsical, and a white cowboy boot that we can wear all summer long. We're already dreaming of all the outfits we can create with these fun boots (hello, Cowboy Carter). Just keep reading to shop our picks!",

    "description": "Reformation is a brand that's hard not to know. The sustainable Los Angeles-based fashion label is adored by the likes of Kendall Jenner, Meghan Markle, and Taylor Swift - along with countless others, including PS editors, and most likely, you. The brand's repertoire isn't known for just one thing. While its dresses are the ultimate fan-favorite, Reformation's influence stretches far beyond that, with must haves in every category, from tops and bottoms to footwear, accessories, jewelry, and even the bestselling, '90s-inspired Cary jeans. But with price tags that mostly land in the three dollar sign-range, a full Reformation shopping spree isn't always realistic. That's why we're all about choosing the right pieces and why we've curated this guide to the brand's bestsellers for every Reformation lover, new or seasoned. Ahead, we've rounded up the 15 best Reformation pieces to consider coveting for fall, from everyday dresses that'll take you from the office to happy hour and wedding guest dresses to tops that are perfect for layering. We even included options at a range of price points, along with PS editor favorites, styles in trending prints, and more. Keep scrolling to shop our selects.",
