You get It model Alex Consani as the star of Aritzia’s newest campaign. The Canadian retailer just released its spring workwear collection, which has the 2024 model of the year leading the campaign as an office siren.Consani gets down to business in a corporate ‘80s-esque setting, dressed in Aritizia’s work staples like statement blazers, striped button-downs, baggy trousers, and trench coats. According to a brand statement, Consani takes on “different office personas with a playful twist like “Big Boss,” “Secretary,” “IT”, and more.”Whether you work a corporate office job or not, the collection delivers modern work wardrobe staples that are professional but certainly not stuffy. From relaxed work pants and slim cigarette pants that can be dressed up or down to mini skirts and dresses that can be styled for day or night, these spring styles are versatile enough to wear in and out of the office. For proof, see Consani in mini shorts, capri pants, and a bomber jacket. The collection predominantly features Aritizia’s in-house brand Babaton, which is known for its tailoring. Some standouts include new iterations of iconic styles — like the double-breasted Slouch Coat (a personal favorite), “carrot”-shaped Prospect Pant, and belted paperbag Industry Short — reimagined in the brand’s (Re)ssential stretchy yet structured fabric. Babaton’s signature dresses — like the crewneck Priestly and fit-and-flare Bond mini dresses plus the crepe Futurist midi dress — are also showcased in the workwear collection. There are also lightweight, office-appropriate high-neck tops, cardigans, and vests from Babaton and Wilfred, a “romantic-leaning knits” in-house label. The spring workwear collection’s pieces range from $78 to $325, and are available to shop online now. Shop full Aritzia Work Wardrobe Like what you see?

Whether you’re overwhelmed by the number of places to shop or trying to hone in your personal style, come along as we explore ‘fits, fabrics, styling potential, and more by sorting through the virtual and IRL shelves at our go-to shopping destinations.  If you’re a Nordstrom fan (as many Refinery29 readers and editors are), you likely know that the retailer has several in-house “Nordstrom Made” brands. Around for nearly 40 years, BP. started as a juniors label, and now offers gender- and size-inclusive clothing and accessories. Open Edit serves trend-forward styles that can also easily blend into your existing wardrobe. Treasure \u0026 Bond has laidback, vintage-inspired clothing made for casual outings. Caslon has mature, relaxed, and effortless staples. Activewear brand Zella is designed with performance and comfort in mind. And, of course, there’s Nordstrom‘s namesake line, which offers up fashion-forward wardrobe building blocks.With spring around the corner and my wardrobe in need of transitional-weather staples and spring workwear outfits, I recently went to the NYC flagship store to check out the retailer’s in-house selection. While browsing through the new arrivals, I was intrigued by the spring outerwear and skirts from Open Edit, classic button-downs and trousers from Caslon, and dresses and denim from Nordstrom, so I put together looks from these three brands. Ahead, see my favorite spring must-haves from each. DashDividers_1_500x100 Nordstrom New Arrivals From Open Edit Open Edit’s trend-forward styles wound up being my favorite styles out of the three in-house Nordstrom brands I tried. There were quite a few matching skirt sets, including this plaid cropped blazer and mini skirt that I ended up loving. I’d wear this look with a pair of sheer black tights to the office to make it more work-appropriate.There was no shortage of staple tops, including a crewneck tank (seen in top photo) and a long-sleeve boatneck bodysuit that I styled under a dress coat that could easily transition from the office to the bar. I also loved the funnel neck top (under a blazer here) that I could wear to work on any given day, styled with any oversized sweater or jacket.If you prefer longer skirts, Open Edit has a versatile silky maxi that comes in a range of colors and a faux leather midi skirt (top photo). I’ve never thought that a fitted skirt with a front seam would look good on me, but this style was so flattering and became a favorite of mine during this haul (plus it comes in metallic silver if you want a party look). Shop all Open Edit new arrivals DashDividers_1_500x100 Nordstrom New Arrivals From Nordstrom Made Nordstrom brand has the widest selection of wardrobe staples. I felt elegant in this sleeveless maxi dress; the fitted top cinched my waist to create a nice line and beautifully billowed out to a flowy skirt (which, bonus, has roomy pockets). Despite being full-length, the fabric is light enough to wear throughout the confusing transitional-weather months as well as summer.After finding out that Nordstrom is branching into denim for the first time, I was excited to try a pair of trending flare jeans. I wasn’t disappointed: They fit great, and the standard length wasn’t too long on my 5’3” frame, which would save me a trip to the tailor. While I’d usually opt for a lighter denim wash for the spring, these darker jeans work well in an office setting. Shop all Nordstrom Made new arrivals DashDividers_1_500x100 Nordstrom New Arrivals From Caslon I found Caslon’s offering to be more mature and modest. While the brand’s styles weren’t my personal favorite — I initially hoped to try Treasure \u0026 Bond, which wasn’t available in the store at the time — they’re definitely office-approved. From several button-downs and lightweight sweaters to tailored blazers and trousers, there are many solid staples (that also come in plus sizes).After initially having my eye on the sweet embroidered cotton button-down, which wasn’t available in my size, I tried a knit button-down which seemed like a better fit for colder weather than spring. That said, I liked the striped linen pants that would look just at home at the office as a seaside staycation, as well as the olive chinos, which are a nice alternative to the more traditional black dress pants. Shop all Caslon new arrivals DashDividers_1_500x100 While I didn’t get to test out other Nordstrom in-house brands in person, I perused the online assortment and found even more spring styles. Treasure \u0026 Bond’s new arrivals, like floral maxi dresses and pastel quilted jackets, look ready to take on casual spring events. Likewise, BP.’s cropped cardigans and butter yellow skirts will get you excited to ditch your coats. And if you’re looking to update your workout wardrobe, Zella styles, which have been vetted by R29 editors, include soft and stretchy activewear in spring-ready colorways.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/cuyana-easy-tote-editor-review-48904560",
    "description": "Tiny handbags, be damned - this season is all about bold totes that are big enough to carry your entire life in. And as someone whose closet is chock-full of clutches, crossbody bags, and a number of other compact purse styles, I have very mixed feelings about the trend. But if there was ever a handbag that might sway my loyalties, I knew it would be the Cuyana Easy Tote ($268) - a standout piece from the luxury, ethical brand behind some of today's most polished fashion essentials. In all truth: I've had my eye on Cuyana's chic tote offerings for a while now (thank Meghan Markle for that!). So naturally, when I heard that Cuyana was planning to do a major makeover on its handbag and tote stock, my interest was immediately piqued. After all, this was the same brand beloved and religiously worn by celebrities like Jessica Alba and Angelina Jolie. Any collection revamp would have to rival some of the designer's cult-favorite styles like the (now defunct) Classic Structured Leather Tote, all while still staying true to Cuyana's reputation for timeless elegance. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to take Cuyana's popular bag style, the Easy Tote, for a test-drive before the product's debut. I'll admit: even as a fan of the brand, I was wary about whether the style could live up to the hype of the luxe designer's other, more staple bags. But so far, Cuyana's new Easy Tote has managed to do the impossible - make a tote believer out of even the most adamant mini-bag loyalist: me. The bag has been my greatest accessory companion over the past few weeks - and I have an inkling it will continue to be my go-to long after, too. Read on for my honest review of Cuyana's Easy Tote style. About the Cuyana Easy Tote The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop in two styles: a classic, horizontal Easy Tote and a Cuyana Tall Easy Tote ($268). The Easy Tote comes in eight different colors, including cappuccino (my bag of choice), caramel, black, and stone. The style is also available in a handful of fresh, seasonal colorways that include daffodil yellow, indigo, and ecru. This particular style is Leather Working Group (LWG)-certified, which affirms that the bag's leather is tanned in an environmentally responsible way. What I Like About the Cuyana Easy Tote Even upon first wear, you can tell the tote is built to last - a theme that's consistent with most all of Cuyana's product inventory. The bag is crafted from a lightweight, pebbled Italian leather that's designed to soften with each wear - making it a chic and comfortable style that's perfect for the long haul. The tote is also astonishingly lightweight - so much so that Cuyana has even marketed it as being the brand's \"lightest bag ever.\" As someone who has had some time to take the product for a spin, I can confirm: it really does live up to the airy hype. I'm notorious for carrying a lot of stuff with me wherever I go - whether it's to the gym, airport, office, and beyond, I always have plenty of my own daily essentials in tow. As a result, I've historically had to rely on bulky, heavy, and downright inconvenient totes to keep all of my handbag must haves organized. But thanks to Cuyana's Easy Tote, I get the space of a deep and chunky tote, all without any of the hassle or added weight. I suspect this is in part due to the tote's minimal design, which avoids cliché bag buffers like synthetic lining or bulky hardware. More than anything, I just love the timeless elegance of Cuyana's Easy Tote. The relaxed style boasts more of a squishy, breathable feel that's simple, stylish, and, best of all, subtle. Statement handbags and purses might be popular nowadays, but like most trends, it's difficult to predict whether they'll remain relevant in the next season. With the muted design of the Cuyana Easy Tote, I have no doubt that the bag will be a sophisticated and polished staple in my closet for years to come. What's Worth Noting The tote features a double-handbag design, which aims to create a more streamlined look, allowing users to easily switch between carrying the bag by hand or by shoulder. Initially, I was concerned that the shorter straps might look cluttered or even feel suffocating on my arm when I opted to hold the bag on my shoulder. Fortunately, the straps are flexible and can easily be pushed down into the tote when needed, all without causing damage or creases. While I wasn't immediately sold on the strap design, I've come to see the appeal - especially since it's like getting two bags in one. Another thing to note are the minimal storage compartments. The tote features a single, large hanging wall pocket on the interior, which is the perfect size for holding your phone, cardholder, or go-to lipstick or any other valuables you might need on hand. Personally, I don't mind that the bag has only one storage pocket - when it comes to totes, the simpler the design, the better. That being said, if you are someone who relies on having more structure or organized spaces in your bag, it's certainly something to be aware of and maybe it's worth purchasing a handbag organizer to go with it. Who Is the Cuyana Easy Tote Best For? Some people mark the beginning of a new chapter in their life with a fresh hairstyle or other grown-up investment. Others celebrate it by splurging on a new Cuyana handbag. I, like so many other fans of the luxury brand, prefer the latter - which is why I'd say this Cuyana tote is perfect for anyone looking for a timeless bag they can take anywhere and carry through any season. The deep style boasts plenty of interior space that's capable of holding everything from a school binder and work laptop to a reusable water bottle, wallet or cardholder, travel beauty bag, staple pair of sunnies, and so much more (even all at once!). Whether you're a grad student looking for a chic bag for school, a corporate worker in need of a practical tote to carry to and from the office, or just someone hoping to add a more relaxed style to your wardrobe, the Easy Tote encompasses the ideal, go-anywhere bag that will help you feel polished and supported in any season. Where Is This Cuyana Tote Available? The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop exclusively at the brand's website.
