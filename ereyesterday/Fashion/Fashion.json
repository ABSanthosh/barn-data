    "description": "It’s worn by everyone from French mechanics to Harry Styles. What is it about the chore jacket that makes it so enduring – and can a modern version ever be truly authentic?Look around you and before too long you are likely to spot a chore jacket. I saw a particularly fine example on a dad last weekend at a heritage railway. As warm days stretch into still-cold evenings, beer gardens are full of them. They are worn down allotments and in towns, and I have a few in my own wardrobe. Because what began as everyday workwear for French factory employees more than a century ago has today become a wardrobe stalwart. You can even find chore jackets in the supermarket, with Sainsbury’s Tu and Asda’s George offering the cheapest – the simple design lends itself to mass production.They march across my Instagram feed, from workwear-inspired brands LF Markey, Folk or Uskees, down through high street stores such as Zara and John Lewis, as well as at hyper-expensive label The Row – your French machinist might have muttered a piquant “dis donc!” at its chore, with pockets too close together and a £1,500 price tag. The jacket has been worn by the likes of Brooklyn Beckham and Hailey Bieber, while Harry Styles is often seen in a version by SS Daley, the label inspired by British class tensions (and in which he has a financial stake).

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-outfit-ideas-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: spring outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Dressing for a new season can be equal parts exciting and challenging. It’s an opportunity to store away some of the well-loved pieces you’ve been constantly re-wearing in favor of wardrobe staples you’ve maybe been ignoring, while also a challenge to navigate the changing of seasons and unpredictable weather. The creative part of your brain probably needs some time to adjust to the newness when actually planning outfits that are both fashionable and practical.That’s where we come in: We scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled through our Instagram feeds, searching for spring outfit ideas and inspiration. What we found were takes on some of the year’s budding trends — ruffles, oversized suits, leopard print, and more — that will have you in the mood for transitional-weather dressing. Ahead, find 23 looks worth adding to your moodboard this season. Spring Outfit Idea: Barrel Sleeves The barrel-leg trend is moving on up, resulting in air balloon sleeves on tops that will make a statement in any room you walk into. Spring Outfit Idea: Waistcoat A tailored vest or waistcoat will offer structure to any look, whether you style it with trousers, jeans, or warm-weather-ready linen. Spring Outfit Idea: Butter Yellow We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: Butter yellow is the sunny color trend for just about any occasion. Spring Outfit Idea: Chocolate Brown If you’d rather dress in a more subdued shade, chocolate brown is here to stay for another season. Add a dose of spring cheer by pairing it with light blue and casual sneakers, like seen here.  Spring Outfit Idea: Bright Suiting Who said office-appropriate outfits have to be boring? Push the edges of corpcore with suits in fun, cheery, spring-ready colors.Spring Outfit Idea: Soft Suiting  We understand if a highlighter-adjacent suit isn’t in your comfort zone — or if you’re not able to push the office dress code quite that far. Opt for less structured, more oversized suiting to add some softness to your 9-to-5 look. Spring Outfit Idea: Corpcore With a Twist A skirt suit is a classic springtime option. Take yours up a notch by going for more unconventional officewear-inspired pieces, like this cropped top with an attached tie.Spring Outfit Idea: Skirt Over PantsYes, this divisive trend has returned to the fashion week runways — and we say: go for it. We especially love the idea of double layering with a corset over a button-up top, as seen here. Spring Outfit Idea: Dress Over PantsAlternatively, how about a dress worn over a pair of trousers? Spring Outfit Idea: Mocha Mousse Neutral hues are in for spring, and there’s something that feels both comforting and luxe about this matching Mocha Mousse loungewear ’fit — just like the team at Pantone said there was when it was crowned the color of the year.Spring Outfit Idea: Pops of Color Monochromatic neutral may be the look of the season, but we wouldn’t deny the opportunity to add some color to our wardrobes. We love how the richness of the red handbag pictured here pops against the gray tones. Spring Outfit Idea: Capri Pants After reemerging last year, capri pants remained popular at London Fashion Week this past month. Whether you go for a wide-leg or more fitted pair, they give plenty of flexibility when it comes to getting dressed for transitional weather. Spring Outfit Idea: Frog Green Move over, brat green. A grassier, more subtle — yet still bold — frog green is on the rise for 2025, and it’s perfect for warm-weather dressing. We love the idea of wearing a pair of tights in the vibrant hue under a sheer skirt. Spring Outfit Idea: Leopard-Print Accessories Leopard print still isn’t going anywhere, but, this season, we’re taking a more subtle approach to the pattern, adding it to our outfits through spirited accessories like hats, bags, or shoes. Spring Outfit Idea: Lightweight Scarves Speaking of accessories, put the finishing touch on your outfits this spring with a thin, lightweight scarf to achieve instant Cool French Girl vibes. Spring Outfit Idea: Layering Sweaters Take your styling cues straight from the runways of New York Fashion Week by using your winter sweaters as spring accessories. Drape your favorite knits or cardigans over your shoulders, or tie them around your waist (or wherever else the mood may strike). Plus, it’s nice to have an extra layer handy for those crisper days. Spring Outfit Idea: Double Denim This season, we’re asking one very important question: Can you ever have too much denim? We’re leaning towards “no.” Expect to sport a bunch of double denim outfits — which can be customized to your own preferences, whether you prefer barrel-leg jeans, flares, dark washes, or anything else. Spring Outfit Idea: Tiered Dresses Our motto when it comes to picking out dresses to wear this spring? The more volume, the better. This long-sleeve white dress is the ideal place to start — the tiered skirt is full, but not too puffy, for those who prefer something slightly more understated. Spring Outfit Idea: Leather Jacket + Sleeveless Dress Break out your summer dresses a bit early by wearing a leather jacket (or any other go-to warm layer) over them. Spring Outfit Idea: Ruffled Blouse Take a classic outfit formula — white shirt plus jeans — and zhuzh it up with some ruffles. Thank us later.Spring Outfit Idea: Dressed-Up JumpsuitIt’s hard to go wrong with a pretty jumpsuit, but we especially love the flowy, exaggerated sleeves on this chocolate brown one. Spring Outfit Idea: Polo Sweater Polos and rugby sweaters are continuing to have their moment. Add a twist to the look with a colored collar (as opposed to the traditional white shade) matched to another piece of your outfit, like a pair of pants. Spring Outfit Idea: Midi Skirt + Boots Wearing a midi skirt with a pair of knee-high boots is an easy way to experiment with the balance and proportions of an outfit while also elevating the overall look.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "From The White Lotus to Summer House, it’s hard to miss all the warm-weather and vacation-ready fashion that’s been on our screens. And it’s inspiring us to upgrade our own spring wardrobes, especially while many of us have just done our annual closet cleanouts. So if you’re realizing that you may need a spring dress (or two) to round out your warm-weather outfits, look no further than the trends taking over the season.There are plenty of styles (many of which we saw during Paris Fashion Week) worth experimenting with. Think everything from nostalgic bubble hems and playful drop waists to joyful butter yellow and timeless polka dots.So, whether you’re in need of an everyday must-have to wear to the office, a flirty style for date nights, or a special-occasion dress for spring weddings and parties, take inspiration from the trending styles below. DashDividers_1_500x100 Milkmaid Dresses Whimsical and nostalgic, milkmaid dresses are a go-to style for frolicking through fields… or any other spring activity. Usually defined by puff sleeves, corseted bodices, ruffled straps, and smocking, the breezy silhouette is a fan-favorite for celebrities and TikTok influencers alike. It’s also been reimagined from a casual, rustic style to one that can be worn to the office or weddings. DashDividers_1_500x100 Denim Dresses Whether you’re heading to a backyard party, country festival, or brunch, a denim dress is an easy and versatile staple for casual outings. And since there’s a wide range of lengths, silhouettes, and denim washes on the market, the classic style has been refreshed for 2025. Opt for a casual button-down mini, a drop-waist maxi, or anything in between. DashDividers_1_500x100 Butter Yellow Dresses After its surge in popularity last year, butter yellow is back in full force this spring. That’s especially evident in the spring dress lineups from our favorite brands. Pick from casual minis, versatile midis, and tried-and-true maxi slip dresses for every type of occasion, from Mother’s Day to wedding season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Drop-Waist Dresses Drop-waist dresses made their return last year when the European summer aesthetic was all the rage. Luckily, they’re not going anywhere this season, from stretchy-cotton midis to taffeta-like gowns. If in doubt, look to V-shape waists and dipped hip details rather than harsh seams to dip a toe into the trend. DashDividers_1_500x100 Polka Dot Dresses Whether you want to channel Julia Roberts’ brown horse race ensemble in Pretty Woman, or Marilyn Monroe’s white number in The Seven Year Itch, throw on a polka dot dress to create your own cinematic look. This spring, stick to classic black-and-white color palettes for a timeless look, or neutrals like navy and brown for a more minimalist take on the print. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bubble Hem Dresses As playful as it is versatile, the bubble hem provides a maximalist (yet still wearable), nostalgic touch to dresses. While bubble hem skirts have had their time in the spotlight, we’re looking at full-blown bubble hem dresses now. And since they’re predicted to be a defining trend of 2025, there’s no better time to try it out. For spring, look out for warm-weather-approved fabrics, like linen and crisp cotton poplin. Plus, details like smocked bodices and airy open backs. DashDividers_1_500x100 Floral Dresses Yes, florals are a perennial staple, but it’s impossible to ignore the bolder iterations being scooped up by shoppers this season. Whether the print is micro or large-scale and abstract, vibrant pinks, blues, and yellows feel especially fresh. Also, look out for botanical prints, and more unexpected blooms like sunflowers and hydrangeas for a splashier take. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lace Dresses Lace may feel most appropriate in the realm of formalwear… or lingerie, but we’re here to prove that the elegant fabric can be incorporated into your everyday looks, too. Consider pieces trimmed with lace along the hems or appliqués rather than full panels that scream evening. Right now, you can even find plenty of styles with sheer skirts that feel decidedly flirtier and bold rather than conservative or matronly. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/nik-bentel-rc-car-bag-review-49439326",
    "description": "Nik Bentel is the genius designer behind the TikTok-viral pasta bag (which he confirms is his bestselling item to date), and his wheels keep spinning - literally. The Nik Bentel RC Car Bag ($251, originally $295) launched in February and has already outpaced most of the brand's past product drops in terms of day-one performance, according to Bentel himself. \"It's definitely one of our fastest-moving designs,\" he jokes of the statement piece that's part handbag, part remote control car with four-wheel drive. \"What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved?\" Like most of his projects, this accessory is made to get you noticed, which is exactly why I was committed to taking it out on the town for dinner and drinks. Of course, I also love the fact that it's inspired by vintage toy cars, a nod to nostalgia I can definitely get behind. \"My inspiration tends to come from everyday objects that feel overlooked or oddly iconic - things we see all the time but don't usually imagine as wearable or collectible,\" Bentel says, naming Moschino and Chanel as brands that have a similar imaginative approach. \"With the RC Car Handbag, I was thinking about motion and creating a little chaos. What if your bag didn't just look fast, but actually moved? That sparked the idea of taking a remote control car - something playful and nostalgic - and merging it with the functionality of a handbag. It became an object that turns sidewalks into runways.\" I wasn't surprised that the moment I sat down at a bar with my partner for cocktails al fresco on the first truly warm spring day, cheerful onlookers to my left and right begged me to send my bag in motion. They were close enough to notice the wheels and intrigued by the functional object. Needless to say, this was definitely Bentel's intention. \"People love the chaos of it! We've had people racing them in their offices, at galleries, and even just using them as shelf pieces,\" he says, continuing, \"Some carry it, some drive it - and some do both at once. The reactions are usually split between 'Wait . . . it moves?' and 'I've never seen anything like this.' It's been really fun to watch how people interpret and interact with it.\" In just two months, the RC Car Bag has become a beloved piece of art spotted on artists, influencers, and editors alike, from Kitty Lever and Taylor Quitara to Emma Orhun and now even me! Ahead, you can read my full review of the intriguing design and watch it in motion. About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag The bag is crafted from matte black genuine leather with mechanical wheels and a battery powered motor; handheld controller included. The remote control can power the car from up to 30 feet away at 9 mph. The wheels have silver rims and rubberized tread for drifting control. The bag measures 7.25\" x 3\" x 12.5\". AA batteries are included (standard and rechargeable). A limited edition quantity of 300 bags were produced for this project. There's an interior clasp to keep belongings secured, including the remote control while you're carrying it like a handbag. Each piece is handmade, with the bag and remote control weighing just over 1 pound together. What I Like About the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag Obviously, this bag is a conversation-starter, which for me makes an accessory worth the splurge. The matte black colorway is versatile while the avant-garde structure of the bag is currently on-trend. Funnily enough, Bentel allowed the shape to be fully dictated by the car itself, or as he describes, \"almost like the bag was hijacking another object's identity.\" While this isn't necessarily a statement piece you'd wear to a wedding, it can complete many casual outfits from athleisure to jeans and a tee. I also love that the wheels are small and subtle - up-close, you can tell the style is much more than just a purse, but from across the room it might as well be any other coveted designer handbag on the market. Finally, all the pieces included are lightweight - the bag weighs 1 pound and 3 ounces when the remote control is stored inside - so it's not like you're lugging around a huge satchel. In fact, the bag and remote control together weigh a lot less than some of the other purses I own. What to Consider Before Buying the Nik Bentel Studio RC Car Bag If you like to keep your belongings protected, note that this bag does not come equipped with any interior pockets and there's no secure closure aside from a thin snap tab that arches over the top. When the remote control is stored inside, there's also not much room for anything else. I personally carried two credit cards, some gum, and hand sanitizer and wouldn't have had room for my chunky keychain (luckily, I was out with my partner who had his own keys to get us back into the apartment). While currently marked down, the bag is also somewhat of an investment being that it's probably not appropriate for every occasion or event on your calendar. That being said, it's important to remember the thought-provoking and somewhat kitschy nature of Nik Bentel's viral pieces - they aren't exactly built for convenience, and that's sort of the point.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown. Find your favorites and shop this season's best comfortable work shoes for standing all day.",
