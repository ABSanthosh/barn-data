    "description": "Jeans are a classic, but aren’t always the most comfortable thing to wear. Is that why designers have started ‘faking’ them?Those of us who wear jeans tend to do so for the following reasons: they’re durable, versatile, and timeless. But when it comes to comfort, well, that is usually more of a rare quality. Who doesn’t own a pair of jeans that are difficult to sit down in? But now, a new jean is challenging this tradition – meet the jean-printed sweatpant.Gap’s £60 “jean joggers” look like a pair of loose-fitting jeans complete with five pockets, but are in fact cotton joggers with a hidden elasticated waist and faux fly. Gap describes them as “jean adjacent.” Similar to fake news, they’ve quickly gone viral. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Whether it’s lurid, hip-hop-style tribute tees or monogrammed socks, making a personal mark on the things we wear can be a marvellous model for self-expressionIt was Roger Federer’s white jacket in 2006 for me. Golden initials embroidered on the breast pocket, as he lifted the Wimbledon trophy. The elegant monogram suggested an aristocratic elan that I craved. Was it possible to grab some of his pedigree, without the achievements or money, but with some simple stitching? I wondered if I would feel like a fraud.Twenty years later, such personalisation is attainable, and everywhere. Monograms and other distinctive touches, formerly the preserve of the rich, can be anyone’s. Zara, H\u0026M and Uniqlo offer embroidery options in-store. You can buy personalised phone cases, keyrings and socks through Etsy, Glenfiddich whisky bottles labelled with your name, and Converse Chuck Taylors with your face on them. Buying a shoe tree the other day, I was asked if I wanted my initials etched on the heel knob. Oxford Street’s newest pop-up, Hus of Frakta, offers a monogrammed Ikea bag. We personalise football shirts on stag dos and birthdays, and print ironic T-shirts with the faces of loved ones. What’s with all the self-regard – and is identity so easily bought?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Whether you’re hauling your laptop, gym gear, and makeup bag on a marathon commute or strolling to your neighborhood coffee shop with your tablet and a dream, one thing’s clear: a great work bag is a must. And let’s be real — that flimsy canvas tote doubling as your grocery hauler just isn’t cutting it anymore. Ready to upgrade? We’ve got you. From sleek leather totes to ultra-functional backpacks — and even business-trip-ready options with luggage sleeves — these picks will keep your essentials safe, stylish, and organized. Want extra fashion cred? Look for suede textures, belted designs, and geometric shapes inspired by 2025’s biggest handbag trends.Whether you’re shopping on a budget or looking to splurge, you’ll find top picks from R29 reader-favorite brands like Calpak, Quince, and Lululemon, alongside fashionable finds from Coach, MZ Wallace, Polène, and more.  Laptops Bags With Compartments Laptop bags with compartments mean business. Think padded sleeves, triple-section interiors, and clever details like customizable inserts. These designs keep your tech secure and your essentials perfectly organized — all while looking sharp on the go. Business-Trip Ready Travel Bags When it comes to business trips, bags with luggage sleeves are a must. Options like the Béis Work Tote combine sleek, organized interiors with travel-smart features like secure laptop compartments and built-in luggage sleeves. Ideal for navigating terminals or heading straight to meetings, they’re the perfect blend of style and functionality. Bags In Modern Shapes  Modern shapes are the secret to elevating your workwear game. Whether structured and architectural or soft and sculptural, these unique silhouettes add instant interest to your blazers and work pants. Pro tip: carry one to your next interview — it’s a guaranteed way to stand out as a top candidate. Work Backpacks Backpacks are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Go for a fun pattern like Rothy’s checkerboard print, water-resistant matte neoprene like the Alo backpack, or sleek leather — something Coach has perfected (see the Coach Lana Bag and Coach City Tote, two forever-favorite work bags). For travelers, a backpack with a laptop sleeve is the ideal blend of function and style. Structured \u0026 Ladylike Bags The ladylike trend is here to stay in 2025. Channel the sophistication of the ’30s to ’60s with a structured top-handle, timeless shoulder bag, or trendy belted tote for a polished touch that blends vintage charm with modern refinement.  Puffy Tote Bags A puffy tote bag or quilted tote bag doesn’t just protect your office essentials — it also brings major winter vibes with its plush, cozy feel. Think of them as the chicest way to keep your stuff safe while looking effortlessly cool (and seasonally on point). Suede Bags Suede is the perfect mix of iconic and on-trend, with a timeless appeal that feels endlessly polished — whether it’s a slouchy or a sculptural take on the classic suede tote bag. This luxe fabric truly shines in rich earthy tones, from olive green to chocolate brown, cementing its status as a standout choice for work bags.

    "description": "When it comes to fashion, whether you're minimalist, maximalist, or something entirely in between, there's one staple item you need in your wardrobe: a leather jacket. It's truly the Swiss army knife of clothing. There are plenty of different styles to choose from, including oversize, cropped, and motorcycle - just to name a few. You can dress it up or down, and whether you're wearing it for a date or throwing it on for a quick grocery store run, there's nothing like a well-worn leather jacket that is perfectly you. However, finding a high-quality leather jacket at a price that won't break the bank is no easy feat. Luckily, we think we found a brand that checks all of our boxes and has something for everyone, no matter what style you're seeking. Allow us to introduce you to Quince. Quince is all about offering high-quality items made with premium materials at an affordable price. How do they do it? The direct-to-consumer brand uses a factory-direct model and keeps costs low by cutting out the supply-chain middlemen. They make home and travel products, but right now, our editors couldn't be more obsessed with their leather jackets. Ahead, three editors put three different styles of Quince's 100-percent leather jackets to the test. You can check us out modeling different options, read about how they worked for us, and then use our tips to help you make your own purchase - we promise you won't regret it.
