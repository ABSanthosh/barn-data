    "description": "Her novel about being Anna Wintour’s assistant caused such a storm, she wished she’d never written it. As the story becomes a musical with songs by Elton John, the author reveals why the imperious editor hasn’t spoken to her sinceWhen Lauren Weisberger was 22 years old, she got the job that she would end up being famous for all her life. Having “literally never had a job beyond working in a frozen yoghurt place, with a bit of babysitting and lifeguarding”, but hoping to become a writer, she secured an interview to be assistant to Anna Wintour, then editor-in-chief of American Vogue. To the general horror of the Vogue office in New York, she arrived carrying her CV and writing samples in the sensible, dowdy leather briefcase her parents had given her as a graduation present. “I was fresh out of college – four years of studying and partying and wearing sweatpants all day long. I wasn’t into fashion, so Vogue was a completely foreign culture to me.” To everyone’s surprise, she got the nod.The role was “demanding and fast-paced and stressful and head-spinningly around-the-clock. I would wake up every morning to voicemails left overnight, endless tasks that all needed to be done right away.” This was 1999 and “Anna didn’t have a computer. As her assistants, we were her computers. And everyone in the office was tall and gorgeous and slender and totally obsessed with this world in a way that felt toxic to me. Every minute in that office felt like an emergency. I was just a kid. I went into survival mode.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "The trend for ‘duck lips’ is over and many people are seeking to reverse their cosmetic treatments – often with painful and disfiguring resultsIt was her wedding photographs that did for Grace Stewart’s dermal fillers. By the time the 32-year-old married her long-term partner in 2022, she had been getting fillers for three years – first in her jaw, in pursuit of “that snatched look”, and latterly in her lips, cheeks, nose and chin. One image in particular made her do a double-take: a side-on candid shot in which she is being swept up in a hug by a cousin. “It was this really lovely moment, but all you can see is my chin curling up and this bulky jaw,” says the Nottingham-based social media manager. “I now think: ‘My Lord, why did I do that to myself?’”Stewart did not get any further treatments in the two years after her wedding, but while hyaluronic acid filler is typically marketed as temporary – lasting up to 18 months – she couldn’t seem to shake the volume that had been injected into her jaw. So, this year, she made like Kylie Jenner, Courteney Cox and Molly-Mae Hague and had social media’s latest injection du jour: hyaluronidase, or dissolver. “I now know that there’s a reason why my face is the shape that it is. It’s not supposed to have this angle to it that doesn’t flow,” she says. “I feel so sad that I felt the need to adjust how I looked just to feel like the best version of myself.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/good-american-soft-tech-denim-review-49406797",
    "description": "Good American is known for its innovative material, B-corp certified production, and inclusivity when it comes to sizing. To be frank, I wish every denim brand looked a lot more like this one. And when I heard the label was re-launching its bestselling Soft-Tech jeans for fall, I knew PS editors had to be among the first to test out the new selection. GA introduced some of its signature silhouettes, like the Good Waist Palazzo Jeans, Good Curve Bootcut, and Good Petite, in this curve-hugging fabric that's honestly pretty game-changing (not to give everything away right here on the spot). What's so great about the Soft-Tech denim? It's one of the most sustainable fibers on the market, according to the brand, blending a lightweight, silk feel and TENCEL™ to create a flexible and soft jean that magically lifts and flatters in all the right places. In other words, it provides a surprising amount of structure for feeling like a pair of leggings when you pull them on. PS editors are well-versed in product testing, and we've tried some of the most renowned denim brands on the market - from Madewell to Levi's to Gap - so we took a very meticulous approach to delivering our reviews. Ahead, you can see photos of us modeling four different styles; read about our experiences not just wearing, but washing these jeans; and choose the pair that's right for you if you're down to invest. Sorry for yet another spoiler, but I highly doubt you'll regret it.",

    "description": "With winter right around the corner, we now have yet another task to add to our shopping agenda these days - and it involves finding a coat that's stylish, warm, and (ideally!) durable enough to still be something we can wear well into next year, too. Regardless of where you live or how brutal the winter weather can get, finding a coat to sport during the year's coldest months can be daunting - and often, pretty costly, too. Fortunately, there's Amazon. And as with most of our shopping antics, we always know that we can turn to the retailer to find stylish yet affordable fashion pieces, from rain boots to cozy and affordable sweaters and cold-weather workout clothes for the new season. And this year, winter coats and jackets are no exception! Cold gusts of wind and brisk temperatures are at our doorsteps - and naturally, we need to be prepared. If you aren't fully stocked up on cute coats and jackets for the upcoming season, now is the time to get shopping. Already, Amazon has built a pretty impressive selection of outerwear for winter and (bonus!) all at incredibly fair prices, too. We rounded up our favorite options for you to shop through, all in a variety of colors and styles. With such a wide range of price points, you might even be able to buy a few of these choices for your winter wardrobe.

Does the office holiday celebration call for an LBD or a structured midi? Should you wear sequins or velvet for the cocktail soirée? Stiletto boots or ballet flats to the dinner party?  Fortunately, partywear has gotten looser over the years — which means there’s no one formula for the perfect holiday outfit. The runways have given us permission — encouraged us, even — to style dresses over pants and to don our cowboy boots to the function. Meanwhile, designer-approved trends like bubble skirts and burgundy hues are very adaptable, as suitable for the office as the dance floor. For the planners and procrastinators alike, scroll on for 10 modern dress-and-shoes combinations — courtesy of 10 stylish creators — to see you through all of December. Slip Dress and Sneakers  View this post on Instagram A post shared by z o ë (@zoehudsonx) Level up the comfort of your favorite slip dress (preferably one with lace detailing or a festive colorway) with a pair of dad sneakers.  Lace Dress With Boots (And Pants) View this post on Instagram A post shared by LOURLIN • Boston Content Creator (@_lourlinmarie_) The dress-over-pants trend is a holiday season-win. Pair a sheer dress with heeled boots and trousers to stay warm and chic. Neon Brights View this post on Instagram A post shared by alanna doherty (@alannanicolex) Make a statement with highlighter-bright hues. Color-block your favorite neons and wait for the compliments to flow.  Cocktail Dress and Platform Heels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nyome Nicholas – Williams (@curvynyome) If the party calls for more formal attire, a black cocktail dress will always come through with holiday glam. Pair with platform sandals for a more comfortable shoe option. Playing With Prints View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rylé Tuvierra راه-يلي (@thefiercewalker) Dare to wear a bold print for a festive night on the town. Play with florals, stripes or animal patterns and link them up with a biker boot for a trendy touch.  Holiday Hues  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Arunima Ghosh (@arunniima) Reds and greens are no-brainers this time of year. Style one color from head to toe, pair the hues together, or play around with non-traditional shades, like a forest green or deep burgundy.  Maxi Dress and Tall Boots View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vee (@astoldbyvee) One for the work parties and daytime get-togethers: A maxi dress with knee-high boots make a timeless look. Metallic Magic View this post on Instagram A post shared by zeda (@notzeda) Own the festive theme with a metallic dress and accessories. Add some interest by layering with a graphic tee or utilitarian jacket. Sequin Mini and Heels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Adéṣayọ̀ Tàlàbí (@simplysayo) Sequin and diamanté details are a party lover’s best friend. Sparkle in a cool printed mini and with bold heels to match. Bubbling Up View this post on Instagram A post shared by alyssa coscarelli (@alyssainthecity) 2024 has been the year of the bubble hem, so it’s only right to end it in one. Wear a mini or maxi with ballet flats, knee-high boots or a solid pair of pumps.   Like what you see?
