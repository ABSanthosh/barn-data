    "description": "The versatility of the humble belt can give the clothes you already own a new, stylish lease of lifeThere is a white-hot, brand new must-have accessory in fashion. Long, snakey object that goes around your waist, sometimes holds your trousers up. It’s called a belt. Perhaps you’ve heard of it?Sometimes shifts in style are so simple that you don’t notice them. The return of the belt is like that. Everyone owns a belt and knows what it is. A belt isn’t eyecatching, which means that when someone walks past you in the street wearing a belt, your eye doesn’t necessarily even register it in the way you would clock, say, a cowboy hat, or a corsage. But the belt is big fashion news this season. It is a style hack that can give your favourite coat an instant makeover; unlock a new silhouette when teamed with a pair of trousers; and turn basics into an outfit. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bold-elements-ally-brooke-petite-fashion?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Floor-dragging hemlines. Comically disproportionate silhouettes. Too-low knee placements (see also: darts, and waistbands, and necklines). Rises so high, they span the entire length of your torso. Long coats that pool at the feet. These are just a few of the many, many sartorial challenges that petites face — but all of that is addressed in JCPenney’s latest fashion collaboration: Bold Elements x Ally Brooke, a collection done in partnership with the award-winning singer-songwriter (you might remember her from Fifth Harmony) that delivers petite-forward, fashion-fueled styles.  “At 5’0”, I know firsthand how often petite women are overlooked — and how difficult it can be to find fashion that fits. I wanted to work with JCPenney to break down those barriers in fashion and create a collection that fits and flatters all body types,” Brooke says. “What makes this collection so special is that it’s not straight-sized clothing that happens to offer petite, it’s petite clothing that happens to offer straight sizing. The difference is so apparent in the pieces.”  This thoughtful, considered approach to design that benefits *everyone* (from petites to straight size and plus size) is evident in all 29 pieces, but Brooke calls out two styles in particular: long trench coats and Bermuda shorts, saying “trend-forward fashion [like these] often aren’t realistic options for petites like me, but this collection offers stylish, proportional designs made for petite and plus-sized women.” Her other favorites include a top featuring a pattern of her actual lip print, along with the black blazer styled with the pinstripe pants. “Many people wear a combination of petite and standard sizes, and I love that you can mix and match styles and sizes to fit your own vibe — no alterations required.”  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 (@refinery29) And to keep the big fashion energy going, JCPenney hosted an unforgettable event during New York Fashion Week to not only celebrate the launch of the Bold Elements x Ally Brooke collection, but also to announce the Petite Power List, which honors eight influential petite women, including Brooke, who are making waves in their industries: April Lockhart, an advocate for the disability community; Averie Bishop, a social activist and cofounder of the Tulong Foundation nonprofit; Shan Berries, CEO and founder of Shades by Shan Cosmetics; April Whitney, a certified personal trainer and founder of Petite PWR; Eli Rallo, a content creator and author of I Didn’t Know I Needed This; Imani Ellis, CEO and founder of CultureCon and The Creative Collective; and Armani Latimer, a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader who has embraced her alopecia and inspires others to do the same.  “I know that size means nothing when it comes to showing up in big ways and making an impact in life. [That’s why] I’m excited to work with JCPenney to announce the “Petite Power List,” Brooke says. “I’m so excited to help all women, but especially petites, find their big fashion energy.” Prices quoted from February 6, 2025; check jcpenney.com for current pricing and discounts.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/meghan-markle-embroidered-sweatshirt-49426830",
    "description": "Meghan Markle already has a reputation for incorporating thoughtful design flourishes into her wardrobe; over the years, she's subtly channeled Princess Diana's infamous style, frequently worn pieces from woman-owned brands like Cuyana and Birdies, and even been spotted wearing an eternity ring encrusted with Markle's own birthstone, along with those of her husband, Prince Harry, and their firstborn child, Archie. Now, in her latest Instagram post, the former royal gave fans a glimpse of yet another style that cleverly pays homage to her family - and keeps her kiddos feeling close. ICYMI: Markle took to Instagram earlier in the week to share a video in which she spoke about her ongoing efforts to support the victims of the Altadena wildfire in Los Angeles, as well as thanked Billie Eilish for helping her surprise a 15-year-old fan whose home had been destroyed by the Eaton Fire. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan) In the video, Markle is wearing what appears to be a simple black sweatshirt with blue jeans and her go-to Cartier watch - aka the perfect off-duty look. But upon further examination, attentive fashion girlies (like myself) noticed a unique detail that sets her top apart from the usual crewneck: embroidered cursive text along the collar that reads \"Archie \u0026 Lili\", the names of Markle's two children. The thoughtful Club Chainstitch Adult Chainstitch Sweatshirt ($73) is not only a sweet nod to Markle's two kiddos, but it also comes from a woman-owned small business in Chicago, Club Chainstitch. The bestselling sweatshirt can be easily customized on the brand's site, giving shoppers the option to choose their text choice, placement, and the letter coloring.
