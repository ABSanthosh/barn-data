    "description": "Whether it’s lurid, hip-hop-style tribute tees or monogrammed socks, making a personal mark on the things we wear can be a marvellous model for self-expressionIt was Roger Federer’s white jacket in 2006 for me. Golden initials embroidered on the breast pocket, as he lifted the Wimbledon trophy. The elegant monogram suggested an aristocratic elan that I craved. Was it possible to grab some of his pedigree, without the achievements or money, but with some simple stitching? I wondered if I would feel like a fraud.Twenty years later, such personalisation is attainable, and everywhere. Monograms and other distinctive touches, formerly the preserve of the rich, can be anyone’s. Zara, H\u0026M and Uniqlo offer embroidery options in-store. You can buy personalised phone cases, keyrings and socks through Etsy, Glenfiddich whisky bottles labelled with your name, and Converse Chuck Taylors with your face on them. Buying a shoe tree the other day, I was asked if I wanted my initials etched on the heel knob. Oxford Street’s newest pop-up, Hus of Frakta, offers a monogrammed Ikea bag. We personalise football shirts on stag dos and birthdays, and print ironic T-shirts with the faces of loved ones. What’s with all the self-regard – and is identity so easily bought?

    "description": "As much as we love playing dress-up, diving headfirst into the latest fashion trends, there’s no denying the magnetic pull of a matching sweatsuit or lounge set. They’re cozy, they’re comfy, they’re cute — and when made with quality and care, they’re built to last. Plus, let’s talk versatility. Toeing the line between sporty athleisure and polished co-ords, sweatsuits are the ultimate shortcut to looking casual yet put-together. Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit. Or default to your favorite when tackling a week’s worth of chores in a few hours. Working remotely and need to feel slightly more “dressed” than your pajamas? Problem solved.  And on travel days? Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: you can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.Louis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition. Leaning into Y2K nostalgia in all the right ways (Paris and Britney were both OG fans), the assortment includes the iconic bright monogrammed Speedy Bandoulière 25 bag, slingback mules, patterned silk scarves, and even a skateboard complete with the Superflat Panda — because why not? Shop at Louis Vuitton nowLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy Bandoulière 25, $, available at Louis VuittonJ.Crew Teams Up With AraksBefore launching her luxury intimates line Araks, Araks Yeramyan was a member of J.Crew’s design team. Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in. They carry a quiet confidence, the kind of ease that makes them as much a gift to yourself as anyone else.” Shop now at J.Crew Araks x J.Crew Midi Slip Dress, $, available at J.CrewAraks x J.Crew Beatrice Bralette, $, available at J.CrewPHLUR Golden Rule EDPPHLUR, the brand behind the viral Missing Person fragrance, is back with a new hypnotic scent. Enter: Golden Rule. Encased in a shimmering gold bottle, the brand describes the eau de parfum as “sensual,” combining notes of juicy mandarin and pink pepper with smooth coconut milk, vanilla cream, and orange flower. Warm and feminine, the fragrance is perfect for imbuing a sprinkle of summer into cold winter nights.Shop now at PhlurPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at PhlurRixo x Stripe \u0026 StareRixo is known for its playful prints and feminine silhouettes; Stripe \u0026 Stare is recognized for its ultra-comfortable and consciously-made underwear. The only question we have is: How has it taken this long for the two London-based brands to join forces? The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them. Pieces are available in US sizes 2 to 22, and made with 95-percent biodegradable fabric.  Shop at Rixo and Stripe \u0026 Stare on January 16 Fenty Skin Cherry Dub CleanserWhile we start yet another year screaming “Where is the album?!” to the sky, Rihanna remains booked and busy, launching a new lightweight gel cleanser. The product is all about harnessing the Barbados cherry, which is rich in vitamin C. Here the brightening ingredient is combined with niacinamide to improve skin texture and aloe juice for soothing inflammation. Shop now at Fenty BeautyFenty Beauty Cherry Dub Pore Purify'r Gel Cleanser, $, available at Fenty BeautyLoewe x OnSwiss running shoe brand On is one of the fastest growing brands on the market, working with megawatt talent like Zendaya and collaborating with buzzy designers like Jonathan Anderson through Loewe.

Brazilian Bum Bum Cream creators Sol de Janeiro are stepping up to the plate this month with the launch of a lightweight body oil scented with pink dragon fruit and hibiscus. Cacay oil is said to boost collagen and elastin production, while squalane plumps and amaranthus flower seed extract moisturize deeply. Be sure to apply to damp skin for maximum hydration.Shop now at SephoraSol de Janeiro Beija Flor Body Oil, $, available at SephoraLevi's x UNDERCOVERIn honor of its 35th anniversary, Japanese luxury streetwear brand Undercover has once again teamed up with Levi’s. The second collaboration between the two brands fuses their rich heritages. The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather. Not only is the show coming back to Netflix for a second season (with Peter Kavinsky in tow), it’s also teaming up with Korean beauty brand Good Light to launch a limited-edition lip bundle. The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide. There’s even a collectable keychain included in the backpack-inspired packaging.Shop from 16th January at Beauty BayLike what you see?

    "description": "We don't know about you, but we're currently in our football era - and it's all thanks to Taylor Swift. Ever since the pop superstar made her surprise appearance at that fateful Sunday Night Football game last year, we've found ourselves hyper-focused on the football season more than ever before. Sure, the games themselves are entertaining - when you've got generational talents (and TikTok-loved players) like Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow all in the league, you can bet some pretty high-stakes showdowns will take place. But perhaps even better than who's playing on the field is who's showing up and showing out in the stands - especially when the talent is Ms. Swift herself. The 2024-2025 NFL playoffs are here, with divisional round games set to take place this weekend; the Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the Houston Texans, while the Buffalo Bills will compete against the Baltimore Ravens, the Washington Commanders against the Detroit Lions, and the LA Rams against the Philadelphia Eagles. These playoff games will feature some of the league's most prominent stars, including none other than Swift's boyfriend, three-time Super Bowl-winner and tight end Travis Kelce. And with Swift's attendance for the game seemingly confirmed by Kelce in an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, NFL fans (and Swifties alike) have even more to get excited about. The musician's presence became a fixture at NFL games last season. From creating touchdown-celebration handshakes with Brittany Mahomes to chatting up Donna Kelce with a vodka cranberry cocktail in hand, Swift appears to be leaning all the way into her WAG era - and inspiring a whole new legion of fans to obsess over the game (or at least tune in to see what she's wearing). Whether you're a dedicated NFL viewer looking to embrace the Swift x NFL crossover or simply a loyal Swiftie hoping to love the sport just as much as the singer, you can conquer the upcoming NFL playoffs in style with these game day outfits - all of which are inspired by Taylor Swift's outfits, no less. From her favorite red lipstick to logo sweaters with \"NFL (Taylor's Version)\" printed across the front and other stylish football outfits that play into this iconic crossover between sports and pop culture, here's what to wear to wear to a football game with a Swiftie-inspired twist.",

    "description": "Every year at this time, we find ourselves craving new sweaters - you just can't beat that thrill of finding a new knit or sweatsuit set to cozy up in all season long. And while we're firm believers that you can never have too many sweaters in your wardrobe (especially if you live somewhere cold), dishing out the money to spend on a variety of styles is often a burden on our wallets. Fortunately, there are plenty of stylish sweaters out there that are equal parts cozy and affordable, and we've recently discovered a few of our favorites on Amazon. It's no secret that the retailer is a hub for deals across pretty much every major category. But when it comes to fashion, the retailer delivers in more ways than one with a massive selection of knits and other top-rated clothing, all at unbelievably low prices - we're talking so affordable, you won't have to spend a penny over $25. Whether you want an elevated yet comfortable sweatshirt or a fitted turtleneck for layering, we've got options that'll impress you. Take a look at our favorite Amazon sweaters under $25, and score a few before they sell out. With deals like this, we have no doubt they'll be gone in the blink of an eye.",
