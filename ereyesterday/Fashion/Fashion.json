    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-festival-outfit-ideas?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Weekend one of Coachella brought us all the dramatic looks we were craving, from the performers and celebrity attendees to the crowds of stylish festival goers. Naturally, it sparked the urge to start planning our own spring and summer festival outfits, whether for the second weekend of “Gagachella” or any upcoming desert, city, or beach concerts.  With so many festival fashion trends and aesthetics to choose from — western cowgirl, rainbow raver, retro hippie — there’s one wardrobe anchor that fits every vibe: denim. From ‘70s bell bottoms to ‘90s vests, denim has always been a go-to for concert style, and now, there are even more playful ways to wear it.As a denim devotee figuring out my own festival lineup, I decided to make it the centerpiece of several outfits. From one-and-done jumpsuits to matching sets, trending jorts, and unexpected accessories, I put the tried-and-true staple to the test. Here’s how it went — and how you can do the same. DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival Outfit Idea: Denim Overalls \u0026 Jumpsuits If you don’t want to stress over putting an outfit together — or worry about anything slipping down (or riding up!) while you’re mid-dance sesh — a one-piece is the way to go. Long-sleeved styles also offer coverage from the sun and bugs!I styled a white barrel-leg jumpsuit from Madewell with a western twist: a studded belt, Tecovas cowboy booties, and an Away cargo pack. No matter your jumpsuit choice, adding tons of accessories is the key. For a breezier vibe, I went with light-wash Cider overalls with bows tied down the legs. Paired with a gingham Calpak water bottle holder and Nike Cortez sneakers, the look felt playful and picnic-ready. If a slightly undone look speaks to you — especially for showing off a statement top — unhook a strap and try a mesh layer, graphic tee, or bikini top underneath. DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival Outfit Idea: Denim Jorts Yes, jorts are back — and they’re the ultimate swap for traditional cutoffs that ride up or cause thigh chafing. The longer Bermuda length is perfect for long, sweaty festival days. For one look, I styled a light-wash Pilcro pair (with a casual shoe lace tie) with sheer butter-yellow layers and matching Guess sunglasses. The unexpected color still pops — especially when paired with shiny metallic sneakers. I also played with white H\u0026M jorts, styling them with a rainbow crochet top, patterned crossbody bag, and a printed headscarf for a colorful, seaside-ready vibe. Add a belly chain or bag charm hooked onto the belt loops for a creative twist. DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival Outfit Idea: Denim-On-Denim Sets A Canadian tuxedo moment always hits. Matching sets — jacket + jean, vest + short, or crop + skirt — are a foolproof way to make a statement without much effort.One standout set I wore was a gradient-dyed shirt and wide-leg jean combo from Kenneth Cole.  I just buttoned the top at the neck to reveal a tank underneath, and slung on a Uniqlo mini bag. Platform slingbacks finished the look — the only sandals I trust on uneven festival ground.I also took a Buffalo skort set for a spin, which looks like a mini skirt in the front but offers full coverage in the back. Paired with a raffia bucket hat and Teva sandals, it gave breezy, beach festival energy. But you could easily take this look in a rave direction with Kandi bracelets and platform sneakers. DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival Outfit Idea: Denim Accessories Want to keep your denim touch subtle? Try it in the form of accessories. Baseball and cowboy hats, tote bags, sneakers, statement belts, or even a denim phone case can tie your look together without being the whole story.I went full-on with mine, styling multiple denim accessories at once, but you can always mix them into your outfits sparingly for a fun pop that looks and feels festival-ready.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationOld Navy Launches Special-Occasion Dresses This spring and summer, Old Navy wants you to get dressed up — literally. The retailer just launched The Occasion, a new collection of elevated — and affordable — dresses and separates for special events. With prices ranging from $44.99 to $64.99, the capsule features elegant twist-front maxi dresses, sleek cowl-neck satin gowns, joyful bubble-hem mini dresses, all of which are available in sizes XS to 4X (or 0 to 30). “I’ve designed dresses for women in every scenario — from everyday moments to the red carpet — so it was a pleasure to lend my expertise to Sarah [Holme, Old Navy head of design and product development] and collaborate with the Old Navy design team on The Occasion,” chief creative officer Zac Posen said in a press release. “This collection is elevated, accessible, and truly makes any event feel special.” Shop now at Old Navy Old Navy Satin Cowl Maxi Dress, $, available at Old NavyCoach Becomes Official Partner of the WNBA Professional women’s basketball just got even more stylish because Coach is now an official partner of the WNBA. The deal — which, according to a press release, is meant to encourage players and fans to embrace and express all aspects of their personalities — will pop up in different ways throughout the 2025 season. That includes the WNBA Draft, which was held in New York City on April 14 and saw top prospects like Paige Bueckers (the first overall pick), Hailey Van Lith, and Aneesah Morrow sporting Coach at the event. Another aspect of the partnership? Coach will become the presenting sponsor of WNBA Pride, a platform celebrating the LGBTQ+ community.

Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones RoadCult Gaia Introduces Bridal Collection The brand behind the viral Ark bag and Cassidy Sandal — and the latest Gap collaborator — Cult Gaia is walking down the aisle. The LA brand has just launched its debut bridal collection, and it’s full of sculptural, statement-making styles that break the typical wedding-day mold — think a mini dress made from silk-chiffon braided material, a floral-lace gown with removable sleeves, a plisséd 3-D top, and more. “Crafted for the effortless bride, each piece is thoughtfully created to captivate, inspire, and evoke pure emotion on your most special days,” Cult Gaia founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat said in a press release.

The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour.

Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam.

Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better?

    "description": "As shopping editors, we know all of the most useful secrets when it comes to searching through Nordstrom's site for the best styles (and even better deals). In many ways, it's our job to track down great products with high ratings, and Nordstrom has no shortage of those. If you find yourself in the market to update your closet with a new clothing item or even a top-rated pair of shoes, we have more than a few suggestions. We've curated products that are not only trending, but included in our own personal favorites as well. Below, we've laid them all out for you - because, after all, what are shopping fairy godmothers for? Nordstrom recently released tons of new wardrobe essentials that are sure to sell out quickly, plus a few cult-favorite pieces that are hard enough to find in stock. From a top-rated cardigan to stylish Madewell wide-leg jeans and editor-loved Birkenstock clogs, these pieces are designed to live in your closet for the longterm - even as they endure multiple trend changes and TikTok aesthetics. Check out the best Nordstrom clothes that customers are currently loving from the retailer ahead, and buy them before they sell out.",
