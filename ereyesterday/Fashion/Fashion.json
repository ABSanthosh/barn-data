    "description": "Need a classic swimsuit for less than £40? A hat that’s easy to pack? Or the perfect beach-to-bar T-shirt? Make this summer a breeze with our fashion experts’ top tipsThere is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.The truth is that aside from the fact that people equate wearing fewer clothes with being cooler – not true! – it’s very hard to know what to wear when the sun comes out. So we are here to help. How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear? Continue reading...",

    "title": "Is Celine Phantom The Next Big Designer Comeback Bag?",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/celine-phantom-bag-comeback-michael-rider?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The 2010s were the golden age of the It bag — and few designers had a hold over the category quite like Phoebe Philo.  The British designer became Celine’s creative director in 2008, and had her first hit in the accessories department shortly thereafter, with the introduction of the Luggage bag in 2009. The boxy tote, with its distinctive handle placements and exterior zipper, quickly became a staple on the arms of the oft-papped, from Nicole Richie to Lindsay Lohan to Rihanna.  “That was the height of the It bag era and the It Girl era,” says Noelle Sciacca, associate director of fashion and strategic partnerships at The RealReal. “Whether you were in the fashion space or not, you knew what that bag was because of the paparazzi photos… If you saw Lindsay Lohan or someone from The Simple Life had it, you wanted that style.” As a result, this ignited a desire for boxier handbags, even among shoppers who didn’t have a Celine budget. (Most Luggage bags fell in the $2,000-$3,500 range.) “Every contemporary brand, every mall brand started to do that [Luggage] shape because it felt so unique,” she says.  A few years later, in 2011, Philo riffed on the design and birthed another soon-to-become icon: the Phantom. Roomier than the Luggage, with wings jutting out from either side, the Phantom was inspired by Celine suitcases from the 1970s. It boasted the same handles and zipper (except the latter had a long braided rope pull) as its handbag sibling, so, together, they were often referred to as the “smile bags.” The silhouette attracted an even bigger celebrity following than the Luggage, spotted on the arms of Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Celine Dion, as well as models of the moment like Alessandra Ambrosio and Lily Aldridge. “The Phantom always stood out because of its oversized, unstructured shape and dramatic wings,” says Anais Rivera, director of procurement at Fashionphile. “It felt bolder, cooler, and a little less polished than the rest. It has this effortless, slouchy vibe that makes it feel different. It doesn’t try too hard, and that’s exactly what made people gravitate toward it. You could throw it over your shoulder with jeans and a tee, and still look elevated.”  Almost 15 years later, there’s a lot of nostalgia around the Phantom, especially for millennials who wanted one during its heyday but couldn’t afford it. “I remember being in college and dreaming of owning one — I would’ve given you my left kidney to buy one,” says Rivera. “That bag defined a whole era.” Sciacca was an assistant at a fashion magazine at the time. “It’s similar to what the Miu Miu Sparkle Bootie was for me — one of those iconic accessories that everyone wanted to call in, that was seen on every cool editor,” she says. “I would try it on and play with it when it was in the fashion closet. It definitely has a hold on me personally.” To Sophie Hersan, the co-founder and fashion director of Vestiaire Collective, the Phantom is inextricably linked to Philo, embodying “the ghost of Phoebe,” who left Celine in 2017. “It’s the day-to-day bag for modern women,” she says, likening it to a Hermès Birkin in its utility. “It’s for the modern woman who works and has a messy bag. Not everyone can afford a Birkin, but the Phantom is exactly what every woman wants… I was waiting for the maison [to reissue] it.” Michael Rider, Celine’s new designer, worked at the brand when both the Luggage and Phantom came out. Though he was on the ready-to-wear team at the time, he dipped into the accessories of the era for his debut as creative director for Spring 2026 and reintroduced the Phantom — bigger, but slightly shorter, and even wider — in black, brown, and Yves Klein blue (another nod to Philo). Rider even riffed on the bag’s unofficial nickname, curving the zipper upwards so it resembled a smile.  “It’s this nice, beautiful way to honor the codes of the fashion house, but also add this playful irreverence to it, and indicate the direction in which he’s going to take it,” Sciacca says.  Even before Rider’s runway debut in July, the Celine Phantom had been on the minds of resale shoppers. Fashionphile reported that it saw the highest search volume for the style of the year back in January, with a 79% increase from the prior month. In the days after the show in Paris, though, searches were up 1,205%, compared to the preceding week.  On The RealReal, searches for the Celine Phantom were up 120% on the day of the Celine show, and nearly doubled the next day. Obsessions — when users “heart” an item on the resale platform — are up 123% year-on-year; searches are up 263% year-on-year. “What world news is for the stock market, fashion news is for the resale market,” says Sciacca. “We always see that correlation: As a past season It bag gets reintroduced on the runway, it automatically creates a desire. People have to wait months for Spring 2026 to go into production and be released by the brand. People see it and they want it, so that instantly drives them to the resale market.” Hersan has noticed secondhand’s impact on the firsthand market at Vestiaire Collective, too — when “there’s such a demand [for] a bag, an accessory, or ready-to-wear that you can find it again in the new collection from the maison.” (The platform saw a 10x increase in searches for the Phantom after the Celine show in July, compared to June.) She first picked up on it when Dior reissued the Saddle, and foresaw it happening with the Chloé Paddington (also designed by Philo, who was the creative director of the brand from 2001 to 2006) once Chemena Kamali joined the brand. She sees this as an effort from brands to own their heritage and show customers that they can stick with a brand even amid designer switch-ups. “All the codes are there,” she says.  Sciacca points to nostalgia as another driving factor: “The people who loved the bag [when it first came out] and feel nostalgic for it want to gravitate towards it again, but then that new generation is able to adopt it for the first time. It’s a good time for brands to play on that.”  Beyond that, the Phantom comeback is aligned with a desire we’re seeing for big bags, specifically “sizes over 35 — thinking about The Row Margaux or the Birkin,” says Rivera. “Now that everybody’s coming back to the office, you want bags where you can fit your laptop and all your needs.” The Phantom, she adds, is “in a very unique position to thrive.” Sciacca agrees, noting that a big part of the Phantom’s appeal is its practicality. “You feel like you can be playful with fashion, but it’s a serious bag at the same time,” she says. “When I first started working at The RealReal, I was surprised by how many color combinations there were… There’s still personal style. You’re not just subscribing to a trend, in that sense.”  The Phantom “is a piece that will last over the years,” says Hersan. Even as other styles came and went, it was never totally out of the picture: “I could never say that it wasn’t on-trend anymore.” It has that “effortless silhouette that we’re looking for today,” when “we want to invest in more timeless pieces than ever.”  Another thing they agree on: Now’s the time to buy — and sell.  “It’s the very simple economics of supply and demand. As demand goes up, we can increase resale prices… As these things start to be gobbled up on the resale market, there’s going to be less and less [inventory], so people will pay more of a premium,” Sciacca says. “To anyone who wants to buy it: Scoop it up now, because if you wait a couple weeks, you’re going to pay hundreds of dollars more for it.” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "When it’s sweltering out, the only thing more appealing than blasting the AC is slipping into an ultra-lightweight dress that barely skims the body. Whether it’s a floaty cotton dress that breathes easily, a poplin midi with cut-outs for added airflow, or a linen maxi made for getaways, these summer-ready silhouettes are what we’ll be living in from now through Labor Day.This edit includes the most breathable summer dresses we could find — many with open backs, strategic slits, or draped shapes that won’t cling, bunch, or stick to sweaty skin. We’ve got all the trends covered, too: shift dresses that go from desk to drinks, tiered and flowy dresses made for triple-digit temps, picnic-ready gingham, bubble hems that bring volume without weight, and standout hues like butter yellow and tangerine. Consider this your guide to surviving the heat in style — whether your summer plans include a sardine-girl stroll through the city, a fisherman-coded coastal escape, or a destination wedding abroad (hello, European aesthetic). Mini Dresses Short, swingy, and made to float away from the body, these minis are your best defense against summer’s stickiest days. But heat-proof doesn’t mean shapeless or void of detail — our favorites include ruched accents, exaggerated babydoll silhouettes, and not-overly-clingy smocking. Midi Dresses Midi lengths strike the perfect balance between ease and polish — ideal for office days, dinner plans, or anything in between. Refresh your assortment with of-the-moment silhouettes featuring halter necklines, milkmaid-esque puff sleeves, and beautifully embroidered handkerchief designs. Maxi Dresses Maxis may offer the most coverage, but the best ones still feel easy, airy, and perfectly cool on hot days. Reach for a cut-out design or open back for date night, a cotton shirt dress for a day full of shopping and lunch, or a printed option that feels just right for a summer wedding or dinner outing.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/loft-deco-mini-wrap-skirt-review-with-photos-49452368",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca My earliest memories of LOFT date back to when it was still called Ann Taylor LOFT, when I'd tag along with my mom to help her pick out work outfits. It's been a minute since I've stepped foot in a store, but recently, my TikTok algorithm (which knows me frighteningly well) served up a few trending fashion picks from the brand's website. And honestly? LOFT is delivering. The pieces feel exactly like the aesthetic I'm reaching for these days: elevated but effortless, polished yet comfortable. Cue me immediately adding the exact items they fed me to my cart: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt ($35, originally $70) and the Ribbed Square Neck Sweater Tank Top ($27, originally $55). About the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt The LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is available in both regular and petite sizes. You can find it in stores and online. It's made of 100 percent lyocell and is machine washable. It measures 17.5 inches in length and features a straight, relaxed shift fit. What I Like About the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt What I like most about the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is how it blends two trends I keep seeing on Pinterest: bandana prints and sarong-style silhouettes. The fit feels polished yet playful, and with the right accessories, I can wear it just as easily for daytime plans as I can for a night out. It's also incredibly easy to style. Admittedly, I'm not the most adventurous dresser, so this skirt speaks to my minimalist heart - it looks chic with anything black and white (though by all means, go bold if that's your thing). I paired it with a classic LOFT tank I'll be wearing on repeat year-round, the Staud handbag I wear constantly, and a pair of strappy black heels. Lastly (and at the risk of sounding a little obsessed), I love that this skirt isn't an online exclusive. So many pieces sell out fast online and are nearly impossible to track down. Thankfully, it's also available in stores, and I noticed that several Minnesota locations near me still had it in stock. (Can't promise the same for you, but I'm hopeful!) Image Source: PS Photography | Marisa Petrarca What to Consider About the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Something to keep in mind about the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is that it's made of 100 percent lyocell, which the brand lists as machine washable in the product details. While that's true, I did a little digging and found that the best way to keep it looking its best long-term is to wash it on a delicate cycle in cold water with a mild detergent, then air dry. I'm admittedly reaching for cons here, but if you're planning to keep this piece in regular rotation, it's worth noting. Where Is the LOFT Deco Mini Wrap Skirt Available? No shocker here: the Deco Mini Wrap Skirt is a LOFT exclusive, available both in stores and online.

    "description": "It's no secret that \"Love Island USA\" is impacting current culture as we know it. While it's far from the first love-centered reality show that we've seen, its popularity is especially referential. The show's foundational concept is unusual alone - being secluded on an island away from the outside world to find the love you've been looking for all your life. Islanders also played a significant role in season seven's massive impact, including Olandria Carthen and Nicolas Vansteenberghe's kiss that caused a massive crash-out at \"Love Island\" watch parties. Another highlight from the show that's still on our minds? Amaya Espinal (aka our sensitive gangster) wearing a muumuu in episode 28. While the New Yorker's bubbly personality and witty candor have given us plenty of meme-worthy moments to reflect on, her muumuu is far from just another piece of clothing that's passed the TikTok viral test. In an interview with the Today show, Espinal revealed that she only had a day to prepare for the show before being flown to Fiji, so she threw a bunch of clothing in a suitcase - including the muumuu she got during a trip to Portugal. \"Bringing that piece back to the villa reminded me of my travels and reminded me of the good days whenever I was having a bad one,\" she says. \"It was more than a dress for sure - it really made me feel grounded.\" @dontask724 just a girl and her moo moo against the world #amaya #amayaloveisland #amayapapaya #loveislandusa #loveisland #usa #fyp #viral ♬ original sound - 𓇼 Apart from the sentimental value it holds for Espinal, the muumuu bears cultural significance that's particularly noteworthy. The comfortable piece can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Christian missionaries in Hawaii influenced native women to wear the silhouette to further cultivate modesty. Hawaiian women adapted a more casual, sleeveless version - the \"holokū\" - for everyday wear, before it was renamed the muumuu. Fast forward to present day, the dress style is still acceptable in Western culture, and often a go-to purchase for vacations, Hawaiian-themed parties like luaus, and more. And of course, celebrities have proudly embraced the muumuu - most recently, Kris Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, and Gayle King were seen wearing them on a Mallorca getaway. Espinal wearing her own speaks to the diversity we need to see more of on reality shows, and is a surefire way to exhibit the fact that modesty is still attractive. During the scene in which she wore it, her partner, Bryan Arenales, complimented her look (despite her labeling it as a \"grandma dress\"). His support proves that you don't always need to show skin to be deemed attractive or desired - especially in the eyes of your romantic partner. While her exact dress isn't available to shop, we found similar picks that evoke the same level of style and confidence: Unique Kaftans Floral Print Long Tunic Dress ($3, originally $10), JaipurCraftandArt Cotton Kaftan ($27, originally $75), and H\u0026M Oversized Kaftan Dress ($75).
