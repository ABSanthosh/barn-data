    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-ballet-flats?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ballet flats have long been a wardrobe staple — the ultimate choice when sandals feel too exposed, sneakers too casual, and heels too fussy. But this season, the timeless silhouette is getting a playful upgrade, with designers embracing texture, whimsy, and a dose of nostalgia.Mesh styles — which soared in popularity over the past year — have evolved into a modern essential, with fresh takes featuring bold embellishments from bows to embroidery. Jelly ballet flats unlock peak childhood memories in grown-up, glove-like fits — and bonus: they’re waterproof, making them perfect for those sudden summer rain showers. Mary Janes feel newly charming in colorful linens and woven raffia, while darling crochet styles bring handcrafted, wanderlust-inspired vibes to any look. And if you’re craving color, butter yellow is the seasonal standout (do we sound like a broken record yet?) — soft, sunny, and surprisingly wearable.Though undeniably classic, ballet flats are especially appealing right now because of their balance: playful yet practical, timeless yet trend-forward, wearable yet anything but boring. Whether you’re pairing them with workwear for a commute, a summer dress on vacation, or denim shorts on a hot and steamy day, this summer’s wave of ballet flats delivers something for every aesthetic.Ahead, we break down the standout styles to shop now — each one primed for repeat wear all season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Ballet Flats: Timeless Leather  Classic and versatile, leather ballet flats that never go out of style. With clean lines, soft materials, and sweet bow ties, these shoes are easy to pair with just about anything in your summer rotation. Best Ballet Flats: Mesh  Mesh ballet flats had a major moment last year — and they’re not going anywhere. This season, the trend feels more refined: sheer neutrals, delicate embroidery, and sleek studs that add texture without the weight. Best Ballet Flats: Mary Janes  Mary Jane ballet flats are still going strong — now rendered in fresh, personality-packed, and heatwave-ready designs. From sunny stripes to colorful linen and woven raffia, these playful updates add charm to even your most laid-back summer looks. Best Ballet Flats: Yellow  We’re in peak butter yellow season, and ballet flats are a fun way to work the shade into your summer rotation. From soft leather to breezy mesh, these sunny pairs brighten up everything from denim skirts to easy dresses. Best Ballet Flats: Woven Leather Woven leather is a great way to add texture while still keeping things timeless. Stick with a round toe for a more classic feel, or opt for a square toe and higher-cut vamp if you’re leaning modern. Best Ballet Flats: Jellies  We have The Row to thank for putting jelly flats back on the map — and this summer’s versions are even more playful. Red and blue remain fashion crowd favorites, while bright green and pink feel especially fresh in mesh fisherman styles and cutesy Mary Janes. Best Ballet Flats: Crochet  These textured flats offer a handcrafted feel that’s sweet, feminine, and decidedly low-key. Whether styled with flowy dresses or denim cutoffs, they add a dose of charm without feeling fussy. Best Ballet Flats: Satin  The ultimate balletcore pick, satin flats bring a soft, dressy touch that works just as well with a summer wedding guest dress as they do with an evening outfit. They instantly make even the most casual pieces feel more intentional. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kendall-jenner-white-tank-top-49445450",
    "description": "Image Source: Photo by Brian Babineau | NBAE via Getty Images I'm a long-time Kendall Jenner fan - I appreciate the model's fashion, taste in men (hello, Bad Bunny), 818 Tequila line, and her POV on all things life and wellness. She's just plain cool. So when I saw her style for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference NBA Semifinals, I remember thinking: leave it to Jenner to make a simple outfit look high fashion. Well, the internet apparently agreed, and influencer and podcast host Tinx sussed it out: that effortless and sheer white tank top Jenner's wearing? Yeah, that's a boys' tank from Hanes and costs less than $2. The Hanes Boys Ecosmart Cotton Tank ($10) comes in a pack of five and has a sheerness that's perfect for making a fun bra pop. We've got to hand it to Tinx for blowing the lid off this. While we can't officially confirm that this is the exact tank Jenner wore to the game, Tinx tried it on herself and, well, it looks identical. \"The other day, I was fixating on this picture because Kendall's white tank is perfect, so I asked my loving community of fellow shopaholics, 'Where do you guys think it's from?'\" she explained in her TikTok video. \"They all said Hanes. I have on good authority it's a Hanes Boys Tank.\" @tinx #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Tinx What Size Should You Get in the Hanes Boys Cotton Tank? Now, it's important to note that this tank top comes in boys' sizing. Tinx got herself a large, and it fit her well - so I'll be ordering the same. The good news is it comes pre-shrunk, so you won't have to worry about it shriveling up in the washer or dryer. And because it's designed with a smooth, tagless interior and made of 50 percent polyester and 50 percent cotton, you can count on it feeling comfortable, too. The best part? It's incredibly easy to pair with leggings or shorts - way easier to style than a bodysuit - which makes it that much more wearable. If you really want to recreate Jenner's Game 4 style, you can even add a Knicks Hat ($37) to go with it. Either way, a five-pack of tank tops will never go to waste.
