Instead, the Golden Globes were an evening of statement-making for women of a certain age, both on the red carpet and the podium itself.In her acceptance speech for her role in The Substance, 62-year-old actor Demi Moore took aim at an industry known for its rampant ageism, reminding us that despite working for “like, over 45 years … this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor”.

    "description": "How you end the year may influence how the entire year ahead turns out. Specifically, when we're talking style, some people believe the color underwear you choose for New Year's Eve could be potentially prophetic. Whether you're attending a party or lounging at home to watch the ball drop, if you want to put thought into the color of your panties and what that hue could symbolize, keep reading. The idea? Each color is associated with a specific quality you hope to embody in 2025. Founder of PSYKHE and fashion psychologist Anabel Maldonado explains that the superstition ties into the concept of \"enclothed cognition.\" This theory argues that how we dress informs our psychological processes, thoughts, and feelings. Two researchers at Northwestern University, Hajo Adam and Adam Galinsky, coined the concept after their studies showed that people wearing white doctor's coats were more attentive during a series of tasks than those wearing white painter's coats. The reason tied back to their prior assumptions about a doctor's heightened ability to focus. \"While the superstitions have a much more metaphysical interpretation - aka the color will magically make things happen for you - I believe our ancestors were just missing the middle step: the fact that if we think it and believe it, we're halfway there to what we desire,\" Maldonado says, sharing that some of the women she grew up with in her Latin culture wore red underwear on New Year's Eve for a good love life. Ahead, discover the different colors and what they are said to symbolize. Then, shop selects from popular lingerie brands once you decide what you're manifesting for 2025. Expert Featured in This Article: Anabel Maldonado is the founder of PSYKHE and a fashion psychologist.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Perhaps you’re partial to a voluminous, wide-leg look or have never said goodbye to skinny jeans of yore (hey, no judgment here). Maybe a utilitarian-looking cargo style is more your sartorial speed. Regardless of your tried-and-true fit, 2025 could be the year you expand your denim horizons, as the up-and-coming true blues trends are decidedly a breath of fresh air. According to Shopbop’s senior fashion director, Caroline Maguire, the year’s front-running denim looks will be all about reinvention — specifically, classic silhouettes with unexpected twists. “We’re seeing a blend of nostalgia and innovation,” she tells Refinery29. “While some trends nod to the past with vintage-inspired washes and silhouettes, others embrace modern, statement-making details that feel entirely fresh.” She adds that the masses are seeking denim that stands out, be it by way of bold treatments, intriguing distressing, or unique fabrics.  Meanwhile, Erin Meehan, creative director of women’s denim at Frame, says there will be an emphasis on slim, sleek, and tailored silhouettes in 2025. “There will still be the presence of a play on proportion,” she says. “Women need multiple shapes in their wardrobes now to give them unlimited styling options and levels of comfort,  from super casual to more dressed up.” Without further ado, read up on eight denim trends poised to take off in 2025, according to the pros.  Denim Trend 2025: ‘70s-Inspired Flares Transport your closet back to the ‘70s with a pair of flares inspired by the bygone era.  “Nostalgia is driving the push towards the ‘70s flare that we’re going to see across both genders in the seasons ahead,” explains AG’s in-house stylist, Ashley Catuzzi. The groovy trend’s alive and well in the Spring/Summer 2025 collections. At Chloé, creative director Chemena Kamali serves up a high-waisted look, which resembles a pair designed by Phoebe Philo in 2004. (Fashion is cyclical, after all.) Contemporary brands like AG of course, as well as Anthropologie and Torrid are now offering the dramatic look — choose your fighter. Denim Trend 2025: Barrel-Leg Jeans Picking up where 2024 left off, barrel jeans are set to make an even bigger splash in 2025. According to Pistola’s founder, Grace Na, it’s the latest hero silhouette: “The barrel leg gives emphasis to the bottom half of an outfit, allowing for the top portion to be more fitted and paired down. When you find the right fit, this silhouette can be very flattering.” Celebrities like Blake Lively and Julianne Moore have also co-signed the billowy jeans — a testament to the style’s cool flair. Denim Trend 2025: Jorts  Sun’s out, legs out: Jorts will bubble up next year, confirms AG’s Catuzzi. In Copenhagen, Scandi-cool labels like Skall Studio and Caro Editions presented their takes on look, the former giving jorts a polished touch with its clean knee-length style, and the latter offering up a pair enlivened with bright red lip motifs and a cigarette hanging out of the mouth. Diesel, too, reimagines the classic bottoms for spring, showcasing a style with captivating long fringe details that go from the upper thigh all the way down to the calf. As for styling your jorts, Catuzzi is keen on strappy sandals, mules, or knee-high boots — go with what makes the most sense for the forecast.  Denim Trend 2025: Distressed Jeans “Distressed denim is making a major comeback, with shoppers drawn to its effortless, lived-in look,” says Maguire. “From subtle abrasions to bold, shredded finishes, this trend appeals to those seeking a relaxed yet edgy aesthetic.” The fashion director also notes that the edgy look is a surefire way to add texture and personality to any outfit. On the runways, designers like MM6 Maison Margiela and Diesel have made a compelling case for the early aughts-inspired denim silhouette. Denim Trend 2025: Bootcut Jeans Ready or not, low-rise bootcut jeans are predicated to emerge in 2025 — just ask Still Here’s founder Sonia Mosseri. “This has been a trend I’ve seen slowly brewing,” the expert notes. Designers, including Mosseri, are breathing new life into the Y2K-inspired look by way of cropped silhouettes, intriguing stitching, and more fresh details. Meehan is on the same page, noting how modern bootcuts with a more gradual, smooth transition from the knee to the leg opening are on course to reign. So, no, you won’t be mistaken for The O.C.’s Marissa Cooper. Denim Trend 2025: Baggy Cargo Jeans “On the other end of the spectrum, super baggy cargo will be back, too,” says Mosseri, referring to the aforementioned bootcut trend. The slouchy look is also the antithesis of the skinny jeans that have been unearthed as of late. With functional pockets and a feel-good roomy fit, it’s no wonder style mavens like Katie Holmes have welcomed the fit with open arms. Denim Trend 2025: Dark Wash Jeans Elena Bonvicini, the founder of celebrity-loved brand EB Denim, points to dark wash jeans as a look to watch out for over the next few months. “It’s coming with the minimal chic look we’re seeing right now,” she says about the up-and-coming trend. And she’s absolutely right: There’s something about a deeper denim shade that feels a smidge more polished than, say, an ultra-light wash. Denim Trend 2025: Double Denim Why wear one denim look when you can sport two? This seems to be the mindset of the industry’s leading designers, as the denim-on-denim look dominated runways a few months ago —  at Coach, by way of a jean jacket and coordinating roomy jeans, at Cinq à Sept in a floral print-heavy two-piece set, and elsewhere. The beauty of the look is it’s a breeze to throw on when you’re rushing to get out of the door. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Reflecting on the top color trends of 2024, a few contenders swiftly come to mind. Charli xcx’s Brat Green was the loud, abrasive color no one could escape, Pantone deemed Peach Fuzz the must-have color of the year, and at a certain point in time, it was impossible to leave the house and not see someone trotting around in siren red socks or tights. It was a year that embraced a diverse range of expressive hues, cementing the truth that there’s always room for color in your wardrobe, no matter your personal style.  In 2025, there are a few standout colors that are likely to gain traction. The spring/summer 2025 runways offer a peek at what’s to come, as does the street style and influencer circuit, which is already embracing powdery pastels (icy blue and petal pink, to name a couple), saturated tones of green and red, and a certain shade of brown that we predict will be everywhere in no time flat. If you’re keen to begin incorporating these into your outfits now, read on for our predictions of the colors that’ll define 2025 fashion. 2025 Color Trend: 24K Gold While butter yellow is surely on your radar already, a richer tone — 24k gold — is popping up on the runways of labels like Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and Gabriela Hearst, emphasizing the impact of a confident hue. Similar to 24k jewelry, with its lustrous, gold nugget-like appearance, this yellow can be incorporated as an accent, contrasted with muted neutrals or layered with a vibrant pattern to punctuate the look. 2025 Color Trend: Tea Rose The impact of Barbiecore can’t be overstated and while hot pink may be shimmying out of the spotlight for now, an onslaught of designers are embracing a gentle tea rose hue in 2025. From Khaite’s dreamy dresses crafted in powdery pink swaths of silk gazar to Simone Rocha’s and Ferragamo’s ballet-adjacent, petal pink separates, all signs point toward another year of pink. 2025 Color Trend: Icy Blue Ethereal, elegant and effortless to style, icy shades of blue are one of 2025’s most covetable color trends. Countless runways have endorsed the delicate hue, from rich-in-detail separates at Cecilie Bahnsen to floaty dresses at Prabal Gurung and Chloé. Wear it head-to-toe or as an accent — it’s among the most versatile colors around. 2025 Color Trend: Marigold A brand-new year often calls for a zippy color to perk up your wardrobe. 2025’s answer to this? Marigold. This cheery yellow-orange is cropping up as an oh-so covetable skirt at Prada, a gorgeous asymmetrical ruffled skirt at Bottega Veneta, and a head-to-toe pleated dress at Simkhai (among several others) for spring. 2025 Color Trend: Cardinal Red Siren red has been a staple color for the last few seasons — who can forget Tibi’s red socks paired with red ballet flats? Though the fiery hue will likely continue on its trajectory (it’s pretty timeless, after all), the 2025 runways have been pointing to cardinal red as a sultry alternative. Gucci’s purplish-red lace dress will be hard to resist once it hits shelves, as will Louise Trotter’s expertly crafted separates for Carven, which could be worn just as easily to the office as on a dinner date. 2025 Color Trend: Periwinkle Every few years, periwinkle prances its way back into the trend cycle, reminding us just how striking this color really is. Stella McCartney’s a proponent of the fanciful hue, translating it into a dramatic sheer gown that would look impeccable on the red carpet. A subtler alternative can be found at Tod’s by way of a structural top (best paired with slouchy slacks and sandals). And for the ultimate party dress moment, Brandon Maxwell takes the cake with his eye-popping halter neck frock. 2025 Color Trend: Chocolate Brown Rich, chocolate brown will play a starring role in 2025. This timeless neutral is among the easiest to style and manages to feel a bit more refined than a simple black or charcoal gray. Look to runways like Max Mara for inspiration on how to wear it: For spring, the brand weaves the elegant hue into a smattering of chic looks, from tailoring and evening attire to an oversized jacket and coordinated mini skirt that nods perfectly to ‘70s style.  2025 Color Trend: Frog Green Brat Green took the fashion world by storm this year, but the hue is pivoting in a slightly quieter direction in the new year by way of frog green. These grassy hues have become a favorite on runways that often have a hand in setting trends — think Sandy Liang’s cool-girl separates and Victoria Beckham’s memorable green gown worn by Gigi Hadid.
