    "description": "At this point, every day feels synonymous with a new fashion trend. Whether it's a resurgence or something entirely fresh, you can expect to see at least one hot topic du jour on your FYP each morning. In case you've been living under a rock, this month alone has brought an influx of trends redefining our shopping identity: bandage dresses (really the Hervé Léger dress), recession core, and the \"New England Summer\" aesthetic. And, as if we're not already spending enough, there's yet another trend tempting us to swipe our cards: jelly shoes. Of course, jelly shoes are far from new. While the popular footwear style is undeniably equal parts chic and comfortable, it's more than just a PVC shoe. The look originated post-World War II as a cost-effective alternative to shoes made from natural textiles such as leather and cotton. The first PVC shoe is believed to have been created by the French company Sarraizienne in the 1950s, often worn by fishermen due to their affordability and easy-to-clean design. By the '80s, PVC footwear had evolved to the term \"jelly shoes\" when Tony Alano and Nicolas Guillon launched their company of the same name. Major fashion houses, such as Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, started incorporating the style into collections. (Gaultier even collaborated with jelly shoe icon Melissa in May 2023.) Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Rihanna have also embraced the trend, proving its staying power. If you couldn't tell, jelly shoes are back, and we're here for it. Today's versions go far beyond the fisherman sandal, with silhouettes ranging from ballet flats to platform heels featuring playful details like hearts. Whether you want to nail the TikTok fisherman aesthetic in a chic way or simply want another fun summer shoe, shop our curated guide of the best jelly shoes ahead.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/megan-thee-stallion-love-island-swim-line-49448769",
    "description": "Although we're still processing the \"dump\" from episode 20 of \"Love Island USA\" Season 7, Megan Thee Stallion's episode still has us obsessed. Given the show's allure and many steamy moments, it was only right that the \"Mamushi\" rapper made a guest appearance. During her cameo, the star hosted a three-part challenge, which consisted of a twerking competition, a limbo round, and a puzzle race, which culminated in two new bombshells joining the show. Of course, she wore an ensemble that was sultry enough to match the night's mischief: a metallic gold two-piece bikini with matching, strappy-heeled sandals and jewelry. But let's be clear: it's far from your average bikini; it's from her very own Walmart swimwear line. The \"Sweetest Pie\" artist recently launched her Hot Girl Summer collection with the popular retailer, featuring 18 size-inclusive styles, including her look from the show: the Dipped in Gold Bikini Top ($18) and the Dipped in Gold Bikini Bottom ($16). Megan also caught up with the women islanders before the challenge in their quarters for some serious girl talk, and they all slipped into pieces from the singer's line. Iris Kendall and Cierra Ortega wore the Dipped in Gold One Piece ($28); Hannah Fields and Huda Mustafa rocked the now-sold-out Hot Girl Summer One Piece; and Amaya Espinal and Chelley Bissainthe donned the Chicas Fringe Bikini Top ($18) and its matching bottom, which is also sold out. Meanwhile, Olandria Carthen stood out in the Mamushi One-Piece Swimsuit ($28). Megan's new drop is in keeping with a recent trend: recession core. Celebrities embracing (or creating) more affordable products for consumers is nothing new, but the concept is especially referential in today's economic climate. Yet, Megan has mixed budget-friendly picks with high-end items in her outfits on many occasions from brands such as Amazon and I.AM.GIA. Whether you're a committed \"Love Island USA\" fan (like us) or shopping for your next tropical getaway on a budget, any of these picks from Megan's line will surely fit the bill. After all, it is a hot girl summer. Naomi Parris is the assistant shopping editor at PS, based in New York.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-summer-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Shoes — sandals, ballet flats, loafers, you name it — have the potential to make or break your whole look. As such, if you’re on a mission to level up your summer style, you can’t go wrong with refreshing your footwear rotation. Though there’s always a time and place for, say, classic white sneakers, we suggest taking a step — quite literally — outside your comfort zone by trying out summer’s biggest shoe trends, which are all over the map.  Firstly, designers are harking back to the past, introducing new iterations of footwear from bygone decades. One notable example? Retro sneakers. With slim silhouettes and bold, punchy colors, these vintage-looking kicks are real head-turners, as proven on the spring/summer 2025 runways at shows like Miu Miu, Proenza Schouler, and Loewe. Meanwhile (perhaps much to the dismay of some millennials out there), late-2000s-inspired gladiator sandals have made a major comeback this season. However, the latest styles are a far cry from the uber-high silhouettes once loved by the likes of Kourtney Kardashian, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Rihanna. And for something a bit more refined, turn your attention to of-the-moment woven shoes — from ballet flats to slide-on sandals, footwear is getting the artisanal treatment this summer.  Without further ado, scroll onward for a rundown of summer 2025’s top shoe trends. Put your best (and most stylish) foot forward this season. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Gladiator Sandals The rumors are true: Gladiator sandals of yore are popping up everywhere this summer, albeit in shorter variations than the knee-length styles popular in the 2000s and 2010s. In step with the return of the boho fashion aesthetic, the trend ran the gamut on the runways, spotted in the form of studded versions (at Isabel Marant) and minimalist looks (debuted at Khaite). To keep the look more grounded, style the shoes with a slouchy bag and denim shorts. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Retro Sneakers Following 2024’s Puma Speedcat craze, more low-profile retro-inspired runners — many of which look like they’re straight out of the ‘70s — are now infiltrating the fashion scene, thanks to the style’s strong presence on the catwalks. Always ahead of the curve, Miu Miu introduced the vintage vibe in vibrant shades like hot pink, turquoise, and butter yellow. Miuccia Prada also designed deep purple suede sneakers with a metal toe for Prada. And should you prefer a high-top silhouette, there’s a good chance the ultra-colorful pairs at Loewe will strike your fancy. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Woven Styles Woven accessories are synonymous with summer, so it makes perfect sense as that homespun-looking footwear is in high demand this season. For spring/summer 2025, the look made an appearance at Jacquemus, Stella McCartney, and Gabriela Hearst shows. One major draw of a woven shoe? They provide the breathability and drama of the mesh look without being entirely see-through. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Boat Shoes The fisherman aesthetic has taken over every facet of our wardrobes, and footwear is no exception. From the white and navy boat shoes at Loewe to Monse’s shiny brown pair, these new summer silhouettes have made one thing clear: Designers want you to set sail in style. And if you’re not near the beach or lake this season, you can give these practical shoes a downtown chic vibe with a breezy button-up and edgy leather shorts.   Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Embellished-Toe Pairs For spring/summer 2025, luxury labels gave the term “twinkle toes” a new meaning. At Chanel, Fendi, and Balmain, shoes festooned with rhinestones, pearls, and beads took center stage. Whether in the form of flat sandals or heeled mules, consider these babies the perfect plus-one for an upcoming wedding — they won’t go unnoticed. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Jelly Sandals Ready or not, the jelly sandals trend is back for round two this summer, with big-name designers turning the cute style on its head. Chloé, for one, propelled the look into high-fashion territory with its heeled thong sandals. Lacoste, meanwhile, leaned into the trendy fisherman sandal look. Though these shoes may conjure up images of frivolous childhood moments, they are more than apt for adults now, too, with a silhouette for every aesthetic. Summer 2025 Shoe Trend: Snakeprint Styles Snakeskin is giving leopard print a run for its money — at least in the footwear department. This season, fashion houses cracked the code for timeless yet fresh silhouettes featuring the sumptuous design. Jil Sander did so with its Western-esque boots, while Dries Van Noten designed a slingback wedge with a curvy heel. Make a snakeskin shoe the pièce de résistance of your summer outfits, whether you’re dressing for the office or a date. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-summer-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As the sun beams down and temperatures rise, we’re reaching for our lightest and brightest pieces. While summer typically calls for vibrant colors, this season there’s a fresh emphasis on powder pastels and zesty hues. And as predicted, many of 2025’s top color trends are officially having their moment. From sorbet nails and sardine prints to Mocha Mousse tones, the fashion food craze is going strong. Now, a full-color feast — from pistachio green to clementine orange — is being served across summer staples. Designers like Sergio Hudson and Emilia Wickstead showcased cotton candy pink on their spring/summer 2025 runways, while labels like Quince and Hill House Home have plucky shades like sky blue on offer. Meanwhile, fashion influencers are declaring cherry red the new “tomato girl summer” shade (unsurprisingly, we’re here for it). Read on for a deeper dive into each summer color trend — plus styling ideas for your vacation looks, work ‘fits, wedding guest attire, and more. DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Cherry Red In addition to being a major swimwear trend, bright red has made its way into every part of the summer wardrobe. The bold hue popped up all over spring/summer 2025 runways via matching sets, statement dresses, and high heels. Try it monochrome for impact, or pair it with pink for a refreshingly bright combo — we even love it with blue for a fisherman-coded look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Pistachio Green Whether sparked by Dubai’s pistachio chocolate obsession or runway momentum, this playful green is everywhere. The distinct shade (and all of its brighter and more muted variations) is fueling a summer dress trend that’s equally fun for daytime picnics and evening events. It also plays well with Mocha Mousse for a more understated, earthy effect. DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Cotton Candy Pink Slightly brighter than early spring’s baby pinks, cotton candy tones are having their moment. From nostalgic ruffled gowns to power suits, the darling hue balances whimsy and structure — equally fitting on a puffed sleeve top or a platform sandal. Look out for smaller pops via pink accessories, too (think silk headscarves and mini bags). DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Sky Blue From refined button-down tops to versatile maxi dresses and playful bloomer bottoms, sky blue was a design house fan-favorite… and is now splashed across staples from our favorite brands. Treat the bright hue as a neutral — like white or navy — or make it the star of the show through head-to-toe outfits and statement accessories. DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Clementine Orange Vibrant and juicy, this zesty orange stands apart from this season’s pastels, transforming farmers market citrus and tropical island florals into wearable pieces. The runways delivered bold separates and sweeping gowns, but accessories like swim sarongs, chokers, oversized sunglasses, and bags are giving us the most inspiration. DashDividers_1_500x100 Summer 2025 Color Trend: Butter Yellow Of course, we couldn’t forget about butter yellow, the color viral we’ve all been melting for. From runways to reader-favorite retailers, the pale hue continues to dominate. Luckily, it’s easy to pair with other pastels or crisp black for a high-contrast, retro-meets-modern mix.
