    "description": "Learn how to master tricky February dressing with our fashion expert• From waterproof boots to invisible jackets: this winter’s wardrobe essentialsI am fond of February. It means January is over, which is cause for celebration already. The end-of-season sale rails have gone, so shop windows are again a source of new ideas. The weather is still rubbish, obviously, but the light is coming back: with a pinch of luck, you may even see daylight on the way home from the office by the end of February. The first snowdrops are nearly here. I like Valentine’s Day, which I know is deeply uncool of me, but I like pink and I like chocolate, so what’s not to love?But February can be a challenge to dress for. The novelty of snuggly knits and shiny boots has well and truly worn off at this point, and maintaining enthusiasm for cold-weather dressing is a chore. Please keep reading for a puffer coat update and a fresh layering formula, not to mention a top-tier edit of the most delectable and affordable treats I’ve scouted from February’s shelves. No time to waste, my friends: another good thing about February is that it’s only 28 days long. Let’s hear it for a month that’s not just short, but also surprisingly sweet. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Come winter, style often takes a backseat as we refocus our wardrobes on one thing: pieces that'll help to keep us warm. The more the temperatures drop, the more we find ourselves yearning for cozy winter accessories like touchscreen gloves, scarves, and of course, cute beanies. Unlike bucket hats, beanies are one of those styles that genuinely looks good on everyone. And while functionality might be the primary focus of our shopping sprees these days, there are plenty of beanies for women that are designed with both warmth and style in mind - because if you look good, you feel good. Whether you're heading out on a ski holiday or looking to add some more warmth into your day to day, our shopping experts rounded up the best beanies for women that come in a range of colors, materials, and even prices. Standout finds include a Carhartt beanie that's a bestseller on Amazon, a pom beanie that's designed to go with any outfit, and even a smart beanie that's equipped with built-in Bluetooth (yes, really). Keep reading to shop our picks for the best cute beanies below. And for more shopping inspiration, check out our guide on the best cold-weather gear.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift's presence at NFL games has done more than just bring a new legion of fans to the sport; it's also given fashion girlies (like myself) an excuse to tune in each week for a glimpse at the star's commanding game-day looks. Last weekend, Swift attended the 2025 AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills, decked out in a head-to-toe Louis Vuitton ensemble that offered a grunge, Blair Waldorf-inspired take on TikTok's loud-luxury trend - perhaps a callback to the Y2K aesthetic she sported throughout her original \"Reputation\" era? (Cue the speculation of Swifties everywhere.) Keeping in theme with the red and black color palette of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce's, Super Bowl-bound team, the pop star paired a logo Louis Vuitton hoodie and beanie with a preppy mini skirt, lace-up boots, and burgundy Calzedonia 50 Denier Total Comfort Soft Touch Tights ($15) - which perfectly matched Swift's red lips (because of course). The pop star-approved opaque tights are made from a polyamide material that's thick, without being too warm - making them a great wardrobe essential to have on hand year-round, but especially come winter. And with over 10 different colorways to shop - 3897 Dark Red being Swift's shade of choice - you can easily mix the colorful tights into your game-day wardrobe or Super Bowl outfit, regardless of the team you're rooting for. While the under-$20 accessory is one of the more affordable options in the musician's most recent game-day outfit, Swift has incorporated plenty of budget-friendly pieces into her past WAG looks - including a $35 knit beanie and custom New Balance sneakers.

    "description": "Heading off on a trip and don’t know what to wear? Whether you’re venturing to the airport, the train station, or in the car, one thing’s for sure: Comfort is non-negotiable. Sure, trusty leggings and cozy sweats are MVPs, but, sometimes, you want to look a little more “effortless jet-setter” and a little less “just rolled out of bed.” Enter: travel pants. When curating our list of the best travel pants, we held them to sky-high standards: They needed to be versatile enough to wear straight off the plane and into whatever adventure awaits, comfy enough for the bizarre yoga-esque positions you’ll find yourself in while attempting to sleep on a long-haul flight, and stylish enough to pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe (and avoid the dreaded overpacking guilt). Bonus points to pants with practical perks like wrinkle resistance, technical fabrics, and — the holy grail — pockets.Meet our 24 favorite travel pants below. Once you experience the magic of sweat-wicking, breezy, and polished bottoms that don’t scream “athleisure overload,” we promise you’ll never look back.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
