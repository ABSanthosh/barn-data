    "description": "In the president’s second term, it’s out with the quiet decorum of the Bidens and in with loud American bling. What do the big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos promise for the future?The age of Donald Trump is an assault on the senses. There is a brutish grandeur to a president who, in his heavy, shoulder-padded Brioni suits, looks like a buffalo painted by Holbein. Geopolitics has been warped into a Lord of the Flies fever dream, presided over by a bronze face-painted playground bully. Bedazzled cowboy hats and Maga caps, YMCA and raised fists, speak of a culture with the volume dial turned up. Just as power has been cut free from responsibility, so has prestige been unchained from taste. Trump 2.0 feels like a Space Mountain ride with no safety bar – and it is just getting started.Fashion speaks loudly in this new world. Two weeks into the second Trump term, power dressing already has a new look. Out with the careful patrician decorum of the Bidens, in with a novel era of American bling. The cultured metropolitan allure of the Obamas is a distant memory, overlaid with bright lights, big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos. Elon Musk’s preposterous flight jacket. Melania Trump’s strange hat. Lauren Sánchez’s inauguration-day lingerie. It is, as the kids say, a lot. Continue reading...",

    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Tarnish-free gold jewelry sounds like the ultimate cheat code — pieces that won’t fade, dull, or turn your skin green, no matter how much you wear them. But do they exist on a budget? The short answer: kind of. Unless you’re investing in solid gold (which is expensive), no jewelry is completely resistant to wear over time. But thanks to smarter materials and better plating techniques, you can get long-lasting shine without the hefty price tag. “‘Tarnish-free’ means the jewelry is resistant to discoloration from air, moisture, or skin oils,” explains Jennie Yoon, founder and CEO of Kinn Studio. “While no jewelry material is completely immune to wear over time, tarnish-free pieces are designed to maintain their original appearance for much longer.” The key? High-quality base metals, thicker gold layers, and protective coatings that help plated pieces hold up to daily wear. One of the biggest game-changers in affordable jewelry is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a high-tech plating method that makes gold layers tougher, thicker, and more resistant to fading. “Recent advancements like PVD coating, thicker micron plating, and anti-tarnish treatments allow us to create beautiful, long-lasting pieces at a price point that is accessible to more people,” Yoon explains. But longevity isn’t just about the plating method — it also comes down to how you wear and care for your jewelry. “Avoid exposure to water, sweat, and chemicals like perfumes or cleaning products,” Yoon advises. “Storing your pieces in a cool, dry place and cleaning them with a soft cloth can make a huge difference in keeping them looking new… A well-made piece of plated jewelry can last for years with proper care.” So what’s the difference between gold plating, vermeil, and solid gold? Gold plating is the most affordable, but it’s also the least durable — just a thin layer of gold over brass or stainless steel. Vermeil is a step up, with a thicker layer of gold over sterling silver, making it more resistant to tarnishing. And solid gold? That’s literally the gold standard for jewelry that stays pristine forever — but at a cost. Ahead, we’re breaking down the best tarnish-free gold jewelry brands for everyday wear — whether you’re looking for an investment piece, fun heart-shaped design, or an everyday go-to that won’t quit. Jenny Bird Every fashion insider knows that Jenny Bird delivers the sculptural hoops, chunky chains, and sleek cuffs that instantly pull a look together. R29 editors, including fashion director Irina Grechko, swear by the brand for pieces, including the water-durable collection, that can handle nonstop wear. Crafted from recycled 14K solid gold and ultra-durable stainless steel, these essentials bring the statement without tarnish or green marks.  Mejuri By far one of the most beloved jewelry brands, Mejuri makes some of the best everyday jewelry — from delicate and sparkly to bold and lustrous. With a commitment to 95% recycled gold, the brand blends sustainability with durability, offering everything from solid 14K gold designed for nonstop wear to 18K gold vermeil layered over sterling silver for long-lasting shine. Whether you’re finally splurging on that investment piece or adding to your daily stack, these designs are made to go the distance. Kinn Kinn is redefining modern heirlooms with fine jewelry crafted to stand the test of time. With solid gold as the foundation — the ultimate standard in tarnish-free wear — and high-quality vermeil built for longevity, these pieces are designed to be worn daily rather than saved for special occasions. “Balancing affordability with quality requires a commitment to using high-quality materials, such as sterling silver bases for vermeil or thicker gold plating,” explains Yoon. The result? Investment-worthy staples that won’t lose their luster, whether you wear them for years or pass them down for generations. Missoma From bold, trendy statements to timeless classics, Missoma has made demi-fine jewelry a must-have. Designed in London and handcrafted for stacking, the brand delivers chunky chains, sculptural hoops, and stackable rings in recycled 18K gold vermeil, gold plating, and sterling silver. Covetable collaborations with fashion notables like Lucy Williams and Harris Reed — as well as an appearance in the Barbie movie — only add to its cult status. And for those ready to invest? The Missoma Fine collection elevates bestsellers in recycled 14K solid gold and diamonds — classic, with a twist. Catbird The purveyors of all things teensy, delicate, and just left of center, Catbird makes cool person jewelry — the kind you collect, stack, and never take off. Designed in Brooklyn and crafted with over 95% recycled 14K solid gold and recycled diamonds, the brand’s whisper-thin rings, glimmering chains, and tiny starry diamonds won’t tarnish, fade, or lose their glow. Catbird also practically invented the stacking game — and changed jewelry again with its Forever Bracelet, a clasp-free solid gold chain custom-fitted and welded directly onto your wrist for a seamless, always-on look that’s become a signature of the effortlessly cool. Monica Vinader Monica Vinader reimagines fine jewelry through the lens of fluid, organic shapes and nature-inspired textures, resulting in pieces that feel both effortless and quietly striking. From sculptural pearl drops and softly contoured gold bands to gemstone beaded bracelets with molten-like detailing, each design embraces natural irregularities that set it apart. Crafted from 100% recycled gold and sterling silver, the brand’s jewelry doesn’t just look refined — it’s made to last, tarnish-resistant, and designed for everyday wear. And now, traceable lab-grown diamonds bring high-wattage shine to the mix. Ana Luisa Mega-affordable and packed with all the hits, Ana Luisa delivers sparkly hoops, delicate studs, dangly earrings, and layerable chains alongside solid gold, pearl, and diamond pieces — all without the steep markup.

    "description": "Meghan Markle already has a reputation for incorporating thoughtful design flourishes into her wardrobe; over the years, she's subtly channeled Princess Diana's infamous style, frequently worn pieces from woman-owned brands like Cuyana and Birdies, and even been spotted wearing an eternity ring encrusted with Markle's own birthstone, along with those of her husband, Prince Harry, and their firstborn child, Archie. Now, in her latest Instagram post, the former royal gave fans a glimpse of yet another style that cleverly pays homage to her family - and keeps her kiddos feeling close. ICYMI: Markle took to Instagram earlier in the week to share a video in which she spoke about her ongoing efforts to support the victims of the Altadena wildfire in Los Angeles, as well as thanked Billie Eilish for helping her surprise a 15-year-old fan whose home had been destroyed by the Eaton Fire. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan) In the video, Markle is wearing what appears to be a simple black sweatshirt with blue jeans and her go-to Cartier watch - aka the perfect off-duty look. But upon further examination, attentive fashion girlies (like myself) noticed a unique detail that sets her top apart from the usual crewneck: embroidered cursive text along the collar that reads \"Archie \u0026 Lili\", the names of Markle's two children. The thoughtful Club Chainstitch Adult Chainstitch Sweatshirt ($73) is not only a sweet nod to Markle's two kiddos, but it also comes from a woman-owned small business in Chicago, Club Chainstitch. The bestselling sweatshirt can be easily customized on the brand's site, giving shoppers the option to choose their text choice, placement, and the letter coloring.
