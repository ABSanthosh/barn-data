    "description": "If you're a fan of Netflix's \"Love Is Blind,\" then you may be curious about the engagement rings, which are either chosen on set or brought in (Kyle Abrams presented his mom's ring to Shaina Hurley during season two, for example). Knowing that on \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette,\" the jewelry is entirely provided by Neil Lane, you have to wonder how much shopping the men on \"LIB\" could possibly be getting done outside of the pods while they're holed up from the outside world. What's more, if you're looking closely, you may notice similarities in some of the women's engagement rings. In fact, in season one, it appeared Lauren Speed, Jessica Batten, and Amber Pike wore identical rings following their proposals. According to \"LIB\" production company, Kinetic Content, all the men are presented with dozens of rings to choose from (Netflix said that in seasons four and five, they were all courtesy of Bridal Rings Co.), unless they brought their own. \"Whatever they choose, we pay for. Whatever we pay for, they keep, regardless of engagement ending,\" a Kinetic representative says. And even though you might recognize similar elements on some designs - like diamond carat size, band embellishment, and setting - no two styles are exactly the same. Kinetic even shared that in season two, the men proposing discussed their choices together, so the rings felt unique to each recipient. Of course, there are fans who have tweeted that they believe the women should be able to choose their preferred style before heading into the pods. That became a major issue in season two, when Mallory Zapata ended up with a silver ring picked by Salvador Perez, instead of her preferred choice of gold. Perhaps the producers will find a way for both contestants to join the ring-selection process in future seasons. In the meantime, keep reading for everything to know about the \"Love Is Blind\" engagement rings, including the similarities, the payment, and the process by which they're chosen.",

    "description": "When we shop, convenience is key, and that's why Amazon tends to be our go-to. Those stylish flats you've been eyeing for weeks? They can be yours in just a few clicks, without having to drive to the mall or wait in any lines. Whether you're already familiar with Amazon's array of designer footwear or are exploring it for the first time, the selection is brimming with chic styles. What adds an extra layer of confidence to online shopping is Amazon's hassle-free return policy - there's basically no risk involved. As long as you haven't worn your shoes beyond a quick try-on, a full refund is just a return away. But that's not the only aspect we adore about shopping for shoes on Amazon. Brands are usually really good at providing ultra-specific sizing details, a convenient touch that's often lacking in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. All of this is to say that you're in good hands shopping for footwear of all kinds from Amazon's digital fashion department - and that goes for designer brands, too. The retailer carries so many you might not have realized, including Staud, Coach, Tory Burch, Loeffler Randall, and so many more. To prove it, we did a little searching and rounded up 15 pairs of designer shoes we've been eyeing, all of which are waiting for you on Amazon. Keep scrolling to shop a range of styles, including the best sneakers, boots, sandals, and more, at a wide range of price points.",

    "description": "It’s that time again to peek behind the curtains (or closet doors) of Refinery29 editors to see what they’ve been wearing for winter (and will continue to wear for at least another month, thanks to Punxsutawney Phil).As winter progressed, we updated our fashion must-haves with tried-and-true styles we already owned (and happily returned to) plus new additions. From statement outerwear and trendy jeans to cashmere scarves and chunky gold jewelry, we each gravitated towards a mix of classic staples and bold designs, including some appropriate for transitional-weather dressing well into the spring. Click on to see which cold-weather styles we stand behind for cozy days in and out. Then, go ahead and cart up some editor-approved pieces for your own stylish 2025 wardrobe.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Closed Nikka Wide Leg Jeans“As someone quite petite, I'm always on the hunt for oversized jeans that don't swallow me whole. This pair from Closed is definitely an investment, but I've already gotten my fair share of wear out of them. They are buttery soft — they literally feel like sweatpants — and the silhouette feels streamlined, almost like a trouser, so I look put-together without feeling stiff. I've dressed these up with boots and heels, but they look just as good with sneakers or ballet flats.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnerships ManagerClosed Nikka Wide Leg Jeans, $, available at NordstromPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Alo Cashmere Light Frosted Scarf“Sometimes you want to add a scarf to your fit to keep you cozy and warm, but many are just too chunky and clunky (especially for someone petite like myself). It’s easy to get overstimulated on the train when your oversized scarf makes you too warm, and then can barely fit in your bag. This light cashmere scarf from Alo is perfect for that in between winter/spring time. I love the pop of red, too. 10/10.” — Kelly Washington, Senior Social EditorAlo Cashmere Light Frosted Scarf, $, available at AloPhoto: Courtesy of Kelly Washington.Sisters \u0026 Seekers Bryant Button Cardigan“Lots of cardigans remind me of school uniforms, but this chunky knit one feels both fashion-forward and functional. I wear it on its own, layered over turtlenecks, or tucked into wide-leg jeans and midi skirts. The charcoal shade in particular goes with basically everything I own. Not to mention, it’s incredibly warm.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterSisters and Seekers Bryant Button Cardigan, $, available at Sisters and SeekersPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Jenny Bird Art Heart Ring“I love stacking rings for a statement anytime I leave the house, and this heart-charm cocktail ring is my newest (favorite) addition. The chunky band and puffy heart may seem impractical or over the top, but I found that it’s a good weight (not too heavy) and the dangling charm isn’t distracting. So far, I’ve worn it out for my February birthday and New York Fashion Week (styled with a Y2K Juicy Couture heart chain belt), and I’m excited to continue taking it out for lovey-dovey occasions like date nights and weddings.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterJenny Bird Art Heart Ring, $, available at Jenny BirdPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Gap Barrel-Sleeve Denim Shirt“While 2024 was certifiably the year of barrel-leg jeans, I hadn’t even considered barrel sleeves until I set my eyes on this Gap denim shirt. I love when a simple piece is spiced up with a bold flourish — like sheer-paneled T-shirts or embroidered denim — so I’m obsessed with how unexpected these sleeves are. Here, I’ve gone for a Canadian tuxedo with double the flair: barrel sleeves and the brand’s horseshoe jeans.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorGap Barrel-Sleeve Denim Shirt, $, available at GapPhoto: Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Rouje Suede Big Bag“I’m a big bag person — I like to schlep around a lot of stuff, just in case. Previously, I’ve relied on wrinkled canvas totes or poorly made high-street styles that just can’t take the weight. After having two of such bags break on me in the middle of a busy and bustling London, I decided to save up and invest in something that will last.This Rouje bag has been on my wish list for years. Originally, I wanted the trendy zebra design, but decided to play it safe with this warm chocolate brown; I won’t get sick of it in a year, and it goes with everything. The bag feels top quality and holds so much stuff — a hardback book, journal, water bottle, small umbrella, wallet, wired headphones, and an assortment of lip products. And, though my 13-inch laptop is too tall for the bag’s magnetic closure, since it fits so close under my arm, I throw that in, too.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterRouje Suede Big Bag, $, available at RoujePhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Reformation Cary High Rise Slouchy Straight Leg Jeans“A couple of months ago, I walked into the Reformation store to find a festive NYE dress or blouse, only to unexpectedly walk out with these pants instead. Well, it’s a good thing because I haven’t stopped wearing them since then. The print adds just a touch of interest (and fun!) to my everyday winter staples — solid-colored sweaters, neutral layering tees, etc. — without looking over the top, and the fit is high-rise without being too rigid or tight-fitting.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorReformation Cary High Rise Slouchy Straight Leg Jeans, $, available at ReformationPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Buck Mason Vintage Interloop Oversized Crew“Never underestimate the versatility of a neutral sweatshirt that fits just right. I jumped on this Buck Mason pullover because it reminded me of an unlabeled sweatshirt I thrifted in Tokyo, which had unfortunately shrunk in the wash. This new addition has that same pre-washed, vintage charm, with an interloop stitching detail on the crewneck, but is much softer and resistant to pilling in the wash. I can’t wait to wear this on repeat this winter.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterBuck Mason Vintage Interloop Oversized Crew, $, available at Buck MasonPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Vagabond Valence Bag“I’ve been on the hunt for a red leather bag. Desperately trying to avoid one featured in a viral sponsored ad (that most people seem to own), I was holding out for something special. And I found it! Vagabond’s quality really is second to none. The color is pigmented and shifts elegantly in the light. It’s also surprisingly roomy with two extra pockets on the front. It hasn’t left my arm since I’ve gotten it.” — Kelly Washington, Senior Social EditorVagabond Valence Bag, $, available at VagabondPhoto: Courtesy of Kelly Washington.Good American Always Fits Good Legs Flare Jeans“Since reviewing these jeans (and testing the unique four-in-one sizing) to see if they actually always fit, they’ve become my go-to pants for nights out. The black wash is great for the winter and the trouser hem is refined, making them dressier than blue jeans. The “6-12” size option is perfect since I’m typically a size 10. While they are longer on me than I’d prefer, a pair of booties do the trick. But they’re certainly worth the price point, so I’ll be keeping a lookout when more of the brand’s Always Fits jeans become available in petite sizes.”Good American Always Fits Good Legs Flare Jeans, $, available at Good AmericanPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Everlane The Feather Cashmere Bandana“This 100% cashmere scarf from Everlane was my most-used accessory last winter, and that hasn’t changed this year. It’s so easy to throw on as I head out the door, and it doesn’t add much bulk to already heavy and cumbersome winter layers. Because it folds up so small, I also find it so convenient to throw into my bag or tie around the handle of a tote, in case I get chilly throughout the day.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnerships ManagerEverlane The Feather Cashmere Bandana, $, available at EverlanePhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Free People By The Light Of The Moon Earrings“These statement earrings are great for when I don’t want to do too much with my outfit, but still want to appear a touch more ‘elevated.’ The multiple shades of jewels in this style are so glimmery and pretty to look at.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterFree People By The Light Of The Moon Earrings, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Rails Getty Paneled Wide Leg Jeans“As someone who is barely five feet tall, finding patchwork jeans that fit has been a serious challenge. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve eagerly tried on an upcycled pair — typically at a thrift store that sells reworked vintage pieces — only to find that it’s too long and baggy for my frame. These Rails paneled jeans looked promising to me since: A) the straight paneled design looked elongating, and B) they came with an unfinished hem, so I could just snip another couple of inches off the inseam to make them shorter. The gamble paid off: The polished design has won me so many compliments, and it doesn’t overwhelm my height even with a wide-leg silhouette. The best part? No one can tell that I tailored these jeans myself.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterRails Getty Paneled Wide Leg Jeans, $, available at RailsPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Loveness Lee \u0026 Awe Inspired Snake Jewelry“Can you spot the pattern here? Yes, somehow over the last few months, I’ve been naturally drawn to snakes and serpents — given that we’re now in the Year of the Snake, according to the Chinese zodiac, it’s hardly surprising. Not to get too deep, but a life lesson that I’ve been trying to learn and embody is that it’s okay to shed the old and regrow as new; life is all about fresh starts, rebirths, and building new dreams. These pieces help me remember that as I go about my day, especially when worn together. (Not to mention, I’m also manifesting Taylor Swift’s album reputation Taylor’s Version this year, so it’s snakes all around!) Note: Unfortunately, the Ottoman Hands Rebirth ring has now sold out, but you can find a very similar design at Rachel Entwistle, or Rebirth style earrings at Ottoman Hands.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterAwe Inspired Mystic Serpent Cascade Earrings, $, available at Awe InspiredAwe Inspired The Gate of Hades Key Necklace, $, available at Awe InspiredLoveness Lee Snake Chinese Zodiac Signet Ring, $, available at Loveness LeePhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Sam Edelman Lyla Knee High Wide Calf Boot“It can be difficult for me to find a pair of knee-high boots that fit my calves and short stature, but when I tried these Sam Edelman shoes, I was ecstatic — they fit so well and looked so sleek. The leather is soft, supple, and stretchy, allowing the shaft to easily slide up my legs without them feeling constricted. But the highlight of this boot is in the unexpected details, like a curved kitten heel, slim square toe, and dainty calf ‘belt.’ So far, I’ve worn them to Christmas dinner with a mini skirt and glittery tights and to a work event with a cardigan and cozy leggings.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterSam Edelman Lyla Knee High Wide Calf Boot, $, available at Sam EdelmanPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Saint + Sofia Black Zebra Everly Pleated Skirt“This year, I want to only add new pieces that I know will get loads of wear (in my world, that means at least once a week). While I already own a similar skirt (styled here), I’ve worn it so frequently over the last three years that it’s starting to look worn. This Saint + Sofia skirt is the perfect example of a hard-working staple piece that fits perfectly into my wardrobe. Plus, it has the most fun, subtle zebra print and is made out of a heavy, warm recycled polyester — perfect for winter months (with thermal tights underneath).” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorSaint + Sofia Black Zebra Everly Pleated Skirt, $, available at Saint + SofiaPhoto: Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Jamie Haller The Baggy Painter Jean“After the '00s, I never thought I would wear cargo jeans again. And yet, I’ve worn this pocketed pair from Jamie Haller almost every other day this winter. Thanks to its high-rise waist, structural baggy legs, and darker hue, the silhouette is more polished than its early aughts counterparts, pairing nicely with workwear-appropriate blazers and cardis.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorJamie Haller The Baggy Painter Jean, $, available at Jamie HallerPhoto: Courtesy of Irina Grechko.We The Free Cori Waxed Jacket“I had my eye on this jacket for a long time before it came into my possession, and it hasn't disappointed me one bit. The deep earthy colors and classic cut scream winter to me. It’s roomy enough to layer a sweater underneath, and it provides protection from light rain. It also goes well with just about anything: This Free People jacket with a scarf, jeans, and chunky ankle boots has been my uniform for the chilly months.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterWe The Free Cori Waxed Jacket, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Cos Oversized Quilted Jacket “I bought this jacket in the fall because I was missing a casual coat that wasn't too heavy and could comfortably fit over my oversized sweaters. I find this dark sage green color easy to style with most of my everyday outfits — the silhouette is boxy, but still feels feminine. For the price and versatility, this has been a great addition to my winter wardrobe.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnerships ManagerCOS Oversized Quilted Jacket, $, available at COSPhoto: Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Eberjey Inez Washable Silk Printed Long PJ Set“While most of the year I sleep in mismatched concert shirts and basketball shorts, during the winter, I love a matching set. Eberjey’s styles are some of my favorites. Right now, I’m wearing the brand’s popular Inez silk set in navy and thick white stripes, which looks as luxe as it feels.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterEberjey Inez Washable Silk Printed Long PJ Set, $, available at EberjeyPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Kitri Darina Venus Intarsia Knit Sweater“Not to point out the obvious, but this sweater has extra appeal to me because it has my name on it (three friends who don’t know each other each DM’d me the link, telling me to buy it ASAP). Even if you’re not named Venus, there are plenty of reasons why you should add this to your winter wardrobe rotation. Firstly, it is incredibly warm: It’s been snowing non-stop, and this alpaca-wool-blend sweater has kept me so toasty that I’ve left my puffer jacket at home. I also love the whimsical heart drawings on the elbows and the cropped but loose fit.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterKitri Darina Venus Intarsia Knit Sweater, $, available at KitriPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.\u0026 Other Stories Brushed-Knit T-Shirt \u0026 A-Line Maxi Skirt“As soon as I saw this co-ord in the store, I simply could not get it out of my head. The color! The texture! The cut! Everything about it screamed, You need this, and I swiftly succumbed to its cries. It’s such a versatile outfit — I often wear the two pieces together, but I wear them separately, too. The short-sleeved cut of the T-shirt is perfect for this time of year, when you want to stay warm outdoors without overheating during the rush-hour commute. Tip: Tuck the top into your bra to give it a more cropped look and to break up the two pieces when worn together.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer\u0026 Other Stories Brushed-Knit T-Shirt, $, available at \u0026 Other Stories\u0026 Other Stories Brushed-Knit A-Line Maxi Skirt, $, available at \u0026 Other StoriesPhoto: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.Next Penny Lane Faux Fur Lined Longline Coat“I’ve been lusting after a Charlotte Simone Penny Lane coat for so long now, but I keep missing out — partly because I’m too slow to the brand’s hotly-anticipated new-season drops, but mostly because they each cost an arm and a leg. (The last time I checked, it would set me back a cool $500. Eeek!) Imagine my surprise and excitement when I stumbled across this stunning, chocolate brown Penny Lane coat — a dead ringer for the CS coat I was after — in my local Next store. It’s less than $200, but it feels so luxurious and well-made. It’s lined with faux fur, and the fuzzy shearling around the sleeves and neckline is so thick, you don’t really need a scarf. I feel like a very chic bear every time I slip it on, all snug as a bug, despite the winter storms we’ve been battered with.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterNext Penny Lane Faux Fur Lined Longline Coat, $, available at NextPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Damson Madder Tish Leopard Shirred Cami“This cami is the perfect mix of deep brown tones, resulting in an elegant take on the inescapable leopard print. It still maintains some subtlety, which is hard to come by with this pattern. I love how this looks both on its own and layered over a black turtle neck when it’s cold. I wore this to an event recently with all black, and felt very chic. The bows on the back are a nice detail, too.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Leopard Tish Shirred Cami, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto: Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Farm Rio Gigi Tapestry Mini Dress“I’ve worn this shirtdress three times in the fall already, and am excited to continue wearing it throughout the winter, styled with tights and boots for holiday parties and for when I’m going straight from the office to industry events. I don’t own many floral-printed pieces, but this one fits seamlessly into my wardrobe while feeling seasonally-appropriate. The flouncy, billowy silhouette is also super comfortable and a big plus for all-day wear.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterFarm Rio Gigi Tapestry Mini Dress, $, available at Farm RioPhoto: Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Like what you see?

But pretty much anything else in the colour has traditionally been shunned as unwelcome and unflattering. Brown is ugly, they say. It conjures up images of everything regrettable about 1970s style.

    "description": "Super Bowl appearance continues the retailer’s vibe shift from slightly boring staples into a raved-about brandAlmost a week on from the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar’s half-time performance is still being talked about. In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers and cult crossbody bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable cashmere jumpers.
