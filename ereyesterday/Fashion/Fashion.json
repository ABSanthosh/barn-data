    "description": "Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is estimated to cost women $2.5bn a yearMany shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same, just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. There’s a collective, decisive shift against all things quiet and demure — at least when it comes to 2025’s jewelry trends. If you’re taking cues from the runways about how we’re going to be dressing this year, prepare to accessorize with a 2010s-level gusto. Designers seem to be loosening up, letting go of the restraint they’ve practiced in the wake of “quiet luxury,” especially in the finishing touches department. The single gold chains and mini hoop earrings aren’t going away, necessarily — but they’ll now be sharing real estate with charm necklaces that you can make your own, statement brooches that tell their own story, cocktail rings that add drama to your manicure, and bangle bracelets that announce your presence with each motion. More is more is more. (The opposite of that one Coco Chanel quote, basically.) Ahead, discover the seven jewelry trends we predict will reach new levels of scale (and virality) in 2025. 2025 Jewelry Trend: Charm Necklaces You may have noticed a recent uptick in videos on your feed suggesting visits to DIY jewelry shops and charm boutiques, especially as personalization ruled in fashion. Well, those aren’t going anywhere in 2025 — if anything, they’re about to multiply, now that designers co-signed the return of charm necklaces on the runway. Chemena Kamali’s Chloé is the leader here, and, if we learned anything from the ubiquity of her first collection for the French brand (especially among celebrities), it’s that we can trust its viral potential. 2025 Jewelry Trend: Door-Knocker Earrings Brands like Saint Laurent and Etro have been leaning into maximalist retro prints that bring us back to the ’70s and ’80s. That more-is-more sensibility has translated to their accessories, too: On their recent runways, models piled on the jewelry, their lobes adorned with oversized, sculptural earrings that brought home the “I-raided-my-grandma’s-closet-for-this-look” vibe. 2025 Jewelry Trend: Brooches If 2024 was the year of the bag charm, 2025 will be the year of the brooch. It was one of Matthieu Blazy’s final decrees at Bottega Veneta, where he accessorized knits, dresses, and more with golden frog pins. (Nicolas Ghesquière had brooches at Louis Vuitton, too.) Much like the bag charms, brooches allow us to add a personal touch to wardrobe staples. They’re especially impactful in the cold months, when we have to cover up our well-thought-out outfits in bulky outerwear — pin a unique brooch to the lapel, and it’ll make you stand out in a sea of black coats. 2025 Jewelry Trend: Pearl Chokers The pearl necklaces trending in 2025 are less sorority and more subversive, sitting close to the neck and often embellished with a little something extra. For inspiration, look at how Chanel added its signature double Cs as a closure on a choker on its Spring/Summer 2025 runway (photo above). 2025 Jewelry Trend: Cocktail Rings In 2025, your manicurist will be getting their flowers in bushels, since everyone will want to get a good look at the cocktail rings adorning your hands. You can find one statement piece that steals the show, you can mix and match minimal bands, or you can dive head-first with multiple bobbles, à la Max Mara Resort 2025 (above). 2025 Jewelry Trend: Bangle Bracelets If you talk with your hands, story time is about to get more sonically interesting. At the Gucci, Chloé, and Dries van Noten shows, the flowy, colorful fabrics in the collection were juxtaposed with sculptural metallic bangle bracelets stacked on the models’ wrists. (In some instances, we even saw some cuffs clinging to the upper arms.) Don’t be afraid to double, or triple, up. 2025 Jewelry Trend: Long Dangly Earrings Yet another sign of the return of the mid-aughts bohemian look, dangly earrings are reentering the accessories zeitgeist, with co-signs from Isabel Marant, Chloé, Dries van Noten, Ralph Lauren, and more.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Zara’s latest drop is the kind to make you rethink everything in your closet. The silhouettes are fresh but familiar — think classic staples with a twist, like sculptural leather pants that move with just the right amount of drama, pleated minis that bring a polished prep-school feel, and handbags that pull an outfit together without trying too hard. And while these new arrivals are undeniably of the moment, they also feel like they’ve always belonged in your closet: instantly clicking with everything you already own.The best part? These pieces don’t require a full wardrobe overhaul to work. They’re the kind of instant-upgrade staples that take a simple tee or a go-to knit and make it feel more intentional. Whether you’re after a new pair of jeans, a spring jacket that is the outfit, a tailored trouser to level up your weekday rotation, or just a little something to shake up the usual, consider this your sign to add these Zara pieces to your wardrobe now. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Jackets From suede jackets to metallic bombers, these outfit toppers bring structure, texture, and just the right amount of drama to transitional dressing. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Tailored Sets These separates elevate your layering game into an art form. Wear them together, or split them up to style with other staples in your wardrobe — either way, the look is polished and structured. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Dresses We love dresses that do all the work for you. With silhouettes that shift between polished and flirty, you can throw these midis on with simple accessories and still look incredibly put-together. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Denim A range of washes, relaxed — but not overly baggy — silhouettes and throw-on-and-go layers give go-to denim an update. Lean into co-ords or mix these jeans in with breezy tops for sunny spring days. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Knits  Whether worn together or mixed with tailored separates and jeans, these knits are the elevated cozy essentials you’ll never get sick of. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Tops Curve-accentuating shapes, easy prints, and on-trend ruffles put a new spin on everyday dressing. Whether paired with relaxed pants or a pretty skirt, these tops strike the perfect balance between playful and refined. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Pants \u0026 Skirts Slouchy trousers, bubble skirts, mini skorts — this assortment covers all moods, from laid-back ease to office polish. It makes styling way too easy. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Shoes Footwear that does the most with the least effort, from strappy metallic heels to sculptural wedges: These pairs prove that good shoes are totally transformative. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara New Arrivals: Bags Structured shoulder bags, woven totes, and sculptural minis add unexpected proportion to day and night dressing, balancing practicality with just the right amount of intrigue.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lewis-hamilton-fashion-outfits-49193195",
    "description": "There's no doubt about it, Lewis Hamilton is a driving force in the world of fashion. The Formula 1 driver has become almost as famous for his love of bright, bold, and eccentric outfits as he has for his many championship titles, and there's no sign of him putting the brakes on his wardrobe choices anytime soon. With a number of races under his belt this season, Hamilton has regularly been spotted in the paddock wearing an array of looks that put him in first place in the fashion stakes. Notably, he did so before it became a trend among athletes as fashion pages dedicated to driver style like F1 Paddock Fits can attest. The 40-year-old has regularly discussed his personal style, which often includes a mix of emerging, diverse designers and pieces from larger fashion houses. In a previous interview with Vogue, Hamilton said: \"[F]ashion is about freeing yourself - it's about self-expression; it's about you; it's about slowly, over time, evolving and learning more about yourself and what you like and how you want to show up - how you want to be seen. What makes you feel great? It's a great feeling when you put on a piece of clothing and throw your shoulders back and are just like: I feel great today. That's what fashion does.\" Hamilton works with stylist Eric Mcneal; is conscious of the environmental impact of fashion; and is constantly striving to promote more diversity, both within motorsport and the fashion industry. He's cohosting the Met Gala in May 2025 and he's a fitting choice for the theme \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which celebrates the history and enduring impact of Black dandyism. When the famed driver attended the Met Gala in 2021, he used his platform to invite three emerging Black designers to his table (Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson, and Jason Rembert of Aliétte). He was also cast as the star of Valentino's Fall 2022 campaign, modeling Pierpaolo Piccioli pink alongside Zendaya, chosen for his influence beyond the race track. As he makes his bid to bag another championship this year, take a pit stop and scroll ahead for all the times Hamilton has turned the paddock into a runway.",

    "description": "The cutout dress is getting a 2025 makeover, and we're here for it. Though cutouts have been everywhere these past few seasons, they're getting more inventive and unique by the day.

Cutout dresses now come with accents across the stomach, collarbone, chest, shoulders - you name it. If you've been seeing the viral fashion trend all over TikTok and in red-carpet photos and want to try it on for size, here are 15 sexy styles that are worth scooping up.
