Think a teeny-tiny bag that can hold little more than a bank card. But now, the knitted micro-scarf is emerging as an absurd yet functional must-have.Triangular in shape, one of the bestselling patterns on PetiteKnit, the site of Danish knitwear designer Mette Wendelboe Okkels, is for a scarf that measures just 80cm x 13cm, covering just a small portion of the glands of the neck.

Now it’s to close, leaving devoted customers bereftThe premise of Old Town clothing was a simple one: choose from a limited range of designs and fabrics (cotton drill, canvas, linen or cord), provide your measurements and, a few weeks later, a box would arrive through the post containing your trousers, jacket or skirt, handmade in Norfolk by designer Will Brown, Marie Willey and their team of 10 seamstresses. But this year Old Town announced they are not taking any further orders and is winding down the main business – news greeted with anguish among their regular clients, including myself.“We’re 68, we are tired,” Willey says. “We made a rod for our own backs because we’ve micromanaged things to the point it’s worn us out.” Each had clearly defined roles – Willey dealing with customers and ordering fabric, Brown the designing and making.
