    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. New York Fashion Week is back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. It brings together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the coming season. This year, they stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts, coordinating sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS Shopping's senior content director Jessica Andrews and associate director Sarah Wasilak attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.",

    "description": "If you're a fan of Netflix's \"Love Is Blind,\" then you may be curious about the engagement rings, which are either chosen on set or brought in (Kyle Abrams presented his mom's ring to Shaina Hurley during season two, for example). Knowing that on \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette,\" the jewelry is entirely provided by Neil Lane, you have to wonder how much shopping the men on \"LIB\" could possibly be getting done outside of the pods while they're holed up from the outside world. What's more, if you're looking closely, you may notice similarities in some of the women's engagement rings. In fact, in season one, it appeared Lauren Speed, Jessica Batten, and Amber Pike wore identical rings following their proposals. According to \"LIB\" production company, Kinetic Content, all the men are presented with dozens of rings to choose from (Netflix said that in seasons four and five, they were all courtesy of Bridal Rings Co.), unless they brought their own. \"Whatever they choose, we pay for. Whatever we pay for, they keep, regardless of engagement ending,\" a Kinetic representative says. And even though you might recognize similar elements on some designs - like diamond carat size, band embellishment, and setting - no two styles are exactly the same. Kinetic even shared that in season two, the men proposing discussed their choices together, so the rings felt unique to each recipient. Of course, there are fans who have tweeted that they believe the women should be able to choose their preferred style before heading into the pods. That became a major issue in season two, when Mallory Zapata ended up with a silver ring picked by Salvador Perez, instead of her preferred choice of gold. Perhaps the producers will find a way for both contestants to join the ring-selection process in future seasons. In the meantime, keep reading for everything to know about the \"Love Is Blind\" engagement rings, including the similarities, the payment, and the process by which they're chosen.",
