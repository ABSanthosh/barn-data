  "description": "This September is a significant milestone in the history of Finnish democratic socialism; marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the first socialist-led coalition of Kalevi Sorsa. A journalist who went on to work for UNESCO and the Finnish foreign ministry on multiple occasions, while also going on to serve as Secretary and later Chairman of his own Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sorsa became prime minister following a general election held in Finland in 1972. Over the next three years, Sorsa presided over a truly transformative administration. Although circumstances led to his government’s premature collapse in 1975, Sorsa would go on to serve as prime minister again for three non-consecutive terms; in the process holding that position for a longer period than any of his predecessors.Vittorio Trevitt explains.

Despite the electoral victory achieved by the SDP, it failed to win enough seats to win majority representation in both the cabinet and in the legislature; a situation that remained unaltered during Sorsa’s subsequent premierships. The lack of socialist majorities in these two bodies, however, was no obstacle to radical social reform. What helped the SDP was the fact that the Centre Party, one its main coalition partners during the Sorsa years (though not always seeing eye to eyewith the Social Democrats), had a progressive outlook on social issues, advocating not only extensions to the welfare state but also the facilitation of rented housing, further educational opportunities and the utilisation of income policies in reducing inequalities. Additionally, the Liberal People’s Party and the Swedish People’s Party (two long-established groups that would become mainstays of various cabinets led by Sorsa) were advocates of activist, socially responsible government. Thanks to the intervention of the country’s president, a broad-based coalition comprising parties of differing philosophical persuasions was formed, with Sorsa at the helm. Thus marked the beginning of an age of reform that one could call “The Sorsa Era.”Sorsa’s electoral successes can be seen in the wider context of a global trend towards socialism, in which certain developments witnessed left-wing parties enter government in several countries; many for the first time. In 1974, after Portugal’s long-established right-wing dictatorship came to a long-awaited end following a coup, the Portuguese colonies of Angola, São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau became independent states with leftists at the head of these new, free nations. In Europe, an election held in Ireland in 1973 produced a coalition formed between Fine Gael and the social-democratic Labour Party, with the latter awarded cabinet posts related to social concerns that enabled it to realise important advances in social security in subsequent years. Five years later, an election in San Marino resulted in the formation of a socialist-communist governing alliance that would lead the principality for the next 13 years. “The Sorsa Era” was therefore not unique to Finland, but a reflection of international politics at that time. Notable governmentWhat was notable about Sorsa’s longevity was the fact that his SDP, unlike its counterparts in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, had failed to establish itself as the dominant force in national politics, with most governments that led Finland following its independence from the Russian Empire in the early Twentieth Century being of a liberal or conservative orientation. This did not mean, however, that the SDP remained a political outsider. In 1926, the SDP made a breakthrough when it formed a minority administration (albeit a temporary one), and nearly a decade later formed a key part of what was known as a “Red-Earth” ministry with liberal and agrarian-oriented figures. Lasting from 1937 to 1939, it was responsible for milestones in social legislation such as the introduction of comprehensive maternity aid, better dietary requirements for seamen, and wide-reaching pension coverage. After the Second World War, the SPD often provided positions in coalition cabinets, two of the most notable being the “Popular Front” cabinets from 1946-48 and from 1966-70 (the former communist-led and the latter SDP-led) which affected major reforms in areas like education,social security, occupational safety, and workers’ rights. The SDP also governed alone, first from 1948-50 and again from 1956-57. During these periods, it presided over notable undertakings in social policy. Amongst others, these included measures to improve accident insurance and combat TB (including free treatment for poorer patients), provide care for mentally disabled people, and facilitate employment opportunities. Sorsa’s terms enabled him to build on the record of past left-wing coalitions, leaving his own imprint on domestic policy in the process.The legislative output of Sorsa’s first administration was considerable, with a broad array of reforms carried out that reflected the democratic socialist aspirations of his party. New pension benefits were introduced in cases of disablement together with farmers’ retirement and succession, while a greater number of people became entitled to financial support for housing. The innovative Day Care Act required municipalities to provide either childminders at home or day care facilities; effectively making childcare an integral part of the Finnish welfare state. Extra grants for children under the age of three were introduced, together with recompense (both monetary and in kind) in cases of wrongful arrest, detainment and criminal damage; the latter including the property in addition to the person involved. Guaranteed pay in cases of insolvency and bankruptcy was also enshrined into law, along with measures aimed at ensuring safe working conditions, while the replacement rate of supplementary private sector pensions was raised by a sizeable amount. Legislation was introduced providing for free trials and the establishment of local legal aid offices (aimed at ensuring that limited resources were not barriers to justice), together with compensation for farmers leaving their profession for a certain amount of time. Laws aimed at promoting exercise in open spaces, providing special treatment in intoxication cases, and establishing separate taxation of married partners were also passed; the latter of which helped more women to enter the workplace. Government spending also went through an expansionary phase, which rose by double-digits during Sorsa’s premiership.Sorsa’s tenure, however, was cut short by gathering financial storms not of his own doing. Finland’s economy was battered by an international oil crisis, which contributed to a decision Sorsa made to stand down as prime minister in 1975. Two years later, however, Sorsa returned to the premiership with the Finnish economy in a parlous state, which the government successfully tackled by the application of measures designed to weather the financial storm. Symbolically, the policies pursued by the SDP-led government were shaped by the “Bad Sillanpää” programme adopted by the SDP in early 1977, which committed the party to more market-friendly policies as a means of strengthening the economy. Social progressThe economic difficulties of this period, however, did not lead to social progress being neglected during Sorsa’s second term, which exhibited a similar reforming zeal to the first. Poorer pensioners became eligible for a special aid supplementwhile maternity leave was more than doubled and paid absence for fathers of newborn babies was established for the first time. An additional week of general paid leave was instituted, together with requirements of firms to not only set up health services in the workplace, but also for there to be negotiations between employers and workers or their representatives over matters that directly impacted staff, like dismissal. Laws intended to safeguard consumers and provide support services tailored to the needs of certain disabled people were also implemented.In 1978, however, the cabinet fell; precipitated by division over financial policy. Sorsa regained the post of prime minister in 1982, but his new premiership faced a premature end due to internal cabinet opposition over a planned, significant rise in defence expenditure; with one of his coalition partners, the communist Finnish National Democratic League (SKDL), opposed to such a move. Although Sorsa made the SKDL leave the coalition, it was quickly replaced by a different party. Thus Sorsa came to lead his fourth and final administration; serving what would be his longest term in office. While some regressive decisions concerning the way pension increases are calculated were made, social policy for the most part was forward-looking during Sorsa’s last term. A compensation scheme for those afflicted by healthcare-associated injury and a universal income support benefit were established, together with a home care allowance for vulnerable groups and reforms to unemployment benefits that included higher levels of payment. A law aimed at putting a stop to gender discrimination was passed, together with measures designed to guarantee the safety of consumer goods, provide adequate shelter for those living with severe disabilities and those experiencing homelessness, and ensure supportive networks for those with issues concerning alcoholism and addiction. More people were also brought into compulsory pension insurance and a shared system of parental leave was inaugurated, together with a cash allowance for parents who stayed at home in place of daycare. This particular reform, which was promoted by the Cente Party, was a bone of contention for the SDP, who would only accept it if Centre agreed to greater public assistance for childcare. 1987 electionThese accomplishments, however, did not translate into electoral success, with the SDP losing seats in a national election in 1987 and a new administration formed under the leadership of the centre-right National Coalition Party. Although the SDP maintained a degree of cabinet representation in what became known as the “red-blue” coalition, “The Sorsa Era” had finally drawn to a close.Sorsa’s departure from the premiership did not spell the end of his involvement in public life, however. He went on to serve as Governor of the Bank of Finland, and back in the Nineties became involved in talks with employers and workers in an effort to hammer out an agreement between the two groups during a time when the country experienced a severe economic recession, with the former calling for an effective reduction in labour costs that trade unionists opposed (an agreement supported by the latter was eventually made). Sorsa also sought to become his party’s candidate for an upcoming presidential race, but despite his impressive credentials there was a clamouring for change within the SDP, with over six out of ten party members voting for a rival candidate; thus sadly ending Sorsa’s aspirations to one of the highest offices in the land.Although Sorsa’s political career was at an end, the SDP has continued to play a prominent part in Finnish politics; participating in numerous cabinets to the present day. Since 2023, however, Finland has been led by a conservative ministry (which includes members of a radical right-wing party) that has pursued reactionary policies in regards to social security and asylum. Although the next election isn’t due until 2027, the SDP has consistently outperformed its rivals in countless polls for over a year, strongly suggesting a swing back to the Left if the SDP maintains its momentum. The legacy that “The Sorsa Era” left for Finland, with the many beneficial reforms and higher levels of social justice left in its wake, is one that a future SDP-led administration can use as a roadmap in leading Finland towards a brighter, fairer future. The memory of Kalevi Sorsa, who tragically passed away in 2004, should live on not only in the hearts and minds of Finnish social democrats today, but in their future actions as well. Did you find that piece interesting?
