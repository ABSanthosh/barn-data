  "description": "If we look back to the era of kings and queens, there is a common figure lurking in the courtrooms. You’ll find them in taverns, traveling from town to town, or even as far back as Ancient Egypt. These motley characters go by many names, a buffoon, a fool, a jongleur, and most commonly, a jester. The jester has a long history, entwined with humor, power and politics. There was always a lot more to these colorful characters than met the eye. These were masters of mischief and manipulation. Here, Daryl Refuerzo dive deeper into the colorful world of the jester throughout history. Laughing Fool, circa 1500. Available here. Jesters Date Back to Ancient Times While the Ancient Egyptians did not have jesters in the same sense as the medieval courts, they had their own version of a jester. Dating back to the 5th dynasty of Egypt, many pharaohs had an interest in people from distant lands, especially those who differed in appearance. Some pharaohs employed pygmies from the south and kept them as entertainment. These Natural Fools were more of a means of entertainment at the expense of their appearance, and they are different from the Licensed Fools that we see in royal courts. Fools are Universal We see examples of jesters around the world, including both Natural Fools and Licensed Fools. Humor and wit as means of entertainment are a universal human experience that transcends any one place or time. In Poland, we have an example of one of the most famous court jesters, Stańczyk. He served three different Polish kings during his time as a jester, Alexander, Sigismund I the Old, and Sigismund II Augustus. The famous painting of Stańczyk by Jan Matejko is often one of the first images you see when you explore jesters, it’s memorable for his red jester ensemble, equipped with cap ‘n bells. Stańczyk was regarded by many poets and historians as a wise man who would weed out hypocrisy in favor of the truth. Another famous example of a court jester is Will Sommers, a jester during Tudor times. Sommers dazzled with his wit and was introduced to King Henry VIII sometime around 1525. He would go on to serve all three of the king’s children during his time as a jester. Like Stańczyk, Sommers held the same weight to his word, holding truth closely. It was said that Sommers and King Henry had a friendship that survived even the sharp-tongued moments that come with being a jester. However, not all jesters were men. Mathurine la Folle is one of the few female jesters we see in history, and she serviced the French court during King Henry III, King Henry IV, and King Louis XIII. Unlike other jesters, Mathurine wore an Amazon warrior costume that was equipped with a wooden sword. She was known for her sharp wit, but also for her assistance in catching the would-be assassin who tried to kill King Henry IV. These jesters, like the many others of their time, had a special place at the reigning monarch’s ear, they were able to tell them truths and even share advice when others could not. It was the court jester who was most skilled at delivering bad news to even the most hot-headed kings. Even the most brutal blow was easier to swallow when wrapped in rhymes or a well-timed joke. Who Killed the Court Jester? While fools and jesters could be found in most corners of the world for centuries, their motley-colored reign did not last. During the Enlightenment period, as powdered wigs grew taller and powdered egos grew puffier, the idea of keeping a professional fool around became outdated. While political satire did not disappear entirely, the motley costumes of the jesters held no place in royal courts, instead they were replaced by politicians and philosophers. Despite this, the jester did not die out completely. Rather, the jester saw an evolution. Shifting from their typical court jester roles and merging into what we know today. Modern Fools Today, there are many modern fools and jesters who carry on the torch of their witty forebears. If you’ve ever watched a late-night talk show, you can see the shadows of a court jester. A figure who addresses world events with a smile and a well-timed joke, all they are missing is the cap ’n bells or curled-toe shoes. We also see evidence of jesters in modern entertainers, in clowns, jugglers, acrobats, magicians, and even stand-up comedians. When you pass a busker or trickster performing on the street, you’re witnessing the evolution of one of the most common human traits. The ability to share in laughter. Long May the Jester Reign While the motley costumes and jingling bells of the jester faded into history, they leave behind a legacy that has stretched through the centuries. From Ancient Egypt to medieval courts or the modern fools we know now, the jester’s reign never ended. Whether whispering wisdom to pharaohs, mocking kings with rhyme, or roasting presidents on late-night TV, the jester remains a timeless figure.We should all take note of the jester’s lasting impressions. After all honey catches more flies than vinegar, and wit is always a sharper sword than wrath. Did you find that piece interesting? If so, join us for free by clicking here.",
