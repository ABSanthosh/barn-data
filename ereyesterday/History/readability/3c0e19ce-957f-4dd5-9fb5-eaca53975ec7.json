A depiction of the bridge on opening in 1883: Bird's-Eye View of the Great New York and Brooklyn Bridge and Grand Display of Fire Works on Opening NightIf you’ve been blessed with the chance to see the last visually-stunning scene in Martin Scorsese’s cinematic marvelGangs of New York from 2002 — which was a gorgeous time-lapse walk through the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge and the evolution around it through the centuries — then you were no doubt immersed in the depiction of the development of New York but also the changing landscape of Green-Wood Cemetery overlooking the East River. Nearly one hundred and twenty people perished during the Draft Riots of 1863. The country was in the midst of the American Civil War — and the Union needed troops. The Army of Northern Virginia had been beaten at Gettysburg — and General George Meade was under scrutiny for not pursing Lee’s Army. General Ulysses S. Grant who would take command of the Union Army in 1864 — however — had other ideas. Grant was committed to win the war as quickly as possible.No army under a Confederate banner would never again invade of the north. Their attempt at a decisive victory on northern soil to entice European countries like France and Britain to join the aid of the south had failed. The Union Army would utilize conscription to replenish their ranks and not everyone was eager to enlist.A few weeks ago, not long after 8:00 P.M., the Mexican Training Ship Cuauhtemoc lost power on the East River and slammed into the Brooklyn Bridge killing two people and injuring nineteen. Masts were broken on the two-hundred seventy-seven person vessel but it was successfully determined that the Bridge did not sustain any damage. Although the Brooklyn Bridge was designed by John A. Roebling — his daughter-in-law (Emily Warren Roebling) was essential in keeping it on track for completion when her husband Washington Roebling became ill. It would be more thanten years until the Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed and opened. The 43-year old Mexican Navy Training Vessel ARM Cuauhtémoc dates back to 1982.Back at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn — which has roots going all the way back to 1838 — when it began life as a final resting place for overcrowded churchyards. It’s nearly 480 acres are home to more than 550,000 graves — including some of the most prominent 19th century families of New York which includes the Roosevelt’s and also famous people like Leonard Bernstein. The cemetery holds both Confederate and Union casualties, as well as Revolutionary Warsoldiers. It’s Gothic Revival Gates designed by Richard Upjohn — provide the warmth of a welcome in the summer months to this day.For both the United States and Mexico — the collision a few weeks ago wasn’t just a collision. It was a collision of history for both nations.Michael Thomas Leibrandt lives and works in Abington Township, PA.",
