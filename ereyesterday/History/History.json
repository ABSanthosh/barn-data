    "description": "It lies just beneath the surface—literally and figuratively. A rusting American Liberty ship, broken-backed and quietly corroding off the coast of Kent and Essex, barely three miles from Sheerness. To many in the southeast of England, the name Richard Montgomery is familiar, even faintly iconic. Its skeletal masts still protrude from the Thames Estuary at low tide like a warning, or a forgotten monument. But beneath those masts lies something altogether more sobering: over 1,400 tons of unexploded ordnance. The wreck is a wartime time capsule that, by all reasonable estimates, has the potential to unleash the largest non-nuclear explosion on British soil since the Second World War.Richard Clements explains. The wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery. Source: Christine Matthews, available here. The story of the SS Richard Montgomery has never truly gone away. Locals have lived in its shadow for decades. Teenagers are warned off from daring swims. Journalists periodically revisit it. The government monitors it. Yet in recent months, the Richard Montgomery has once again found its way into headlines. With new sonar scans, rising concerns over corrosion, and questions about how long inaction can remain the official policy, this long-silent threat has begun to murmur again. A Wartime Wreck with a Dangerous CargoThe SS Richard Montgomery was built in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1943—one of over 2,700 Liberty ships constructed at speed to fuel the Allied war effort. She arrived in the Thames Estuary in August 1944, destined to join a larger convoy headed for Cherbourg, where her cargo—thousands of tons of munitions—was to support operations in liberated France. At the time, the estuary’s Great Nore Anchorage near Sheerness served as a gathering point for vessels awaiting safe passage.While anchored there, the Montgomery’s mooring reportedly dragged or failed, and the vessel drifted onto a shallow sandbank known as Sheerness Middle Sand. Grounded and listing, the ship’s structural integrity was compromised. Efforts to refloat her proved unsuccessful. Salvage teams began offloading the munitions, but before the operation could be completed, the ship’s hull split amidships.An estimated 6,000 tons of ordnance had been on board. Roughly half was safely removed. The remainder—some 1,400 tons by official estimates—remains inside the forward holds to this day. The cargo includes high explosive bombs, anti-tank devices, and aerial munitions, many of which have become unstable with time. A wartime manifest is believed to exist, though details have often been redacted in public summaries. Over the years, surveys have confirmed the presence of explosive material, but exact specifications are rarely disclosed in full.The wreck was declared a dangerous site, and further salvage was ruled out for fear that disturbing the remaining cargo could trigger an explosion. Instead, the area was marked with buoys, designated an exclusion zone, and subjected to regular monitoring—a policy that has continued into the 21st century. Living with the RiskFor most residents of coastal Kent and Essex, the Richard Montgomery is less a mystery than a fact of life—an ever-present silhouette on the horizon. Its masts, protruding from the water like the ribs of a fossilized beast, have been visible for generations. Schoolchildren grow up hearing about it. Locals give it a wide berth. And yet, for something that holds such destructive potential, it remains curiously normalized.Signs near the shoreline warn of exclusion zones. Maritime charts mark the wreck with bright symbols. Navigation buoys flash their silent signals to passing vessels. But on land, conversation about the ship is often casual. It has become, over time, one of those shared local oddities—like a long-standing crack in the pavement or a tree that leans the wrong way. Everyone knows it’s there. Most choose not to think about it too much.The British government has kept a close, if quiet, eye on the wreck. Annual surveys by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency check for structural shifts. A Department for Transport report in 2022 reiterated that the risk of explosion remains low so long as the site is left undisturbed. But concerns do resurface. In 2020, the Ministry of Defence released footage from a sonar scan showing the ship’s hull deteriorating, fueling public speculation.There have been no shortage of ideas over the years—from controlled detonation to encasing the wreck in concrete. None have gained traction. Each option, it seems, carries greater risk than simply leaving it alone. Successive governments have opted for cautious monitoring rather than intervention, a decision often criticized as kicking the can down the road. Yet the wreck persists, and so does the uneasy status quo.For those who live nearby, this balance between familiarity and latent danger is strangely British in character. Not quite forgotten, not quite feared, the Richard Montgomery remains part of the local backdrop. As one long-time resident in Sheerness once quipped to a reporter, “If it hasn’t gone up by now, it probably won’t—will it?” Back in the HeadlinesAfter decades of relative obscurity, the Richard Montgomery has once again captured national attention. In early June 2025, Kent Online confirmed new flight restrictions imposed over the wreck—pilots are now prohibited from flying below 13,100 feet within a one-nautical-mile radius, following expert advice aimed at further reducing risk. This no-fly rule, in effect until further notice, applies to all aircraft except emergency or coastguard flights.The news wasn’t confined to regional outlets. National broadcasters followed with commentary on broader safety concerns, describing the wreck as “a forgotten time bomb” in one headline. Security experts noted that the estuary’s proximity to major shipping lanes—used by LNG carriers and container ships—heightens concerns not only of accidental detonation but also of potential sabotage.Despite the growing attention, subsequent government statements have maintained a cautious posture. The Department for Transport confirmed that structural deterioration is ongoing, but insisted the risk remains low provided the site remains undisturbed. Meanwhile, maritime exclusion zones are still enforced and the wreck continues to be monitored by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Managing a Legacy: Proposals and PrecautionsOver the decades, a variety of solutions have been considered for the Richard Montgomery. Options have ranged from full ordnance removal to structural reinforcement or burial in concrete. However, none have been pursued—primarily because the danger of disturbing the wreck is considered greater than leaving it alone.The Maritime \u0026 Coastguard Agency, the Department for Transport, and the Ministry of Defence have stuck to a policy of passive containment. The site is clearly marked and monitored, with exclusion zones for shipping and—as of June 2025—a no‑fly zone prohibiting aircraft below 13,100 feet within a one‑nautical‑mile radius.The remaining cargo, estimated at around 1,400 tons of high explosives including bombs of various sizes and white phosphorus smoke devices, remains buried in the forward holds beneath silt and collapsed steel. As long as the wreck remains undisturbed, the official assessment describes the threat as low, though not negligible.While public imagination often oscillates between a catastrophic detonation and a safe cleanup, reality demands nuance. These wrecks are treated more like dormant geological faults—stable under current conditions but potentially volatile if tampered with. Lessons from the Deep: The SS Kielce CaseA comparable cautionary example comes from the English Channel, with the Polish freighter SS Kielce. The Kielce sank in 1946, carrying munitions when it collided with another ship off Folkestone. The wreck settled in some 90 feet of water—well over twice the depth of the Richard Montgomery, which lies at approximately 50 feet.In 1967, efforts to dismantle the Kielce ended badly. The Folkestone Salvage Company placed demolition charges on the hull and inadvertently detonated remaining munitions. The blast created a crater in the seabed over 150 feet long, 67 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. It registered as a magnitude 4.5 seismic event—detected across Europe and North America—and shattered windows and roofs in Folkestone, several miles away.It is worth noting that despite its deeper waters and lower explosive payload, the Kielce explosion still caused significant damage. In contrast, the Richard Montgomery sits in shallower water—its masts still visible above the low tide—and holds far more ordnance. Its proximity to densely populated areas and strategic infrastructure such as Sheerness docks and Thames shipping lanes makes its situation uniquely sensitive.The Kielce disaster remains a sobering historical precedent. It underlines the unpredictable dangers of attempting salvage operations on munitions-laden wrecks, and supports the reasoning behind official efforts to keep the Montgomery undisturbed. Conclusion – Between Memory and ResponsibilityThe SS Richard Montgomery is more than a rusting wreck—it is a persistent testament to wartime legacies and the decisions we make to contain them. Its silhouetted masts serve as a stark reminder that beneath the Thames isn’t just history, but latent danger.The Kielce incident teaches us that intervention—even cautious, professional intervention—can have unintended consequences. That wreck lay deeper and held fewer explosives than the Montgomery, yet when disturbed, its blast shook communities and created seismic ripples around the world.The Thames wreck lies closer to shore, holding much more volatile material. It is not merely passive decay; it is a hazard managed by surveillance, exclusion zones, and measured restraint. While erosion and rust continue their slow work, the official approach remains surveillance—not removal.In the end, the Richard Montgomery reveals much about our relationship with the past. It sits—watched, measured, contained—but unresolved. An explosive time capsule in shallow water, it tests the limits of prudence. As history recedes into memory, this wreck stands as a powerful symbol of the care and caution we must exercise in the aftermath of war. Did you find that piece interesting?

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/7/15/the-history-and-development-of-the-ballista",
    "description": "Throughout ancient military history, the ingenuity of engineers often turned the tide of empires. Among the most fearsome weapons conceived by the minds of Hellenistic and Roman engineers was the ballista, a mechanical marvel that hurled death with frightening accuracy across ancient battlefields and siege lines. Part crossbow, part artillery piece, the ballista became one of the most iconic weapons of ancient warfare, capable of instilling dread and exacting destruction. Yet despite its power, it was not always the decisive weapon its inventors hoped it would be.Terry Bailey explains. A depiction of a ballista being loaded and drawn. By Pearson Scott Foresman, available here. Origins: A Greek invention with a Roman evolutionThe ballista traces its origins to the Greek engineers of the 4th century BCE, who were inspired by the tension-based power of the gastraphetes, an early handheld crossbow. Engineers under Dionysius I of Syracuse, a powerful Greek tyrant, began to scale up this concept, producing larger torsion-powered engines capable of launching heavy bolts and stones. These machines employed twisted skeins of sinew or hair to store immense energy, an innovation that marked a leap from basic tension weapons to sophisticated torsion artillery.When Alexander the Great set out on his campaigns, his engineers brought ballistae along, using them for siege operations and battlefield support. But it was the Romans, renowned for adopting and refining enemy technology, who truly unlocked the weapon's potential. By the 1st century BCE, the ballista was a regular component of Roman military engineering, appearing in battles and sieges. Roman versions, often mounted on carts or towers, featured improved accuracy and range, thanks to meticulous craftsmanship and standardization. Design and capabilitiesUnlike the catapult, which lobbed projectiles in an arc, the ballista was a direct-fire weapon, hurling iron-tipped bolts or stones along a flat trajectory. Large ballistae could fire bolts over 300 meters with frightening precision, capable of piercing armor, shields, or targeting small groups of soldiers. The torsion springs, made from animal sinew or hair, stored immense energy, while the twin arms and a winched mechanism allowed for repeated loading.Its precision made it a favored weapon for picking off high-value targets: enemy officers, sentries, siege engineers, or even towers and battlements. In defensive roles, ballistae were stationed on fortifications to snipe advancing attackers or disrupt siege machinery. Decisive use in warfareThe ballista proved its worth in siege warfare, where accuracy was key. During Julius Caesar's siege of Avaricum in 52 BCE, ballistae were employed to clear Gallic defenders from their walls while Roman sappers and ladders advanced. Their psychological impact was immense, defenders were struck down from great distances, often without warning. A more dramatic example comes from the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE, during the First Jewish–Roman War. Roman ballistae, according to Josephus, rained bolts and stones into the city, causing widespread destruction and panic. The sheer power and range of the machines contributed to breaching Jerusalem's formidable walls and demoralizing its defenders. Ballistae were also used effectively in field battles, albeit more sparingly due to their weight and setup time. In battlefield support, smaller versions known as scorpiones were deployed among Roman legions. These could be quickly assembled and fired over the heads of advancing infantry, targeting enemy troops or cavalry at a distance. Where the Ballista fell shortDespite its power, the ballista was not a miracle weapon. It had several limitations that restricted its use in mobile, fast-paced warfare.During the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE, where Roman forces under Crassus faced the nimble Parthian cavalry, ballistae and other siege engines proved ineffective. The light horse archers and cataphracts simply stayed out of range, constantly moving, and avoiding the predictable trajectories of Roman artillery. Crassus' legions were outmaneuvered, their static weapons offering no meaningful advantage against such fluid tactics.Similarly, in the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 CE, the dense terrain and ambush conditions rendered Roman artillery useless. The ballistae, cumbersome and requiring clear lines of fire, were a poor fit for forested ambushes where speed and maneuverability were vital.Even in sieges, their setup time, dependency on trained engineers, and the need for consistent maintenance meant that if a campaign moved too fast, or the engineers were killed, ballistae could become logistical burdens. Legacy and influenceWhile gunpowder eventually rendered torsion weapons obsolete, the ballista's influence is unmistakable. The principles behind its engineering—torsion power, precision targeting, and mechanical leverage continued to inform later developments in artillery. Medieval engineers, for instance, developed the springald, a similar torsion-based machine used for castle defense.Today, reconstructed ballistae can be seen in museums and experimental archaeology sites, where modern tests confirm their devastating accuracy. More than just siege engines, they represent the sophisticated understanding of mechanics and materials achieved by ancient civilizations. A weapon of precision, not versatilityThe ballista was a triumph of ancient engineering, a precision weapon that excelled in static or siege-based warfare. When used in the right conditions, open siege fields, fortified positions, could be devastatingly effective. But in fast-moving or uneven terrain, its limitations became apparent. Unlike the sword or the bow, it was not a universal weapon, but a specialized tool in the ancient arsenal. Still, the ballista's legacy endures as a symbol of military ingenuity, a machine that combined the mechanical genius of the ancient world with the brutal realities of war. It remains a testament to how the ancients solved the eternal challenge of delivering lethal force at a distance, long before the age of gunpowder or rockets. ConclusionNeedless to say, within ancient warfare the ballista occupies a unique position, not merely as a weapon of destruction, but as a profound expression of mechanical sophistication and tactical nuance. Unlike many of its battlefield contemporaries, the ballista was not designed for indiscriminate slaughter or rapid assaults; it was crafted to do one thing with relentless efficiency: strike with precision. This made it a formidable instrument in the measured and calculated operations of siege warfare, where distance, targeting, and psychological impact could determine the outcome before walls were even breached.The story of the ballista is also the story of how science and strategy converged in the ancient world. It embodies the early fusion of mathematics, material science, and practical engineering, demonstrating how human intellect could transform raw physical forces, torsion, leverage, and elasticity, into an organized repeatable system for projecting power across space. From the experimental machines of Hellenistic Greece to the standardized arsenals of the Roman legions, the ballista represents a milestone in the evolution of long-range warfare.However, the ballista's legacy is not simply technical. It underscores a fundamental truth of military history: no weapon, no matter how sophisticated, is infallible outside the context for which it was designed. The same machine that could shatter fortress walls and terrify garrisons proved powerless against nomadic horsemen or guerrilla ambushes in dense forests. This tension between potential and practicality ultimately shaped its role on the battlefield. The ballista was never a silver bullet, but in the hands of disciplined engineers and tacticians, it became a scalpel—deadly, deliberate, and exacting.Today, the ballista endures not just in museum reconstructions or historical texts, but as a symbol of a deeper heritage. It reminds us that the ancients were not merely warriors, but thinkers and builders, people who saw war not only as a contest of strength, but as a challenge of problem-solving and innovation. In every sinew-wound skein and grooved bolt channel lies a fragment of that ancient ingenuity, echoing a time when wood, iron, and intellect converged to project power with terrifying precision.The ballista may have faded from the battlefields of history, overtaken by gunpowder and steel, but its principles live on in every weapon designed to strike with speed, force, and accuracy. It is a relic of the past, yes, but also a harbinger of modern ballistics and the timeless human pursuit of mastering distance through technology. In the ballista, the ancient world built not only a weapon, but a legacy, living on in our use of the word ballistics. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

Over time, the word passed into various European languages, preserving its association with military technology and the act of launching objects over distance.The plural form, ballistae, follows classical Latin grammatical rules, where nouns ending in -a in the singular (and belonging to the first declension) typically take -ae in the plural. Thus, a single device, (ballista) or multiple devices or generalization as ballistae when describing these formidable war machines. This classical inflection is still used today in academic and historical contexts when referring to ancient artillery.The etymology of ballista is directly connected to the modern term ballistics, the scientific study of projectiles in motion. The link lies in the shared Greek root ballein, emphasizing motion through the act of throwing. In contemporary usage, ballistics encompasses the analysis of trajectories, propulsion, and impact, fields of study that have evolved from the principles underlying ancient weaponry like the ballista.Thus, while modern ballistics deals with bullets, rockets, and missiles, its conceptual ancestry can be traced back to ancient engineers and their mastery of mechanical launch devices, making the ballista a distant but significant precursor to the science of modern projectile motion. Construction of the ballistaThe basic construction of the ballista was a sophisticated blend of wood, sinew, and iron, designed to maximize torsion power and precision. At its core, the ballista was essentially a giant, torsion-powered crossbow with two arms mounted horizontally on a robust wooden frame. These arms were connected to tightly wound skeins, bundles of twisted sinew or animal tendons that acted like springs. When the arms were pulled back with a winch and released, the stored energy in the twisted cords would propel the projectile forward at high speed.The main frame, often constructed from oak or other durable hardwoods, supported a pair of vertical posts with holes through which the skeins were threaded. The throwing arms made of wood reinforced with metal passed through these skeins, and their rotation was restricted to build up torque. A sliding carriage or track (known as a cheiroballistra in some Roman versions) held the projectile either a large bolt or a stone and guided it forward along a groove during the release.A ratcheted winch and trigger mechanism allowed operators to pull back the throwing arms with considerable force and hold them securely until the moment of firing. Some versions featured metal fittings and tension-adjusting mechanisms, enabling fine control over the torque for improved accuracy and power. To protect against the massive stresses of repeated firing, many ballistae had reinforced joints and bronze or iron brackets at pressure points.Despite its complex appearance, the ballista's construction was a masterpiece of ancient engineering, combining mechanical leverage, elasticity, and tension. Its components could be broken down and transported by carts, then reassembled in the field by trained Roman engineers, a testament to its thoughtful and modular design. GastraphetesThe gastraphetes, (γαστραφέτης), meaning \"belly-bow\" in Ancient Greek, was an early form of crossbow and a remarkable precursor to later torsion-powered artillery like the ballista. Invented sometime in the 5th century BCE, possibly by engineers in the city of Syracuse or by the famed Greek polymath Ctesibius of Alexandria, the gastraphetes represents a crucial step in the evolution of ancient projectile weaponry. Unlike later torsion-based designs, it relied entirely on mechanical tension in a bow made from composite materials rather than sinew-powered skeins.What set the gastraphetes apart was its method of operation. The weapon was propped against the user's belly, (hence the name), to stabilize it while a slider mechanism was pushed downward to cock the bowstring. This innovative design allowed the user to exert far greater force than was possible with a hand-drawn bow, resulting in significantly increased projectile power. The device featured a stock or groove along which a heavy arrow or bolt could be placed, and a catch mechanism allowed the user to release the bolt with controlled precision.The gastraphetes was primarily a siege weapon, not typically used by individual soldiers in open battle. It was most famously described by the engineer Heron of Alexandria, (Ἥρων ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς), in his works on mechanics, and it likely saw use in warfare before the rise of more sophisticated torsion-powered artillery. Though eventually overshadowed by ballistae and catapults, the gastraphetes laid the groundwork for mechanical shooting devices in both Greek and later Roman military arsenals, making it one of the earliest examples of man-portable mechanical artillery in Western military history. ScorpionesThe scorpio (plural scorpiones) was a small yet deadly piece of Roman artillery that served as a critical component of siege warfare and battlefield tactics during the height of the Roman Empire. Derived from earlier Greek torsion-powered technology, the scorpio functioned much like a large crossbow and was designed to launch bolts or stones with great force and accuracy. Its name, Latin for \"scorpion\", likely referred to the weapon's stinging, sudden strike and perhaps its claw-like arms, which drew back the projectile.Scorpiones were typically powered by twisted sinew or hair ropes, which stored torsional energy. When the weapon was loaded and the arms drawn back, this energy was released to propel a long iron-tipped bolt or small stone at high velocity. While the scorpio was not as massive or as destructive as larger siege engines like ballistae or onagers, it excelled in precision and speed. Roman legionaries used them for sharpshooting from defensive walls or on the battlefield to pick off enemy officers or disrupt tight formations.Compact and relatively portable, the scorpio could be operated by a team of just a few men, making it highly versatile for both offensive and defensive operations. During Julius Caesar's campaigns, particularly in Gaul, scorpiones played an important role in fortifying Roman camps and repelling enemy assaults. In the imperial period, each legion was issued several scorpiones, and they were often mounted on wooden towers or fortified walls to provide overlapping fields of cover.Though smaller than other siege engines, the psychological and tactical impact of the scorpio was considerable. A single well-placed shot could kill an enemy commander or punch through shields and armor, sowing confusion and fear. Over time, improvements in design and materials helped increase their range and reliability, securing the scorpio's place as a mainstay of Roman military engineering. SpringaldThe springald was a medieval siege engine resembling a giant mechanical crossbow, designed primarily to launch bolts or stones over long distances. Developed in Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, the springald was a descendant of earlier Roman torsion-powered artillery like the ballista. However, it was adapted for new battlefield requirements in medieval warfare. Unlike the ballista, which was often mounted horizontally, springalds were typically mounted vertically or at an angle and encased in a protective wooden frame, giving them a box-like appearance. This design allowed them to be used defensively from within castle towers and behind fortifications.The power of the springald came from twisted skeins of sinew, hair, or rope known as torsion springs which stored energy when the weapon's arms were pulled back. Upon release, the arms would snap forward, hurling the projectile with considerable force. Though not as powerful or far-reaching as trebuchets or mangonels, springalds had a much faster reload time and greater accuracy when firing bolts, making them effective for defending gates, walls, and choke points against attacking forces. They were instrumental in countering enemy siege ladders, towers, or light infantry approaching too closely.By the 15th century, with the rise of gunpowder and cannons, springalds became obsolete. However, they remain a fascinating example of the ingenuity of medieval engineers, who adapted ancient principles of torsion and leverage to meet the needs of their time. Reconstructed models and manuscript illustrations provide valuable insight into their construction and deployment, showing how medieval defenders sought a balance between rate of fire, accuracy, and destructive potential.",

    "description": "Edward Said brought the question of Palestine into the American mainstream. He taught at Columbia University for nearly 40 years, and today, more than two decades after his death, pro-Palestine student protesters on that campus and others have invoked his name. Meanwhile, his interviews circulate on social media and his books are taught at universities around the world. On this episode: the story of the man who pushed for recognition of the Palestinian perspective, the pushback he faced, and the dangers he foresaw.To access bonus episodes and listen to Throughline sponsor-free, subscribe to Throughline+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/throughline.Learn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",

    "description": "What's the role of government in society? What do we mean when we talk about individual responsibility? What makes us free? 'Neoliberalism' might feel like a squishy term that's hard to define and understand. But this ideology, founded by a group of men in the Swiss Alps, is a political project that has dominated our economic system for decades. In the name of free market fundamentals, the forces behind neoliberalism act like an invisible hand, shaping almost every aspect of our lives.
