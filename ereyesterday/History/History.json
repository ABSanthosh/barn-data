    "description": "There are many old tales that are still spoken of today. And one such tale in British history is Camelot and King Arthur. Here, Sam Davey considers the tale with a modern twist. Sam’s new book, The Chosen Queen! is here: Amazon US | Amazon UK A depiction of King Arthur from the Nuremberg Chronicle.There are certain historical episodes that, despite their antiquity are still very much part of our modern western cultural identity. For example,  Alexander the Great and the cutting of the Gordian knot, the doomed love of Antony and Cleopatra, Nero fiddling whilst Rome burns, King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone… They provide us with examples of conduct and attributes we may wish to emulate – like Alexander’s decisiveness and lateral thinking; or behaviour to actively avoid – no one admires Nero’s cavalier disregard for the lives and fortunes of others, whilst indulging his own hobbies and desires (oh, hang on….). Sometimes they even provide role models that we can look up to and aspire to emulate – like the story of Arthur, an unknown and relatively lowly individual, who by one simple, unexpected act, becomes a King. But “wait a minute” I hear you say, “did King Arthur actually exist?”  Existence?There is still debate as to the verifiable existence of a fifth century Britannic king called Arthur. The British Isles had been first invaded by Julius Caesar in 55 BCE. and remained under the control of the Roman Empire until, in 410 CE, the Visigoths invaded the Rome, and the Empire, forced to deploy all its forces in defence, withdrew its troops and administrators from the British Isles. This plunged Britannia into the social, economic and political disorder that have traditionally been called the Dark Ages. In his book The Anglo Saxons: A history of the beginnings of England: 400 to 1066 (Pegasus Books, 2021) historian Marc Morris states that at this point in history: “Britain was a failed state”. Its civic institutions were in disarray, its peoples leaderless. The land was ripe for the taking, and the Angles, Saxons and Jutes – war-like tribes from Germany and the Netherlands - did exactly that.It is against this backdrop of chaos, violence and confusion that the stories of Arthur –  his Knights and his Round Table – are set. References to  Arthur appear in early historical sources – such as the  10th century Annales Cambiae and the Historia Brittonum (828 CE), but it is not until the twelfth century, and the publication of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae (The History of the Kings of Brittain) that we find a  detailed depiction of  King Arthur as a mighty warrior, who defeated the invaders and held the Saxons at bay.The veracity of these Histories has frequently been questioned, and although recent research has revealed evidence to support the idea of a British resurgence during the late fifth and early sixth centuries – aligning with the supposed dates of Arthur’s reign, it is not possible to say with any certainty that he existed. What is certain however, is that the idea of Camelot and all that it has come to represent has been used for centuries to reinforce an ideal of ethical behaviour and strong leadership.Elizabeth Proctor in \"The Legendary King: How the Figure of King Arthur Shaped a National Identity and the Field of Archaeology in Britain\" (2017, University of Maine) notes that:“It is important to recognize that the contemporary version of Arthur is the result of various political forces from the past.  Different traits were added to his character in an attempt to connect the often unfamiliar ruling elite with the masses and the history of the land they were trying to control”. King Arthur has long been a symbol of British identity, supposedly the very embodiment of the ideals of chivalry, loyalty and moral rectitude. But as I looked into the early writings and began to unpick them, it became clear to me that there was a darker side to the story. I began to realise that the origins of Camelot were not to be found in the almost comedic tale of lost and found identity that surrounds the extraction of the sword of the stone, but in a tangled web of deceit, political machination,  and  the rape and abuse of his mother, Igraine of Cornwall.  StoriesThis led me to consider not whether Arthur did or did not exist as an historical figure -  that is something we need further evidence to determine - but to ask what for me is a rather more important question:   Why do we continue to see the stories of Camelot through a Hollywood-lens of charming animation, musical-comedy and knights doing the can-can, when at their heart is a blood-feud as violent and destructive as any Greek Tragedy?  This is the perspective that I seek to challenge, and in my book The Chosen Queen,  I begin at the beginning – with the conception of Arthur and the events that led up to it. The story goes as follows: Igraine was married to Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, with whom she had several children. Uther Pendragon, who had recently inherited the throne of Britain, becomes infatuated with Igraine and tries to force his attentions upon her. Igraine informs her husband, and they leave the court without Uther’s consent. This is seen as treason, and Uther declares war on Gorlois,  slays him, and rapes Igraine, who conceives Arthur.  When Arthur is born, he is taken away from Igraine and fostered, growing up knowing nothing of his identity or family. His sisters, Morgan and Morgause, blame their half-brother for the death of their father, the destruction of the family unit, and the disgrace of their mother.In every version of the story I have read, the rape of Igraine is little more than a footnote. It is not questioned, and its implications are given little consideration. But to ignore it, and hold up these tales as examples of moral rectitude is equivalent to ignoring the facts of slavery and imperialism.This literary silencing of a victim of rape is, sadly, representative of the way rape victims have long been treated. Rape victims have often been advised not to report their attack, or have been challenged, shamed and disbelieved if they do so. The recent case in France, in which Giselle Pelicot, drugged and then raped by her husband and numerous others over a nine-year period, refused to be shamed by what had happened to her,  is inspirational, and I hope marks a change in the way society will regard rape, its victims and its perpetrators in the future.In The Chosen Queen I call into question the idea that Arthur and the tales of Camelot necessarily provide us with a positive example of ethical leadership, seeking to provide another voice to counter balance our received understanding. I also seek to give a voice to a woman who has been silenced, and in doing so, pay tribute to others, whose voices have not been heard. Sam’s new book, The Chosen Queen! is available  here: Amazon US | Amazon UK",

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/6/3/dagobert-i-the-politically-ambitious-7th-century-king-of-the-franks",
    "description": "Dagobert I ( 603/605-639 CE), a prominent figure in the Merovingian dynasty, ruled as the King of Austrasia (623–634) and eventually as the King of all the Franks (629–639). His reign marked a period of relative unity and administrative consolidation, though it was often marred by political intrigues, external threats, and internal dissent. Dagobert's leadership qualities, political ambitions, strengths, and weaknesses left a lasting imprint on early medieval Europe.Terry Bailey explains.  Treasures of Dagobert from a 19th century book.Born into the Merovingian dynasty, Dagobert was the eldest son of King Chlothar II. The political climate of the early 7th century was dominated by internal strife within the Frankish territories, divided into Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy. To ensure stability and appease the Austrasian nobles, Chlothar appointed Dagobert as the sub-king of Austrasia in 623 CE. Despite his youth, Dagobert showed an early aptitude for governance and diplomacy, bolstered by his chief advisor, Pepin of Landen, who later became a foundational figure in the rise of the Carolingians.Upon his father's death in 629, Dagobert sought to consolidate his power over the entire Frankish realm. He deftly neutralized his rivals, including his half-brother Charibert II, who briefly ruled over Aquitaine before being assassinated, likely on Dagobert's orders. By 632, Dagobert was the undisputed ruler of the Frankish kingdoms, a feat rarely achieved in the fragmented Merovingian era.Dagobert's reign was characterized by his ambition to strengthen royal authority, curtailing the growing power of the Frankish nobility. He implemented significant administrative reforms, sought alliances with powerful aristocrats, and maintained a court that reflected the grandeur of his aspirations.He was also a patron of the Church, founding several monasteries, including the famed Abbey of Saint-Denis near Paris, which became the royal necropolis of the French monarchy. His support of the Church not only solidified his legitimacy but also provided a moral counterbalance to his often ruthless political maneuvers.Dagobert demonstrated a keen interest in diplomacy. He maintained relations with neighboring powers, including Byzantium and the Lombards, and successfully negotiated treaties to secure Frankish borders. His reign saw campaigns against the Slavs and Saxons in the east, though his success in these ventures was limited, reflecting both his strengths in negotiation and his challenges in military command. Strengths and weaknessesDagobert's greatest strength lay in his political acumen. He understood the delicate balance of power required to govern a fragmented kingdom. His ability to play rival factions against each other, while maintaining a semblance of unity, showcased his diplomatic skills. His cultural patronage, particularly his support of the Church, ensured his place in the annals of medieval history.However, Dagobert's reign was not without flaws. His centralization efforts often alienated the regional nobility, leading to sporadic revolts. His taxation policies, aimed at funding his court and military campaigns, were deeply unpopular among his subjects. Moreover, his inability to establish a robust system of succession weakened the Merovingian dynasty after his death, as his sons Clovis II and Sigebert III became pawns in the hands of powerful noble factions.Dagobert I's reign marked a turning point for the Merovingian dynasty. While his efforts at consolidation were not entirely successful, they provided a template for future rulers. His close relationship with the Church laid the groundwork for the Carolingian dynasty's eventual alliance with religious institutions, a cornerstone of medieval European governance.In popular memory, Dagobert is often remembered for the chansons de geste and legends that extol his virtues while glossing over his political machinations. The phrase \"Le bon roi Dagobert\" (The good King Dagobert), immortalized in French folklore, reflects the romanticized view of his rule, despite its complexities.Dagobert I's life and reign encapsulate the challenges of early medieval kingship, a precarious balance of ambition, governance, and personal flaws. His legacy, though overshadowed by the eventual rise of the Carolingians, remains a testament to the enduring struggle for unity and authority in the Frankish world.In conclusion, Dagobert I's reign was a pivotal chapter in the history of the Merovingian dynasty and early medieval Europe. His relentless pursuit of unity in a fragmented Frankish kingdom, coupled with his administrative reforms and diplomatic ventures, showcased his vision of centralized authority. Despite the political intrigues and controversies that marred his rule, Dagobert's accomplishments in governance, cultural patronage, and Church relations set significant precedents for subsequent monarchs.Yet, Dagobert's reign also underscored the inherent difficulties of maintaining control over a vast and diverse realm. His strained relations with the nobility, unpopular fiscal policies, and failure to establish a stable succession plan highlighted the limitations of personal ambition in the face of systemic challenges. These shortcomings ultimately contributed to the gradual decline of Merovingian power, paving the way for the rise of the Carolingian dynasty.Dagobert I's dual legacy, one of ambition and fragility, offers valuable knowledge into the complexities of leadership in early medieval Europe. As both a unifier and a flawed ruler, he stands as a reminder of the precarious nature of kingship during this turbulent era. His life and reign remain a rich source for understanding the evolution of governance, the interplay of religion and politics, and the enduring quest for unity amidst diversity. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

The death of Dagobert I, occurred at Épinay-sur-Seine, near Paris, after a brief illness. Historical sources, including Frankish chronicles and hagiographies, offer limited and sometimes contradictory information about his final days. However, most agree that he died of natural causes, likely from some form of illness or disease, as was common in the early medieval period. There is no evidence of assassination or battle-related death. Dagobert was buried at the Basilica of Saint-Denis, a royal necropolis just north of Paris. His tomb became a focal point of Frankish royal burial customs, reinforcing the sacred connection between kingship and the Church. Over time, hagiographers embellished his life and death, with legends portraying him as a sinner who was saved through the intercession of Saint-Denis. This religious narrative aimed to elevate Dagobert's status posthumously and align his legacy with Christian sanctity, even as real political control was slipping from the hands of the Merovingians. Military campaigns and territorial controlDagobert I's reign was not defined by sweeping military conquest but by strategic campaigns aimed at reinforcing the Frankish borders, asserting dominance over rebellious territories, and preserving internal order. His approach to warfare was largely reactive, dealing with external threats and internal instability as they arose, though not without ambition for territorial influence. Campaign against the Slavs (Wends)One of Dagobert's most notable military actions was his campaign against the Slavs, specifically the Wends, who had settled in regions east of the Frankish realm (in modern-day Saxony and Bohemia). These Slavic tribes had been pushing into Thuringian territory, threatening Austrasian interests.In 631, Dagobert led a joint military expedition along with his allies, including the Lombards and the Bavarians. The campaign was initially intended to be a show of Frankish military strength and to secure the Elbe frontier. However, it turned into a significant setback. The Slavs, under their leader Samo (who had established a Slavic confederation), ambushed and defeated the Frankish forces at the Battle of Wogastisburg.The defeat was a major embarrassment for Dagobert and highlighted his limitations as a military commander. It also marked one of the first major defeats of a Frankish army at the hands of a Slavic confederation, underlining the growing challenge posed by tribal coalitions on the empire's periphery.Despite the failure, the campaign had lasting effects: it revealed the limitations of centralized Frankish power and the necessity of cooperation with semi-independent regional dukes, such as those in Bavaria and Alemannia. Dagobert would later rely more heavily on diplomacy and strategic alliances in these frontier areas. Control over Aquitaine and the Death of Charibert IIThough not a campaign in the traditional sense, Dagobert's conflict with his half-brother Charibert II, who ruled over Aquitaine, had a military and political dimension. Seeking to avoid a division of the Frankish realm, Dagobert likely orchestrated Charibert's assassination in 632, along with that of Charibert's infant son. Following their deaths, Dagobert absorbed Aquitaine into his realm, reinforcing his position as the sole ruler of the Franks.The incorporation of Aquitaine, a wealthy and semi-autonomous region, was crucial for economic and strategic reasons. However, Dagobert's control remained fragile, as local resistance simmered and future Merovingians struggled to assert direct authority in the region. Internal revolts and repressionDagobert faced internal challenges from noble families and semi-independent regions such as Gascony and Burgundy. Though not large-scale military engagements, these revolts required military responses. Dagobert often dispatched loyal retainers and Austrasian forces to quell disturbances and enforce royal authority. In Burgundy, he cracked down on dissent by confiscating lands and redistributing them to loyal supporters, a tactic that maintained short-term control but bred long-term resentment. Frontier policy and alliancesRather than launching expansionist wars, Dagobert sought to secure his borders through diplomacy backed by military threats. He maintained peaceful relations with the Visigoths of Spain and Lombards of Italy and entered into alliances with the Avars and various Germanic duchies such as Bavaria. His military prestige, bolstered by the symbolic authority of the Merovingian kingship, was often enough to deter open conflict, except where local rulers sensed weakness, as Samo did in the east.",
