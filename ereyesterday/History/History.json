    "description": "Thousands of political science books and magazines discuss the idea of ​​democratic transformation. For example: how can a country once under authoritarian rule, transform from that to individual and democratic rule? And what do we truly know about dictatorships? Can a democratic country transform into a dictatorial country, despite the pre-existence of a constitution and elections?Probably the most well-known example of this is Germany: which had a parliament; a multi-party system; laws protecting elections; and laws protecting individual freedoms. At the time, the illiteracy rate was almost zero percent,yet it transformed from a democracy into an expansionist dictatorship in 1933, after Hitler's rise to power. Here, Nora Manseur and Kaye Porter explain how Adolf Hitler took power. Read part 1 on Hitler’s early years here. Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler and Reich President Paul V. Hindenburg in March 1933. Source: Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-S38324 / CC-BY-SA 3.0, available here.Taking advantage of Germany’s financial and social instability, Hitler’s party became the largest in the Reichstag in 1932. Later then President of Germany, Paul Von Hindenburg, appointed Hitler Chancellor. Meanwhile, Hitler also hadarmed paramilitary troops known as “Storm Troops” or more commonly known as Brownshirts, because of their brown uniforms. The Storm Troops were under Hitler's command, and the number of soldiers reached in the region of some 400,000 in 1932. The goal of these forces was to control the streets, because; Hitler saw that controlling the streets was the key to controlling the state. Despite his growing military force and political power, Hitler did not yet have theabsolute power, which would enable him to achieve his expansionist dreams. In order to achieve full power, he would need a majority in parliament; the support of the German people; and the support of the German army. Seeing the growing militia power on the streets, however, the military had begun to fear the influence of the Brownshirts.  Taking powerHitler systematically and strategically overcame these obstacles. The German parliament contained left-wing parties who strongly opposed to the Nazi Party. On February 27, 1933, the opposition became violent when  Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe set fire to the German parliament in protest against the spread of Nazism. Hitlerrecognized this as an opportunity in his interest, as this was an opportunity to get rid of his opponents in parliament.Combined with his growing power on the streets, this was a brutal stab against democracy. The next day, Hitler issued a decision to suspend civil and political freedoms under the guise of bringing safety and order to the chaos.The result was a successful declaration of emergency law.On March 5, 1933, the government organized new elections, in which Hitler won 44%, 17 million votes. Because Hitler still did not have a majority,  he proposed and persuaded parliament to vote legislation called The Enabling Act. This legislation allowed Hitler to issue laws without the approval of  parliament. With this power, any known communists in parliament were arrested, beaten and prevented from entering parliament. With legislative and executive power in hand, Hitler issued a decision to dissolve all parties and unions except the Nazi Party. With control over the leadership an electoral body, Hitler's target now became the German army. 1934In 1934, Hitler’s paramilitary Storm Troops numbered roughly 2 million soldiers, many times more the number of soldiers in the German army. Ernst Röhm, who had socialist political beliefs, was also the commander of the Storm Troops. He demanded that Hitler carry out their original plans to lead a revolution and implement socialism. The original party values had been to support the German workers, and in fact they had been known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Hitler’s goals had changed however, and he knew that in order to achieve control, he would need the support of businessmen. When Ernst Röhm asked Hitler to join the German army with his Storm Troops under his command as one entity, Hitler had a decision to make. He knew that this combined army would carry out the promised Socialist revolution. The army leaders, however, opposed this therefore Hitler had two options: either  take control of the army leaders who might betray him, or give the power of the military to his friend Ernst Röhm. He chose the army over his friend.Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the Nazi SS, an elite Nazi security force separate from the Storm Troops, informed Hitler that Ernst Röhm was planning a coup against him. In response Hitler ordered the killing of Ernst Röhm and other Storm Troops Leaders without trial. On June 27, in what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, more than 800 people were liquidated in cold blood. This once again showed Hitler to be a bloody and violent ruler. The German president thanked him and told him that he had saved the German nation.Hitler knew that a massacre of German citizens could have dangerous repercussions. In order to get control of the media and message, he ordered Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, to spread the word that there was a plot to overthrow him by Ernst Röhm. If he could justify in the minds of the people that what happened was simply law and order, and for their safety, then fewer people would question his actions. In addition, he bribed terrified wives and children of those who were killed that night to keep silent about anything that might harm his image. Greater powerShortly after the Night of Long Knives, German President Paul von Hindenburg died, and the position of presidentmerges with that of Chancellor. A referendum was held in August 1934, where the German people voted for Hitler to be the Supreme Leader or \"Führer.\" Then, as the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels already controlled all film production companies, and newspapers, helping to consolidate power. Another factor for Hitler’s success was the Autobahn - work began in 17 cities at the same time, and would ultimately be a giant highway network linking German cities together. This project was so important to Hitler, that he himself opened the excavation works in his first year in power. This project aimed to eliminate unemployment, giving jobs to at least 600,000 Germans, Promises of employment and spending on a huge project, combined with the propaganda, inevitably increased  his popularity and he won easily. ScapegoatThe economic improvement did not last long. The Autobahn only employed approximately 125,000 people and old problems such as unemployment and inflation reappeared. Clutching at power, Hitler used a people he considered to be an enemy, a scapegoat on which to hang all the problems. The Jews, whom Hitler blamed for everything, from economic difficulties to the decision to surrender in the war, were influenced by Hitler's anti-Jewish ideology since he was in Austria, and also the communists who were carrying out strikes that were one of the reasons for the surrender in 1918, most of whom Hitler said were Jews.In 1935, in a celebration at the Berlin Opera House, Hitler issued a set of laws called the Nuremberg Laws, which divided the German people into: Germans and Jews. They would mean that Jews were stripped of their German citizenship, were forbidden to marry non-Jewish Germans, were barred from entering universities and schools, and were required to wear visible badges that would identify them on the street. These laws established the legal persecution of Jews before they were systematically exterminated.This continued until November 1938, when a German Jew living in France, Herschel Grynszpan, shot a German diplomat in France, Ernst Vom Rath, and a major campaign of incitement against the Jews began. On November 9, 1938, this resulted in  the Jews being subjected to a wave of severe violence in which about 100 Jews died, and the synagogue, homes, and shops of Jews were destroyed. This night is known as the Night of Broken Glass, and a collective fine was also imposed on the Jews, and about 30,000 Jews were arrested. Find that piece of interest?

    "description": "The Battle of Gaugamela (Γαυγάμηλα), or Battle of Arbela (Ἄρβηλα), fought on the October 1, 331 BCE, was a turning point in ancient history, marking Alexander the Great's decisive victory over the Persian Empire and solidifying his place as one of history's greatest military tacticians and strategists.The confrontation was the culmination of escalating hostilities between the ambitious Macedonian king, Alexander III of Macedon who became known as Alexander the Great, (Αλέξανδρος ο Μέγας), and Darius III, the ruler of the vast Persian Empire.Terry Bailey explains. The Battle of Gaugamela by Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1602.The lead-up to GaugamelaFollowing his father King Philip II's unification of the Greek city-states and establishment of the League of Corinth, Alexander ascended to the Macedonian throne with aspirations of expansion beyond Greece's borders. His campaign against Persia began in 334 BCE, with Alexander's victories in battles such as Granicus, (Μάχη του Γρανικού), 334 BCE and Issus, (Ἱσσὸς Μάχη), 333 BCE setting the stage for a showdown.These early successes inspired confidence among Alexander's ranks and raised concerns for Darius, who had underestimated Alexander's prowess. In the wake of the Battle of Issus in 333 BCE, where Alexander had struck a significant blow to the Persian forces, Darius offered peace terms, including a generous ransom for his captured family and large territorial concessions.Alexander, however, saw himself as Darius's equal and declined the offer, seeking to claim the Persian Empire for himself. Politically, Darius now faced mounting pressure from his subjects to protect the empire's core territories, therefore, moved to consolidate his forces near Gaugamela, a strategically chosen location on the Mesopotamian plains, where he could deploy his army's full strength and exploit the open terrain. Commanders and armies, strategy and tacticsOn the Macedonian side, Alexander commanded a seasoned, highly disciplined army composed of approximately 47,000 troops, including phalanx infantry, elite companion cavalry, and specialised units like archers and highly mobile light infantry. Alexander's forces were strategically flexible and accustomed to his aggressive, calculated tactics. Central to Alexander's strategy was a deep understanding of mobility and the use of oblique formations to outflank larger forces.Darius III, on the other hand, led a considerably larger force, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to as high as 250,000 troops. The Persian army was a diverse coalition, including cavalry, infantry, chariots equipped with scythes, and a small contingent of war elephants. Darius positioned himself at the centre of his forces, with infantry and heavy cavalry on the flanks and chariots prepared for a decisive charge. His strategy relied on overwhelming Alexander's smaller army with sheer numbers, hoping to use the flat plains of Gaugamela to his advantage. The battle unfolds, tactics and actionAs the battle began, Darius attempted to use his numerical superiority by sending waves of cavalry on both flanks to encircle Alexander's troops. However, Alexander the Great's tactics at the Battle of Gaugamela were masterfully adapted to the open, flat terrain, which should have favoured Darius III's much larger Persian forces. Recognising that a direct, head-on confrontation with such a massive army would be risky, Alexander orchestrated a strategy to exploit his troops' agility, discipline, and skill.Central to this was his innovative integration of cavalry and infantry, forming a highly flexible, responsive battle line that allowed him to neutralise the Persians' numerical advantage and leverage his own army's strengths. Alexander placed his heavy infantry, the Macedonian phalanx, at the centre of his formation, forming a strong, disciplined core that could hold against Persian attacks.His famed companion cavalry, led personally by Alexander, was positioned on the right flank, along with other light infantry and cavalry units. This flank was the decisive wing of his army, where Alexander intended to deliver a powerful blow. On the left, under the command of General Parmenion, were additional cavalry and light infantry, tasked with holding their ground against Persian attacks. The integration of cavalry and infantry on both flanks gave the Macedonian army flexibility, allowing Alexander to adapt quickly to Persian moves.Alexander also employed a tactical feigned retreat and oblique advance, pulling his right-wing cavalry gradually to the right. This manoeuvre drew Persian forces away from their solid front line, stretching them and exposing gaps. When Darius ordered his cavalry to pursue Alexander's right flank, Alexander seized the opportunity.The Persian line thinned, especially near the centre, where Darius was stationed. At the critical moment, Alexander and his companion cavalry swung sharply to the left, charging through the gap in the Persian centre toward Darius himself. Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx advanced, keeping the Persian infantry occupied and preventing them from reinforcing their vulnerable centre.This coordinated use of cavalry and infantry allowed Alexander to drive a wedge into the Persian army, isolating Darius and forcing him to flee. As the Persian king retreated, the morale of his troops broke, leading to a chaotic withdrawal. Alexander's tactical ingenuity in using a mix of direct engagement and flanking manoeuvres on such open terrain proved decisive, showcasing his ability to adapt and exploit the unique conditions of the battlefield. Aftermath and legacyThe Battle of Gaugamela signalled the collapse of the Persian Empire, opening the doors for Alexander's forces to capture the key cities of Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis. This victory marked the effective end of Persian power and the beginning of a new era of Hellenistic influence across the former empire. Alexander's victory at Gaugamela became a testament to his strategic brilliance, shaping his legacy as one of history's most formidable conquerors.The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centred on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the southwest, Illyria to the northwest, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south.Not to be confused with the Republic of North Macedonia, a landlocked country in Southeast Europe, sharing land borders with Greece to the south, Albania to the west, Bulgaria to the east, Kosovo to the northwest and Serbia to the north. Alexander the Great's empireAlexander the Great's empire was one of the largest in the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwest India. Extent of the EmpireAt its height, Alexander's empire covered approximately 5.2 million square kilometres (2 million square miles), making it the largest empire in the world at the time.It stretched from Macedonia and Greece in the west, across the Middle East, through Persia (modern-day Iran), and reaching India in the east. The empire also included Egypt and parts of Central Asia. Key regions and territories conqueredMacedonia and Greece: The empire began here and remained Alexander's cultural and administrative base.Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey): Alexander moved here after defeating the Persians at the Battle of Granicus, (Μάχη του Γρανικού), 334 BCE.Persian Empire (modern Iran, Iraq, Syria, and parts of Central Asia): After his decisive victory at the Battle of Gaugamela, (Γαυγάμηλα), in 331 BCE, Alexander claimed the entirety of the Persian Empire, which was the dominant power in the region.Egypt: He was welcomed in Egypt as a liberator and founded the city of Alexandria.Mesopotamia and Babylon: These regions became central to his empire after the fall of Persia.Punjab Region in India: Alexander's easternmost conquests reached the Punjab region, but he did not extend further due to his army's reluctance. Population and diversityAlexander's empire was highly diverse, encompassing various cultures, languages, and religions. The empire was home to tens of millions of people, though exact population estimates vary. Administration and influenceAlexander's conquests helped spread Greek culture, language, and ideas across these regions, influencing them for centuries to come in what became known as the Hellenistic Period. His empire, however, was difficult to govern due to its sheer size, and it began to fragment soon after he died in 323 BCE.Alexander's empire was significant not only for its size but also for its lasting cultural impact. Greek influence persisted through the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded his empire, blending with local cultures across Asia and the Mediterranean. Phalanx, (φάλαγξ)One of the most effective and enduring military formations in ancient warfare was that of the Greek phalanx. The age of the phalanx formation may be traced back to Sumeria in the 25th century BCE, through Egypt, and finally appearing in Greek literature through Homer in the 8th century BCE (and since has been generally associated with Greek warfare strategy, the name itself coming from the Greek word for 'finger').The phalanx formation was a close-rank, dense grouping of soldiers armed with long spears and interlocking shields with the first few ranks of soldiers projecting their spears out over the first rank of shields.",
