    "description": "On January 13, 1396, the House of Plantagenet was spiraling. A controversial marriage had just taken place in Lincoln Cathedral. John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster defied all reason and reputation to marry his long-time mistress, Katherine Swynford. Though most mistresses throughout English history did not exceed their scandalous station, Katherine Swynford did what many could not; she legitimized her children and started a rival line for the throne. Because of her, the British monarchy today exists.Kristine de Abreu explains. A depiction of the tombs of Katherine Swynford and her daughter, Joan Beaufort (before they were damaged). Source: available here.Early Life and First MarriageKatherine Swynford (born Katherine de Roet) started out in life rather unremarkably. She was neither of noble blood nor a struggling peasant. She was somewhere in between, a member of the gentry. As her father was a knight in the service of King Edward III and his queen Phillipa of Hainaut, Katherine spent the early years of her life at court under the care of the latter. The queen doted on her and her sister Phillipa, resulting in them receiving the same education as the noble and royal children at court. Katherine grew into an exceptionally beautiful, poised, demure and obedient woman whom many respected at court. This included the lords and ladies above her. Eventually, she entered into the service of Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt. John was the fourth son of Edward and Phillipa.Due to her closeness to the royal family, they chose to arrange her marriage. They paired her off with Sir Hugh Swynford of Kettlethorpe, a knight of modest social standing. Though he owned lands and an estate, the mills and small buildings were neglected and the land was infertile. Therefore, the couple had to depend on Hugh’s salary as a knight. Historians determine they had at least four children. Sadly, misfortune struck the Swynfords when Hugh died in 1371 after participating in a military campaign, leaving Katherine a widow. For a poor widow, this was basically a death sentence.  An Affair with John of GauntBut Katherine’s good standing with the royal family saved her as John of Gaunt supported her financially and gave her a job in the household of his new wife, Constance of Castile, whom he married after the death of Blanche of Lancaster. Though Katherine’s situation improved substantially with John moving heaven and earth to ensure she received a decent inheritance, it also became way more complicated than she expected. She and the married John of Gaunt fell in love. Historians cannot conclude exactly when the affair began but vote in favor of it being during his marriage to Constance.This was not a temporary fling of short-lived clandestine meetings at night. Rather, it was a long-term relationship where all the nobles knew of the infidelity, including Constance. Katherine gained unofficial status as John’s mistress and even became the governess of John’s daughters (with Blanche). Whether Constance cared or not is up for debate, as Constance had a better advantage keeping quiet, considering how her union with John would mean reclaiming the Castilian throne. But Katherine had four children with John, all of whom were cared for, educated and raised alongside royalty, despite their status as bastards. He gave them the surname Beaufort, a family who’d play a major role in the War of the Roses decades later. It was an odd state of affairs. Not only did the court not come to Constance’s defense but they seemed to approve of Katherine and John’s love. There was a strange acceptance of the blended families, both legitimate and illegitimate, and life was relatively harmonious among all parties involved. Despite Katherine remaining in good graces with the nobility, the public had a different opinion.John of Gaunt was not afraid to parade the relationship in front of the masses. A famous incident recorded around 1378 by chronicler Thomas Walsingham described John and Katherine riding side by side while his wife Constance was riding behind them. This was a public display of their affair which elicited outrage and disgust from the common folk. They wanted justice and vengeance for Constance, declaring John’s behavior unholy and labeling Katherine a seductress and witch. The public pressure was too much to handle. Three years later was the Peasants’ Revolt, for which John blamed himself and his indiscretions. The peasants demanded his head for his treachery. So, in a heartbreaking decision driven by guilt, he formally broke from Katherine. He still supported her and their children financially and saw her from time to time. She left court to seek residence in Lincoln.Despite the public renunciation of the relationship, Katherine and the royal family’s relationship remained solid. King Richard II, John of Gaunt’s nephew, bestowed upon her the Order of the Garter, chivalric award and title. Katherine led a quiet existence in the countryside, working in noble households and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle. It seemed as though this was to be the status quo until Constance died in 1394. A line securedNow that Constance was dead, John immediately sprang into action to legitimize his mistress and children. He appealed to the Pope for his approval, which he gave by manner of a Papal Bull. He then married Katherine at Lincoln Cathedral in 1396, thereby making her his third wife and the Duchess of Lancaster of England. Their children, the Beauforts, were now princes and princesses. The marriage was initially met with resistance but the nobles relented and accepted the reality.John’s long anticipated marriage to Katherine did not last long. He died from a disease (possible STD). Upon his death, Katherine had all her assets temporarily seized but Richard II came to her aid. She stayed out of politics and chose to live her life out of the spotlight in Lincoln once again. When John’s first-born son with Blanche of Lancaster, Henry Bolingbroke usurped the throne from Richard, Katherine switched sides and supported him, probably in the hopes of not making an enemy of her stepson. This proved the best strategy as Henry continued the family tradition of showing her favor financially. Her children swore fealty to their new king which gave them immense leverage and helped them set up their descendants for success. John and Katherine’s eldest son John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset fathered Joan Beaufort, the wife of James I King of the Scots and John Beaufort, the father of Margaret Beaufort and grandfather of King Henry VII (Tudor). Also a descendent of Katherine and John was Cecily Neville, the mother of Edward IV, Richard III and George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence. This made the Beauforts connected to both the House of Lancaster and the House of York. By the time the War of the Roses peaked, the House of Beaufort aligned with Lancaster as pertaining to their lineage by John and Katherine. Henry Tudor defeated Richard III at Bosworth Fields and sealed their legacy through blood and iron at that fated battlefield.So, the intense love affair between John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford resulted in the British monarchy’s security with the reigns of the Houses of York, Tudor, Stuart all the way to today’s House of Windsor. John and Katherine’s legacy even made it to the United States with presidents such as George Washington, John Quincy Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D Roosevelt and George W Bush being descendants. Find that piece of interest?

    "description": "Thousands of political science books and magazines discuss the idea of ​​democratic transformation. For example: how can a country once under authoritarian rule, transform from that to individual and democratic rule? And what do we truly know about dictatorships? Can a democratic country transform into a dictatorial country, despite the pre-existence of a constitution and elections?Probably the most well-known example of this is Germany: which had a parliament; a multi-party system; laws protecting elections; and laws protecting individual freedoms. At the time, the illiteracy rate was almost zero percent,yet it transformed from a democracy into an expansionist dictatorship in 1933, after Hitler's rise to power. Here, Nora Manseur and Kaye Porter explain how Adolf Hitler took power. Read part 1 on Hitler’s early years here. Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler and Reich President Paul V. Hindenburg in March 1933. Source: Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-S38324 / CC-BY-SA 3.0, available here.Taking advantage of Germany’s financial and social instability, Hitler’s party became the largest in the Reichstag in 1932. Later then President of Germany, Paul Von Hindenburg, appointed Hitler Chancellor. Meanwhile, Hitler also hadarmed paramilitary troops known as “Storm Troops” or more commonly known as Brownshirts, because of their brown uniforms. The Storm Troops were under Hitler's command, and the number of soldiers reached in the region of some 400,000 in 1932. The goal of these forces was to control the streets, because; Hitler saw that controlling the streets was the key to controlling the state. Despite his growing military force and political power, Hitler did not yet have theabsolute power, which would enable him to achieve his expansionist dreams. In order to achieve full power, he would need a majority in parliament; the support of the German people; and the support of the German army. Seeing the growing militia power on the streets, however, the military had begun to fear the influence of the Brownshirts.  Taking powerHitler systematically and strategically overcame these obstacles. The German parliament contained left-wing parties who strongly opposed to the Nazi Party. On February 27, 1933, the opposition became violent when  Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe set fire to the German parliament in protest against the spread of Nazism. Hitlerrecognized this as an opportunity in his interest, as this was an opportunity to get rid of his opponents in parliament.Combined with his growing power on the streets, this was a brutal stab against democracy. The next day, Hitler issued a decision to suspend civil and political freedoms under the guise of bringing safety and order to the chaos.The result was a successful declaration of emergency law.On March 5, 1933, the government organized new elections, in which Hitler won 44%, 17 million votes. Because Hitler still did not have a majority,  he proposed and persuaded parliament to vote legislation called The Enabling Act. This legislation allowed Hitler to issue laws without the approval of  parliament. With this power, any known communists in parliament were arrested, beaten and prevented from entering parliament. With legislative and executive power in hand, Hitler issued a decision to dissolve all parties and unions except the Nazi Party. With control over the leadership an electoral body, Hitler's target now became the German army. 1934In 1934, Hitler’s paramilitary Storm Troops numbered roughly 2 million soldiers, many times more the number of soldiers in the German army. Ernst Röhm, who had socialist political beliefs, was also the commander of the Storm Troops. He demanded that Hitler carry out their original plans to lead a revolution and implement socialism. The original party values had been to support the German workers, and in fact they had been known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Hitler’s goals had changed however, and he knew that in order to achieve control, he would need the support of businessmen. When Ernst Röhm asked Hitler to join the German army with his Storm Troops under his command as one entity, Hitler had a decision to make. He knew that this combined army would carry out the promised Socialist revolution. The army leaders, however, opposed this therefore Hitler had two options: either  take control of the army leaders who might betray him, or give the power of the military to his friend Ernst Röhm. He chose the army over his friend.Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the Nazi SS, an elite Nazi security force separate from the Storm Troops, informed Hitler that Ernst Röhm was planning a coup against him. In response Hitler ordered the killing of Ernst Röhm and other Storm Troops Leaders without trial. On June 27, in what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, more than 800 people were liquidated in cold blood. This once again showed Hitler to be a bloody and violent ruler. The German president thanked him and told him that he had saved the German nation.Hitler knew that a massacre of German citizens could have dangerous repercussions. In order to get control of the media and message, he ordered Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, to spread the word that there was a plot to overthrow him by Ernst Röhm. If he could justify in the minds of the people that what happened was simply law and order, and for their safety, then fewer people would question his actions. In addition, he bribed terrified wives and children of those who were killed that night to keep silent about anything that might harm his image. Greater powerShortly after the Night of Long Knives, German President Paul von Hindenburg died, and the position of presidentmerges with that of Chancellor. A referendum was held in August 1934, where the German people voted for Hitler to be the Supreme Leader or \"Führer.\" Then, as the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels already controlled all film production companies, and newspapers, helping to consolidate power. Another factor for Hitler’s success was the Autobahn - work began in 17 cities at the same time, and would ultimately be a giant highway network linking German cities together. This project was so important to Hitler, that he himself opened the excavation works in his first year in power. This project aimed to eliminate unemployment, giving jobs to at least 600,000 Germans, Promises of employment and spending on a huge project, combined with the propaganda, inevitably increased  his popularity and he won easily. ScapegoatThe economic improvement did not last long. The Autobahn only employed approximately 125,000 people and old problems such as unemployment and inflation reappeared. Clutching at power, Hitler used a people he considered to be an enemy, a scapegoat on which to hang all the problems. The Jews, whom Hitler blamed for everything, from economic difficulties to the decision to surrender in the war, were influenced by Hitler's anti-Jewish ideology since he was in Austria, and also the communists who were carrying out strikes that were one of the reasons for the surrender in 1918, most of whom Hitler said were Jews.In 1935, in a celebration at the Berlin Opera House, Hitler issued a set of laws called the Nuremberg Laws, which divided the German people into: Germans and Jews. They would mean that Jews were stripped of their German citizenship, were forbidden to marry non-Jewish Germans, were barred from entering universities and schools, and were required to wear visible badges that would identify them on the street. These laws established the legal persecution of Jews before they were systematically exterminated.This continued until November 1938, when a German Jew living in France, Herschel Grynszpan, shot a German diplomat in France, Ernst Vom Rath, and a major campaign of incitement against the Jews began. On November 9, 1938, this resulted in  the Jews being subjected to a wave of severe violence in which about 100 Jews died, and the synagogue, homes, and shops of Jews were destroyed. This night is known as the Night of Broken Glass, and a collective fine was also imposed on the Jews, and about 30,000 Jews were arrested. Find that piece of interest?

His crimes: drinking, carousing, and — crucially — building social and economic ties with Native people. His book outlined a vision for what America could become. A very different vision than that of the Puritans.But the book wouldn't be published that day. It wouldn't be published for years. Because agents for the Puritan colonists stormed the press and destroyed every copy.Today on the show, the story of what's widely considered America's first banned book, the radical vision it conjured, and the man who outlined that vision: Thomas Morton, the Lord of Misrule.To access bonus episodes and listen to Throughline sponsor-free, subscribe to Throughline+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/throughline.Learn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",
