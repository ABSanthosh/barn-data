    "description": "King of the West Saxons, 871 to 886 CE and King of the Anglo-Saxons from 886 CE until he died in 899 CE.Few rulers in English history have been so richly remembered and widely revered as King Alfred the Great, the 9th-century monarch of Wessex. Crowned during a time of dire crisis, Alfred fought not only to repel Viking invasions but also to nurture a cultural and intellectual revival that laid the foundations for what would become England. He is the only English monarch to be honored with the epithet \"the Great,\" a title earned not through conquest alone, but through visionary leadership, legal reform, and an enduring legacy of learning.Terry Bailey explains. King Arthur by Charles Ernest Butler (1903).A Kingdom Under SiegeWhen Alfred ascended the throne in 871 CE, following the death of his brother King Æthelred, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were under relentless assault from the Danish Vikings. The once-great Heptarchy of Anglo-Saxon England had crumbled, with kingdoms like Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia falling to the Scandinavian onslaught. Wessex stood alone as the last major kingdom resisting Viking domination.Alfred's early reign was marked by intense military struggle. In 878 CE, at the lowest point of his fortunes, Alfred was forced to retreat to the marshes of Athelney in Somerset after a surprise Viking attack. From these swampy redoubts, he regrouped his forces and launched a counterattack, defeating the Danes at the Battle of Edington. This decisive victory led to the Treaty of Wedmore, by which Guthrum was baptized and agreed to retreat to East Anglia, marking the boundary between Wessex and the Danelaw, Viking-controlled territory in the east.Alfred's military success was not limited to battlefield heroics. He initiated groundbreaking reforms.Burh System: Alfred reorganized the kingdom's defense by constructing a network of fortified towns (burhs), strategically placed to counter Viking mobility. These burhs later formed the basis for many English towns and cities, including Oxford and Winchester.Naval Innovation: Recognizing the Viking threat from the sea, Alfred established the first English navy, commissioning longships that were larger and swifter than those of the Danes. While not always successful, this early naval force laid the foundation for future maritime strength.Military Reforms: He reorganized the fyrd (militia), instituting a rotation system so that part of the army could always be on duty while others tended to their farms, ensuring a sustainable, year-round defense. Law, learning, and legacyWhile King Alfred the Great is often remembered for his military successes, his true legacy lies in his deep devotion to justice and learning, which helped shape the cultural and legal foundations of early England.One of Alfred's most enduring contributions was his reform of the legal system. In the Doom Book, he consolidated various Anglo-Saxon laws with Christian ethics and elements of Mosaic law, not to create something entirely new, but to refine and unify. His goal was to ensure a more consistent and fair legal system across the kingdom of Wessex, guided by a strong moral compass rooted in faith and tradition.Equally significant was Alfred's passion for education. Distressed by the widespread decline in literacy, he led a cultural revival by inviting learned men from across Mercia and Europe to his court. He was personally involved in the translation of important Latin texts into Old English, including Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy and Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care, so that knowledge would no longer be the privilege of the clergy alone but accessible to all free men capable of learning.Alfred also helped lay the foundations of English historical writing. Under his guidance, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was begun, an ambitious and unprecedented record of England's history that would continue to be updated for centuries. It was a bold effort to preserve the past and shape a collective national identity, long before the concept of England as a unified state had fully formed. Strengths in detailHe is widely celebrated for his exceptional leadership and visionary reforms during great turmoil in Anglo-Saxon England. One of his most prominent strengths was his military acumen. Facing relentless Viking invasions, Alfred displayed remarkable strategic foresight. After suffering early defeats, as outlined, he reorganized the military system, establishing a network of fortified towns known as burhs and organized a standing army and a navy capable of repelling future attacks. These reforms not only defended his kingdom but also laid the groundwork for the eventual unification of England.As discussed, Alfred's key strengths were his commitment to learning and education. Believing that wisdom and learning were essential for good governance, he promoted literacy and scholarship in a period when intellectual decline was widespread. He initiated the translation of key Latin texts into Old English and personally contributed to some translations. This cultural revival helped preserve classical knowledge and elevated the intellectual standards of his court and clergy.Alfred's legal and administrative reforms also showcased his strengths as a ruler. He compiled a code of laws known as the Doom Book, blending Mosaic law, Christian ethics, and existing Anglo-Saxon customs. His laws emphasized justice, fairness, and the protection of the weak, reflecting a deep sense of moral duty. Moreover, Alfred's diplomatic skills were evident in his alliances with neighboring kingdoms and his fostering of unity among the Anglo-Saxons in opposition to the Danish threat. It was through resilience, intellect, reforms and actions that Alfred earned his epithet \"the Great\". Weaknesses in detailAlthough celebrated for his defense of Anglo-Saxon England against Viking invasions and his contributions to learning and law, the Great King was not without weaknesses, both personal and political. One of his most pressing challenges was his initial military indecisiveness. In the early stages of his reign, Alfred struggled to organize a cohesive and timely response to the Viking incursions.The infamous retreat to the marshes of Athelney in 878 CE, though ultimately a turning point, was precipitated by Alfred's inability to prevent a surprise Danish advance. His kingdom was nearly overrun, and his survival was briefly reduced to guerrilla tactics and concealment.A further shortcoming was his difficulty in unifying all the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms under a single political structure. While he was successful in asserting dominance over Wessex and parts of Mercia, his influence over the Danelaw regions remained fragile and contested. His reliance on negotiated truces with Viking leaders like Guthrum, though pragmatic, often came at the cost of conceding territory or accepting tenuous peace arrangements that required constant vigilance and resources to maintain.On a personal level, Alfred was known to suffer from chronic illness, which may have limited his ability to command on the battlefield and reduced his energy and stamina in governance. While some sources suggest he had a painful intestinal condition, possibly Crohn's disease or hemorrhoids, this ailment likely imposed constraints on his direct leadership during military campaigns. Additionally, his religious piety and emphasis on monastic reform, while admirable, sometimes alienated more martial or secular factions within his court who may have preferred a more aggressive stance against Norse incursions. Folklore and legendAlfred's fame also birthed enduring folklore, the most famous being the story of the burnt cakes. While hiding in the marshes of Athelney, Alfred is said to have taken refuge in a peasant woman's home. She, unaware of his identity, tasked him with watching her cakes on the fire. Distracted by thoughts of battle, Alfred allowed them to burn, and she scolded him for his carelessness, a tale of humility and resilience.Other legends emphasize his wisdom in disguise. Like Harun al-Rashid of Baghdad or Odysseus, Alfred supposedly roamed his kingdom in humble clothing, seeking truth and learning about his people. It is an interesting point that similar tales often transcend through the ages when elevating greatness in individuals. Archaeological evidenceModern archaeology continues to shed light on the reign of King Alfred the Great, offering tangible evidence to complement the historical record. Excavations at fortified sites such as Wareham and Wallingford have revealed impressive earthworks, large, rectangular defensive enclosures, that align with descriptions in the Burghal Hidage, a military survey from Alfred's time listing strategic fortified settlements, or burhs. These findings underscore Alfred's ambitious efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking incursions by establishing a network of fortresses.On the Isle of Athelney in Somerset, archaeological work has uncovered the foundations of a monastic complex believed to be the abbey Alfred founded in gratitude after emerging from hiding there in 878 CE. Following his eventual victory over the Vikings, Alfred commemorated his refuge with a religious institution whose legacy is marked today by a memorial monument on the site.Meanwhile, the quest to locate Alfred's remains has focused on Hyde Abbey in Winchester, where he was believed to have been reinterred. In 2013, archaeologists examined a set of human bones found at the site. Though testing was hampered by centuries of disturbance and yielded inconclusive results, the investigation reignited public interest in the fate of England's only monarch officially titled \"the Great.\"Alfred's reign is also reflected in his coinage. Notably, the \"London Monogram\" series, minted after 886 CE, signifies his consolidation of control over London and his political alignment with the rulers of Mercia, such as Æthelred. These coins are not just currency but symbols of authority, cooperation, and the emerging unity of early England. The making of EnglandAlfred's real genius lay in laying the groundwork for English unification. Though he never ruled all of England, his reforms and military efforts preserved Anglo-Saxon culture during a time when it could easily have been extinguished. His son Edward the Elder and grandson Æthelstan would later build on Alfred's vision, extending control over the Danelaw and shaping a more united English kingdom.Alfred the Great was more than a warrior-king. He was a scholar-ruler, a reformer, a builder, and the spiritual founder of the English nation. Through battlefield resilience, legal reform, and cultural revival, he ensured that the Anglo-Saxon identity survived and evolved into a unified England. His title \"the Great\" is not merely honorific; it reflects a rare blend of might and mind, courage and culture.In conclusion, King Alfred the Great stands as a towering figure in early English history, not simply because he resisted conquest, but because he envisioned a civilization worth defending. In an age defined by violent upheaval and cultural disintegration, Alfred did more than safeguard Wessex, he laid the intellectual, legal, and political foundations for a nation that did not yet exist. His military triumphs against the Vikings, especially the pivotal victory at Edington, prevented the complete collapse of Anglo-Saxon rule. Yet Alfred's legacy transcends the battlefield. By reforming the militia, establishing fortified towns, and founding a navy, he ensured that defense would no longer be reactionary but strategic and sustainable.More significantly, Alfred recognized that the soul of a nation lies not only in swords and shields, but in schools, scriptures, and the rule of law. His translation of classical and Christian texts, his involvement in education, and his codification of laws all point to a ruler deeply committed to justice, wisdom, and moral integrity. He was a rare king who valued books as much as blades, who sought to govern not through brute force but through enlightened order and his duty.Even in his weaknesses, his chronic illness, conservative outlook, and limited territorial control, we see a man grappling with the limitations of his time and body, yet still forging a legacy that others would build upon. Alfred did not live to see a fully unified England, but without him, there may never have been one. His son Edward the Elder and grandson Æthelstan would extend his vision, but the blueprint, the ideological, military, and cultural architecture, was Alfred's alone.The legends that surround him, from burnt cakes to cloaked wanderings among the common folk, only deepen the perception of a monarch who was not aloof but profoundly human, humble, wise, and tirelessly devoted to his people. Archaeological discoveries continue to confirm the historical reality of his reign, reinforcing the truth that Alfred was not merely a figure of myth, but a pragmatic and perceptive statesman.In the end, Alfred the Great was not just a savior of Wessex, but the architect of English identity. His synthesis of warrior virtue, scholarly pursuit, legal clarity, and Christian kingship created a model of rulership that endured long after his death. That he is the only English king ever granted the epithet \"the Great\" is a testament to his unique combination of vision, intellect, and resolve. In preserving what was best of the Anglo-Saxon world and projecting it into a future that he could only partially see, Alfred earned his place not only in the chronicles of England, but in the enduring story of Western civilization. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

It was a significant legal document in early English history, combining previous Anglo-Saxon law codes with Christian principles. Alfred drew from older legal traditions such as those of Æthelberht of Kent, Ine of Wessex, and Offa of Mercia, and prefaced his code with passages from the Book of Exodus, showing a conscious fusion of Mosaic law and Germanic custom.The Doom Book was designed not only to provide justice but to reflect moral guidance based on Christian doctrine, offering insight into the cultural and religious landscape of early medieval England.In contrast, the Doomsday Book (more accurately spelled Domesday Book) is a later piece of work and not to be confused with the Doom book. The Doomsday Book was a monumental land survey ordered by William the Conqueror in 1085–1086 CE, nearly two centuries after Alfred's reign.Unlike the Doom Book, which was a set of laws, the Doomsday Book was an administrative record intended to assess land ownership, resources, and taxation potential throughout England. The name \"Domesday\" evokes the finality and thoroughness of the Last Judgment, underscoring the idea that its findings were unchallengeable. It covered much of England and parts of Wales, detailing landholders, their holdings, the value of the land, and the obligations attached to it.The key difference between the two lies in their purpose and function: the Doom Book was a legal code intended to guide judgment and justice in courts, while the Doomsday Book was a financial and administrative survey meant to consolidate control over William's new kingdom and establish a basis for taxation. Though both played crucial roles in shaping medieval English governance, they reflect different priorities: moral-legal order versus economic-political control. The Anglo-Saxon ChroniclesThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicles are a collection of annals written in Old English that document the history of England from the 5th century through the 12th century. They were commissioned by King Alfred the Great in the late 9th century to preserve the history and culture of the Anglo-Saxon people in the face of Viking invasions and other external threats. The chronicles were initially compiled in the Kingdom of Wessex, but over time, different versions were created in various regions of England, each adding local details to the larger historical narrative.The text is unique in that it combines both secular and religious history, detailing the reigns of kings, battles, invasions, and major events, as well as the Christianization of England and the role of the church in shaping the kingdom. The Chronicles are invaluable as a primary source for historians, providing insight into the early medieval period, including the relationship between the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings, the establishment of the English monarchy, and the transformation of England from a pagan society to a Christian one.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles survive in multiple manuscripts, with some of the most notable versions found in the British Library and the Bodleian Library. They differ in their regional focus and detail, but together, they provide a comprehensive look at the history of early medieval England. The chronicles are particularly significant for their role in the development of historical writing in England, influencing later works such as the Domesday Book and the writings of later historians.Though the original text was written in Old English, parts of the chronicles were later translated into Latin and became widely known across the Christian world. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles remain an essential resource for understanding the origins of the English nation and its early historical development. Burghal HidageThe Burghal Hidage is a remarkable document from early medieval England that provides a rare glimpse into the defensive infrastructure of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex during the late 9th or early 10th century. It lists a series of fortified settlements, known as burhs, along with the number of hides of land assigned to each. A hide was a unit of land measurement, roughly enough to support a household. In this context, it likely served as a basis for calculating the manpower and resources needed to defend the fortifications.Traditionally dated to the reign of King Alfred the Great, the Burghal Hidage is closely associated with Alfred's wide-ranging military reforms in response to the Viking threat. Faced with repeated Norse invasions, Alfred sought to create a network of strategically placed burhs to defend the kingdom and provide safe havens for the population. Each burh was supplied and maintained by the surrounding land, with one man required to defend every 4 poles (about 5.5 meters) of wall based on the number of hides allocated. This ensured that each fortress had sufficient defenders, and it allowed for rapid military mobilization. Two versions of the Burghal Hid-age survive:The main list, which includes 33 burhs, and the shorter list, which omits a few entries. Many of the burhs listed evolved into key English towns, including Winchester, Oxford, and Wallingford.The document is not only significant for military history but also for urban development and administrative organization. It reflects a level of central planning and logistical capability that was advanced for its time and laid the foundation for England's later unified defense system under the Anglo-Saxon and later Norman kings. London MonogramDuring Alfred the Great's reign, he undertook a comprehensive reform of the West Saxon coinage, both to stabilize the economy and to assert royal authority over the newly unified territories. Central to this reform was the establishment of a more standardized system of mints, among which London played a preeminent role.Coins struck at London bore a distinctive monogram on the reverse side, typically rendered as a compact, interlaced arrangement of the letters L O N D, and this \"London Monogram\" quickly became synonymous with both the city's importance and the high quality of its silver currency.The London Monogram served several key purposes. First, it acted as a mint-mark, guaranteeing to merchants and the populace that the coin met the king's exacting standards for weight (approximately 1.3 grams of high-purity silver) and fineness. Second, its geometric and easily recognizable design functioned as a deterrent to clipping and other forms of debasement: any attempt to shave off silver could be readily spotted when the monogram's crisp angles and interwoven strokes were compromised. Finally, by marking coins with the name and emblem of London, the empire's burgeoning commercial hub, Alfred reinforced the city's status as the fiscal heart of his kingdom and as a focal point for trade with the Continent and beyond.Beyond its practical applications, the London Monogram on Alfred's pennies carried symbolic weight. It underscored the close relationship between king and city: London supplied the skilled moneyers and the resources necessary for minting, while Alfred's authority ensured that the coinage circulated widely and fostered economic cohesion across Wessex and the recently acquired Mercian territories. Even after Alfred's death, successors continued to use monograms and mint-marks echoing his example, cementing the legacy of the London Monogram as an enduring icon of early medieval English sovereignty and monetary unity.The concept of a London, or Royal monogram continues today, for example Royal cyphers, such as \"ER\" for Elizabeth Regina or \"CR\" for Charles Rex, appear throughout the city on post boxes, government buildings, and official documents, serving as a form of royal monogram that reinforces London's role as the heart of the British monarchy and trade. While the term \"London Monogram\" itself may not denote a specific, universally adopted image, it encompasses a rich tapestry of design traditions that echo the city's culture, influence, and visual legacy from centuries past to present.",

    "description": "Deception has always been a part of military tactics, from the ancient Trojan Horse to the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein positioned his troops along the Iraq-Kuwait border, claiming they were on a training mission as a cover-up for his true intentions of invading Kuwait. It was no different during the Second World War, when commanders devised unusual deception strategies. One of these involved an actor impersonating Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.Róza Gombos explains. Montgomery during World War II.In 1942, the Allies began to turn the tide of the war — the Germans had been stopped in North Africa, the Japanese had been pushed back in the Pacific theatre, and the German 6th Army had been encircled at Stalingrad. Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin decided on an Allied landing in Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord. Executing the operation required massive preparation, lasting several months. One of the most important objectives was to prevent the Germans from learning the time and location of the invasion. To achieve this, commanders devised a number of deception operations to mislead the enemy.Bernard Montgomery played a key role in the operation. He was the Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief and also contributed to refining Lieutenant General Morgan’s invasion plan. Since Montgomery was a central figure in the operation, the time and location of the Allied landing could potentially be linked to his whereabouts. The deception plan, known as Operation Copperhead, aimed to mislead the Germans about where and when the invasion would occur. If they spotted Montgomery somewhere else, it could lead them to believe the invasion was imminent in a different location, prompting them to redeploy their forces and divert divisions away from Normandy.All the intelligence services needed was a double for Bernard Montgomery… The doubleAfter a persistent search for the ideal double, Lieutenant Colonel John Jervis-Reid from the deception planning department of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force saw a photo in the News Chronicle of someone who looked remarkably like Montgomery. With that, they had found the perfect candidate for the operation.[1]The photo was of actor Meyrick Edward Clifton James. He had fought in the First World War at the Battle of the Somme. After the war, he took up acting. Later, during the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Pay Corps.Many people noticed his striking resemblance to Montgomery and often joked about it. James wrote in his memoir that after Montgomery’s victories in North Africa, he was in Nottingham when he went on stage to make an announcement. The crowd mistook him for the general and greeted him with loud applause and cheering.[2]In London, after a night performance of When Knights Were Bold, a News Chronicle photographer came into his dressing room. The photographer had been told that James looked like Montgomery, which piqued his interest. The actor borrowed a beret, and the photographer took pictures of him.[3]The photo appeared in the News Chronicle with the caption ’You’re wrong – it’s Lieut. Clifton James’. Worry?While it seemed to be an innocent joke, James began to worry—what if the senior military staff saw the photo? He even had a nightmare in which he was deported and dropped by parachute into Berchtesgaden for impersonating the general.[4]James’ unease soon proved justified. The higher military circles had indeed seen the photos—and they took serious notice of his resemblance.In May 1944, the actor received a phone call from Colonel David Niven from the Army Kinematograph Section. The colonel offered him a role in an Army film they were supposedly making.Niven instructed him to meet Colonel Lester at the Grand Hotel in Leicester and to bring some photographs of himself.[5] They had lunch, but the colonel did not mention anything about a film. As a result, James assumed he was not qualified and had not been selected for the role.[6]The next day, he received a letter from Niven informing him that he was indeed suitable for the job and that he needed to travel to London. To James’ confusion, Colonel Lester later told him that they were not going to make any films after all.[7]“You are very much like General Montgomery, or Monty, as he is commonly called,” said Colonel Lester. James froze—he thought it was a trap and that he was going to be arrested for unlawful impersonation.[8] But then Lester continued:“You have been chosen to act as the double of General Montgomery before D-Day. I am in charge of this job. It is our business to trick the enemy.”[9] The planThe plan was for James to impersonate Montgomery in the Mediterranean, in order to make the Germans believe the Allies would launch the invasion there, while the real Montgomery remained in the United Kingdom. To prepare for this, MI5 arranged for James to spend several days with Montgomery’s staff so he could study his voice, gestures, and mannerisms.[10]The operation had to be kept top secret. James could not tell anyone; he was advised to be constantly suspicious and to avoid drinking with strangers.[11]When everything was ready, James was flown to Algiers, where he met General Maitland Wilson. In the capital of Algeria, he was cheered by thousands of troops and high-ranking officers. According to James, nobody doubted that he was Montgomery.[12]He was seen publicly with General Wilson to create the illusion that Montgomery and Wilson were planning the invasion. Afterward, he was sent to Cairo to keep him out of the public eye while the Normandy landings were underway. Later, he returned to London without arousing any suspicion.During the interrogation of captured German generals, they confirmed they had been aware of Montgomery’s supposed arrival in the Mediterranean. However, one of them admitted he was not sure whether it was the real Montgomery or just a feint.[13] The operation itself was successful, though it did not significantly influence the course of the Normandy landings. Did you find that piece interesting?
