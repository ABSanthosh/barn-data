    "description": "The Crimean War (1853–1856) was a conflict shaped by political rivalries, military innovation, and brutal clashes that tested the resilience of European armies. At its heart lay a struggle for influence between Russia and the Allied forces of Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire, and later Sardinia. The war's battles would reveal the strengths and weaknesses of 19th-century military tactics, paving the way for modern warfare.Terry Bailey explains.Read part 1 in the series here, and part 2 here. The Battle of the Alma by Eugene Lami.Among the most significant engagements was the Battle of Alma, fought on the 20th of September, 1854. This clash marked the first major confrontation between the Allies and Russian forces, setting the tone for the bloody campaigns that followed. It was a battle of strategy, courage, and missed opportunities, a battle that could have altered the course of the war had its victors seized the moment.Therefore in the third instalment of the Crimean War, the aim is to delve into the key battles of the Crimean War, from the storming of the Alma Heights to the grueling Siege of Sevastopol, the legendary Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, the chaotic hand-to-hand combat at Inkerman, and the crucial naval struggle in the Black Sea. Each of these engagements played a pivotal role in shaping the war's outcome and left a lasting impact on military history. The Battle of the Alma: The First ClashThe Battle of the Alma, fought on the 20th of September, 1854, was the first significant engagement of the Crimean War. Allied forces, comprising British, French, and Ottoman troops, confronted the Russian army along the Alma River, approximately 35 miles north of Sevastopol. The Russian forces, under Prince Alexander Menshikov, had established strong defensive positions on elevated terrain south of the river, anticipating a formidable challenge for the advancing Allies.The Allied strategy involved a coordinated assault, with the French army, led by Marshal Jacques St. Arnaud, advancing along the coast, while the British, under Lord Raglan, took an inland route. The French initiated the attack, with General Bosquet's division crossing the river and scaling the cliffs to outflank the Russian left. Concurrently, the British forces advanced under heavy artillery and musket fire. Despite facing intense resistance, the disciplined advance of the British infantry, including the notable actions of the Guards and Highland brigades, succeeded in breaking the Russian defensive lines.The battle concluded with a decisive Allied victory, compelling the Russian forces to retreat toward Sevastopol. However, the Allies did not capitalize on their success; a lack of cavalry pursuit allowed the Russian army to withdraw in an orderly fashion, regroup, and fortify Sevastopol. This missed opportunity extended the conflict, leading to a protracted and grueling siege that would last for nearly a year. The Battle of Alma not only demonstrated the effectiveness of Allied cooperation but also highlighted significant tactical lessons. The engagement underscored the importance of coordinated assaults and the need for effective pursuit of retreating forces to fully exploit battlefield victories. These insights would influence military strategies in subsequent conflicts, marking Alma as a pivotal moment in military history. The Siege of Sevastopol: A war of attritionThe Siege of Sevastopol was the longest and most grueling engagement of the Crimean War, a drawn-out contest that tested the endurance of both the Allied and Russian forces. As the home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol was a crucial strategic target, and after their victory at the Battle of Alma, the Allied forces comprising British, French, and Ottoman, in addition to, Sardinian troops moved swiftly to encircle the city. However, the Russians, led first by Admiral Vladimir Kornilov and later by the formidable engineer General Eduard Totleben, transformed the city into a fortress of resistance.Over nearly a year of brutal combat, the siege became a grim precursor to modern warfare. Trenches stretched across the battlefield, artillery pounded both sides relentlessly, and waves of counter-assaults turned the land into a nightmarish no-man's-land. The British launched repeated attacks against the Redan, while the French targeted the Malakoff, but each advance came at a staggering cost. Despite superior naval firepower and resources, the Allies found themselves locked in a war of attrition against the determined Russian defenders.As the months dragged on, exhaustion and disease ravaged both sides. Yet, in September 1855, after relentless bombardment and a final decisive assault on the Malakoff, the Russian position became untenable. Realizing the city could no longer hold, the Russians evacuated Sevastopol, destroying their remaining defenses and scuttling their fleet to prevent it from falling into Allied hands. The fall of Sevastopol marked a turning point in the Crimean War, illustrating the devastating cost of prolonged siege warfare and foreshadowing the brutal conflicts of the 20th century. The Battle of Balaclava: The Charge of the Light BrigadeThe Battle of Balaclava fought on the 25th of October 1854 during the Crimean War, stands as a testament to both the horrors of miscommunication in battle and the unwavering courage of soldiers. Initially centered on a Russian offensive aimed at severing British supply lines, the battle took on legendary status due to the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade.A misinterpretation of orders led approximately 600 British cavalrymen to charge straight into a heavily fortified Russian artillery position. Lacking proper support and facing withering fire from all sides, the Light Brigade suffered devastating losses. Their bravery, however, became the defining image of the battle, symbolizing the perils of unclear commands but also the fearless discipline of the British cavalry.Beyond this tragic episode, Balaclava also highlighted the resilience of British forces in other engagements. The 93rd Highlanders, famously dubbed the \"Thin Red Line,\" held their ground against a Russian cavalry advance, demonstrating steadfast discipline under immense pressure. Meanwhile, the Heavy Brigade's decisive charge successfully repelled a larger Russian force, showcasing the effectiveness of well-coordinated cavalry tactics.Though the battle itself was inconclusive from a strategic standpoint, it left an enduring legacy. Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem The Charge of the Light Brigade immortalized the heroism and sacrifice of those who rode \"into the valley of Death.\" Balaclava remains one of the most evocative moments of the Crimean War, a story of valor, tragedy, and the importance of clear military leadership. The Battle of Inkerman: The Soldiers' BattleOn the foggy morning of the 5th of November, 1854, the Crimean War saw one of its most brutal and chaotic engagements, the Battle of Inkerman. Often called the \"soldiers' battle,\" it was defined not by grand strategic maneuvers but by the courage and resilience of individual troops and small units. The Russian forces, seeking to break through Allied lines, launched a surprise assault against British positions. The thick fog obscured visibility, turning the engagement into a series of fierce, close-quarters skirmishes.Despite being heavily outnumbered, the British forces, later reinforced by their French allies, held their ground with remarkable tenacity. The rugged terrain and poor visibility meant that command-and-control structures struggled to function effectively, leaving much of the fighting to the initiative and discipline of individual soldiers.Bayonet charges, hand-to-hand combat, and relentless volleys of fire defined the battle, as small groups of troops clashed in isolated struggles across the battlefield. Ultimately, the Allied forces repelled the Russian attack, inflicting significant losses. Inkerman proved that superior training, discipline, and tactical adaptability could overcome sheer numerical strength. The battle also highlighted the challenges of battlefield communication and coordination in unpredictable conditions. More than a test of strategy, the Battle of Inkerman became a testament to the determination and fighting spirit of the soldiers who fought it. The Naval War in the Black SeaThe Crimean War was not only fought on land but also saw significant naval confrontations, particularly in the Black Sea, where control of supply lines and strategic ports played a decisive role. From the outset, the British and French fleets imposed a stringent blockade on Russian ports, crippling supply routes and restricting reinforcements. This maritime pressure was a key element in the broader Allied strategy to weaken Russian resistance.One of the war's most pivotal naval engagements occurred on the 30th of November, 1853 at the Battle of Sinop, where the Russian fleet delivered a crushing blow to the Ottoman navy. This early Russian victory, marked by the destruction of several Ottoman vessels, shocked Britain and France, prompting them to escalate their involvement in the conflict.The Allies responded by deploying their technologically superior steam-powered warships, which soon established dominance in the Black Sea.The naval campaign reached its climax with the bombardment of Sevastopol, the heavily fortified Russian stronghold. Although the naval artillery alone could not break the city's defenses, it placed immense pressure on Russian forces, contributing to the eventual fall of the city.The final blow to Russian naval power came with the destruction of their Black Sea fleet, ensuring that their maritime influence in the region would never fully recover. This loss significantly weakened Russia's overall war effort, demonstrating the crucial role that naval supremacy played in shaping the outcome of the Crimean War.The Crimean War's major battles showcased the evolution of warfare, from traditional cavalry charges to the grueling realities of siege warfare and trench combat. The bravery of soldiers on both sides was met with the harsh realities of logistical failures, disease, and miscommunication. With Sevastopol under Allied control and Russian forces reeling, the war moved toward its final phases, setting the stage for the dramatic conclusion of this historic conflict.Therefore, it is very easy to conclude that the Crimean War, was particularly savage with important battles such as the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman, and the prolonged siege of Sevastopol, setting the stage and providing a warning of what future conflict would look like, however, it was the breaking of the siege of Sevastopol that marked a turning point in the Crimean War.These engagements revealed the brutal realities of modern conflict, where industrial advancements, evolving tactics, and logistical challenges shaped the course of battle. The war underscored the growing importance of coordination between infantry, cavalry, artillery, and naval forces, while also exposing severe deficiencies in communication, leadership, and medical care, issues that would demand urgent reform in the British and other European armies.The war's most enduring legacy, however, lies in its far-reaching consequences. Militarily, it demonstrated the vulnerabilities of large, conscripted armies reliant on outdated doctrines, prompting significant reforms in the Russian, British, and French armed forces. Politically, the war shattered the balance of power that had defined Europe since the Napoleonic era, diminishing Russian influence in the Black Sea region and setting the stage for conflicts in the future. Diplomatically, it highlighted the fragility of alliances, as tensions between Britain and France persisted beyond their temporary wartime cooperation.Perhaps most notably, the Crimean War heralded a new era of warfare, where technological advancements, including steam-powered warships, rifled muskets, and the first war correspondents brought the brutality of battle closer to home than ever before. The public outcry over the appalling conditions faced by soldiers, particularly in British hospitals, led to transformative changes in military medicine and logistics, championed by figures such as Florence Nightingale. These lessons would resonate far beyond the 1850s, influencing military strategy and humanitarian efforts in conflicts to come.While the Crimean War may not have reshaped borders as dramatically as later wars, it left an indelible mark on military history. The valor displayed by soldiers from all combatant forces, the strategic miscalculations, and the hard-fought battles all contributed to shaping the modern world. In many ways, the lessons learned in Crimea foreshadowed the brutal realities of warfare in the 20th century, making it a conflict not just of its time, but of times to come. In the next instalment, we will explore the humanitarian crisis that emerged from the war and the critical role of medical advancements in battlefield care. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.

The medal was instituted in 1856 by Queen Victoria to recognize acts of extreme valor in the face of the enemy.A total of 111 Victoria Crosses were awarded for actions during the Crimean War. What made these VCs special was the Crimean War medals were awarded retrospectively for bravery displayed during the war, which took place before the inception and minting of the medal. The poem, 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'It is worth quoting Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem about the Charge of the Light Brigade as it is intimately linked to that event.IHalf a league, half a league,Half a league onward,All in the valley of DeathRode the six hundred.\"Forward, the Light Brigade!Charge for the guns!\" he said.Into the valley of DeathRode the six hundred. II\"Forward, the Light Brigade!\"Was there a man dismayed?Not though the soldier knewSomeone had blundered.Theirs not to make reply,Theirs not to reason why,Theirs but to do and die.Into the valley of DeathRode the six hundred. IIICannon to right of them,Cannon to left of them,Cannon in front of themVolleyed and thundered;Stormed at with shot and shell,Boldly they rode and well,Into the jaws of Death,Into the mouth of hellRode the six hundred. IVFlashed all their sabres bare,Flashed as they turned in airSabring the gunners there,Charging an army, whileAll the world wondered.Plunged in the battery-smokeRight through the line they broke;Cossack and RussianReeled from the sabre strokeShattered and sundered.Then they rode back, but notNot the six hundred. VCannon to right of them,Cannon to left of them,Cannon behind themVolleyed and thundered;Stormed at with shot and shell,While horse and hero fell.They that had fought so wellCame through the jaws of Death,Back from the mouth of hell,All that was left of them,Left of six hundred. VIWhen can their glory fade?O the wild charge they made!All the world wondered.Honour the charge they made!Honour the Light Brigade,Noble six hundred! Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson FRS, (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892)",

    "description": "The Ancient Romans have left a legacy of its sprawling empire through ruins, architecture and history firmly rooted in Italian culture. This legacy has inspired artists and writers for generations and the archaeological site of Pompeii, located in southern Italy, has fascinated historians as a place frozen in time after the tragic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.Here, Amy Chandler considers the history of tourism at Mount Vesuvius. The eruption of Vesuvius in 1794 by Alessandro D'Anna. This tragic natural events after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius buried both Pompeii and Herculaneum and was left undisturbed until 1748. In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, efforts were made by the new Emperor Titus to relocate those who survived to nearby cities such as Nola, Naples and Capua. (1) Despite initial attempts, human interference reduced with only looters attempting to dig through the newly formed igneous rock to retrieve valuables. Soon the site became overgrown and forgotten leaving Pompeii frozen in tragedy. In 1863, under Italy’s new leader Garibaldi, Giuseppe Fiorelli was appointed as director of the excavation to uncover Pompeii’s lost history. (1)The story of Pompeii and those fateful days leading to the eruption fascinates visitors and draws 2.5 million tourists each year to the site, with 1 million visiting Mount Vesuvius. Visitors are eager to walk in the footsteps of history and understand the civilisation that was destroyed and connect with the past in a meaningful way. The reasons as to why many visit the historic site and climb the mountain with such a volatile reputation has changed over the centuries from a spiritual enlightening to an insatiable form of consumerism. Arguably, climbing Mount Vesuvius was seen as what modern society refers to as the bucket list. The attitude and needs of the tourist shifted from a spiritual enlightening to the desire for comfort and speed where travellers focused on the destination rather than the journey. The types of tourists shifted as new forms of interacting with the area and travel evolved. This article will explore how tourism has changed from the elite grand tour to Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii to a destination attracting tourists from all over the world.  The eighteenth century touristIn the eighteenth century, the Grand Tour of Europe was common amongst the elite upper class of the male English aristocracy to broaden their knowledge and experience of the world through cultural enrichment in Europe and beyond. (2) Seen as a rite of passage, many would bring back souvenirs from their travels. (2) Travel was primarily common in the elite and most wealthy as it wasn’t financially or physically accessible, therefore the only way to experience these locations was through travel writers, and paintings from those privileged enough to travel across Europe. It wasn’t until the 1840s with the rise of the middle class and the boom of industrialisation and railways that this elite activity became more accessible to a wider group of people who could afford to travel for leisure. This soon broadened the type of tourist and diluted the exclusivity of the elite grand tour. Grand tourists visited the main cities in Europe and travelled by boat and horse drawn carriage in a lengthy and often challenging journey that could easily last a year or longer. There wasn’t any set route but would begin by crossing the English Channel by boat and entering France. From there the journey could deviate but would mainly consist of entering Italy either from the Alps and Lyon or Marseille to Livorno, Italy. Once in Italy, the tour would drift through Florence for the Renaissance art, Venice for partying and the annual carnival and detour to Rome to visit the ancient ruins. It wasn’t until the excavation of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1738 and 1748 that tourists deviated to southern Italy into Naples to visit the ruins.  The journey to climbing up Mount Vesuvius in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century was either by purchasing a private carriage that provided a leisurely journey or, which was most common, a communal horse drawn carriage called a corricolo or calesso. (3) The journey became easier after the introduction of the 1839 railway to Portici that was one of Italy’s first railway lines that followed the Vesuvius coastline offering a picturesque journey for visitors. Before this, the journey was often an exciting and treacherous adventure where the visitor became involved with the locals. Most tourists arrived at the Piazza della Fontana, which was compiled of 12 buildings and a stable. (3) This was usually where many would haggle and bargain with local tour guides. Once visitors had acquired a guide, they begun the ascent up the mountain where the landscape suddenly transformed from rich volcanic soil to a “realm of death and the slain earth’s dust alone slips beneath your unassured feet” as described by Madame de Stael in her 1807 travel guide Corinne, ou l’Italie. (3) Travellers usually rode on donkeys until they reached what many referred to as a “half-way house to heaven”, “Casa Bianca” or most commonly the Hermitage of San Salvatore. (3) The Hermitage offered travellers rest and food before the next journey towards the summit and was built in the 1650s, 600 metres above sea level by fugitives of the plague and was close to the previous Hermitage that was destroyed by the 1631 eruption. Galignani’s Guide (1824) described the lodgings as a “neat plain white building of two stories” with a chapel. (3) The Hermitage offered more than just a rest for travellers, but was an opportunity for a change in tour guides. The Hermitage also offered a Visitor’s Book for travellers to sign with many recording details of their stay. While there was no fee for staying, those who ran the Hermitage expected a suitable reward in return for their hospitality.From that moment on, tourists travelled on foot for about an hour, which was followed by a strenuous ascent to the volcano. As eruptions occurred, so did the increase in tourism, the Hermitage was particularly busy in autumn after 1822 which meant a need for more staff and tour guides. Many illustrations depicted flocks of wealthy tourists in inadequate attire climbing the mountain, which emphasises the mass interest in the area. Due to the nature of the hot and rough terrain a cobbler was stationed at the Hermitage to mend worn out and damaged shoes. The higher the climb the tougher it became as one traveller described the ascent as “climbing a sand hill” combined with the sulphurous fumes from the volcano. (3) At this point, the guides would wrap belts around their group and drag each other up the mountain. On some occasion, sedan chairs carried those who were unable to walk on the rough terrain.Much of the allure of visiting the volcano came from the thrill and unpredictability of nature. No two visits were the same, with the terrain altering after an eruption to occasional explosions to full eruptions depending on the time and environmental factors of the climb. The greater the danger meaning the greater the thrill that only created a mixture of fear, awe and apprehension at the strength of nature. Mount Vesuvius was a reminder that this volcano was responsible for wiping out a civilisation in one swoop leaving history frozen in time.  Modern interventionThe process of finding and bargaining with a guide was seen as a rite of passage and perceived as a fixed itinerary when visiting Naples by the 1820s. However, by 1862 the process was streamlined through a ticketing system and aided by Thomas Cook tours in 1864, which organised excursions across Europe and the UK. (3) Thomas Cook introduced Pompeii into the wider itinerary for European travel and created structured visits, transforming the whole experience entirely. (4) This streamlining process aided in structured and accessible exploration without the reliance on local knowledge from tour guides. The structured approach to visiting Naples and the volcano became compacted in visitor guidebooks that provided details, logistics and descriptions of the site that prepared visitors instead of blindly entering the area. In many ways, this approach allowed greater control, but took away that thrill of foreign travel that was once alluring to those undertaking the grand tour and the stories of unknown territory. However, with an influx of tourists and the instability of volcanic eruptions the typography changed through man-made interventions and eruptions cutting new paths to the summit. For example, throughout the nineteenth century, a road was built leading to the Hermitage and by 1844 an Observatory was built that increased accessibility and scientific interest, once again changing the way visitors interacted with the area. (3) The road allowed easy access for carriages and turned the path to Mount Vesuvius into a commodity that many could just ride up in a carriage and pay enough money to be taken to the summit. Some travellers referred to the lines of carriages all flocking the summit as ‘Derby Day’. Even the way that visitor experienced the climb changed from many embracing the dirt and ash and the physical toil that the climb had on their body to those who didn’t need to exert themselves at all.As tourism flourished, the need for tighter regulations also increased. The local government began to regulate the guides and control their numbers and activities on the mountain. (3). The Ordinance of 1846 reduced the number of official guides to 16 with the requirement to speak at least one foreign language and be of “good character”. (3) These official guides were issued permits and given fixed prices to charge for tours to the summit, this eliminated the need for bargaining that so many travellers associated with early visits to Naples. The intervention of the local government undermined the select few who held a monopoly on activities in the area and controlled the routes to and from Mount Vesuvius previously. Visitors now had a variety of options and better communication while travelling. Despite this improvement a handful of tourists still preferred to continue to travel through the Resina area for the adventure rather than to choose the convenience of the railway. Ultimately, the need to haggle and bargain for a guide was unnecessary and the production of widely accessible guidebooks stating the dangers of guides who bargain eliminated this step. The intervention of travel agencies like Thomas Cook played a major part in the flourishing of tourism and the accessibility to a wider audience. This intervention sanitised the experience and today it is very common for travel agencies to employ English-speaking travel reps to work in hotels abroad and act as a point of contact and excursion organiser for British tourists. This checkpoint removes the need to integrate within the local culture and is distant from the experience of those who undertook the grand tour in the eighteenth century. Growing strainsFurthermore, the greater the number of visitors the greater the strain on the surrounding infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs. It is only natural that as these attractions become popular, the need to modernise or transform the way that visitors interact with the area must adapt to the new needs of tourists. The development of photography and ability to produce souvenirs from the excursion created a heightened awareness that reached a wider audience. By 1880, the introduction of a funicular railway to Mount Vesuvius eased the journey and reliance on guides for the whole journey. Instead guides were only needed for the climb to the summit. This railway cut a 1 hour and 30 minute ascent to a 12-minute ride that could transport 300 passengers a day. (3) Despite improving the visitor experience, the funicular didn’t achieve much of a profit and cost too much to run. By 1887, Thomas Cook’s son John Mason Cook swooped in to save the funicular but refused to accept the guide’s request for a concession payment. (3) This created major tension and protests from the tour guides resulting in the burning of the station, cutting the track and throwing one of the funicular cars into Vesuvius’s crater. The guides interfered with repairs and damaged the line, prompting the closure for 6 months until an agreement was settled. Finally a settlement agreed that a portion of every ticket sold on the funicular was given to the guides in exchange for their services at the upper station to the top of the volcano (100 yards). (3) This agreement changed the structure of guides from independent to employees. Albeit, the funicular did close in 1955 after the completion of a road and was no longer used. Tourism rapidly changed because of the work of travel agents like Thomas Cook. They created an itinerary and holiday with strict structures that focused on stress-free experiences that avoided the issues that past travellers had to negotiate. Before long, a hotel, restaurant, railway and toll roads that issued levies on non-Cook customers surrounded the volcano. (3) These infrastructures provided stable income for the local community and the romantic idea of struggle and enlightenment through the treacherous climb was replaced by comfort, ease and convenience. Tourists were distanced from physical challenges of the environment and the immersion with the locals. The volatile volcano could be conquered with little effort, which is a far cry from the gruelling path made by many grand tourists of the eighteenth century.Both the site of Pompeii and Herculaneum preserve history in a fixed point in time, but some historians argue that this moment may not reflect the extent of daily life as many did evacuate and take personal possessions. These sites still offer historians and visitors a unique opportunity that no other historical or archaeological site can do, even if much of the original structures were severely damaged during the eruption. The excavation of Pompeii opened up a human and emotive narrative that connected with visitors on a different level than just an event in the past. However, with the growing number of tourists visiting Naples today, there is increased concern for the safety of both the site of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Pompeii has a lasting legacy and it appears many tourists wish to do the same. Reports include tourists vandalising and purposefully damaging the frescos with one Dutch visitor writing their name in permanent marker in bold letters and some scratching their initials into the stone. (5) In the future, there must come a point where local governments and heritage bodies such as UNESCO need to evaluate the safety of the sites with the growing number of visitors. Arguably, some visitors potentially view the site as a tourist attraction or commodity for their personal consumption rather than a place of immense historical value and a memorial to those killed by the eruption. This point is something that is lost through the commercialisation and allowing open access to the public. Italy has also started to restrict the number of tourists entering Pompeii by only issuing 20,000 tickets per day and utilising timed slots in peak summer times to help ease the human pressures placed on the fragile site. (6) It’s not just Pompeii that is struggling under the number of visitors, popular locations like Venice, Portofino, Capri and Rome also experience immense strain during peak season. (6)                                                                                          ConclusionThe awe and unpredictability of nature is one that has captivated visitors for centuries and still offers an unmatched experience. To visit Mount Vesuvius and walk around the site of Pompeii has only grown in its popularity due to the timeless preservation of history. Pompeii is a haunting reminder the natural world cannot be domesticated irrespective of technology that monitors and tries to predict the next natural disaster. The rise of tourism to the area and many other UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Europe have been made accessible through industrialisation, railway and other transport options that connected remote areas that were once only accessible by carriage. Large travel agents have replaced the control from the local monopoly that select families had over visitor routes and territory by structured excursions. The Grand Tourists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century embellished a daring and treacherous experience through writing, artwork and word of mouth, which creates this fear of missing out. Social media is just a more advanced way to distribute these stories about Pompeii and other cities that replaces the old-fashioned grand tourists. However, like with all major cities that often become shrouded in a romanticised version or one that is often embellished, the reality of visiting some of these locations can often be underwhelming. This is especially evident when heritage sites become flooded with tourism that poses a threat to the preservation of heritage and culture. What is most evident is that while museums, writers and artist can attempt to capture the feeling and atmosphere of cities and heritage sites, they cannot always replicate that feeling of being there in person. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.
