    "description": "The Bronze Age, 3000 - 1200 BCE, marked a period of remarkable human progress. Across the Mediterranean and Near East, great civilizations flourished, building empires, advancing technology, and creating extensive trade networks. This era was defined by the widespread use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, which revolutionized warfare, agriculture, and craftsmanship.Yet, around 1200 - 1150 BCE, a cataclysmic event known as the Bronze Age Collapse brought many of these civilizations to their knees. Cities burned, trade routes crumbled, and once-powerful kingdoms disappeared from history. Understanding this collapse is crucial because it reshaped the ancient world, leading to the emergence of new societies and altering the course of human development.Terry Bailey explains. A depiction of Ramesses II triumphing over the Hittites in the siege of Dapur. Available here. Major civilizations \u0026 political structuresEgypt (New Kingdom)At its height, Egypt's (New Kingdom) 1550 -1070 BCE, was a formidable empire stretching from Nubia to the Levant. Pharaohs such as Thutmose III, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses II expanded Egypt's influence through military conquest and diplomacy. Monumental structures like the Karnak Temple and Abu Simbel reflected Egypt's immense wealth and power. However, by the 12th century BCE, Egypt faced increasing pressure from external invasions, particularly from the enigmatic Sea Peoples. The Hittite EmpireCentered in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Hittite Empire 1600 - 1180 BCE, rivalled Egypt in power. The Hittites controlled key trade routes and were masters of chariot warfare. Their capital, Hattusa, contained vast archives of cuneiform texts that provided insight into their administration and military campaigns. However, the empire struggled with internal strife and external threats, weakening its ability to resist the upheavals to come. Mycenaean GreeceThe Mycenaeans 1600 - 1100 BCE, dominated the Greek mainland and the Aegean. They were warrior-kings who built impressive palatial centers such as Mycenae, Pylos, and Tiryns. The deciphered Linear B script reveals a highly organized bureaucratic system managing agriculture, taxation, and military affairs. The legendary Trojan War, though mythologized by Homer, likely reflects real Mycenaean involvement in conflicts across the eastern Mediterranean. Minoan CreteThe Minoans, 2000 - 1450 BCE, predated and influenced Mycenaean Greece. Though their dominance declined following natural disasters and invasions, Minoan culture persisted in Mycenaean Crete. The palace of Knossos, with its vibrant frescoes and labyrinthine corridors, stands as a testament to its artistic and architectural prowess. Babylonia \u0026 AssyriaThe Mesopotamian world was dominated by Babylonia and Assyria. Babylonia (under the Kassites) thrived as a center of learning and law, preserving the traditions of Hammurabi. Assyria, meanwhile, grew into a militaristic powerhouse. Both states relied on complex administrative systems documented in vast collections of cuneiform tablets. Canaanite City-StatesCanaanite city-states, such as Ugarit and Byblos, were crucial trade hubs linking Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Aegean. Excavations at Ugarit have unearthed extensive archives detailing commercial transactions and diplomatic correspondence, illustrating the interconnectedness of Bronze Age societies. The Sea Peoples and other marginal societiesBy the late Bronze Age, a mysterious confederation known as the Sea Peoples began raiding coastal settlements. Their origins remain debated, but they contributed to widespread devastation, particularly in Egypt and the Levant. Other groups, such as the nomadic Arameans, also began challenging established powers. Economic \u0026 cultural achievements Trade networks: The lifeblood of civilizationTrade was the backbone of the Bronze Age economy. Copper from Cyprus and tin from Afghanistan and Cornwall, (a region within what is now known as Great Britain), were essential for bronze production. Ships laden with goods crisscrossed the Mediterranean, linking civilizations in a vast commercial web. The Uluburun shipwreck, discovered off the coast of Turkey, provides a snapshot of this trade, carrying goods from Egypt, Mycenae, Canaan, and Anatolia. Writing systems: Record-keeping and administrationWriting systems such as Linear B (used by the Mycenaeans), cuneiform (Mesopotamia), and hieroglyphs (Egypt) were vital for governance, trade, and literature. The clay tablet archives of Hattusa and Ugarit offer invaluable records of diplomatic agreements and economic activity. Monumental architecture and artThe era saw grand architectural feats, from Egyptian temples to Mycenaean citadels. Art flourished, depicting religious rituals, military exploits, and daily life in vivid frescoes and sculptures. Military strategists and technologyBronze weaponry, chariots, and composite bows revolutionized warfare. Fortifications, such as the massive walls of Mycenae, showcased advancements in defensive architecture. Signs of weakness before the fallClimate fluctuations and early signs of droughtPaleo-climatic studies indicate that the Late Bronze Age experienced episodes of drought, possibly disrupting agriculture and weakening states reliant on food surplus. Overextension of EmpiresMany kingdoms expanded beyond their sustainable limits, placing immense strain on resources and administration. The Hittites, for example, struggled to maintain control over their vast territories. Internal revolts and instabilityEvidence from cuneiform records and archaeological layers of destruction suggests that internal conflicts weakened several states before the final collapse. ConclusionIn conclusion, the Bronze Age was a golden era of human civilization, one of technological ingenuity, political complexity, and flourishing trade. It was a time when great empires such as Egypt, the Hittites, and Mycenaean Greece extended their influence through diplomacy, warfare, and economic expansion. The Mediterranean and Near East were interconnected in ways that foreshadowed the globalized economies of later millennia. However, this intricate web of civilizations proved fragile when faced with a perfect storm of challenges.The collapse that followed between 1200 and 1150 BCE was not a singular event but a cascading failure of societies already weakened by climate fluctuations, internal strife, and overextension. The arrival of the enigmatic Sea Peoples was only one piece of a larger puzzle, migrations, famines, and political upheavals all played a role in dismantling the old world order. The once-thriving palaces of Mycenae, the archives of Hattusa, and the great cities of Canaan were reduced to ruins, signaling the end of an age.Yet, from this collapse emerged new foundations for the civilizations that followed, which were not merely a period of decline but one of transformation. The rise of new powers, such as the Neo-Assyrians and later the Greek city-states, laid the groundwork for the Iron Age, ushering in fresh innovations and cultural shifts. The lessons of the Bronze Age collapse remind us of the fragility of interconnected societies, and the resilience of human civilization to rebuild, adapt, and evolve. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

This timeframe is derived from archaeological excavations at the site of Hisarlık in modern-day Turkey, which is widely believed to be the historical Troy.The most accepted dating suggests that Troy VIIa, a layer of destruction at the site, aligns with the traditional period of the Trojan War. Evidence of fire, siege, and violent collapse at this level supports the idea of a catastrophic event, though whether it corresponds precisely to the war described by Homer remains debated.Homer's Iliad, composed around the 8th century BCE, presents the war as a grand narrative of honor, heroism, and divine intervention rather than a precise historical account. The epic revolves around the wrath of Ἀχιλλεύς (Achilleus, Achilles) and the siege of Troy, but it does not depict the city's fall.The Iliad ends before the infamous Trojan Horse ruse and the final destruction. In this sense, Homer's version serves more as a metaphorical exploration of Troy as a symbol of human ambition, conflict, and fate rather than a strict retelling of events. The war, as depicted, is as much about the cultural and moral struggles of the Greek world as it is about an actual historical conflict.The actual fall of Troy likely involved a prolonged siege, resource depletion, and internal strife rather than the singular dramatic deception of the Trojan Horse, which appears in later literary traditions such as The Aeneid by Virgil.Archaeology suggests that the city was indeed destroyed and rebuilt multiple times, reinforcing the idea that Troy was both a historical location and a mythological and literary construct, shaped over centuries to reflect the values and anxieties of the Greek world. The literal translation of the IliadThe actual literal translation of Ἰλιάς (Ilias), pertaining to Ilium, the ancient name for the city of Troy, comes from Ilios(Ἴλιος), an alternate Greek name for Troy. In essence, Ilias means \"The Story of Ilium\" or \"The Tale of Troy.\" The commonly used English title, The Iliad, follows this meaning, signifying Homer's epic poem about the Trojan War. Egyptian chronologyThe chronology of ancient Egypt is often adjusted due to the challenges associated with reconstructing a timeline from fragmentary and sometimes contradictory evidence. Unlike modern calendars, the Egyptians used a regnal-year dating system, meaning events were recorded based on the number of years a particular pharaoh had ruled. When records of a pharaoh's reign are incomplete or lost, historians must rely on other methods, such as archaeological evidence, astronomical calculations, and synchronization with other ancient civilizations, to estimate dates. This can lead to revisions when discoveries alter previous assumptions.One major reason for adjustments is the reliance on astronomical data, particularly references to the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis), which the Egyptians used to track their calendar. However, because their calendar lacked leap years, it drifted relative to the solar year, creating inconsistencies when trying to correlate it with absolute dates. Additionally, king lists and inscriptions from different sources, such as the Turin King List, the Palermo Stone, and Manetho's history, sometimes conflict or contain gaps, requiring scholars to reinterpret the evidence.Furthermore, ancient Egypt's interactions with neighboring civilizations, such as the Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians, provide external synchronization that can refine its chronology. However, as these civilizations’ chronologies are revised, Egypt's timeline must sometimes be adjusted accordingly. Advances in radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) have also provided new insight that occasionally challenges traditional historical dating, leading to further refinements in Egypt's timeline. Consequently, Egyptian chronology remains a dynamic field, continually updated as new evidence emerges.",

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/4/12/american-isolationism-is-back-again-a-historical-view",
    "description": "David Hamilton’s forthcoming book The Enigmatic Aviator: Charles Lindbergh Revisited  finds earlier parallels with current events and looks at the ever-changing verdict on Lindbergh. Here, the author considers American isolationism in the context of his new book. Charles Lindbergh shown receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross from President Calvin Coolidge in June 1927.The American Founding Fathers counseled that the nation should ‘avoid foreign entanglements’, and President Trump's recent hesitation in support of Ukraine brings back memories of earlier similar debates. In the 1930s, the mood in Congress and the country was that American involvement in World War I had been a mistake and had not only failed to make the world ‘safe for democracy,’ but too many lives had been lost or damaged. But by 1940, President Roosevelt started to try to convince America to get involved in the new war in Europe. Public opinion was divided, and although there was majority support for giving help of some kind to beleaguered Britain, the polls were against putting ‘boots on the ground’. Leading the opposition to such deeper involvement was the America First Committee (AFC), the most significant grassroots movement ever in America, and they preferred the term ‘anti-intervention’, which did not suggest total withdrawal from the rest of the world. The AFC had the most support in the Midwest, while FDR and his hawks in the cabinet had the backing of the anglophile East Coast. The AFC had bipartisan political support and was joined by writers and historians. Eventually, their star speaker at the regular nationwide rallies was the American aviator hero Charles Lindbergh (1902-1974). After his famous solo flight to Paris from New York in 1927, he had retained a remarkable mystique since he coupled his success in the world of commercial aviation with a policy of avoiding the still-intrusive press, particularly the tabloids, by using the European royalty’s strategy of ‘never complain never explain.’ He traveled widely in Britain, France, Germany, and Russia and proudly showed their military planes; it was his confidential reports via the Berlin American embassy back to G2 intelligence in Washington on the Luftwaffe strength that eventually convinced President Roosevelt in 1938 to order a rapid expansion of the American Air Corps. From 1939, Lindbergh added his voice to the anti-intervention movement, starting with historically based, closely argued radio broadcasts and then speeches at the large AFC rallies later. His emergence was doubly uncomfortable for FDR. He not only feared Lindbergh’s contribution to the debate but knew that his close connection to the Republican Party (including marrying Mexican ambassador Dwight Morrow’s daughter) meant he could be a formable populist political opponent should he run for president, as many had urged. In response, FDR and his inner cabinet, aided by compliant congressmen and friendly columnists, mounted an unpleasant campaign against Lindbergh, and, rarely debating the issues he raised, they preferred an ad hominemattack. His travels in Germany and interest in the Luftwaffe made him vulnerable, and the jibes included but were not limited to, claiming he was a Nazi, a fifth columnist, an antisemite, a quisling, and even, mysteriously, a fellow traveler. World War TwoIt is often said that Lindbergh and the AFC lost the intervention argument to FDR, but instead, Pearl Harbor brought abrupt closure to the still evenly balanced debate. Thereafter, during the War, Lindbergh worked in the commercial aviation sector and then flew 50 distinguished missions with the Marines in the Pacific. After FDR’s death, the unpleasantness of the intervention debate was admitted and regretted (‘there was a war going on’), and some private apologies reached Lindbergh. Even the FBI was contrite. FDR had brought them in to investigate Lindbergh, even using illegal wiretaps. Still, when J. Edgar Hoover closed their huge file on him, he added a summary saying that ‘none of the earlier allegations had any substance.’ Lindbergh was welcomed back into the post-war military world. As a Cold War warrior, he worked with the atomic bomb air squadrons and served on crucial ballistic missile planning committees. From the mid-1950s, he successfully took up many conservation issues. Now a national icon again, but a reclusive one, his book on the Paris flight and the book sold well. From Truman’s administration onwards, he was in favor of the White House, and the Kennedys sought the Lindbergh’s company, invitations which the couple occasionally accepted. Now, on the White House’s social A-list, Nixon also puts him on important conservation committees. When he died in 1974, President Ford expressed national sympathy. Later, Reagan’s addresses to young people often invoked Lindbergh as a role model.  Lindbergh disparagedBut by the end of the century, something changed, and his place in history became uncertain. This was not the result of new scholarly work or an adverse biography. All the post-war literature had been favorable to him, including Berg’s thorough Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of 1998, which cleared him of any Nazi leanings or antisemitism.[1] The damage to Lindbergh instead came from historical fiction. The basis of Philip Roth’s best-selling novel The Plot Against America 2004 was the well-worn ‘what if’ fictional trope that Hitler won the European war. Lindbergh, elected as US president, aligns with him and acts against the Jews. Roth's usual disclaimer was that his story was not to be taken seriously, but it was. Historical fiction can be entertaining if the sales are low and the author obscure, but the inventions can be dangerous in the hands of a distinguished author. An HBO television series of the same name based on the book followed in 2020, and it often felt like a documentary. Serious-minded reviewers of the television series took the opportunity to reflect widely on fascism and antisemitism, with Lindbergh still featured as a central figure. The mood at the time was ‘wonkish,’ looking again at figures of the past and seeking feet of clay or swollen heads, or both. When others sought any justification for Roth’s allegations, they returned and found the smears and insults directed at Lindbergh during the intervention debate. The old 1940-1941 jibes were revisited, and, yielding to presentism, to the dreary list was added the charge of ‘white supremacist,’ which at the time had escaped even Lindbergh’s most vocal opponents. Evidence for all the old labels was lacking, and to prove them, corners were cut even by serious historians, leading to a regrettable number of mangled or false quotations. The most vivid tampering with the historical record was misusing a newspaper picture taken at an AFC rally in 1941. It shows Lindbergh and the platform party with arms raised, and the caption at the time noted that they were loyally saluting the flag. The gesture at that time was the so-called Bellamy salute which was soon officially discouraged and changed in 1942 to the present hand-on-heart version because of its similarity to the Nazi salute.  Washington’s Smithsonian Institution was now revisiting Lindbergh, and although they had proudly used Lindbergh’s plane Spirit of St Louis as their star exhibit since 1928, they had now deserted him. An article in their Smithsonian Magazine, after denigrating the AFC, described Lindbergh as ‘patently a bigot’ and used the image suggesting a Nazi salute.[2] The Minnesota Historical Society, also with long-standing links to the Lindbergh heritage, also turned to him and answered inquiries about Lindbergh by directing them mainly to the Roth novel and the television program based on it. They also recommended a shrill new book on Lindbergh subtitled ‘America’s Most Infamous Pilot.’. Lindbergh had not been ‘infamous’ until 2004.The 100th anniversary of Lindbergh's classic flight will be with us soon in 2027. The damage done by Roth’s mischievous historical fiction should be met instead with good evidence-based history, restoring the story of this talented man. David Hamilton is a retired Scottish transplant surgeon. His interest in Lindbergh came from the aviator’s laboratory work as a volunteer in Nobel Prize-winner transplant surgeon Carrel’s laboratory in New York.[3]  His forthcoming book is The Enigmatic Aviator: Charles Lindbergh.[1] A.
