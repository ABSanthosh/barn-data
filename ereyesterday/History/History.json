    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/4/10/audrey-hepburn-in-world-war-two",
    "description": "One of the most devastating conflicts in history, the Second World War, touched the lives of millions, its impact also played a huge role in the life of Oscar winning actress, and beloved style icon, Audrey Hepburn. Audrey’s early life was spent in Holland in the midst of the Nazi Occupation where she witnessed the best and worst of humanity, and developed the ideals that would influence her later life.Erin Bienvenu explains. Audrey Hepburn in 1952. Available here. Audrey was born in Brussels, Belgium, on May 4 1929, to an English father and Dutch mother. Her mother, Ella van Heemstra, was from an aristocratic family, and already had two sons from a previous marriage, Alexander and Ian. She had met Joseph in the Dutch East Indies. Through a genealogy study, she believed her husband was a descendant of James Hepburn, the third husband of Mary Queen of Scots. Excited by this royal connection Ella insisted the family adopt the name ‘Hepburn-Ruston.’When Audrey was six her father walked out on his family, an event that would haunt her for the rest of her life. He returned to England, where Audrey was also sent to school. Despite their close proximity Joseph never visited his young daughter and the lonely Audrey immersed herself in the world of ballet. It enriched her life and she was determined to become a prima ballerina.  War BeginsAudrey’s life was uprooted once again when the Nazi’s invaded Poland, and Britain declared war. Ella believed her daughter would be safer in Holland, which had a history of neutrality, and genuinely thought that Hitler would respect the countries stance.  Audrey was driven to the airport by her father, it was to be the last time she would see him until she was an adult. Little Audrey had largely forgotten how to speak Dutch during her time away, and she found school difficult, again dance became her escape. She lived with her mother and brothers in Arnhem, where they were close to extended family.All hopes of safety were dashed when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. At first, Audrey remembered, life seemed to go on as normal. The soldiers behaved politely in an attempt to win over the Dutch people. Audrey continued to go to school, though her lessons increasingly became focussed on the war and Nazism. That same year Audrey enrolled in the local dance school, where her teachers were impressed with her passion and gracefulness.Despite their initial conciliatory behaviour, the Nazis soon revealed their true colours and life for the citizens of Arnhem began to change. Food was rationed, and day to day life became increasingly dangerous. Audrey’s brother Alexander was determined not to be forced into work by the Germans and he went into hiding, Ian however was not as lucky. To his family’s immense distress, he was rounded up and forced to work in a Berlin munitions factory. Audrey was also a witness, on multiple occasions, to the local Jewish population being herded onto cattle cars at the train station-their destination then unknown. The horror of these scenes became a recurring theme in her nightmares, she was horrified at the way the Nazis treated people. She saw the Nazis shooting young men in the streets, the violence becoming a constant in people’s lives. Then her beloved Uncle Otto was arrested as a reprisal for an underground attack on a German train. Otto was held hostage in the hopes the real perpetrators would come forward.  They did not, and he and four other men, were executed some weeks later. Adding to her distress, Audrey’s parents had a complicated relationship with the Nazis. Like many in their social circle both Joseph and Ella had initially been attracted to the ideas of fascism, they even met Hitler in 1935. But as the war went on, Ella’s beliefs began to change, she had seen too much cruelty and suffering. Joseph meanwhile spent the war years imprisoned in England for his fascist sympathies.Helping the ResistanceDistraught by what had happened to Otto, Ella and Audrey went to live with his wife, Miesje, Ella’s sister, and their father in the town of Velp, just outside of Arnhem. Audrey held a special place in her heart for her grandfather, with whom she spent many hours doing crossword puzzles, he became the father figure she had so longed for. It was also in Velp that Audrey began doing volunteer work for local doctor, Hendrik Visser t’Hooft, a man with close ties to the resistance. Through the doctor Audrey and her mother became involved in events known as ‘black evenings’, concerts organised to raise money for the resistance. In private homes, sometimes her own, Audrey danced for a select audience with the windows blackened and doors guarded so that no Nazi could look in. It was a family affair; Ella made her daughters costumes and Audrey choreographed her own routines. It was a welcome, though risky, distraction from the events going on outside. Audrey was to remember fondly how, “The best audience I ever had made not a single sound at the end of my performance.”This was not the only way Audrey helped the resistance. At least once she delivered copies of the underground newspaper, Oranjekrant. She hid copies in her socks and shoes and then cycled off to deliver them. On another occasion the doctor sent her into the woods near Velp with food and a message to a downed allied airman. No doubt Audrey’s fluency in English made her valuable in this role. On her way home however, she ran into a German police patrol. Thinking quickly and remaining calm, Audrey began picking wildflowers which she offered to the men. Seeing such a young, innocent girl, they sent her on her way without a second thought.As the war continued food became an ever-increasing problem, and in order to supplement their meagre rations many were forced to forage in the countryside for additional supplies. The van Heemstras ate nettles, grass and made flour from tulips, but it was never enough and Audrey was soon suffering from the effects of malnutrition.Another problem arose when she turned fifteen. She was required to register, in order to continue dancing, as a member of the Dans Kultuurkamer, an institution created by the Nazis in order to control the arts in Holland. Audrey wouldn’t consider joining such an organisation and this coupled with her poor health led her to temporarily give up her dance lessons. But dance was vital to Audrey’s well-being so she began teaching others instead, offering small private lessons where she could pass on her knowledge and enthusiasm. Operation Market GardenIn September 1944 the allies launched Operation Market Garden – what was supposed to be the beginning of the successful liberation of the Netherlands. They landed near Arnhem and in the fierce fighting that followed the town was all but destroyed. From her home in Velp, Audrey could hear the almost continuous sound of gunfire and explosions. The Germans ordered the complete evacuation of Arnhem, and many of the displaced made their way to nearby Velp. The van Heemstras, who also had an unwelcome Wehrmacht radio operator working in their attic, opened their home to about forty refugees. The scenes all around invoked a strong response in the compassionate Audrey. She later said, “It was human misery at its starkest.” She was eager to help, offering dance lessons to the anxious citizens of Arnhem in an effort to distract them from the horror outside. She also continued to help Dr. Visser t’Hooft with the endless stream of wounded who came pouring in. Soon even local schools were converted into make shift hospitals, but conditions were desperate.During this time Audrey’s family also hid a British paratrooper in their cellar. If discovered they would all have paid with their lives, but for Audrey the situation was also exciting. The paratrooper was a kind of knight in shining armour, he represented liberation and freedom to her. It’s not known how long he remained with the family before the resistance could spirit him away, but eventually the Nazis ordered all the refugees from their temporary homes. SurvivingWhen Operation Market Garden did not succeed, the Dutch were forced to endure what became known as the ‘hunger winter.’ Disease and starvation were rife and Audrey developed jaundice. Then in March 1945 she was rounded up on the street with several other girls, destined to work in the understaffed German military kitchens. Thankfully Audrey had the presence of mind to run off when the soldiers had their backs turned. She made it home and hid in the cellar until it was safe to come back out. Not long after the allies again began to close in on the Germans and Arnhem was once again under siege. The van Heemstras spent much of their time in the safety of their cellar, occasionally resurfacing to assess the damage to their home and to try and gain any news of the invasion. They lived as best they could, never quite sure what each day would bring, and then, finally, after weeks of fighting the constant barrage of noise stopped.Hearing voices Audrey and her family cautiously emerged from their hiding place. At their front door they discovered a group of English soldiers, Audrey was over joyed. She recalled, “freedom has a bouquet, a perfume all its own – the smell of English tobacco and petrol.” The soldiers were equally delighted to have liberated an English girl! The war was finally over.Audrey was just sixteen years old, malnourished and suffering from jaundice, asthma, edema and anemia – but she was alive, and that was what mattered most to her. As was her immediate family, her two brothers had also survived the war.Audrey resumed her ballet studies, which took her to Amsterdam and then London, and in the end to a career as an actress. However, she never forgot her war years, they shaped her as a person and would lead to the role she most valued, helping underprivileged children in war torn countries as an ambassador for UNICEF.  Find that piece of interest?

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/4/8/the-crimean-war-part-6-the-long-term-effects-and-historical-significance",
    "description": "The Crimean War (1853–1856) is often remembered for the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade, the pioneering efforts of Florence Nightingale, and the brutal conditions suffered by soldiers on all sides. However, its true significance extends far beyond these well-known episodes. As the final instalment in this series, we examine how the war shaped future conflicts, modern medical practices, political realignments, and cultural legacies. The Crimean War was a crucible of change, marking a transition from traditional to modern warfare and leaving an enduring impact on global history.Terry Bailey explains.Read part 1 in the series here, part 2 here, part 3 here, and part 4 here. A Russian Emancipation Reform took place in 1861. The above painting is Peasants Reading the Emancipation Manifesto, an 1873 painting by Grigory Myasoyedov.A catalyst for future conflictsThe Crimean War foreshadowed many aspects of later conflicts, particularly the American Civil War (1861–1865) and the First World War (1914–1918). Tactical developments, such as the use of rifled firearms, improved artillery, and early trench warfare, highlighted the obsolescence of Napoleonic-era battle strategies. The war also underscored the importance of logistics, supply lines, and rail transport, elements that would become central to modern warfare.For the American Civil War, the Crimean War offered key lessons in battlefield medicine, military organization, and the use of industrial technology in war. Notably, Union and Confederate forces adopted the rifled musket and the Minié ball, both of which had proven devastating in Crimea. Additionally, the use of railways to transport troops and supplies became a strategic necessity in the American conflict.During the First World War, echoes of the Crimean War were unmistakable. Trench warfare, extensive use of artillery bombardments, and the difficulties of siege warfare at Sevastopol found eerie parallels on the Western Front. Furthermore, the Crimean War demonstrated the importance of alliances and diplomacy, a factor that would play a crucial role in shaping the alliances of 1914. The war's role in modern medical practicesPerhaps one of the most enduring legacies of the Crimean War is its impact on medical care. The appalling conditions in field hospitals, where infections ran rampant and sanitation was virtually nonexistent, led to a medical revolution spearheaded by figures such as Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole. Nightingale's implementation of hygiene protocols, improved ventilation, and systematic patient care dramatically reduced mortality rates.The war also highlighted the need for organized battlefield nursing, paving the way for the establishment of professional nursing as a respected vocation. Nightingale's work influenced the founding of the modern military medical corps and laid the groundwork for the Geneva Conventions and the Red Cross movement. Political fallout for Russia and the Ottoman EmpireThe Treaty of Paris (1856) ended the Crimean War but left deep political wounds, particularly for Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Russia, previously regarded as an unstoppable force in Eastern Europe, suffered a humiliating defeat that exposed its military and logistical shortcomings.The war spurred Tsar Alexander II to initiate the Great Reforms, including the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and the modernization of the Russian military. These reforms, while significant, also sowed the seeds of future unrest and revolution.For the Ottoman Empire, the war briefly strengthened its position as a European power, but it also underscored its dependence on British and French support. The empire's chronic instability and economic weaknesses persisted, contributing to its gradual decline and eventual collapse in the early 20th century. Enduring cultural legacyThe Crimean War left an indelible mark on literature, art, and memorial culture. Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem The Charge of the Light Brigade immortalized the tragic heroism of British cavalrymen, ensuring that their doomed advance remained a symbol of both courage and folly.Meanwhile, artists such as Roger Fenton pioneered war photography, providing some of the first visual records of conflict and shaping public perceptions of war.Memorials to the Crimean War can be found across Europe, particularly in Britain, where statues, plaques, and monuments honor the sacrifices of soldiers. The war's legacy also persists in the many place names and military traditions inspired by its battles and leaders. The transition to modern warfareThe Crimean War marked a crucial shift from traditional to modern warfare. The use of industrial technology, the importance of logistics, and the role of the press in shaping public opinion all foreshadowed conflicts to come. It was one of the first wars to be extensively covered by newspapers, influencing government decisions and public sentiment in a manner that would become standard in later wars.Moreover, the Crimean War demonstrated that war was no longer solely about battlefield heroics; it was about endurance, supply chains, and public perception. It highlighted the growing importance of infrastructure, railways, telegraphs, and steam-powered ships, which would become indispensable in future conflicts.Needless to say, the Crimean War was far more than a conflict of empires vying for influence; it was a turning point in the evolution of warfare, medicine, politics, and culture. It heralded the twilight of the old world and the dawn of a new era defined by industrialized conflict, strategic alliances, and the inexorable advance of technology.The echoes of Sevastopol's sieges, the lessons learned in battlefield medicine, and the political upheavals it triggered all reverberated through the decades, shaping the course of history in ways its contemporaries could scarcely have imagined.Militarily, the war exposed the obsolescence of outdated tactics and underscored the necessity of logistical efficiency, mechanized transport, and advanced weaponry, principles that would dominate future conflicts from the American Civil War to the mechanized horrors of the 20th century.In medicine, it catalyzed a transformation that saved countless lives in subsequent wars, institutionalizing sanitation, organized nursing, and the professionalization of medical care. Politically, it reshaped the balance of power in Europe, compelling Russia to modernize, hastening the Ottoman Empire's decline, and reinforcing the precedent that alliances could determine the fate of nations.Culturally, it imprinted itself onto literature, photography, and collective memory, immortalizing both its tragedies and its triumphs.Ultimately, the Crimean War stands as a watershed moment in global history, a conflict fought with the weapons of the past and present, therefore, bearing the hallmarks of the future. It was a war that reshaped the world, not only through the treaties that concluded it but through the profound and lasting transformations it set in motion.The shadows of Crimea stretched far beyond the battlefields of the 1850s, lingering in the wars, politics, and medical advancements that followed, ensuring that its legacy endures to this day. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

The work of figures such as Florence Nightingale and others, who revolutionized military medical care and nursing by improving sanitation and organizing hospitals, underscored the desperate need for standardized and humane treatment of the wounded.The inefficiency and suffering witnessed during the war deeply influenced the movement towards formalized humanitarian protections. Swiss humanitarian Henry Dunant, inspired by similar horrors he observed during the Battle of Solferino (1859), took up the cause of improving battlefield medical care.His 1862 book, A Memory of Solferino, argued for the establishment of a neutral medical organization to aid wounded soldiers regardless of nationality. This led to the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863 and, a year later, the signing of the First Geneva Convention in 1864.While the Geneva Conventions were not directly a product of the Crimean War, the lessons of that conflict, especially the need for better medical care and organized humanitarian efforts, greatly contributed to the momentum that led to their establishment.",
