Recognizing the allure of the sea and the mountains, we designed a space that naturally draws the gaze outward in every direction.",

Set on a narrow lot with side-yard setbacks, the evocative mid-century façade belies an unexpected rear that is more modern. The metal and wood slats of the entrance are quite aesthetically pleasing and offer additional privacy to the residents. The material asymmetry in the front courtyard is a nod to the playfulness of the back of the home.",

    "description": "The project involves the renovation of a house that enjoys the unique views of the coastline in Garraf Natural Park. The main concept revolves around a series of questions: How can architecture invite the contemplation of the sea, sky, and nature? How can we reconnect humans to their original state of harmony with their natural surroundings? How can we frame the landscape, turning it into a series of pictures within a domestic space? The proposal embraces the Japanese design technique called Shakkei, meaning “borrowed scenery”, where the external landscape of the garden is integrated to become part of it. From the beginning, the house was conceived as a habitable viewpoint.",

The project aims to transform the company's existing spaces to integrate new trends and evolutions in contemporary work environments. We developed the project following a dual approach: first, to support the ongoing transformation within the company according to principles of flexibility, hybridization, and sensitivity to people's well-being, by creating spaces with varying levels of adaptability, privacy, and IT infrastructure. Therefore, we carried out a radical rethinking of the aesthetics of the spaces, introducing materials and atmospheres that reflect Terna's technological dimension, enhancing its focus on sustainability,\" explain the designers.",

The house was purchased by a young couple who had a long-term view from the outset. Our client understood that a bright future for them and their family would go hand in hand with a low-carbon future for the planet. They wanted a home for their future family that reflected their heritage and personality. They also wanted a place that would have low energy demands and be a light touch on the environment. Collective Works set off to complete a low-carbon deep retrofit, with natural, healthy materials. Just as they wanted to go beyond building regulations in terms of thermal performance, airtightness and operational energy use, they wanted the new kitchen dining room facing the garden to be more than a box.",

    "description": "Every child who dreams of Tibet holds a G318 dream. The Sichuan-Tibet Highway, renowned as \"China's Scenic Avenue,\" has always been a sacred route for travelers. About 200 km past the junction of the southern and northern Sichuan-Tibet routes from Chengdu to Lhasa lies the most spectacular part of the journey. Famous attractions such as the Bangda Grassland, Nujiang Grand Canyon, Ranwu Lake, and Laigu Glacier are scattered throughout the small town of Baxoi in eastern Tibet.",

    "description": "Landscape architecture firm SCAPE together with Bjarke Ingels Group have announced plans to transform Connecticut's Manresa Island into a public-oriented development as a hub for learning, exploration, and community engagement. Originally slanted for private waterfront housing, the new scheme aims to open up the area as a public park with ample waterfront access, a project led by SCAPE. Additionally, the decommissioned coal-fired power plant is set to be converted by BIG into a community hub for multiple activities including swimming, small and large-scale events, research, and educational rooms. Supported by a private philanthropic investment from Austin McChord, the project is set to open in 2030 through a phased development.",

    "description": "During the summer of 2024, an interesting experience was carried out in the Armenian Caucasus mountains. A group of people somewhere in a very rocky and wild environment gathered to construct an undefined and seemingly useless multi-species artifact. They woke up at 5.30 am every morning, worked under an intense heating sun on an improvised construction site, prepared meals together three times a day, played football in the evening, and sometimes danced at night. There were some wild dogs always around, horses as well, a couple of vultures close to where they were building, invisible and dangerous snakes, and wonderful mantises. They seemed happy and tired. From afar, the experience felt absurd and beautiful at the same time.",

Over time, as the definition morphs into different bodies, the practice of curation continues to evolve, filling the roles of caretakers of our built environment and thinkers of different forms for the overall bettering of society.",

The existing building is an old brick row house, 5 meters wide and 37 meters deep, facing a major downtown street. Many surrounding shops have glass walls facing the road to maximize air-conditioned space, which disconnects them from the city. In tropical cities, as streets become more commercialized, the depth of the city is lost, and sidewalks tend to become mere passageways.",
