Behind the fence, there is invariably a perfectly manicured lawn, a green carpet upon which life can unfold. This image and its associations are not, however, accidental. In her book, \"Domesticity at War\", Beatriz Colomina notices that, since the Second World War, the lawn has taken a central space in the imagination of the country, becoming first a in order to make space for diversity, both social and ecological. symbol of the stability of the homes soldiers were hoping to return to, offering a space where those at home could still perform duties for the nation, and, after the war, propagating the image of an idealized lifestyle, one maintained with hard work and dedication. In recent years, the lawn has emerged once again as a site of conflict, this time between those hoping to preserve this idealized image, and those seeking to break the uniformity in order to make space for diversity, both social and ecological.",

    "description": "When we think of spaces that foster meditation, our minds often travel either to Japan's Zen gardens, where clean lines and carefully arranged landscaping call for stillness, or to Scandinavia's designs with neutral tones and soft fabrics. These styles evoke a sense of calm through simplicity, often seen as a characteristic of Japanese and Northern European architectural styles. Yet, stillness and meditation are not restricted to these types of settings. Latin American architectural traditions also offer powerful, though often overlooked, approaches to meditative spaces. With earthy tones of terracotta, rough adobe textures, intimate courtyards, and a strong connection to nature, these environments call for reflection through warmth and material richness, creating spaces that are calming without being understated.",

Strategically positioned to capitalize on its prime location, the building offers unobstructed views of the Han River to the south and the scenic Namsan Mountain to the north. The design not only meets but exceeds the rigorous standards of local building codes, reflecting a thoughtful approach to urban architecture.",

Nestled along the coastline near Tokyo Bay, this idyllic retreat offers an uninterrupted view of the vast seascape. Perched on a gentle hill, the residence boasts a clear view of Mount Fuji on sunny days, while on the opposite side, lush mountains rise, their dense foliage almost embracing the property. Recognizing the allure of the sea and the mountains, we designed a space that naturally draws the gaze outward in every direction.",

Set on a narrow lot with side-yard setbacks, the evocative mid-century façade belies an unexpected rear that is more modern. The metal and wood slats of the entrance are quite aesthetically pleasing and offer additional privacy to the residents. The material asymmetry in the front courtyard is a nod to the playfulness of the back of the home.",

    "description": "The project involves the renovation of a house that enjoys the unique views of the coastline in Garraf Natural Park. The main concept revolves around a series of questions: How can architecture invite the contemplation of the sea, sky, and nature? How can we reconnect humans to their original state of harmony with their natural surroundings? How can we frame the landscape, turning it into a series of pictures within a domestic space? The proposal embraces the Japanese design technique called Shakkei, meaning “borrowed scenery”, where the external landscape of the garden is integrated to become part of it. From the beginning, the house was conceived as a habitable viewpoint.",

The project aims to transform the company's existing spaces to integrate new trends and evolutions in contemporary work environments. We developed the project following a dual approach: first, to support the ongoing transformation within the company according to principles of flexibility, hybridization, and sensitivity to people's well-being, by creating spaces with varying levels of adaptability, privacy, and IT infrastructure. Therefore, we carried out a radical rethinking of the aesthetics of the spaces, introducing materials and atmospheres that reflect Terna's technological dimension, enhancing its focus on sustainability,\" explain the designers.",

The house was purchased by a young couple who had a long-term view from the outset. Our client understood that a bright future for them and their family would go hand in hand with a low-carbon future for the planet. They wanted a home for their future family that reflected their heritage and personality. They also wanted a place that would have low energy demands and be a light touch on the environment. Collective Works set off to complete a low-carbon deep retrofit, with natural, healthy materials. Just as they wanted to go beyond building regulations in terms of thermal performance, airtightness and operational energy use, they wanted the new kitchen dining room facing the garden to be more than a box.",
