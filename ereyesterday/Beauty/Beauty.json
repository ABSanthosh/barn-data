    "description": "If you’ve spent any amount of time lurking on BeautyTok, you’ll be familiar with the legend that is Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, $25. This sheer, universally flattering cherry lipstick has more or less achieved icon status, beloved by beauty editors and celebrity makeup artists alike. Black Honey’s appeal is pretty easy to sum up: Thanks to a mix of warm and cool pigments in the formula, the tinted lip balm imbues a natural berry-like color that somehow looks different, but lovely, on every skin tone. So when word got out that Clinique is growing the Almost Lipstick family with the launch of Nude Honey, $25, we could barely contain our excitement. This latest shade expansion promises to be equally wearable, but with a neutral twist. Given the internet’s ongoing fascination with all things Black Honey, we’re confident that Nude Honey will be charting the same path to cult status as its older sibling. Here are our thoughts on why it’s shaping up to be the next viral beauty hit this summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Almost Lipstick in Nude Honey, $25 Venus Wong, senior writer “Like many beauty editors, Black Honey sits at the top of my makeup rotation. I turn to it whenever I want a just-bitten wash of color on my lips. Fresh from the tube, Nude Honey actually looks strikingly similar to its predecessor, but the magic happens once you swipe it on: unlike some of the nude and light brown lip stains and tints I’ve tried, it didn’t make me look like I’ve just had an espresso and had forgotten to wipe my lips. Instead, Nude Honey adds a dewy apricot-pink coat. As someone with cool and neutral undertones, I often struggle to find lip colors that don’t skew too warm. Not Nude Honey, though. The formula contains both warm and cool pigments, and the lip color was a natural fit. I’ll be turning to this lipstick on the days I want to look understated but put together.” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director “I have a confession to make: I’m not huge on Black Honey — mainly because it skews too pink on my light olive skin — but Nude Honey is just right. The phrase ‘my lips but better’ is an overused cliché in beauty, but it’s the only way to describe this shade. Looking back at my selfies wearing it, it suits me down to a T, don’t you think? There’s something about the peachy nude that pulls the rest of my makeup together, making everything look more polished and uniform. Beyond the spot-on color, I love how deeply moisturizing it is. When I apply it in the morning, my lips stay soft and hydrated right through to lunchtime. Like its berry-tinged counterpart, the staying power is more like a glossy balm, and you’ll need to reapply it throughout the day, but I don’t mind. The thin tube is sleek enough to slip into even the tiniest handbag.” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer “As a fan of Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, I was pleasantly surprised by the Nude Honey launch. The brand describes it as ‘a surprisingly flexible nude that looks different on every lip,’ and I’d say that’s pretty spot on. Nude Honey enhanced my lips beautifully, with a subtle warmth that brings out my natural lip color. Is the pigment buildable, though? Not quite. The more you apply, the shinier it gets, but the color payoff remains about the same. This isn’t a bad thing, but just something to keep in mind. What I really love is how nourishing it feels on the lips, no doubt thanks to its 95% conditioning formula [think castor oil and plant-based waxes]. It’s the kind of product I reach for on days when I’m not wearing much makeup but still want something on my lips. The best part? It makes my lips look super smoochable. I’ll take 14 of these, please!” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer “I don’t think I could’ve created a better dream lipstick than Clinique’s Nude Honey if I tried. I’m not much of a lipstick girl because I don’t love the feeling of having something heavy on my lips, but this texture feels like a gorgeous lip balm with a hint of tint. I’m a fan of Black Honey, but it can sometimes be a little plummy on me for a casual daytime look. Nude Honey, however, is the perfect warm-toned neutral with a hint of muted red that makes my olive skin glow. It’s become my new go-to for an easy, effortless lip, and I love how compact the sleek tube is. I almost never finish a lipstick simply because I don’t use them all that often, but I have a feeling I’ll be restocking this one soon, the way things are headed.” Shop Ulta Like what you see?

    "description": "I won’t pretend sorbet nails are a brand-new trend for summer 2025. Let’s be real — they look a lot like the pastel manicures that pop up every year at this time. But while they’re not exactly groundbreaking, there’s no denying that the biggest nail artists are obsessed with them right now. From Iram Shelton’s shimmering strawberry manicure to Harriet Westmoreland’s mint sorbet French tips, sorbet nails provide a cool pop of color among the wave of neutral princess nails and milky manicures.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria | Nail Artist (@nailsxgoldenhour) What are sorbet nails? For the skeptics amongst us, there is a subtle difference between this year’s sorbet nails and more traditional pastels: “Though they’re in the same family of soft tones, sorbet shades are slightly more vibrant versions of pastel colors,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. “Inspired by their namesake edible summer treat, they’re even brighter and juicier, often with a sheer or jelly-like finish that gives a gorgeously glossy and playful vibe.” Think of fruity hues inspired by your favorite ice cream flavors, such as banana, peach, strawberry, or pistachio, if you’re unsure where to start. View this post on Instagram A post shared by faye louise dennis (@fayelouisedennis) How do you wear sorbet nails? Streets points out that sorbet shades lend themselves beautifully to summer nail art looks. “Soft ombré gradients in sorbet colors are a dreamy nail look for summer. Effortlessly blending shades like pinks and peaches, for example, creates a sun-kissed effect that feels light, airy, and totally on-trend,” says Streets. Additionally, for minimalists, French tips, half-moon manis, and simple, dainty dot designs are a great way to wear sorbet hues more subtly. Scroll ahead for some of our favorite sorbet nail looks to inspire your colorful summer manicures. @stephaniexmarie Summer sorbet vibes 🍧☀️💅🏼 #nailart #nails #creatersearchinsights #nailsoftiktok #nailinspo #trending #momlife #toddlermom #girl ♬ original sound – generational. DashDividers_1_500x100 Orange Jelly View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nail Bar Milwaukee (@nailbarmke) This dewy citrus manicure created by Nail Bar Milwaukee has a beautiful jelly-like texture, which gives it a really playful edge.

This strawberry milk and lemon sorbet fade created by nail artist Ramon Duran is utterly delicious. Strawberry Sorbet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) We’re with this sheer and shimmery delight created by nail artist Iram Shelton, and will be rushing to recreate this combination of soft sparkling base and juicy pink ombré. Peach Cooler View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria | Nail Artist (@nailsxgoldenhour) Juicy and ultra-glossy, this peach manicure created by nail artist Victoria screams summer. OPI’s Infinite Shine Nail Polish in Dreamsicle, $14.49, has the same sheer, watery feel, but with a touch of shimmer. Lemon Ice Streets pointed to pale yellow being one of the “huge breakout sorbet hues for spring”, and this monochromatic look created by @kkdnails proves that it isn’t going anywhere for summer. Try Essie Nail Polish in All Fun \u0026 Games, $10, for a similar buttery lemon hue. Watermelon Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zanë Jashari (@zanasnails) Aura nails lend themselves beautifully to sorbet hues, as nail artist Zanë Jashari proves with this delicate blush-colored design. Mint Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) The simplest way to dabble in sorbet shades if you’re a minimalist at heart is by switching the color of your French tips. This punchy mint look by Harriet Westmoreland is so fresh and chic. Try Sally Hansen Color Therapy Nail Polish in Take A Mint, $9.99, to get the look at home.

    "description": "Well, we might be about to chop all of our hair off. The truth is, we barely made it out alive with our shoulder length hair two years ago, after Hailey Bieber decided to go full snip mode but now that we've seen Sofia Richie's latest cut - a bouncy French bob - we've decided it's too chic to ignore. On June 21, the model posted a carousel showcasing her new look with the simplest of captions: \"French Bob,\" with a tag for her stylist, George Curran. Richie also posted a video on her TikTok account where she takes viewers step-by-step through the entire process. \"I've been thinking long and hard about this,\" Richie says in the video, explaining that she did \"one too many keratin treatments\" on her hair, but has been unable to get her dead ends to go away. \"So, we're cutting a bob,\" she says with finality. The video spans a full five minutes, and we see Richie go through the entire haircut process with Curran at Richie's home. \"I love my bob,\" Richie says about halfway through the video, while her hair is still wet and un-styled. And in news that will shock absolutely no one - it looks even better blown out and styled. @sofiagrainge Call me Bob @georgecurranhair ♬ original sound - Sofia Richie Grainge Richie isn't the first celebrity to embrace the French bob this year. Both Pamela Anderson and Zoe Saldaña debuted French bobs with micro bangs at the 2025 Met Gala, and we honestly think it could be shaping up to be the haircut of the summer. \"A French bob haircut is a short, chin-length cut,\" says hairstylist Raven Hurtado. It's a great way to get rid of dead ends, if you, like Richie, have some damage to your hair from using hot tools or one too many styling treatments. Plus, it's easy - and fast - to style. \"You can air dry or heat style,\" says Hurtado. \"For a tousled look, air dry using a mousse (you can also add a diffuser). To heat style, you can use a round brush and blow dry going under.\" Keep scrolling for a closer look at Richie's new cut, but only if you're prepared to want to make a salon appointment ASAP. It's that good.
