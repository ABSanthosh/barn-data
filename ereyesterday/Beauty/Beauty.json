    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Skims x Roberto CavalliYour swimsuit collection just got an upgrade courtesy of Skims x Roberto Cavalli. Kim Kardashian’s brand has teamed up with the Italian label to create a collection of form-fitting swimwear with archival Cavalli prints — think a scoop-neck one-piece splashed with a tiger face, separates adorned with florals, and matching flowy coverups. “We paired Cavalli’s most iconic prints with our signature swim silhouettes to deliver a sexy collection that empowers everybody to own swim season, no matter where they vacation,” Kardashian said in a press release. Shop on June 27 at Skims Hill House Launches Event Dressing Capsule Get ready to take your Nap Dress outside, because Hill House has debuted a capsule collection for event dressing.

But our favorite of the collection has to be the crochet-knit mini with feathered trim, based on one of Lele’s existing designs. The collection stands as the first Mango Collective drop, a platformaiming to celebrate niche designers.Available to shop now at MangoSupriya Lele x Mango Puffed Open-Back Bodysuit, $, available at MangoGlossier Lip GlazeLip oils have become all the rage in the last few years. From Dior’s Lip Glow Oil to NYX’s Fat Oil Lip Drip, the glazed look isn’t going anywhere. Just in time for summer, the new Glossier Lip Glaze touts itself as the “next generation” of lip oil, with a melt-on-the-mouth sheer finish and cooling menthol effect. Infused with ingredients like liquid shea butter and jojoba oil, the lip gloss replacement promises to leave lips feeling hydrated and nourished.

The footwear brand's latest collab with the Parisian label reimagines two beloved Converse styles — the Chuck 70 (in both high- and low-top silhouettes) and Chuck Wedge — with artful bandana-scarf prints borrowed from the latter's spring/summer 2025 collection. “Good design will always be noticeable, and you’ll never get bored of something that is well achieved — much like the Chuck,\" Marant said in a press release. \"This collection speaks to a cool, easy, and playful attitude.\"  Find the new sneakers in brown and red colorways. Shop on June 3 at Isabel Marant and June 5 at Converse.Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid BlushCream blush has been on trend, but some find the staying power lacking. That’s why cream-to-powder products are on our radar this summer, including Kylie Cosmetics' latest Hybrid Blush. Combining the easy-to-blend nature of cream makeup and the smoothing effect of a powder, the new product brands itself as “mistake-proof.” Available in eight different shades, our favorite hues include Sienna (a terracotta orange) and Slow Jam (a punchy grape shade).Available to shop now at Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid Blush, $, available at Kylie CosmeticsLevi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sAnastasia Beverly Hills Smooth Blur Contour StickStick applicators have redefined contouring, making it easier than ever to accentuate cheekbones and add dimension to the face. Now, Anastasia Beverly Hills is joining the conversation with the launch of its Smooth Blur Contour Stick.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Besides sunscreen, I firmly believe that no matter how many expensive serums, masks, or moisturizers you use, a cleanser is the single most important step in any effective skincare routine. Don’t just take my word for it. Whenever I’ve seen a dermatologist, facialist, or esthetician, their first question is always about which cleanser I use.  About a week ago, I got a bit of a scolding from one of those experts. The rich cleansing balm I’d been enjoying was actually breaking me out, and the fruity fragrance — thanks to a handful of essential oils — was completely stripping my skin. I was under strict instructions to pare things back. My mission? Find a gentle, fragrance-free cream cleanser that I could use for double cleansing in the evening (a must for removing all traces of makeup and sunscreen), and refreshing my skin in the morning. So when The Inkey List’s Hydrating Cream To Milk Cleanser, $19, landed on my desk, it felt like I’d hit the jackpot.  At first pump, this face wash feels like a lotion, but it transforms into a lightweight milk on contact with water. Just don’t underestimate its cleansing power — or its skincare benefits. One of the standout ingredients is 5% rice milk, a staple in many Korean skincare products that usually cost two or three times the price. Ideal for dry, flaky skin, rice milk helps soothe and soften while supporting the skin barrier, the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out. Beyond rice milk, there’s hydrating hyaluronic acid to counteract that tight, uncomfortable feeling post-cleanse, plus ultra-moisturizing glycerin and shea butter — two ingredients I actively seek out in skincare, particularly moisturizers. The Inkey List Hydrating Cream-to-Milk Cleanser, $19 I usually have two or three cleansers in rotation in my shower, but I’ve shelved them all for this. Just a couple of pumps are enough to melt away the multiple layers of mascara, sunscreen, and foundation I wear every day. My skin feels surprisingly clean after the first cleanse (I always count one minute), but doing a second ensures everything is properly removed and that my skin is prepped for the rest of my routine. Beyond its cleansing power, it’s so moisturizing that I actually forgot to apply moisturizer one evening after using it — and didn’t even notice until the next morning. Normally, my skin feels like it might crack if I skip moisturizer. That’s how hydrating it is I’m always keen to hear what my fellow beauty editors think, but when I put a call out on Instagram for other fans, I didn’t expect nearly as many replies. Beauty writer and Refinery29 contributor Vanese Maddix was first to extol its virtues: “Despite vowing to myself that 2025 would be the year I stopped having multiple skincare products open at once, every so often, a new launch comes along that completely throws me off guard and right now, that product is The Inkey List’s Hydrating Cream-to-Milk Cleanser,” she said. Maddix swears by the brand’s Dewy Sunscreen SPF 30, $16, and Exosome Hydro-Glow Complex, $20, (a favorite of mine, too), so it’s safe to say that she trusts the brand with her face. “Its founders, Mark and Colette, certainly know how to make a good skincare product,” she added, “so when I heard the brand was launching a cream-to-milk cleanser, I couldn’t have been more excited. As someone with a normal-to-dry skin type, my face laps up anything with a milky texture, and this one did not disappoint.” Like me, Maddix found that the intensely hydrating formula removed SPF and makeup effortlessly: “I often wear blue mascara, which can be a pain to take off, but this cleanser is up there with some of my favorite cleansing balms and oils as it removes every trace so quickly, without stinging or drying me out,” said Maddix. “I’ve tried my fair share of cleansers that say they don’t leave your skin feeling tight or dry afterwards, but this one genuinely doesn’t. After almost a month of using it, my skin continuously feels soft, moisturized, and hydrated after each use. That’ll be the 5% rice milk and hyaluronic acid doing their thing.” For Maddix, using it to the very last drop — and adding it to her repurchase list — is a “no-brainer”.  Beauty editor Lucy Abbersteen is equally enamored: “I love a cream cleanser so much and this got promoted to my bathroom cabinet after first use,” she told me. “The texture is such a dream, and it wipes off clean every time.” Beauty editor Madeleine Spencer said that she “adores it,” adding, “It’s so gentle and doesn’t leave my skin angry.” Likewise, beauty editor, trend forecaster, and brand consultant Louise Whitbread said that it’s great for double cleansing and especially gentle on her acne- and rosacea-prone skin. You’re probably thinking, It’s just a cleanser. But not cleansing your skin properly — especially at night — means anything you apply afterwards (think potent retinol serums or exfoliating acids) won’t absorb as effectively. If you ask me, that’s a waste of both time and money. Better still, you get a surprisingly generous amount of product for just $19, and it seems we’re all stocking up for the summer.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "title": "The “Love Island” Glam Room Is the Show’s Unspoken Hero",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/love-island-glam-room-49387069",
    "description": "Now that \"Love Island USA\" season seven is officially underway, it has us reminiscing about all the things that have happened in previous seasons. One of our favorites to date? Season six. Not only was last year's season filled with confrontations, tears, and plenty of drama – but there were also a lot of tender moments, too. And while some might argue that Casa Amor brought the biggest relationship tests of season six, there was no single place more important than the show's glam room. This was where those real, meaningful friendships bloomed. Located somewhere off the villa's main stairwell, the glam room is exactly as it sounds: a place for the women to congregate and get ready for the day, equipped with dedicated hair and makeup stations, cabinets full of free beauty products, and full-length mirrors. More than that, each and every season it seems to become a safe haven for the cast of \"Love Island,\" where vulnerable conversations, heated arguments, and sometimes even breakfast came with a side of hairspray and contour. Olivia \"Liv\" Walker, season six's first bombshell, says it was also where they could open up, crowdsource advice, and air frustrations – all while learning new beauty skills and sharing clothes. \"Watching the show back now, I can see how many big moments we were having in the dressing room,\" she says. \"Our girl group was so strong; we had each other's backs. We fight like sisters, we get ready like sisters, we share each other's clothes [and] makeup. But the best thing about having the glam room as our own little space away from the boys was that we were able to open up and be very vulnerable with each other.\" Walker says the \"comfortable\" atmosphere of the dressing room – a space fully stocked with Dyson styling products, First Aid skin care, and Maybelline makeup that she calls \"beautiful, stunning, and every girl's dream\" – made it an ideal escape to blow off steam or get advice from the other girls. As season six went on, you could see the islanders begin to share clothes, makeup, and beauty tips as their comfort levels with one another grew. Everyone was trying to help each other look and feel their best. Take the moment before the Casa Amor re-coupling for example: the women came together in the glam room as a united front to help each other decide what to wear. The same can be said as they all ran to their closets to help Nicole Jacky pick out lingerie for her Hideaway date with Kendall Washington. It made for some of the most relatable scenes of the show that felt like friends helping someone get ready before a first date or running into an ex. If you've ever befriended someone in the women's bathroom, swapping lipstick recommendations or complimenting someone's outfit, or have gotten ready in front of the same mirror as your friends for a night out, this scenario might sound familiar. There's no place or bonding moment that's more universal. That's why watching the friendships unfold in this familiar territory on \"Love Island\" was especially refreshing to watch. Walker agrees, arguing that \"getting ready is the best bit about every single night out,\" whether it's in the villa or at home. \"It's so much fun to put makeup on with your friends, dress up, do hair. Honestly, a lot of us didn't know how to use the Dyson Airwrap until Nicole came in and taught us how to do the curls,\" she says. On the show, Walker says the ritual of getting ready also helped smooth over the tension as the cast put their differences aside to help each other get glam. \"Someone will go at it one second, and the next second it's like, 'Oh my god, do you mind doing my winged eyeliner?'\" This camaraderie extended beyond filming, too; Walker revealed the women had silly behind-the-scenes hangouts in the glam room, including taking advantage of some of the beauty freebies. \"Leah, Kaylor, and I did blind makeovers where one of us would sit in the chairs in the change rooms, and then the other two would just go ham on each other's faces and we couldn't look,\" she says, laughing. \"We'd do blue eyebrows, we'd do designs, and we'd go to the next person, and the next person. Those were the funniest moments ever.\" The best thing about having the glam room as our own little space away from the boys was that we were able to open up and be very vulnerable with each other. Walker also credits her season six co-star Serena Page for helping her nail a braided half-up look, Leah Kateb for doing everyone's pedicures, and Kaylor for making sure her winged eyeliner looked snatched. Even now that she's left the villa, she says she still uses Leah's go-to moisturizer, Weleda Skin Food ($20), as well as the Maybelline products introduced at the villa, particularly the Fit Me Pressed Powder ($9) and the 24-Hour Foundation Powder ($13). (She's still getting the hang of the Dyson styler.) In the end, though, it wasn't about the products or how someone chose to style their hair that day. Rather, Walker says beauty became a way to decompress and bond on a lighter note before some of the more stressful parts of the show. \"It sounds silly, but when you are doing your makeup and trying on dresses, you really see people's real personalities. You're giggling and you're just talking about silly stuff that you don't necessarily always get in villa because it's all about opening up and having those [serious] conversations.\" In between all the drama, relationship ups and downs, and unexpected moments of connection that made this season of \"Love Island USA\" so riveting, the glam room remained the one constant - and that's what made it the secret sauce of the show's success. The universal ritual of getting ready together helped bridge the gap between a reality show and real life, and to that we say: we're buzzing.

    "description": "For the past few weeks, Selena Gomez has been serving up nothing but sleek back styles over on her Instagram page. We get it; temperatures are rising, and it's one of the easiest hairstyles to look put together while keeping your hair out of your face. But it seems like Gomez is finally letting her hair down and she doesn't want to hear what you think about it. The Rare Beauty mogul posted a new shaggy cut complete with tousled fringe. She captioned the post, \"I would, but I'd regret it, then get it redone so I simply won't.\" Seems to us like she's had bangs before, gotten rid of them, and then quickly missed them. Sounds like the most relatable thing she's ever posted. What is it about bangs that makes everyone in our lives think they can have an opinion on them? Gomez set the record straight by letting everyone know she wasn't going to regret her choice - no matter how hot it's about to get in the upcoming months.",
