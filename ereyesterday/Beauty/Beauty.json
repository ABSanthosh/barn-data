    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/igk-antisocial-dry-hair-mask-review-49296456",
    "description": "When it comes to beauty routines, I give the most attention to my hair. My hair type is fine and frizzy, and ever since I got highlights, it's been a bit of a dry, tangled mess. In an effort to get it back to where it was prior to being color treated (soft and impossibly shiny), I've been testing out different shampoo and conditioner combinations. I'm in the process of swapping my apartment's shower head to something filtered, and I also rotate through different hair masks weekly. When I heard about the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask ($36), I was confused. A dry hair mask? The only masks I had ever tried before were . . . well, wet, and they needed to be washed out after application. This one said it didn't need a rinse, and the before-and-after photos looked great, but I was skeptical and thought the whole thing sounded too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the IGK Leave-In Dry Hair Mask and find out why I can no longer live without it. About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask This product is a dry overnight hair treatment mask, so you don't need to wash or restyle your hair after use. It's safe for all hair types, as well as color and chemically treated hair. It's made with bond-building technology to repair hair, as well as vegan silk proteins to soften and smooth hair. It comes in a 5oz bottle as well as a 1.7oz travel size. It's free of sulfates, parabens, and phthalates. It's vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. The packaging is also recyclable. What I Like About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The first time I tested it out, I had no idea what to expect. I had never tried a \"dry\" hair mask before, so I wasn't sure if it would work or if I would notice a difference. I followed the instructions exactly and applied it on dry hair right before bed. I'm used to waking up with tons of tangles and knots (even when I sleep on a silk pillowcase), but I woke up the next morning with hair that felt soft, silky, and smooth to the touch. Since then, I've been using it twice a week in between washes. I have a lot of frizz, especially at my roots, and whenever I use this product, I notice fewer flyaways and more shine. It doesn't weigh my hair down, and if I weren't physically watching myself spraying it onto my hair (and then seeing the results later), I wouldn't believe there was any product on my hair at all. Although I have a few masks I typically keep in heavy rotation, I have to wash them out, and I can't go about my day when wearing them unless I opt for a slicked-back bun. This product makes doing a hair mask so much easier and more convenient because I don't have to wash it out; it makes my hair more manageable with just a few sprays, and it also smells amazing. How to Use the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The brand recommends shaking the can and then applying the product to dry hair in sections before going to bed. They suggest spraying as evenly as possible while holding the can 10 to 12 inches away from your hair. Then, brush everything through. When you wake up in the morning, comb through your hair again - but no need to wash it. I use this mask in two ways. I either follow those directions exactly - using it before bed - or I spray it on my hair during the day, when it's looking a little dry and is in obvious need of some TLC. I've found that when I section my hair out prior to application, I get the best results. But occasionally, if I'm in a rush or feeling lazy, I spritz it all over my hair while it's down and brush it through, then continue on with my day, and I genuinely notice a difference just minutes after applying. What to Consider Before Trying the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this product; it's become a staple in my weekly routine. It even comes in a travel size - which I need to purchase ASAP - so you can make sure you bring soft and silky hair with you wherever you go. Where the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask Is Available The IGK Antisocial Bond-Building Leave-In Dry Hair Mask is available directly on IGK as well as Sephora, Ulta, and Amazon. Rating:",

From the “kicked” bob (an ultra-short crop with flicked out ends) to the “clavi” cut (a mid-length chop that skims the clavicle or collarbone), we weren’t short on haircut inspiration in 2024. But with a new year comes a fresh perspective — and countless more ways to wear our hair, too. If you’re keen to switch things up this January, look no further. Ahead, we asked a handful of London’s most sought-after hairstylists for their 2025 haircut predictions. There’s something for everyone, whatever your hair type or texture. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Snack-Size Bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cassidy Gurev (@hairbycassidy_) Anita Rice, cofounder of Buller and Rice, says that the bob will live on in 2025 but it’ll get even shorter. “The snack-size bob, also known as the ‘kick’ bob, sits at the jawline and flicks out at the bottom,” Rice explains. “It boasts blunt edges but there’s a lightly chopped texture [throughout] to add a little bit of versatility, so that you can flip around easily.” Rice suggests it works best with a side parting, slicked back with gel or mousse, or tucked behind the ears. The inspiration? Think musician Låpsley, says Rice, or this cut posted to Instagram by hairstylist Cassidy Gurev of The Hair Bros.  The Boxie View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rubi (@poseandrepeat) The “bixie”, a cross between a bob and a pixie cut, is getting something of an upgrade for 2025. Enter: the “boxie”, which is a little longer and less maintenance, says James Bickmore, art director at Neil Moodie Studio. “It’s perfect for those who are growing out a pixie but don’t want a bob,” he says. “It’s easy to manage and gets better as it grows out. It has a very ‘I woke up like this’ vibe — with a bit of an edge.” Take inspiration from content creator Rubi on Instagram. The Low Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by barbie ™ (@loc._queen) Lorraine Dublin, a celebrity hairstylist, hair expert and educator, predicts that the “low” cut — as seen on Rihanna recently — is going to be a bold and beautiful hair statement in 2025. “This style showcases how to elevate your natural curls while keeping things low maintenance,” says Dublin. “To achieve this look, start by cutting your 4A curls to remove dead ends and any chemical treatments. Rihanna opts for a shorter length, but this style can also be customized with slightly longer layers for a softer look.” Keen to go even shorter? Look to model @loc._queen on Instagram. As for colou, Dublin says that golden tones add warmth and dimension, complementing the texture beautifully. “To style, I’d recommend starting with a hydrating shampoo and conditioner, followed by a deep-conditioning mask,” says Dublin. “Fenty Comeback Kid Leave-In Conditioner, $36, and Homecurl Curl Defining Cream, $28, are perfect for enhancing and shaping curls,” she adds. “Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to define the curls further, creating a polished yet effortless finish.” Bangs-Meets-Layers View this post on Instagram A post shared by G R A C E A M E L I A (@graceamelia___) If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, suggests Zoe Adams, international artist at Taylor Taylor London. “[Bangs] paired with layers is making a strong comeback for 2025, offering a soft and romantic aesthetic,” she says. “The layered structure creates movement, while the bangs frame the face, adding definition and depth.” Even better, this style is ideal for most hair lengths, says Adams, but it works especially well for those with thicker hair looking to add lightness and shape. Anything goes, too. “Curtain bangs, wispy [bangs] or bold, blunt bangs can all complement layered cuts beautifully,” says Adams. This heavily layered cut by Grace Amelia hits the nail on the head. The Mixie ’25 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hair by Andy Judd (@andy_doesyourhair) Cut by Andy Judd, this mullet-meets-pixie on Addie Jean Carroll is the cut of 2025. “The mixie is full of texture,” says Rice. “It’s essentially an outgrown pixie with soft edges around the hairline, but length at the back can be kept longer to create a wolf cut variation.” According to Rice, the less styling, the better. “Wear it natural for a ‘bedhead’ look,” she says. “Consider heavily texturized [bangs]; the length can be adjusted to your taste.” The Italian Bob 2.0 View this post on Instagram A post shared by Athisha Khan (@athishakhan) With both Bickmore and Adams singing its praises, the Italian bob is in no danger of becoming outdated, but thanks to the abundance of nifty hot brushes out there, we’re going to play around with the size. Take a cue from this cut on Athisha Khan. Try the ghd Rise Professional Hot Brush, $167. Characterized by soft, subtle layers that sit just above the shoulders, Bickmore says the Italian bob offers the perfect balance of volume and movement. “It’s effortlessly chic, low maintenance and works beautifully with natural textures, making it an ideal choice for those looking to combine style with ease,” he says. If your hair is on the fine side, Adams suggests asking your stylist for blunt ends to maximize the volume. “Whether styled sleek or with a soft wave, the Italian bob adds a touch of European elegance to any look,” she says. Triple XL Hair View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alyssa / curly hair friend ❀ (@alyssarxs) XL = extra long à la Charli xcx. “We’ve been seeing so much long long long hair (hence triple XL), and it’s mostly worn with natural texture,” says Rice, like this cut on digital creator Alyssa. “Achieving this look won’t happen overnight but as we’ve seen so many times on the catwalk or in editorials, you can opt for a little help from clip-in extensions.” And if your hair is naturally this long? Maintain it well, says Rice: “Get your hair cut regularly — every six to eight weeks — and invest in conditioning treatments.” Try Davines Nou Nou Hair Mask, $40. “If your hair is [naturally wavy or curly], let it air-dry or diffuse and use a hair wand for extra waves if needed,” adds Rice. Try ghd Creative Curl Wand, $209. The Short Pixie Wig View this post on Instagram A post shared by G R A C E A M E L I A (@graceamelia___) If you don’t want to brave the scissors, Dublin says that a short pixie wig is an excellent way to play with a new style and shade sans permanent change. “This protective style allows you to enjoy a bold, cropped look without cutting or coloring your natural hair,” she says, pinpointing Leomie Anderson as inspiration. “Wigs and extensions are also perfect for people who frequently change their hairstyles or need to protect their hair from damage,” she says. “If you’re looking for versatility and protection, this trend is a game-changer.” Look to digital creator Thai. Brow Bone Contouring View this post on Instagram A post shared by Q. (@callherrq) Bangs will become mini hairstyles in their own right, suggests hairstylist Tom Smith. “In 2025 we’ll see a variety of fusions of previously popular [bang] styles,” he tells R29. “Birkin bangs [inspired by the late Jane Birkin], bottleneck bangs [between curtain bangs and full bangs], curtain bangs, micro [bangs] and various other brow- and cheekbone-skimming lengths will be customized to frame the eyes with softly textured and choppy pieces.” “[Bangs] like these are great for those who want something low-commitment because they’re softer and grow out gently, meaning they don’t require regular trimming,” adds Smith. He suggests asking your stylist what would work best for your face shape: “[This is important because they’ll] consider the size of your forehead, whether you want to show off your eyebrows or cheekbones and make sure you’re willing to tweak the style every morning. You’ll need to reset this area of your hair every day, so while it can be done quickly, it does require some daily maintenance.” We love these face-framing bangs on digital creator Q. The Modern Curly Mullet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tiff McColl 🐸🧚🏼‍♂️🍒 🐕🐕‍🦺 ✨FREE PALESTINE🍉 (@tiffmccoll) The mullet is making a major comeback, according to Dublin, and the modern iteration is made for those with curly hair. “[Women with curls] are reimagining this iconic cut with their natural textures,” says Dublin. “The look features shorter layers at the top and sides with longer, free-flowing curls at the back,” she adds, much like this style by hairstylist Tiff McColl. “The shape enhances volume and movement, and it’s perfect for those who want to push boundaries and pay homage to a style with rich cultural history while staying true to their natural hair pattern,” adds Dublin. She recommends adding a leave-in conditioner and a curl-enhancing cream to your hairstyling arsenal. Try Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning Repair Cream, $6.48, and Living Proof Curl Enhancer, $51.50. Anti Bangs View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) “Considering that we’ve had so much interest in [bang] shapes over the past few years, I predict that 2025 is going to invite in [the opposite] in the form of elongated face-framing — no distinguishable layers or shaping around the face, but lengths that sit longer than the chin,” says Smith. Ryenne Snow nails it with this cut. The key to maintaining [bangs] like these is being kind on your strands. “Avoid splitting by turning down the heat on your tools and using a product like Olaplex No.3,” says Smith, which reduces breakage. “Concentrate it around the weaker hairline areas and be gentle when brushing,” he adds. The Luxe Bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by B L O N D E HELSINKI🇫🇮 (@blondehelsinki) The classic lob, aka long bob, will get a sleek, luxurious upgrade for 2025, says Sam Burnett, owner and creative director of Hare \u0026 Bone salon. “This cut sits just above the shoulders, with seamless layers throughout the mid-lengths and ultra-blunt edges that create a polished, clean finish,” says Burnett, like this cut by Blonde Helsinki. “It’s modern, low-maintenance and perfect for anyone who wants versatility because it can be air-dried for an effortless vibe or styled for an ultra-refined look,” says Burnett.  The Midi Flick View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) Smith cites Florence Pugh and Kendall Jenner as celebrity inspiration but this chunky, flicky, mid-length cut on Sana, created by Francesca Inverarity of The Hair Bros, is by far our favorite look. “Thanks to the virality of 2024’s ‘bell bottom’ bob [a kicked-out bob haircut], we’re going to see flicky and textured mid-length shapes lead the way for [hair] trends in 2025,” says Smith. He suggests asking your stylist for a textured and layered shape that sits around your collarbone. “It’s best styled with soft, messy waves or natural curls if you have them,” says Smith. “Use a texture spray to modernize and add volume to the result.” Try Living Proof Full Dry Volume and Texture Spray, $49. The Layered Curtain Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nataliia Bumford (@nata.boo.hair) “This medium-length cut combines the softness of ‘70s-inspired layers with a modern edge,” says Burnett. Those layers should frame the face and blend seamlessly into the lengths. “[This provides] an airy, weightless effect,” adds Burnett. “It’s perfect for adding movement and dimension to thicker hair while bringing body and life to finer textures.” This cut by London-based hairstylist Nataliia Bumford is beautiful.  The Micro Contour Crop View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kiyotaka Tsutsumi (@kiyo_meynewyork) This is the evolution of the pixie cut. “It features sharp, tailored edges and subtle texturing around the face to sculpt and enhance your features,” says Burnett, like this cut by New York hairstylist Kiyotaka Tsutsumi. “It’s bold yet soft, framing the jawline and cheekbones beautifully and offering a fresh, edgy alternative.  Like what you see?

    "description": "It’s natural to want a fresh start when January rolls around. Some years I say I’ll exercise more, other years I vow to spend less time on my phone. But without fail my perpetual New Year’s resolution is to show my skin a little more TLC. While we may stumble over — or completely give up on — some New Year’s resolutions, your skincare routine shouldn’t feel like an insurmountable hurdle in 2025. Tiny tweaks can often make a world of difference and there’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. Ahead, we asked three dermatologists for their straightforward skincare resolutions to aim for in 2025. Trust us, these are goals you’ll actually want to stick to. DashDividers_1_500x100 Try retinal over retinol If your current retinol serum isn’t doing it for you, then it might be time to add retinal into the mix, according to Dr. Marisa Garshick, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology. Retinal or retinaldehyde — a skincare ingredient derived from vitamin A — is considered more potent than retinol and less irritating than a prescription retinoid (e.g. tretinoin), Dr. Garshick explains. Here’s how it works: For vitamin A derivatives to have an impact on the skin, they need to be converted to retinoic acid. “Retinaldehyde is considered more potent than retinol because it requires fewer steps to be converted to retinoic acid,” Dr. Garshick says. In other words, it works much faster. “[Retinal] is a great option for someone who has been able to tolerate retinol but isn’t seeing their desired results,” Dr. Garshick continues. If you have dry or sensitive skin which doesn’t do well with strong prescription retinoids, then retinal may also be your answer — and you can get it over the counter. Medik8’s Crystal Retinal, $54, is available in various strengths for retinal beginners and established retinal users alike. Also try Maelove Moonlight Retinal Serum, $39.95, with moisturizing squalane and ceramides, and R29-favorite Glow Recipe BlackBerry Retinol Blemish Serum, $48. If you want to spend less, try The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, $14.90. Skincare is much more than just your face  The experts are in agreement: All skincare routines should extend beyond your face. The neck, upper chest and hands are often forgotten about in skincare regimes, explains Dr. Mary Sommerlad, but these areas require just as much attention as your face does. She adds that the skin on the décolletage can be pretty vulnerable to the effects of excess sun and other elements like cold weather. This doesn’t mean you need to buy a specific décolletage cream, though. Bringing your usual moisturizer down to the neck and chest area is just as beneficial. But there are rules. “[The skin here is] incredibly delicate and may not tolerate high-strength acids in the same way as the face may,” Dr. Sommerlad says. Put simply, the 7% glycolic acid that works wonders on your blackheads could irritate the skin further down. Instead, Dr. Garshick recommends gentle yet effective creams with strengthening peptides, hydrating hyaluronic acid and, of course, sunscreen in the daytime. Her favorite multitasking face products that can also be used on the neck and chest include Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Face and Neck Cream, $76, and Peter Thomas Roth Ultimate Solution 5 Multitasking Moisturizer, $65. Also try Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer, $20, if you’d rather spend less. Look for moisturizers with these special ingredients  From hydrating niacinamide to moisturizing ceramides, 2024 saw a host of buzzy skincare ingredients. In the new year, growth factors (also known as GF) and peptides are two ingredients which are really going to be worth the hype, hints Dr. Garshick. Growth factors are types of proteins which increase skin hydration and stimulate skin cell generation. They are also notable in boosting and supporting collagen production, the key to supple skin, says Dr. Garshick. Then there are peptides. These, too, are proteins which strengthen the skin’s barrier — the outermost layer of skin that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). They’re excellent for smoothing skin that’s on the dry side. If you’re keen to give growth factors a go, Dr. Garshick recommends trying The Inkey List 15% Vitamin C + EGF Serum, $16. If peptides sound right for you, try Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream, $69. Understand how LED masks actually work  LED face masks are being hailed as the simple (though pricy) solution to tighter, smoother skin. In 2025, it’s important to understand how LED masks work if you want to reap the benefits. LED masks combine red, infrared and blue light at different wavelengths to rejuvenate skin. Red light, for example, has been shown to improve acne by reducing inflammation, neutralizing acne-causing bacteria and targeting overactive oil glands. It also activates the skin cells that produce collagen and elastin, promoting skin strength and elasticity.  Though LED masks are arguably the must-have tools of the moment, they are not a quick fix. Dr. Sommerlad explains, “Only invest in an LED light if you are prepared to be extremely consistent with use,” noting that some manufacturers recommend daily use (or at least multiple times per week) for several months. It pays to follow the instructions of your chosen tool. A well-made LED mask will feature various settings to target different skin concerns. If you’re ready to commit, try the Solawave Light Therapy Face Mask, $349, or the CurrentBody LED Light Therapy Face Mask, $469. Suncreen all year round If you’ve given up sunscreen this winter, you’re probably not the only one. But there are benefits to wearing SPF all year round, not least because 80% of UV rays can penetrate cloud cover, while UVA — responsible for premature aging and skin cancer — can also make its way through glass windows. NHS dermatology registrar Dr. Sonia Sharma suggests it’s a good idea to get into the routine of wearing sunscreen on a daily basis, even if it is cold and gloomy — and regardless of your skin tone. Dr. Sommerlad recommends choosing a lightweight, hydrating sunscreen with an SPF of 30 to 50, plus UVA protection. Try Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Lotion, SPF70, $9.88, which absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave behind a residue, or Garnier Pure Active BHA+Niacinamide Daily UV SPF50+, $26, which is equally easy to use. If hyperpigmentation is a skin gripe of yours, Dr. Sommerlad suggests trying a tinted sunscreen which also blocks visible light. Try Avène Mineral Multi-Defense Tinted SPF, $36, or La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Sunscreen, $38.99. Consider mole mapping Besides being diligent with sunscreen, people with a family history of skin cancer, or those with a history of tanning bed use, might also want to consider mole mapping or mole scanning services. Available in various towns and cities across the UK, such services use imaging technology to assess each and every mole on your body, ruling out suspicious and potentially cancerous lesions, as well as tracking any changes to your moles over time. “This is especially useful if you have a lot of moles,” says Dr. Sharma, adding, “If you are concerned about new or changing moles, it is important to seek medical attention to have these reviewed.” Mole mapping is available in various clinics across the US. Don’t overdo it While TikTok’s 10+ step skincare routines are captivating, skinimalism is the ultimate skincare mantra for 2025. Dr. Sharma advises against simultaneously using multiple skincare products with many different active ingredients, such as glycolic acid and retinoids. “Using lots of different skincare products can actually weaken the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] and cause more problems,” she explains, manifesting in dryness, sensitivity and inflammation. Dr Sommerlad advises prioritizing a healthy skin barrier. Her advice is to use gentle cleansers and moisturizers that contain humectants — ingredients that attract moisture into the skin. Hyaluronic acid and glycerin are some of the best known examples of such ingredients. Besides these, ceramides and peptides can also help to nourish, restore and maintain a healthy skin barrier, allowing you to get closer to your skincare goals. “Working consistently with effective yet gentle ingredients leads to longer term, sustainable results,” Dr. Sommerlad says. Cautious exfoliation Lastly, Dr. Garshick says that over-exfoliation needs to be left behind in 2024. “While it may be tempting [seeing as it leaves] the skin [feeling] softer and smoother, exfoliating too often — or too aggressively [using physical scrubs] — can actually create micro-tears in the skin which can lead to skin irritation and redness,” she explains. If alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic or lactic acid are a little too harsh for your skin type, look out for products containing poly hydroxy acids (PHAs) instead. These are made up of larger molecules and therefore don’t penetrate the skin as deeply but still have the power to smooth skin and unclog pores over time. Like what you see?
