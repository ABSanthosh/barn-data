    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/clinique-nude-honey-almost-lipstick-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If you’ve spent any amount of time lurking on BeautyTok, you’ll be familiar with the legend that is Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, $25. This sheer, universally flattering cherry lipstick has more or less achieved icon status, beloved by beauty editors and celebrity makeup artists alike. Black Honey’s appeal is pretty easy to sum up: Thanks to a mix of warm and cool pigments in the formula, the tinted lip balm imbues a natural berry-like color that somehow looks different, but lovely, on every skin tone. So when word got out that Clinique is growing the Almost Lipstick family with the launch of Nude Honey, $25, we could barely contain our excitement. This latest shade expansion promises to be equally wearable, but with a neutral twist. Given the internet’s ongoing fascination with all things Black Honey, we’re confident that Nude Honey will be charting the same path to cult status as its older sibling. Here are our thoughts on why it’s shaping up to be the next viral beauty hit this summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Clinique Almost Lipstick in Nude Honey, $25 Venus Wong, senior writer “Like many beauty editors, Black Honey sits at the top of my makeup rotation. I turn to it whenever I want a just-bitten wash of color on my lips. Fresh from the tube, Nude Honey actually looks strikingly similar to its predecessor, but the magic happens once you swipe it on: unlike some of the nude and light brown lip stains and tints I’ve tried, it didn’t make me look like I’ve just had an espresso and had forgotten to wipe my lips. Instead, Nude Honey adds a dewy apricot-pink coat. As someone with cool and neutral undertones, I often struggle to find lip colors that don’t skew too warm. Not Nude Honey, though. The formula contains both warm and cool pigments, and the lip color was a natural fit. I’ll be turning to this lipstick on the days I want to look understated but put together.” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director “I have a confession to make: I’m not huge on Black Honey — mainly because it skews too pink on my light olive skin — but Nude Honey is just right. The phrase ‘my lips but better’ is an overused cliché in beauty, but it’s the only way to describe this shade. Looking back at my selfies wearing it, it suits me down to a T, don’t you think? There’s something about the peachy nude that pulls the rest of my makeup together, making everything look more polished and uniform. Beyond the spot-on color, I love how deeply moisturizing it is. When I apply it in the morning, my lips stay soft and hydrated right through to lunchtime. Like its berry-tinged counterpart, the staying power is more like a glossy balm, and you’ll need to reapply it throughout the day, but I don’t mind. The thin tube is sleek enough to slip into even the tiniest handbag.” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer “As a fan of Clinique’s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, I was pleasantly surprised by the Nude Honey launch. The brand describes it as ‘a surprisingly flexible nude that looks different on every lip,’ and I’d say that’s pretty spot on. Nude Honey enhanced my lips beautifully, with a subtle warmth that brings out my natural lip color. Is the pigment buildable, though? Not quite. The more you apply, the shinier it gets, but the color payoff remains about the same. This isn’t a bad thing, but just something to keep in mind. What I really love is how nourishing it feels on the lips, no doubt thanks to its 95% conditioning formula [think castor oil and plant-based waxes]. It’s the kind of product I reach for on days when I’m not wearing much makeup but still want something on my lips. The best part? It makes my lips look super smoochable. I’ll take 14 of these, please!” Shop Ulta DashDividers_1_500x100 Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer “I don’t think I could’ve created a better dream lipstick than Clinique’s Nude Honey if I tried. I’m not much of a lipstick girl because I don’t love the feeling of having something heavy on my lips, but this texture feels like a gorgeous lip balm with a hint of tint. I’m a fan of Black Honey, but it can sometimes be a little plummy on me for a casual daytime look. Nude Honey, however, is the perfect warm-toned neutral with a hint of muted red that makes my olive skin glow. It’s become my new go-to for an easy, effortless lip, and I love how compact the sleek tube is. I almost never finish a lipstick simply because I don’t use them all that often, but I have a feeling I’ll be restocking this one soon, the way things are headed.” Shop Ulta Like what you see?

    "description": "I won’t pretend sorbet nails are a brand-new trend for summer 2025. Let’s be real — they look a lot like the pastel manicures that pop up every year at this time. But while they’re not exactly groundbreaking, there’s no denying that the biggest nail artists are obsessed with them right now. From Iram Shelton’s shimmering strawberry manicure to Harriet Westmoreland’s mint sorbet French tips, sorbet nails provide a cool pop of color among the wave of neutral princess nails and milky manicures.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria | Nail Artist (@nailsxgoldenhour) What are sorbet nails? For the skeptics amongst us, there is a subtle difference between this year’s sorbet nails and more traditional pastels: “Though they’re in the same family of soft tones, sorbet shades are slightly more vibrant versions of pastel colors,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. “Inspired by their namesake edible summer treat, they’re even brighter and juicier, often with a sheer or jelly-like finish that gives a gorgeously glossy and playful vibe.” Think of fruity hues inspired by your favorite ice cream flavors, such as banana, peach, strawberry, or pistachio, if you’re unsure where to start. View this post on Instagram A post shared by faye louise dennis (@fayelouisedennis) How do you wear sorbet nails? Streets points out that sorbet shades lend themselves beautifully to summer nail art looks. “Soft ombré gradients in sorbet colors are a dreamy nail look for summer. Effortlessly blending shades like pinks and peaches, for example, creates a sun-kissed effect that feels light, airy, and totally on-trend,” says Streets. Additionally, for minimalists, French tips, half-moon manis, and simple, dainty dot designs are a great way to wear sorbet hues more subtly. Scroll ahead for some of our favorite sorbet nail looks to inspire your colorful summer manicures. @stephaniexmarie Summer sorbet vibes 🍧☀️💅🏼 #nailart #nails #creatersearchinsights #nailsoftiktok #nailinspo #trending #momlife #toddlermom #girl ♬ original sound – generational.

Strawberry Sorbet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) We’re with this sheer and shimmery delight created by nail artist Iram Shelton, and will be rushing to recreate this combination of soft sparkling base and juicy pink ombré. Peach Cooler View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria | Nail Artist (@nailsxgoldenhour) Juicy and ultra-glossy, this peach manicure created by nail artist Victoria screams summer. OPI’s Infinite Shine Nail Polish in Dreamsicle, $14.49, has the same sheer, watery feel, but with a touch of shimmer. Lemon Ice Streets pointed to pale yellow being one of the “huge breakout sorbet hues for spring”, and this monochromatic look created by @kkdnails proves that it isn’t going anywhere for summer. Try Essie Nail Polish in All Fun \u0026 Games, $10, for a similar buttery lemon hue. Watermelon Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zanë Jashari (@zanasnails) Aura nails lend themselves beautifully to sorbet hues, as nail artist Zanë Jashari proves with this delicate blush-colored design. Mint Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) The simplest way to dabble in sorbet shades if you’re a minimalist at heart is by switching the color of your French tips. This punchy mint look by Harriet Westmoreland is so fresh and chic. Try Sally Hansen Color Therapy Nail Polish in Take A Mint, $9.99, to get the look at home.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/higher-dose-body-sculptor-ritual-set-review-49447748",
    "description": "If I had to pick one category of beauty products to invest in, I'd go with beauty gadgets. Whether it's LED masks, microcurrent devices, or tools geared toward sculpting and snatching, I'm always game to try them. Recently, Higher Dose just launched a tool that combines multiple different types of beauty technologies in one - and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it to try it. The brand is best known for its red light products (one of our editors is obsessed with the hair-growth hat), and the latest product combines red light, microcurrent, and lymphatic drainage. The main tool in the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set ($399) looks kind of like a mini boomerang (yeah, those things you throw), but what it actually does is a lot more interesting. No, it won't make its way back to you if you throw it, but it will help improve skin texture, increase blood flow, and ease your sore muscles. Sounds pretty good, right? Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set. About the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set It's a body sculpting tool that uses microccurent and red light therapy. It features 14 dual-chip LEDs. It helps support the body post-workout, offers temporary pain relief, boosts circulation, and enhances muscle tone. The set comes with a body sculptor, a sculpting activator gel, a transdermal magnesium spray, a carrying case, and a charger. Treatment time is 10 minutes per session. The battery takes three hours to charge, and lasts for 60 minutes. What I Like About the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set One of my favorite things about the Higher Dose Body Sculptor is that it's small and compact. I know that might seem like a tiny detail, but trust me when I say I own a lot of beauty gadgets, and most of them are ginormous and don't easily fit in a suitcase, let alone a purse. This product is sleek, and it's easy to stick in my overnight bag if I'm heading on a trip. Although it does require a tiny bit of elbow grease to use, it's one of the more fun - and relaxing - beauty rituals I do every week. It's especially nice to use on my calves post-workout, and it's also great for whenever I'm feeling bloated or swollen. I'm hoping that with continued use, I'll see an improvement in the cellulite on the backs of my legs. How to Use the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set This product can be used for fascia release, lymphatic drainage, and muscle activation. The brand recommends starting out with clean, dry skin, and then prepping with the Sculpting Activator Gel. You can also opt to layer with the Transdermal Magnesium Spray. Next, power on the device and select the mode you want to use. The red light only mode will power on automatically, but if you want to use the microcurrent, press and hold the button to turn it on and then select your intensity level. For the next ten minutes, begin by gliding the device over the skin in upward strokes slowly for one to five minutes per area. If your goal is to sculpt and firm, you can use firmer strokes and a higher microcurrent intensity level. If your goal is for lymph drainage, the brand recommends using light pressure and moving toward the lymph nodes. However - it's not recommended for us on the neck or thyroid glands. The brand suggests using the tool five times per week for the first six weeks, and then you can drop down to two to three times per week. It can be used on the stomach, butt, thighs, arms, and legs, or other external surfaces below the neck and chest. I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I prefer to use it after working out to help massage my legs and arms. I typically do a 10-minute session before I get in the shower at the end of the night, or immediately after a workout. What to Consider Before Trying the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set One thing to note about this product is although it's currently only available as a set, you will be able to purchase the Transdermal Magnesium Spray and Sculpting Activator Gel separately if you need refills. One other thing to note is that while this product is easy to use on yourself - it feels even better if you can get someone else to do it for you. On that note - I'm looking for a boyfriend. Any takers? Where the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set Is Available The Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set is available directly on a brand's website.

    "description": "Some stories are hard to explain, but allow us to tell you about the mysterious case of Jamie Foxx's head tattoo. Heavily inked celebrities such as Travis Barker and Machine Gun Kelly have essentially become synonymous with their extensive body artwork. On the other hand, there are public figures who garner just as much buzz due to the mysterious nature of their ink collection - or the lack thereof. Take Foxx, for instance. The beloved actor, comedian, and singer, who is slowly making his way back into the spotlight after a medical scare in April 2023, has one known tattoo. For years, he's been sporting a widely known head tattoo that features a tribal design wrapping around the back of his head from ear to ear. The multi-hyphenate got the ink in 2007 to commemorate his 40th birthday and has been pictured rocking it on multiple occasions over the years. That is, up until recently. Then, in a public outing, Foxx's head tattoo wasn't visible, leading fans to do a double take and some to even jump on board a wild conspiracy theory that the \"Ray\" actor had been cloned (yep, really). If you're just as stumped by these seemingly hyperbolic suppositions regarding Foxx's now-mysterious head tattoo, or have found yourself Googling, \"Jamie Foxx tattoos\" in order to attempt to to solve the mystery, you're not alone. Allow us to connect the dots for you. The speculations began swirling on the internet when the Oscar-winning actor was spotted on a September outing to McDonald's in Los Angeles, where an onlooker in the food joint filmed Foxx from behind. In the video, the actor is seen exchanging pleasantries with the cashier. However, his years-old head tattoo is notably absent.",
