    "description": "There are a couple of things we know for certain about Harry Styles's tattoos: he has a lot of them (probably more than we know about) and he rarely opens up about what each design means to him. The \"Don't Worry Darling\" actor, \"Harry's House\" singer, and beauty brand owner got his very first ink - a tiny star etched on his left bicep - in 2012 on his 18th birthday. And things have only snowballed from there. Styles doesn't speak about his body art often, yet he keeps doodling all over himself. He's acquired some of the tattoos on a whim (like \"big\" on his big toe), while others carry more sentimental value, like the designs that honor loved ones. For example, he has a tattoo on his thigh that says \"Olivia,\" presumably for his ex-girlfriend, Olivia Wilde. Fans first spotted the ink in July 2023 while the singer was boating in Bolsena, Italy. Some of the designs have even been done by Styles himself. Recently, we learned that one of his tattoos might feature some incorrect lyrics, but you'll have to keep scrolling to learn all of the details. How Many Tattoos Does Harry Styles Have? While the exact number of tattoos etched on Styles's body is unconfirmed, we can say for sure he has somewhere north of 60+ tattoos . . . so far. Who knows what - or how many more - he'll get in the future? As for what we do know, we're sharing the information we've collected on Styles's tattoos ahead. And for the rest of them, we'll just have to admire them and their mystery the same way we admire the rest of Harry: from afar. Disclaimer: while we did our best to be comprehensive, don't be mad if we missed one or three - like we said, we're sure he has many more where these came from.",

    "description": "Resetting in the new year isn't just limited to committing to health and wellness goals (though those can be important, too). Take the fresh start as an opportunity to kick-start some new beauty habits you can incorporate into your daily or weekly routines. Whether it's going a day - or even a week - without makeup, decluttering your beauty cabinet, or experimenting with new products and trends, we've got you covered. Over the years, the PS Beauty team has tested practically every makeup trend under the sun, whether it's a seemingly silly technique going viral on TikTok or a celebrity-loved treatment that everyone is curious about. While some were sufficient as one-time experiments, others quickly became signature staples in our editors' beauty regimens. Buzzy TikTok trends like the no-powder concealer hack or the upside-down hair-washing trick may have sounded gimmicky at first, but they turned out to be game changers for editors. Of the many tips and tricks tested by PS Beauty staffers and contributors, we've gathered 10 experiments in particular that are worth your time, especially as you think about changing up your makeup, hair, skin care, and nails in 2025. From simple makeup hacks that can create a \"false-lash effect\" or the illusion of fuller lips to a chic manicure and a \"no-filler\" filler, this list is editor-approved. Give your beauty routine a much-needed revamp and try the below trends out for yourself. Related: A Celebrity Aesthetician Shares the Best Skin-Care Routine For Your Skin Type",

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring CapsuleDesigned with transitional dressing and warmer days in mind, H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring Capsule collection features tailored wardrobe essentials with flowing fabrics and voluminous silhouettes — think a long collarless coat, an oversized leather jacket, a sleek black trench made with a windbreaker-type fabric, a wrap-around miniskirt and more. Pieces are available in a black and midnight blue color palette, while a yellow and purple crocus — one of the first blooms of spring — print is also available on a pair of leggings and handkerchief-hem maxi dress. Shop at hm.com on January 30Marine Serre x RepettoBalletcore is lingering for a little bit longer, thanks to the  Marine Serre x Repetto collaboration. The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition. Leaning into Y2K nostalgia in all the right ways (Paris and Britney were both OG fans), the assortment includes the iconic bright monogrammed Speedy Bandoulière 25 bag, slingback mules, patterned silk scarves, and even a skateboard complete with the Superflat Panda — because why not? Shop at Louis Vuitton nowLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy Bandoulière 25, $, available at Louis VuittonConverse Valentine’s Day Collection + Alex Cosani CampaignConverse is celebrating the season of love with Alex Consani. The model stars in the footwear brand’s Valentine’s Day campaign, called “Love Me, Love Me Not,” highlighting the edgy and feminine sides of self-love. It introduces its themed collection, which includes a pair of Chuck 70 high-tops covered in rosettes, black leather Chuck 70 De Luxe platform heels with a heart-studded strap, pink low-tops, patent leather Mary Janes, rose-adorned apparel, and more.  Shop now at converse.com Converse Chuck 70 Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseConverse Chuck 70 De Luxe Heel Platform Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseJ.Crew Teams Up With AraksBefore launching her luxury intimates line Araks, Araks Yeramyan was a member of J.Crew’s design team. Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in. They carry a quiet confidence, the kind of ease that makes them as much a gift to yourself as anyone else.” Shop now at J.Crew Araks x J.Crew Midi Slip Dress, $, available at J.CrewAraks x J.Crew Beatrice Bralette, $, available at J.CrewPHLUR Golden Rule EDPPHLUR, the brand behind the viral Missing Person fragrance, is back with a new hypnotic scent. Enter: Golden Rule. Encased in a shimmering gold bottle, the brand describes the eau de parfum as “sensual,” combining notes of juicy mandarin and pink pepper with smooth coconut milk, vanilla cream, and orange flower. Warm and feminine, the fragrance is perfect for imbuing a sprinkle of summer into cold winter nights.Shop now at PhlurPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at PhlurRixo x Stripe \u0026 StareRixo is known for its playful prints and feminine silhouettes; Stripe \u0026 Stare is recognized for its ultra-comfortable and consciously-made underwear. The only question we have is: How has it taken this long for the two London-based brands to join forces? The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them. Pieces are available in US sizes 2 to 22, and made with 95-percent biodegradable fabric.  Shop at Rixo and Stripe \u0026 Stare on January 16 Fenty Skin Cherry Dub CleanserWhile we start yet another year screaming “Where is the album?!” to the sky, Rihanna remains booked and busy, launching a new lightweight gel cleanser. The product is all about harnessing the Barbados cherry, which is rich in vitamin C. Here the brightening ingredient is combined with niacinamide to improve skin texture and aloe juice for soothing inflammation. Shop now at Fenty BeautyFenty Beauty Cherry Dub Pore Purify'r Gel Cleanser, $, available at Fenty BeautyLoewe x OnSwiss running shoe brand On is one of the fastest growing brands on the market, working with megawatt talent like Zendaya and collaborating with buzzy designers like Jonathan Anderson through Loewe.

Sitting firmly in the elevated loungewear category, the drop features long-sleeve stretch tees adorned with detachable white feather cuffs, ribbed cotton capri leggings, comfy sweatshirts, short-sleeve T-shirts, and wide-leg joggers alongside a host of more “classic” Sleeper styles, including pink asymmetric dresses and lavender gingham pajamas. Shop now at SleeperSleeper Long Sleeve Stretch-Cotton Jersey T-Shirt with Detachab, $, available at SleeperSol de Janeiro Beija Flor Elasti-Body OilEver since Jodie Turner-Smith preached the benefits of body oil in her epic shower routine, we’ve been on the hunt for a new one to try. Brazilian Bum Bum Cream creators Sol de Janeiro are stepping up to the plate this month with the launch of a lightweight body oil scented with pink dragon fruit and hibiscus. Cacay oil is said to boost collagen and elastin production, while squalane plumps and amaranthus flower seed extract moisturize deeply. Be sure to apply to damp skin for maximum hydration.Shop now at SephoraSol de Janeiro Beija Flor Body Oil, $, available at SephoraLevi's x UNDERCOVERIn honor of its 35th anniversary, Japanese luxury streetwear brand Undercover has once again teamed up with Levi’s. The second collaboration between the two brands fuses their rich heritages. The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather. Not only is the show coming back to Netflix for a second season (with Peter Kavinsky in tow), it’s also teaming up with Korean beauty brand Good Light to launch a limited-edition lip bundle. The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide. There’s even a collectable keychain included in the backpack-inspired packaging.Shop from 16th January at ULTA Beauty.Like what you see?

Becca Cosmetics’ Champagne Pop Shimmering Skin Perfector (IYKYK) had me in a chokehold between the years of 2014-2016, until one day…it didn’t. Slowly but surely, I asked myself if highlighter was, in fact, dead. (On one hand, if you have to ask…) But the thing is, even if highlighter had fallen out of favor, glowy skin had not — that much was certain. “The strobing and highlighter craze perfectly aligned with the early years of beauty on social media, offering a bold, hyper-glowy complexion,” makeup artist and Sephora Beauty Director David Razzano tells Refinery29. “In truth, most people couldn’t translate these harsh strobed effects into daily life – it looked too intense.” (He’s not wrong, but also I think that may have been the point.) “I think that highlighting has quieted down a bit on social because skincare has taken a front seat,” says MAC Cosmetics Senior Artist Michelle Clark. “It’s more about skin artistry now and seeing your natural skin shine through.” So, just as skincare has become so deeply ingrained into beauty routines and social media discourse, it seems that the consensus is Why fake glowy skin when you can have the real thing? “People will always use highlighter, but now it’s less about on top of the makeup and more about creating well-hydrated, dewy skin that radiates through,” Clark adds. DashDividers_1_500x100 So, what exactly does “highlighter 2.0” look like? “In my opinion, the key to modern highlighting is to ensure that the result resembles natural, glowy skin,” says Razzano. “You want your skin to take center stage, not the makeup.” (Preach!) In lieu of see-it-from-space pops of dazzling shimmer, the 2025 interpretation of a highlighted complexion calls for naturally glowy skin that looks lit from within. “Using the correct formulas and techniques for your skin type will allow you to create a natural-looking finish,” Razzano says. “My favorite way to highlight the skin now is by focusing on skin prep to create a glowy complexion,” explains Clark, who also recommends massaging the face during this step to boost circulation and revive your complexion before a drop of makeup hits your face. “When it comes to modern highlighting, I like to use serums, oils or cream products under and over complexion products to create a seamless highlight,” she says. DashDividers_1_500x100 What products work best for a modern highlight? According to Razzano, the most important thing to keep in mind when highlighting is actually your skin type — and here’s why: “This is often overlooked by many, but it is the key to success: If someone has dry to normal skin, I’ll use a deeply hydrating moisturizer like Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream to prep because I want to achieve radiant skin through quality, long-lasting hydration, followed by Saie Glowy Super Gel all over the face to give a beautiful glow and radiance.” For the combination or oily girlies, Razzano suggests a “strategic” approach to highlighting. “This skin type will get a natural glow from oil production, so targeting specific areas is better here, since ‘all over glow’ would likely end up with an excessively shiny T-zone,” he explains. “I would likely use a lightweight moisturizer like Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice to prep the skin with hydration that won’t add additional oil or shine to the face, then create radiance on targeted areas using a soft luminizer like Milk Makeup’s Dewy Cream Highlighter Stick for a beautiful, natural look that melts into the skin.” Clark also leans heavily into skin prep, adding a mist to both prep and set skin. “I never start makeup with dry skin — I use MAC Fix + Magic Radiance to mist the skin with a nourishing dose of Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid,” says Clark. “With it still damp, I will go in with few pumps of MAC Hyper Real Serumizer. These steps work together to create a smooth, glowy canvas for foundation and concealer.” With a dewy base, Clark then recommends “MAC’s glow duo” (the brand’s Studio Radiance Foundation and Studio Radiance Luminous Lift Concealer) to create highlighted skin using not highlighter, but strategically placed foundation and concealer. “I start with a single pump of foundation and create a veil of coverage all over the skin, then I go in specific areas — like the under eyes, around the nose and chin — to give a bit more coverage and luminosity.” Last step? “The final piece to a modern highlighted complexion is to take a pump of Serumizer and tap it on top of the cheekbones, bridge of the nose and cupid’s bow.” And voilà, naturally luminous skin that doesn’t look like a full face of glam — because as it turns out, the best highlighter is the one you don’t even see.
