    "title": "Achieve Hydrated, Defined Curls: 7 Proven Tips From Mielle’s Monique Rodriguez",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-hair-tips-mielle-organics?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As someone with thick, dry, and coarse 3C curls, I can confidently say that the right products (and even advice) are hard to come by — and it’s because most of them just aren’t made with our unique hair types and textures in mind. And as a beauty editor who has tried almost everything at this point, from the most expensive salon brands to the affordable drugstore ones, I’ve learned that the $$$ ones don’t always mean they’re the most effective. That’s why it was a breath of fresh air to attend a Mielle Organics panel with the brand’s founder Monique Rodriguez (whose curls are the stuff of legends, by the way) at Beautycon in Los Angeles on November 2. For the uninitiated, Mielle is at the forefront of natural hair care, creating products for textured strands that are affordable *and* incredibly effective. During the panel, Rodriguez shared her entrepreneurial wisdom with the masses (she’s a big advocate for setting boundaries and making the word “no” a complete sentence), along with key tips and holy grail products that saved her curls when starting her natural hair journey. Keep reading for all of Rodriguez’s wisdom. Now, long-term hydration and defined, healthy curls no longer feels like a pipe dream. 1. If you’ve decided to embrace your natural texture, remember to be patient “[The transition to natural hair] does not happen overnight,” said Rodriguez, who was a teenager when she first relaxed her hair and continued into her late 20s (something most Black women experience, myself included). “That’s what a lot of people get confused about. They think that using a product one time will give you instant results and that the product is just magic. You have to know that, with your transition, it could take [anywhere from] six months to a year.” 2. Go for a chop Rodriguez recommends a cut — whether that’s big or small — to help encourage the growth of healthy new strands. Rodriguez opted for a smaller, gradual chop herself and let her curls slowly grow out naturally again. 3. Know what ingredients you need for your hair type “I needed a good balance of both protein and moisture in my hair,” Rodriguez explained. “That was one of the first products that we launched when I first started Mielle: the Babassu Oil \u0026 Mint Deep Conditioner [which has both]. That was the product that actually helped restore my curls as I was going through that transition. I recommend that product if you’re going through a transition because it will really strengthen your hair and help your curls form.”  The Babassu Oil \u0026 Mint Conditioner contains high concentrations of vitamins, amino acids, oils, and fatty acids, which hydrate and deeply replenish the hair. It’s great for starting you natural hair journey, but it also works wonders for heat damaged hair or dry, coarser hair types to restore moisture. 4. Regularly deep condition (\u0026 trim), especially if you want to dye your curls Rodriguez’s hairstylist was initially hesitant to color her hair (a gorgeous blonde shade, might I add) because it can alter your curl pattern. But Rodriguez wasn’t worried — she knew her hair was strong enough to handle it. “Deep conditioning is extremely important,” she said of her hair routine. “Now that I have the color, I make sure I’m using the Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner and alternating that with the Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque. [I also] trim my ends every six to eight weeks, which I don’t like, but I know it’s an important part of keeping your hair healthy, especially when you have some type of chemical component added to your hair.” 5. Apply your products when your hair is soaking wet When it comes to keeping your curls fresh, hydrated, and defined between wash days, Rodriguez has it down to a science. “I think this is something a lot of curly girls struggle with,” she said. “The secret is, you have to apply your products when your hair is soaking wet. When you do this, it’s sealing the moisture into your hair. My wash-and-go routine consists of the Pomegranate \u0026 Honey Detangling Conditioner and then I use the Pomegranate \u0026 Honey Mousse and the Pomegranate \u0026 Honey Custard. You apply these while [your hair is] wet and then you can diffuse your hair which locks in the moisture. I truly don’t have to do anything else to my hair until I rewash it.” 6. Invest in scalp care Rodriguez swears by the brand’s cult-loved Rosemary Mint Oil, which she uses every other day, to keep her curls strong, despite being color-treated. Another non-negotiable product? The Rosemary Mint Clarifying Sugar Scrub that she’ll use once a week to gently remove product buildup and excess oil. Both contain nutrient-rich and strengthening ingredients like rosemary and biotin, and together, they work to prevent breakage and smooth split ends. 7. Sleep with a bonnet Rodriguez says it’s always a good idea to sleep with a bonnet or to do the “pineapple method” with your curls at night. She also stresses that if you’re using great products (like Mielle!), you actually won’t have to do much to your hair between washes. We love to hear it. Like what you see?

    "title": "This Viral \"Melting\" Sheet Mask Gave Me Glass Skin Instantly",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/peach-lily-glass-skin-collagen-mask-review-49410764",
    "description": "I'll be totally honest with you: I didn't join the \"glass skin\" movement (or even know what it entailed, for that matter) until recently. As a beauty writer, I approach any trend or seemingly elusive marketing term with a healthy dose of skepticism. But I can say with total confidence that Peach \u0026 Lily really delivers on its \"glass skin\" promises. The brand's founder, Alicia Yoon, coined the term and started the trend with a hero serum of the same name - the Glass Skin Refining Serum ($39) - that truly gives you the glossiest glow. I can attest firsthand to its radiance-boosting power because I use it daily. I've never gotten more compliments on my skin, and it's all due to powerhouse ingredients that calm redness, brighten, clarify, and smooth. The best part? Yoon recently took the brand's legendary serum and turned it into a sheet mask. Whether you're a religious user of the Refining Serum or are new to the brand, trust me, this is one you don't want to skip. Peach \u0026 Lily's Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask ($8) contains hero Korean ingredients that provide satisfying and instant results we're all looking for. As Yoon explains, one mask is the equivalent of a 40-gram bottle of serum, so you know you're getting your money's worth. It should come as no surprise, then, that the mask sold out almost instantly when it launched. Happily, it's back in stock (run, don't walk), and I was able to take it for a test run. If you want to learn more about this new miracle-in-a-pouch, keep reading. I'm sharing everything you need to know ahead. About the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask The mask includes two percent ginseng extract (a very high concentration not normally found in skin care), which is packed with antioxidants to brighten and firm the skin. It also has a vegan collagen peptide complex (including copper tripeptide), which firms, plumps, and gives skin a glow. Niacinamide refines skin texture and boosts radiance, while a hyaluronic acid complex locks in moisture while plumping and hydrating the skin. Cica is responsible for calming and soothing red or barrier-impaired skin. The mask can be left on for 30 minutes to overnight. What I Like About the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask I'd recently gotten my hands on Peach \u0026 Lily's Glass Skin Refining Serum and completely fell in love. You can then imagine my excitement when the brand released this mask, promising similarly amazing results. First, some background on my skin. I have sensitive, barrier-impaired, acne-prone skin that also gets dehydrated, especially during drier months here in Los Angeles. Point being, finding the right products isn't always easy. I've loved every single Peach \u0026 Lily product I've tried because they never break me out and provide my skin with the long-lasting hydration it needs. This mask is easily one of my new favorites from the brand because it's so gentle. Usually, when I wake up in the morning, my skin is more easily irritated and a bit dehydrated, so I use this mask to bring much-needed life back to my complexion. I like to use this mask at least once a week, but lately, I've been hoarding the few that I have because I'm worried it will sell out again. $8 might seem a bit pricey for one mask, but trust me, it makes a visible difference after just one use, so I definitely think it's worth it. If you're like me and struggle with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation leftover from breakouts, this mask can also help in that department. Niacinamide is a powerhouse ingredient that I use in my daily routine to help lighten dark spots; this mask contains a two percent concentration of the brightening ingredient. Personally, I pair this weekly mask with the brand's Glass Skin Refining Serum and the results really speak for themselves. They both work great individually, but together, you'll get a massive hydration and radiance boost. The two are now nonnegotiables in my routine, and I'll for sure be stocking up on both. How to Use the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask The brand recommends cleansing and applying any toners or essences you may have before putting on the mask. It comes in two layers - one for the top half of your face and one for the bottom. (I found that the bottom half tended to slide around a bit, but it still got the job done.) Per the directions, you can leave the mask on for 30 minutes if you need a quick fix, three hours (or until it turns clear instead of white), or even overnight. Yoon told me to leave it on for at least an hour if you really want to maximize the effects. I've found that leaving the mask on for about an hour and a half gives my skin that lit-from-within glow. My skin is prone to breakouts, but this didn't cause any, and it even helped calm my skin and tamp down redness thanks to the cica and niacinamide in the formula. What to Consider Before Trying the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask Niacinamide can potentially cause irritation for some people in higher concentrations, but because there's only two percent in this mask, that shouldn't be an issue. (Again, my skin is super sensitive and I've never had a problem.) If you're concerned, you could try doing a patch test with the serum on a small area before applying the mask to your entire face, given that the ingredients are very similar. But as someone with super sensitive, acne-prone skin, I can tell you that this mask didn't cause any issues - it only helped make my complexion look better than ever. Where Is the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask Available? The Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask is available at Ulta Beauty and the brand's website.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jennifer-lopez-crystal-nails-49410852",
    "description": "If you've ever had a reflective manicure à la chrome nails and you thought you were the epitome of bright and shiny - trust us when we say what you had going on was nothing compared to Jennifer Lopez's latest set. The star recently sported a manicure that makes us want to start a petition to have her change her name from J. Lo to \"J. Glow,\" because saying they \"shine bright like a diamond\" is an understatement. The star recently performed at the Elie Saab show in Saudi Arabia wearing a turquoise feathered sequined number, which was polished off with one of the most perfect manicures we've ever seen. The look, which was done by celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik, features over 250 crystals. Bachik is responsible for some of our favorite celebrity manicures ever, and he frequently works with stars like Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez. In fact, he worked on a similar look for Lopez's Super Bowl nails, but this recent iteration might be even better. \"The nails had between 25 to 50 crystals per nail,\" Bachik tells PS. \"I actually removed crystals from the sides to keep nails slender and to make key crystal placements the focus and more impactful.\" Keep scrolling to take a closer look at the manicure and to get the full breakdown of how Bachik created the set. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙠 Nails (@tombachik) Bachik shared in an Instagram post that he started by prepping the nails using the Tweezerman x Tom Bachik Tools ($59). From there, he applied the Aprés Gel-X Sculpted Coffin Tips ($17) in clear. Next, he used the Kokoist Platinum Filler Base ($25), which he followed with the Mia Secret Chrome Silver Gel Paint ($9). Bachik used a chrome powder that isn't available for purchase yet, and then covered the nails with Swarovski crystals. To top everything off, he added Mia Secret Metallic Flakes ($10).
