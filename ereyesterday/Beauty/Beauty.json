    "description": "I’m on a never-ending quest for shiny, healthy-looking hair. I’ll try any product or TikTok trend that promises to impart a light-catching lustre, from shampoos infused with gloss-giving glycolic acid to hair oiling, an ancient South Asian beauty ritual. So when Fable \u0026 Mane’s Shine Hair Mask, $36, made its way to my desk, I was more than a little intrigued. Unlike other hair masks, where the star ingredients are mostly glycerin and a handful of oils, this one features a blend of black tea ferments (more on this special addition later) and moisture-boosting enzymes. The new, intensive treatment claims to inject luminosity and bounce into the hair. My ends have been extra dull and tangled lately due to the changing weather, not to mention excessive styling. Needless to say, I was ready to get my hair wet. After a few weeks of incorporating the hair mask into my shower routine, I’m now ready to spill the tea — pun intended. Keep reading to discover my honest take on how this hair mask truly lives up to its glossy promises. DashDividers_1_500x100 Fable \u0026 Mane Shine Hair Mask, $36 Before I dive into what makes this mask so effective, I have to compliment the scent; it won me over at first sniff. True to its star ingredient — fermented black tea extract — the product boasts a comforting chai aroma. I absolutely adore a warming cup of masala chai at any hour of the day, so this scent is right up my street. Most hair masks I’ve tried are either runnier in texture or are more similar to a thick salve. This mask sits somewhere in between, reminding me of a lightweight body lotion. Thanks to the airy texture, it was very easy to pull this through my thick, long hair with my fingers. What really clinched the deal was how the hair mask added an immediately noticeable gloss to my hair, which lasted for days on end. Let’s dive into the science of it all. DashDividers_1_500x100 What is the benefit of black tea ferments on hair? The main reason my hair started looking instantly shinier is thanks to black tea ferments, an antioxidant that improves scalp health. I asked celebrated hairstylist Tom Smith to give me a deep dive on the benefits. “Black tea ferments are rich in antioxidants like catechins and theaflavins, which can help protect the scalp and the hair strands themselves from pollution and UV exposure,” says Smith, both of which can dull the hair and contribute to color fading. As a result, antioxidants are a popular choice in hair products, he adds. According to Eva Proudman, a consultant trichologist at UK Hair Consultants, these antioxidants have a positive impact on scalp health by improving circulation, encouraging hair growth and reducing overall shedding, giving it a shinier, healthier look in the process. “The hair becomes shiny as the antioxidants stop the hair from becoming dry and dehydrated, which causes dullness and dryness,” she adds. Clinical trial findings from Fable \u0026 Mane also support this, with 89 to 95% of respondents agreeing that the mask makes their hair look and feel shinier and silkier just after one use. DashDividers_1_500x100 What are AHAs and what are their benefits for hair? The mask also boasts AHAs, or alpha hydroxy acids, which are found in natural sources such as sugar cane, fruits, and, in the case of this mask, hibiscus flowers. They are a popular exfoliant that removes dead skin cells and product build-up from the scalp, which can otherwise make hair look dull, says Proudman. AHAs also boost shine without stripping hair or making it feel uncomfortably squeaky and dry. But that’s not all: “They can also help to remove mineral deposits from the hair caused by using hard water, promoting a cleaner environment to improve hair texture and shine overall,” adds Proudman. DashDividers_1_500x100 What are enzymes and what are their benefits on the hair? Finally, enzymes complete the nourishing formula. According to Akash Meta, co-founder and CEO of Fable \u0026 Mane, the enzymes in this hair mask were created through a fermentation process that breaks down sugar into smaller compounds, making it easier to penetrate the hair cuticle for intense hydration. These are naturally derived ingredients that can enhance hydration and maintain the strong bonds in the hair to prevent damage. Smith is equally impressed by enzymes in hair care: “Enzymes are great for deep cleaning the scalp; they combat the overuse of styling products when the hair has not been washed for a few days,” he says. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is the Fable \u0026 Mane Shine Hair Mask any good? While my hair wasn’t overly damaged to begin with, I didn’t realize how much I needed this mask until I used it for the first time. It genuinely took my hair’s shine to the next level. So much so, I’m convinced that you’d be able to see my hair reflect light from a mile away. The “after” photo below was taken more than two days after I used this hair mask, and the mirror-like shine was still going strong. The fuss-free application is icing on the cake. It’s usually recommended to slather a mask treatment on towel-dried hair for around 10 minutes, but Fable \u0026 Mane says it’s only necessary to squeeze out excess water before application, and you can rinse it all off after three minutes. (You can use this after shampooing, in place of a conditioner.) As a lazy person, I can vouch for how this streamlined routine has made my life infinitely easier since I don’t have to climb in and out of the shower to dry my ends and kill time before I can wash it off. For that reason, I’ve used this hair mask a lot more compared to the other, more cumbersome ones in my collection The hair mask is arguably the star product in Fable \u0026 Mane’s burgeoning hair collection, but I also wholeheartedly recommend the Volumizing Shampoo, $30, which makes my hair look fuller with strand-plumping fenugreek extract. As a relaxing bedtime ritual, I’ve also been using the HoliRoots Hair Oil, $56, from roots to ends; it’s infused with ashwagandha, a type of herb often used to promote hair growth. To keep my goals of having a big, enviable head of hair alive, I’ll be incorporating all three of these products into my haircare routine for the summer and beyond.

    "description": "The best thing about this year’s biggest nail trends is that there really is a look for everyone. With pistachio green manicures, and jewelry nails for the maximalists, glossy soap nails, and elevated French manicures for those who prefer a quieter manicure, there’s no shortage of nail inspiration. Just when we thought there was no more space for another minimalist manicure to capture our attention, the “no-makeup makeup” nail trend has emerged as the freshest look for spring and summer. Pared-back and beautifully simple, it’s effectively the equivalent of a tinted moisturizer for your nails; it adds polish and glow while letting your natural nail shine through. But what sets it apart from the other subtle manicures dominating this spring?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cerise 🍒 (@glossytipped) What is the “no-makeup makeup” manicure? Also known as a “naked” or barely-there manicure, the “no-makeup makeup” manicure is all about enhancing your natural nails rather than covering them up. “Sheer, clean nails exude low-maintenance and effortless sophistication,” says manicurist and Bio Sculpture nail technician Julia Diogo. “This barely-there manicure really does deliver ‘your-nails-but-better’, and with the right shade and topcoat, not only is your natural nail plate enhanced, but so is your skin tone.” The key to the look is opting for sheer, neutral tones with a shiny finish. You’re aiming for a “clean”, healthy, well-groomed look that’s so versatile.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Georgia Rae (@raelondonnails) How do you create the no-makeup makeup manicure? The secret to the no-makeup makeup manicure is that while it looks simple, it relies on careful prep and precision: “Cuticle work and shaping are essential in my prep to create this manicure,” says Diogo. “We want to avoid over-trimming the cuticles, so lightly buff to enhance the nail plates’ natural shine and cleanse your hands and nails beforehand to ensure the polish adheres as evenly as possible.” @the_gelbottle_inc Create ‘No-Makeup Makeup’ nails with @Amber using Blanc, Daisy and Kiss BIAB™ 🎀💅 This trend is all about your nails, but better—perfect for fans of the clean girl aesthetic 🫧 #tgb #thegelbottle #thegelbottleinc #cleangirl #nomakeup #nomakeupmakeup ♬ Spring Is Coming – Morunas Diogo points out that you want this manicure to be applied thinly; no bulky textures, just a couple of fine coats of polish for that natural look. As for colors? Sheer creams, translucent pinks, and soft nudes are what you want to look for, rather than anything too milky or opaque. “I’d also finish the nail into soft, short square or almond with a shiner tool and use a glossy topcoat to execute as cleanly as possible,” says Diogo. Want to achieve the look yourself? Here are some of our favorite “no-makeup makeup” manicures to inspire your next nail look. Your Nails But Better View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@irams.jpeg) Chic, simple, and executed perfectly, celebrity nail artist Iram Shelton created this elevated manicure using a combination of OPI Bare My Soul, $11.45, and OPI Put It In Neutral, $11.99. We’ll be rushing to recreate it at home.  Soft Oval View this post on Instagram A post shared by LHB Nails (@lhb_nails) This elongated oval nail is the ideal shape to complement this barely-there look created by manicurist LHB Nails. Micro Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mateja Novakovic (@matejanova) Content creator Mateja Novakovic is the queen of the minimalist manicure, and this iteration is so chic. Opt for a pink-toned polish like Chanel Le Vernis Nail Color in 111 Ballerina, $33, to achieve a similar sheer look. High Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) Nailing the fresh manicure, the incredible Julia Diogo (aka @paintedbyjools) used just one product to create this no-makeup makeup manicure — Essie’s To The Rescue UV Damage Repair Nail Treatment, $12.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/caveman-regimen-skin-care-49092385",
    "description": "These days, we find ourselves using the TikTok search bar more than we hit up Google. The app is a treasure trove of information, especially when it comes to beauty tips and tricks. Whether users on the app are encouraging people to apply hemorrhoid cream to undereye bags or use calamine lotion as a makeup primer, the hacks are endless, but it can be tough sifting through what's actually good advice, and what's just being posted for clicks. In 2024, a skin-care routine (or, rather, an anti skin-care routine) called the \"caveman regimen\" started gaining popularity, with plenty of users on the app claiming it's worked wonders for their complexions - and plenty of others saying it did absolutely nothing. The trend is having a resurgence in 2025, thanks to TikTok influencer Tia Zakher, who has been testing out the caveman method and documenting it on her page. Of course, we're here to set the record straight, so we tapped Karan Lal, DO, a double board-certified pediatric and cosmetic dermatologist, to answer all of our burning questions about the caveman regimen, like what it is, whether or not it's safe, and if it actually works. Experts Featured in This Article Karan Lal, DO, is a double board-certified pediatric and cosmetic dermatologist. What Is the Caveman Regimen? Put simply, the caveman regimen, also called the caveman method, is the practice of doing nothing to your skin. Sometimes referred to as the paleo diet of skin care, it involves cutting everything out entirely: no skin-care products, no makeup, no washing your face, etc. \"It's the regimen without a regimen,\" Dr. Lal says. \"You basically stop everything you are using in hopes it resets your skin.\" The trend, which has been around for years, has recently been gaining popularity on social media, with many people trying it out for themselves for long stretches of time. However, the results are mixed. One TikTok user, Nikki Chan, detailed her experience using the caveman regimen over a period of 30 days, and her results were less than stellar, while others have claimed that the caveman regimen is the only skin-care routine that's ever worked for them. What Are the Benefits of the Caveman Regimen? Implementing the caveman regimen can be a great way to help reset your skin if you've been dealing with sensitivity. \"It's good for people who have an allergic skin disease, untreatable facial rashes, and for those with eczema,\" Dr. Lal says. Plus, he adds, \"It's a great way to find out what could be instigating a facial rash, and it simplifies things for people who don't want to do much. It basically acts as an elimination diet for your skin.\" There could be specific ingredients in your skin-care products or makeup that are having adverse effects on your skin, and forgoing everything should give you a chance to reset. However, for some, that isn't always the case, and testing out this regimen could have the opposite effect. How Do You Do the Caveman Regimen? If it sounds like something you'd be interested in, testing out the caveman regimen is simple - all you have to do is forego putting any products on your face whatsoever. (If you do this, though, Dr. Lal recommends continuing to use SPF, no matter what.) As for how long you should do it, the caveman regimen can be customized based on your specific needs, but typically it's done for a stretch of time anywhere from seven to 30 days. Ultimately, it depends on your reasoning for testing it out. For example, if you're experiencing a facial rash and you're not sure what's causing it, you might opt to cut out skin-care products for a week before slowly reintroducing everything. \"There's no definite timeframe, however, it's usually until your skin improves from its previous state,\" Dr. Lal says. What Are the Risks of the Caveman Regimen? @uglyducklingskincare Replying to @Hot Mess 💋 Would you ever try the caveman routine…and the biggest reason I regret it at the end. It’s basically cutting out all your skincare, even cleanser. I know the #cavemanroutine works for some people, but I’ve come to the realization that my skin NEEDS skincare. It’s all about balance! Have you tried this, would you? #acnemarks #hyperpigmentation #cavemanskincareroutine ♬ Soul Bossa Nova - Quincy Jones While Dr. Lal says the caveman regimen is technically safe for all skin types, there are a few risks involved. The biggest is the lack of sun protection. \"Sunscreen actively decreases the risk of skin cancer development. If anything, please use SPF,\" Dr. Lal says. If you do decide to test out the regimen but continue using SPF, there aren't a ton of downsides to be weary of; however, you should note that the results might not be what you expect. Chan said that during her 30-day trial of the regimen, she experienced dark circles, whiteheads, congested pores, rough texture, and cystic acne. If you're someone with sensitive skin looking for a simple skin-care routine that won't break you out or cause a reaction, Dr. Lal suggests using a gentle cleanser like the PCA Skin Creamy Cleanser ($40), paired with a moisturizer like the Clinical Skin Multi-Lipid Replenishing Moisturizer ($110), and to always end with an SPF.

    "description": "Viral skin-care hacks and products are so plentiful that it's almost impossible to discern which ones are actually worth your time, energy, and money (thank you, TikTok). However, occasionally, a product breaks through the noise and actually lives up to the hype. Case in point: the viral Qure Micro Infusion System ($119), which yields glowy, even-toned skin and supercharges your entire skin-care routine. Plus, you can opt for multiple supply options: a Qure Micro Infusion System 3 Month Supply ($149, originally $357) and a Qure Micro Infusion System 6 Month Supply ($249, originally $714) which are both 60 percent off. Celebrity aesthetician Shani Darden swears by Qure's Micro-Infusion System so much that it has become a staple in her personal routine. It's also endorsed by top dermatologists Dr. Dendy Engelman and Dr. Muneeb Shah. As a beauty editor who tries products and treatments for a living, I'm sometimes cautious about at-home treatments that mimic in-office procedures. But since this one has earned the seal of approval from numerous pros, I was game to test it out. Before I get into the specifics of Qure's Micro-Infusion System and what happened when I tried it, it's important to note that needles are involved in this at-home treatment. Contrary to what you may think, it's extremely different from using a derma roller or at-home microneedling, which has earned mixed reviews. While both help skin-care ingredients penetrate deeper and spur collagen production by creating little microtears in the skin, the improper use of derma rollers (rolling needles) can damage skin, while micro-infusion uses a stamping method with sterile, delicate needles. This method prevents skin damage caused by blunt needles and inadequate technique. Even if you've never used an at-home micro-infusion system, there's no need to worry about damaging your skin or doing it incorrectly. With this system, you can safely transform your complexion at home. About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Customizable to your skin needs – there's a system to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, and another one for fine lines and wrinkles. A safe, at-home microneedling-like product that \"stamps\" your skin with 24K gold 0.5mm needles that are thinner than human hair. Virtually painless and with minimal-to-no downtime. Infuses the skin with active ingredients through microchannels. Helps to boost hydration for a plump and dewy appearance. Reduces the appearance of fine lines, pores, and dark spots. What I Like About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Even though it sounds complicated, Qure's Micro-Infusion System is easy to use: The instructions are clear and the system comes with disposable microneedles to ensure your tools are new and sterile with each use. Additionally, in-office microneedling and Aquagold (an in-office micro-infusion treatment) can run you hundreds of dollars a visit, while the Qure Micro-Infusion System is cost-effective and provides comparable results. I like to use the system before bed and love that it takes less than 10 minutes - perfect for a busy schedule, especially if you can't spare the time (let alone the money) to go for an in-office treatment. How to Use the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System The system consists of four easy steps and comes with six serum concentrates and replaceable needle heads. Step one involves filling the chamber of the device (where the serum is housed) with the serum concentrate that will be micro-infused into your skin. For the second step, turn the chamber upside down for one to two minutes to allow the serum to seep into the needles. I advise washing your face at this time so that it's nice and clean. Next, remove the lid from the microneedles and begin infusing the serum into your skin with a stamping motion. Start at the center of your face and work your way around, exhibiting care to cover all areas of your face. Though it's best to start off with one pass, if you feel that your skin can handle it (and if you're gentle enough), you can pass twice over areas that you may have missed or want to treat again. If you choose to use the needles around your eyes, be extra cautious and gentle. Finally, place the lid back on the needle head, twist it off, and dispose of it. You will use a new needle head for your next treatment. If you have any leftover serum, which you probably will, gently pat it on your face and neck and allow it to absorb overnight. Follow with your favorite gentle moisturizer and then clean out the chamber and discard any remaining serum. Darden recommends stamping with 50 percent overlap to ensure that you cover every area of your face. Qure recommends harnessing the treatment every two weeks, with full results shown after three uses. However, I noticed significant results a day or two after a single treatment. As with any skin care, the more consistent you are, the more benefits you'll accrue from the system over time. What to Consider Before Trying the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System It's important to consider if you'll actually be consistent with the treatment in order to see the best results possible. Additionally, since there are needles involved (granted, they are thinner than human hair), there's an element of discomfort with the treatment: It's minimal but still present. When you first start using it, you'll feel a slight pricking feeling as the device goes into your skin. If needles on any level make you feel uncomfortable, micro-infusion may not be for you. You may also experience some slight redness afterward. Steer clear of using the system if your skin is currently irritated or sensitized, and avoid using it on active acne. You also don't want to apply chemical exfoliants or other harsh topical products immediately after using it. Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Worth the Splurge? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is absolutely worth the splurge, whether you want to maximize your existing skin-care routine or prepare for a special occasion. The results are blatant - my glow after using the treatment speaks for itself. You'll notice hydrated, radiant, and healthy-looking skin. Where Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Available? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is available at QureSkincare.com.
