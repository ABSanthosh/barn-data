    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanning-bed-addiction-skin-risks?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  “I’ll just do a few sessions on a tanning bed to build a base tan before my holiday,” I told myself earlier this year. The results weren’t instant, unlike the self-tanners I’ve used for over a decade, but after a few visits, my skin looked golden. I enjoyed the somewhat lasting glow that didn’t leave me looking like a slice of Dutch crunch bread after four days. I planned to stop going to the tanning salon once I returned home, but the allure of tanned skin was hard to resist. What started as building a vacation base tan — which dermatologists argue is actually a myth — quickly turned into, “I’ll keep going so I’m tanned for my birthday,” then, “I might as well continue over summer. A few more weeks won’t hurt.” Before I knew it, I was clocking up more minutes at the tanning salon than I could count. But here’s the thing: I know the potentially life-threatening risks of using tanning beds. I know that using tanning beds increases the risk of developing skin cancer, including melanoma, and that, as reported by the Skin Cancer Foundation, more than 419,000 cases of skin cancer in the US each year are linked to indoor tanning. I’m not alone in knowing the risks. In a survey conducted by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), 20% of Gen Z adults said that getting a tan is more important to them than preventing skin cancer. But exactly why do we continue?  Tanning is addictive and there’s actually a biological explanation.Dr Clare Kiely, consultant dermatologist Why do we think a tan makes us more attractive? Dr. Ravi Gill, a practitioner psychologist at Smart Mind Health, says that beauty ideals such as ‘tanned equals attractive’ can override our instinct for self-protection: “This is due to powerful social and psychological influences,” says Dr. Gill. Adding, “From a young age, we’re exposed to messages — through media, peers and culture — that link tanned skin with attractiveness, status, and health. Over time, these ideas are internalized and tied to our self-worth and identity.” Lisa, 32, can certainly relate. She used a tanning bed for the first time at just 17 years old after a friend said it would “look good” to have tanned skin. “I was curious, so I decided to give it a try,” she tells me, adding that body insecurities are a reason she still uses them: “When I’m tanned, the spider veins and cellulite on my legs, which you don’t see much of on social media, are less visible,” she says. “That makes me feel more confident. I get compliments as well, which is motivation to continue.”  Interestingly, tanning isn’t the only example of how we’re trading safety for self-esteem. This notion can also be applied to many of our aesthetic practices, like unregulated Botox and BBLs, which have a notoriously high mortality rate in comparison to other cosmetic procedures. Shedding light on this, Dr. Gill explains that humans crave social acceptance and fear rejection, choosing to conform to beauty norms — even when they involve risks: “The desire for social belonging and approval often feels more immediate and emotionally powerful than long-term health concerns,” she says. While I think tanning makes me look better in many ways, I feel particularly conflicted about the damage it’s doing thanks to my medical history: I’ve always had a few questionable moles. The fact that I use tanning beds is something I’m quite embarrassed about. Concerningly, Lisa tells me that she fears skin aging more than skin cancer: “Ironically, I’ve curated a social media feed full of skinfluencers teaching me how to look after my skin, and I’ve honed a [multi-step] skincare routine. Yet I continue to do the one thing that will damage my skin the most — something which no amount of serum or SPF can save me from.” Lisa’s honesty, or as she puts it, “silliness”, might seem extreme to some, but it reveals a deeper truth: decades of messaging have taught us that our value lies in our appearance. Thanks to the popularity of Ozempic alongside the return of thinness on red carpets and For You Pages (which notably prompted the ‘skinnytok’ hashtag ban), being slim is back on a pedestal — and tanning plays a role here. I’ve often found myself commenting on how much ‘slimmer’ I look with a tan, and who can blame me? Shows like Love Island have helped solidify the idea that bronzed skin doesn’t just look “better” but also leaner and more sculpted — like contouring for your whole body. Is tanning bad for you? While I think tanning makes me look better in many ways, I feel particularly conflicted about the damage it’s doing thanks to my medical history. I’ve always had a few questionable moles. Some are asymmetric, others have jagged borders and a range of colors. On holiday, when my skin is exposed in a bikini, friends and family have commented on it and encouraged me to get checked out. After spending time living in Australia, where UV levels are very high, I decided to follow through on this. I wasn’t a tanning bed user at the time of my first (or second) mole check, but doctors did flag that the Sydney sunshine could have put my skin at risk. After an examination of my moles, I was advised to keep an eye on them and return if I saw any “noticeable changes”.  In the years since those checks, I’ve observed a handful of changes to some of my moles. But as someone with health anxiety, I never know if I’m being paranoid or if I really should go back to the doctor. Consequently, I’m in limbo — I don’t want to waste my doctor’s time if the changes I’ve seen aren’t “noticeable” enough, but I also don’t want to ignore the issue and end up in a potentially life-threatening situation. Taking all of this into consideration, the fact that I use tanning beds probably sounds absurd. Honestly, it’s something I’m quite embarrassed about. Why do we use tanning beds despite the risks? Dr. Gill explains that this is a case of cognitive dissonance, when a person feels psychological discomfort because their actions contradict their beliefs. “In beauty culture, this dissonance is common,” she says, pointing again to societal pressures. “For example, someone may understand the risks of tanning bed use or crash dieting but still engage in these behaviors to align with societal beauty ideals.” Dr. Gill goes on to explain that we try to resolve this internal discomfort by rationalizing our behaviors rather than changing them. Telling ourselves, “It’s just for summer” or “Everyone else is doing it” is an easy way to avoid feelings of guilt. Critics, however, often think that tanning bed users should feel guilty for this choice. But here’s the thing: “Shaming people for using tanning beds often backfires, making them more likely to continue the behavior,” says Dr. Gill. She adds, “Research shows that self-criticism reduces motivation for change, while compassionate, non-judgmental support is more effective in encouraging healthier choices.” But can anyone truly say they’ve always put their health above all else? Like tanning beds, alcohol, processed meat, and tobacco, for example, are classed as type one carcinogens — substances that can cause cancer. I’m keen to know whether those who frown on my habit often indulge in a fast food burger or unwind with a bottle of wine. We are watching the number of skin cancers scale out of control in our clinics.Dr Kiely Is tanning addictive? That’s before we bring class into the equation. Research that shows those from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to use tanning beds. Although further investigation is needed to explore why that is, a 2022 study concluded that tanning bed use has been historically framed through the media as a “working-class activity”. Of course, it’s not just about class, appearances or a taste for Sauvignon Blanc; the addictiveness of carcinogens plays a role: “Tanning is addictive and there’s actually a biological explanation,” says Dr. Clare Kiely, a consultant dermatologist and cofounder of The Skin Diary. She explains that when the body is exposed to UV radiation, it triggers a process that results in the release of endorphins, hormones that create a sense of “euphoria”. For many, the glow isn’t just about looking good — it’s about feeling good, too: “I’m normally in a better mood after a tanning bed,” confirms Ella, who agrees this “mood-boosting” effect is a big factor in why people feel addicted to tanning beds. Lisa echoes this, telling me she enjoys the light and “me-time” of being on a tanning bed: “It’s like dreaming myself away to a beach.”  Given how addictive tanning beds are, the responsibility to prevent their damage shouldn’t rest solely on users. Many experts argue that stricter regulation is the only way forward, especially as research shows we continue to tan in spite of the evidence before us. “I don’t believe the current regulations are adequate,” says Dr. Rakesh Anand, a consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson. He notes that while there are restrictions on under-18s and some standards for equipment and usage, there’s still a “significant” public health risk. “Given the well-established link between tanning bed use and skin cancer, stronger measures are urgently needed,” he adds. As for what that might look like, various skin cancer charities have called for tanning beds to have graphic warning signs similar to those found on cigarette packets, while a June 2025 study exposed “potential gaps in current regulations” when it comes to tanning salons marketing on social media.  Whether on a tanning bed in New York or a beach lounger in Mexico, dermatologists are firm in their answer that there’s no such thing as a safe tan — “Unless it’s self-tanner from a bottle,” says Dr. Kiely. She agrees with Dr. Anand that the only way to “eliminate” risk is to ban tanning beds, as they are in countries such as Australia and Brazil: “I’m coming at it as a person who has spent her career cutting out thousands of skin cancers, some of them life-threatening,” Dr. Kiely adds. “We are watching the number of skin cancers scale out of control in our clinics. We must take measures now to protect future generations.” Despite being reminded by every expert of the very real dangers before me, in the time I’ve been writing this article, I’ve racked up another 44 minutes on the tanning beds — although I have reduced the frequency of my visits. I want to stop altogether and pick up my once-beloved self-tanners that are currently collecting dust, but I’m trying to feel less guilt and shame about this habit, as I’ve unpicked how years of societal pressure led me to this point. Ultimately, that’s what needs to change. From Botox to fillers and beyond, we’ve all been sold on the ‘ideal’ appearance, which can differ depending on what we’ve been conditioned into thinking. The recent ban on disposable vapes proves that if people want to do something, they’ll find a way, so we all have to do our part in breaking the cycle when it comes to tanning. Mine is writing this article and being vulnerable about a paradox many of us feel but rarely discuss: the desire to protect our skin while craving the glow of a tan. It would also help to see celebrities and influencers embracing their natural skin tones, and for brands to do the same with the models in their campaigns. Whether it’s a school session or a poster in a tanning salon, better education could also go a long way — not just about the dangers of tanning beds, which clearly isn’t always enough, but about how to resist outside pressure. In learning how to accept ourselves as we are, we might just find the glow hits differently when it comes from within. Like what you see?

    "description": "\"'Love Island UK' Star Helena Ford Looks Dramatically Different in Old Photos.\" \"Helena Ford From 'Love Island' Looks Unrecognizable in Throwback Pictures.\" \"Unearthed Throwback Pics Show an Unrecognizable Helena Ford.\" These are just some of the headlines I've seen popping up on my social media feeds over the last few days. TLDR, if you couldn't tell, apparently old photos of \"Love Island\"'s Helena Ford have popped up online, and surprise! She looks dramatically different. And guess what else? I'm over it. Not only do I not care if 29 year-old Helena Ford looks completely different from 'unearthed' photos (this is reality television, btw, not an archeological dig), but I truly don't think it's any of my business. Why? Because what people choose to do to their bodies is up to them. Does Ford look different in the photos? Sure, her hair color is different, her face is a bit rounder, and her lips look smaller, but guess who also looks a lot freaking different than they did two years ago, five years ago, and ten years ago? Me. And honestly, probably, you, too. \"We're allowed to evolve, to make changes, to look different. We're allowed to look worse, and we're sure as hell allowed to look better.\" Yes, celebrities have been getting more open when it comes to the plastic surgery they've had done, but honestly, whether it's puberty, filler, Botox or a full blown face lift, does it really matter? We already pit women against each other, do we really need to start pitting women against their younger selves? Let's get one thing clear: faces change. It's kind of what they do. I'm 35 now, and I sure as hell do not look the same way I looked when I was 25. (Thankfully I look much, much better.) I have a fridge covered in what the internet would undoubtedly dub \"throwback photos,\" and I remember my boyfriend looking at them a year or so ago and asking me if I had had a nose job. First of all, to be clear - there's nothing I would love more than a nose job (and a breast lift, and a blepharoplasty), but second, nope, never had one. His question was also posed pre-Botox and pre my one harrowing experience with filler, so he was straight up just comparing my natural ass face to my natural ass younger face. And if Ford did get a bunch of filler, a nose job, or even a full face transplant, is it really my business? Nope. Not unless she personally calls me up and decides to tell me about it, or if she publicly decides to comment on it and bring others into the conversation. The internet is acting like Ford, and women in general, are hiding something when WE don't share personal details about the work or treatments we've had done, but let me say it again, a little louder for the people in the back: it's no one's business. How someone looked in the past isn't \"evidence\" of anything. We don't need to investigate it like it is. All this to say: let Ford live her life. We're allowed to evolve, to make changes, to look different. We're allowed to look worse, and we're sure as hell allowed to look better. It doesn't matter whether it's due to a ChatGPT outlined glow up, age, or 18 pounds of filler to the face. Maybe we should all be a little less concerned with what women are doing with their bodies, and a little more concerned with why some people feel the need to comment on it.

    "title": "I Tried Hydrotherapy For Healthier Skin - and It Worked",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hydrotherapy-editor-experiment-49226105",
    "description": "At six years old, I had my first serious eczema flare-up. I don't remember what triggered it, but I'll never forget the impulsive urge to scratch, scratch, scratch until it felt like my skin was on fire, oozing from the inside out. Night after night, I'd scream out in pain as my mom gently slipped silk pajamas over my head, careful to stretch the fabric away from the crusty pus that buzzed from itching. Eventually, a doctor prescribed a topical steroid cream to treat my atopic dermatitis, which helped, but I was told to only use it sparingly and never for longer than a week at a time so as to not build a tolerance to the treatment, leaving me hesitant over the years. Then I recently discovered an alternative solution to those hydrocortisone ointments I relied on so heavily back then: hydrotherapy centers. Also known as water therapy, these treatment facilities - of which there are thousands around the world, with offerings in varying form - use H2O as the sole ingredient to healing the skin. I was invited to try it out for myself at the Avène Hydrotherapy Center in the South of France, which is how I wound up submerged in a soaking bath, surrounded by water bubbles that flickered with promise of soothing my eczema-laden skin. Here's how my visit went. First, What is Hydrotherapy and How Does it Work? Hydrotherapy is the centuries-old practice of using water to treat a number of ailments. This can look like many different things - aquatic physical therapy to ease arthritis, cold plunges to boost circulation - but with hydrotherapy spas, it is typically used for the treatment of skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, scars or burns, and even post-cancer effects like radiodermatitis. While some dermatologists are on the fence about its efficacy as a standalone treatment plan, countless studies have shown that spring water rich in mineral content can calm inflammation and soften the skin's appearance. Still, this is not your thermal pool in Turkey, onsen bath in Japan, or hot spring in Iceland: hydrotherapy is a targeted, naturopathic alternative to traditional Western skin-care medications, although its specific method of application differs from clinic to clinic. At Avène's treatment center, for example, patients are prescribed daily water treatments over the course of three weeks, which can include anything from localized sprays, steam and air showers, and bath soaks. Its water is sourced from the thermal springs in (you guessed it) Avène, France, where its natural rock filtration system means it's loaded with calcium, zinc, copper, magnesium, and Aquaphilus Dolomiae (a microflora only found there). Similar to other hydrotherapy spas, there are experts on-site ranging from hydrotherapists to dermatologists to nurses to ensure proper administration of said techniques. My Hydrotherapy Experience These days, I'd liken my tendency for eczema flare-ups to a villain in any superhero movie: it's always there lurking in the background, ready to pounce, but is carefully managed by reducing the exposure to outside threats (in other words: avoiding fragranced products, harsh skin treatments, and hot showers). Still, rashes happen to me at the start of every new season, so I had been battling patches of eczema on my neck and left elbow by the time I got to the Avène Hydrotherapy Center. I was ready to (metaphorically and literally) dive in to the treatments, but because there is no amount of pleading that would allow me three weeks of PTO, I forged ahead with a smaller, abbreviated sampling of hydrotherapy sessions over the course of two days. First up was a bath, the idea being that a heated oxygen hydrotherapy soak helps promote circulation. The time totaled 20 minutes (which is approximately 19 minutes longer than I typically like to sit in a bath), divided into 10-minute increments: the first half with bubbles to soften the skin, followed by the high-powered jets that directly target inflamed areas. Luckily for my attention span, the water was the perfect lukewarm temperature, and the time went by quick. Next up came a domino of quick-spurt treatments. There was the facial spritz station, where you lean your head into a sink, forehead against a faucet of sorts, and the liquid mists your face at varying pressures for five minutes. (If you've ever been sick and stuck your head over a pot of boiling water to clear up your sinuses, it was kind of like that.) Then came the shower, which looked like a life-sized, standing sprinkler system that sprayed out five minutes-worth of a combination of hot water and air. I awkwardly bounced from the stepping stool to the floor, then back again, trying to find the right height that wouldn't spray me directly in the face; been there, done that five minutes ago. It never got hot, but it was humid, and I was glad it was over fast. Finally, it was time for the scalp shower - an exclusive offering you can only get at the Avène Hydrotherapy Center, and one that filled me with five minutes of unadulterated bliss. I laid down on the padded table and stuck my head into a chamber, where thermal spring water soared at my scalp in every which way like it was the Vegas Bellagio Water Show. I could have sworn I heard a choir of angels singing. This particular treatment is meant to alleviate scalp psoriasis or severe dandruff, so as a supplement to the session, a hydrotherapist then applied globs of the Avène XeraCalm ($36) to every inch of my scalp, where I was told to leave it on as a deep treatment overnight before rinsing it out. Despite the minor discomforts I felt during some of my treatments, when all was said and done, I have to admit: my skin felt softer than it had in months. I wasn't expecting to notice an immediate reduction of the eczema on my neck, either, but after two days, that's exactly what happened. True, this is not your ticket to a day spa. At times - OK, most of the time - the sessions felt clinical, and that's because they are: in France, water therapy qualifies as a basic medical necessity for chronic skin conditions and is therefore covered by insurance. Hundreds of people of all ages fly to the Avène Hydrotherapy Center each year with the hopes of treating their painful eczema, burns, psoriasis, or other ailments. When I left the center, a publicist for the brand mentioned they were helping a family get the treatment they needed. The mom, after seeing my Instagram Story tagging Avène, sent me a DM: \"We're here with a toddler and a baby. Glad to be here.\" I remembered six-year-old me and smiled. Travel and expenses for the author and photographer were provided by Avène for the purpose of writing this story.
