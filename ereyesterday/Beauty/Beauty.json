Halloween and Thanksgiving have come and gone, and it's time to start (and for some, wrap up) your holiday shopping. Checking off every name from your list can be daunting, but the latest launches from some of your favorite brands make it a whole lot easier. Month after month, brands have impressed us with new innovations across the hair, makeup, skin, nail, and body categories, and they certainly didn't take the month of December off. From new skin-care tools that make indulging in a little self-care oh so easy to festive makeup palettes that have us audibly gasping with every pigmented swipe, our editors have found no shortage of exciting beauty products to test - and rave about - this month. On this list, not only will you find serums, candles, lip gloss, perfumes, and even a few limited-edition sets, but you also may just find the perfect beauty gift for someone on your list (or yourself). Whether you're looking to revamp your existing beauty routine or need some stocking stuffers for your upcoming holiday celebration, we've got you covered. Keep reading to dive into the beauty products our editors are loving for December.",
