    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-elitism-snobbery-explained?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "One thing about me is that I’ll always tell you when I’ve found a bargain. My jacket? I thrifted it! My shoes? Thanks, they were on sale! With the cost of living remaining high, we’re embracing spending less on clothes, spurred on by apps like Depop and eBay. But a recent interaction proved that inexpensive beauty products — particularly perfumes — are rarely met with the same enthusiasm.  I discovered the Marks \u0026 Spencer fragrance collection along with millions of other perfume enthusiasts on TikTok this spring. At just £10 (approximately $7.70) the perfumes were considered excellent value for money and some were even said to be “dupes” for designer brands like Viktor \u0026 Rolf and Carolina Herrera. I fell for one scent, Orange Blossom \u0026 Amber, and I wore it on repeat all summer. The compliments came rolling in, until one day when a few friends were a little too honest in their opinions — but only after I had revealed the brand. “On second thought, it smells a bit cheap,” one said over her coffee. Another chimed in, “Yeah, and I didn’t have you down for wearing something like that.”  My phone was obviously listening to the conversation because the first TikTok video I saw when I opened the app later was about “controversial” perfume opinions, namely what TikTok has coined “perfume elitism”. In a viral video, TikToker Emma aka @Perfumerism said, “I totally disagree with the elitism that comes with fragrances. Recently, I bought a $5 fragrance from Bath \u0026 Body Works and I got comments telling me I was ‘too good for that’. It’s like, ‘What do you mean?’ We can enjoy scents that don’t cost a hundred dollars.”  @perfumerism 3 of my controversial takes on perfume (+ perfumetok) #perfumetiktok #hottakes #fragrance #maceration #cologne ♬ [Do not disturb your voice] Heartwarming BGM(983631) – Kids Sound The video amassed a number of comments in agreement. “Elitism!!!! Like should I only smell good if the fragrance was $200???” asked one. Another wrote, “HARD on the elitism! […] If it’s good and cheap, isn’t that even better?”  What exactly is fragrance elitism? Fragrance elitism is clearly provoking people on TikTok but is it actually elitism? According to the Cambridge Dictionary, elitism is the “belief that some things are only for a few people who have special qualities or abilities”, like education, for example. When it comes to perfume, the semantics have changed slightly. Now it’s more colloquial.  I got in touch with Emma, who told R29, “Fragrance elitism is an attitude or belief that certain brands, fragrances or scent profiles are more ‘elite’, ‘exclusive’ or ‘better’ than others.” Emma first came across the concept while working on a perfume counter. “Fragrance elitists might turn their nose away at the idea of a $20 fragrance, or they might consider someone to have ‘poor taste’ if they enjoy any remotely popular scents,” — like celebrity perfumes, she explained.  Fragrance and beauty educator Maiya Nicole calls such folk “scent snobs”. She says, “Their tastes are dictated solely by cost and exclusivity. For them, fragrances that are readily available to the masses — think easily accessible, including scents with social media popularity — aren’t worth the time of day.” Coincidentally, every offering from highbrow brands (often with hefty price tags) is given an instant gold standard label, says Nicole. Typically, those who are elitist towards certain perfumes tend to look for “niche” fragrances, which are usually made in small quantities with natural or rare ingredients. But as perfume has become an affordable luxury, it seems that more and more people are becoming not-so-secret scent snobs.  Why are people quick to talk down on cheaper fragrances? To Nicole, a scent snob isn’t a true lover of the art of fragrance, but a lover of perceived status. So when did perfume become a status symbol? Emma thinks it has something to do with the desire to find the elusive “signature scent”, a fragrance that defines you and reflects your personality. Like designer fashion, jewelry or cars, Nicole believes that people think it says something about them if they can prove they have the funds to invest major money in how they smell. “Too often, people associate certain brand names with quality,” she says. Take Maison Francis Kurkdjian. Its most viral perfume, Baccarat Rouge 540, was described as a “black tie ball” or “penthouse apartment” in perfume form by fragrance obsessives, and wearing it was basically manifestation.   On the flipside, anything too familiar or lacking prestige is deemed less impressive or worthy by scent snobs, says Nicole. One thing is clear: The perfume we choose to wear is indicative of the lifestyle we want to lead. “A lot of people see their fragrance as an extension of themselves, especially as it’s so intertwined with identity,” says Emma. “It makes sense to want to invest in ourselves, and to want people’s sensory encounters with us to leave a positive impression, which is what [a lot of] expensive and niche brands offer.” Emma points out that, unlike a shouty designer bag or a flashy pair of shoes, perfume is understated. “It’s the new quiet luxury,” she says.  Is there any difference between cheap perfume and more expensive brands? I understand scent snobbery. If you’ve spent a hefty amount on perfume, you’ll want to feel justified in doing so. But here’s the thing: Besides marketing and brand names, there isn’t much difference between cheap and more expensive perfumes.  “People generally assume that cheap fragrances mean that they are unethical, don’t last and are made with crap ingredients,” says fragrance presenter and writer Alice du Parcq. None of this is true. “A lot of affordable fragrances are really well made because chances are, they are made by the same people behind expensive luxury fragrances,” she adds. The perfume world is pretty small. A good example of this is Glossier, says du Parcq. “The master perfumer Frank Voelkl co-created Le Labo Santal 33, one of the most famous (and expensive) fragrances. But he also co-created Glossier You, which is $78, as well as the new Glossier You Doux and Rêve.” Du Parcq also mentions renowned French perfumer Jérôme Epinette, the nose behind Victoria Beckham’s $290 perfumes. “He makes big-deal fragrances for major luxe brands, but he also makes fragrances for the high street store \u0026 Other Stories, which are [$40 to $50] each,” says du Parcq. They aren’t the only ones; Nicole tells me that Francis Kurkdjian, of Baccarat Rouge 540 fame, created Elizabeth Arden’s Green Tea, which retails for just $17.90. According to du Parcq, a perfumer of this calibre will never use “rubbish” ingredients. “That’s not a method in their creative process,” she says. “Instead, they’ll use beautiful, raw, natural ingredients, although probably in much smaller quantities. They’ll then support those with good quality biosynthetics, which are skin-safe, sustainable ingredients and have great lasting power.” As for biosynthetics, the cost per gram or milliliter is often much less than using raw natural ingredients, so this keeps the cost down, says du Parcq. Conversely, Amanda Carr, fragrance trend forecaster and cofounder of We Wear Perfume, says that niche brands tend to use more unusual ingredients, which can be expensive. (Emma cites orris butter, which she says can be even pricier than gold per kilogram.) “Niche fragrance is also often more intense, with eau de parfum frequently reaching 25% perfume oil concentration — sometimes even 30%,” says Carr. This makes the fragrance last much longer.   Another thing that makes perfume expensive is its packaging, as du Parcq explains. “Some use UV-coated glass to maintain the integrity of the juice inside, and this innovation costs money.” Affordable fragrance brands can cut prices, especially if they’re creating products on a larger scale. Then there’s the spray mechanism. “When you spray Chanel, there’s a feeling to it,” says du Parcq. “It’s effortless, silky and it has this beautiful flow. That is part of the luxury experience and costs money to make.” Lastly, there’s the way the perfume is marketed. “Marketing people will sit around a table and say, ‘If we price [our perfume] at $200 it will sell more,’ — and that’s a marketing tactic,” she adds. Nicole has come across expensive fragrances with poor performance and affordable fragrances that completely wowed her. “More often than not, you’re paying for the prestige and exclusivity of a brand,” she says. “The truth is that in a ‘blind’ test the average person wouldn’t be able to easily differentiate between a $20, $120 or $420 scent — unless you’re carrying around the bottle and announcing it to people.” No one who smells you or smells your fragrance will say, “I wish this person spent $100 more on this,” adds Nicole. Are perfume dupes ethical? So where do perfume dupes come in? Brands like Dossier have made a name for themselves thanks to their impressive designer perfume copies, but they’re a contentious topic. On one hand, dupes are said to rip off the work of more established brands. On the other hand, they are seen to democratize beauty, and with the cost of living at a high, it’s important not to judge where people spend their money. The experts have thoughts, though. “I have a pretty low opinion of dupes, because they rarely offer good value for money for the consumer — and it’s cheating in my eyes,” says Carr. “The amount of fragrance oil used is often tiny, so they might smell good for 10 minutes, then they will likely fade.” Emma talks openly about dupes on her TikTok page, because she believes that fragrance should be accessible. But all the experts interviewed for this article agree on one thing: There are countless, affordable, high-quality perfume brands that aren’t second-rate copies of luxury versions.  What are the best affordable perfumes? Du Parcq champions Beauty Pie especially. Nicole agrees that there are plenty of affordable ways to explore fragrance without duping. “Skylar, Good Chemistry, Finery, Mix Bar, Zara and Urban Outfitters all have some great fragrances,” she says. One of Nicole’s favorite brands is Brown Sugar Babe, particularly the scent Moola. Meanwhile, Carr rates Roger \u0026 Gallet and says that the Zara Cities collection, crafted by Jo Malone, is “exceptional”.  I also put the question to a handful of my beauty editor peers. Denise Primbet, beauty journalist at Glamour, is a huge fan of Ariana Grande’s Cloud, $48, with juicy pear, zingy bergamot and comforting lavender. Beauty writer Ata-Owaji Victor is equally enamored with Floral Street’s Wonderland Peony, $35, with tart guava and berries, while I love Beauty Pie’s Brazilian Lime, Fig Leaves and Tea, $34, for members. If I’ve learnt anything from the experts, it’s that while perfume is entirely subjective, breaking the bank isn’t necessary to smell great. With that in mind, Nicole sums up scent snobbery perfectly. “When people are caught up on the price of something, they cheat themselves out of the possibility of being delighted,” she says. Emma is inclined to agree: “You will never prise my $11.49 Nemat Vanilla Oil away from me.”  Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly-anticipated savings event is back for 2024. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite luxe moisturizer, the Sephora’s Holiday Savings Event is the time to do just that. Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your Beauty Insider membership tier (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge depending on how much you spend annually), you can get 10, 15, or 20% off, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on November 1, and both VIBs and Insiders on November 5. All tiers have until November 11 to use the promo code SAVINGS at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from November 1 to November 11, no code needed.) As with previous years, there is some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to one Dyson item (choose wisely), one Shark Beauty item, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. The Ordinary products, MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount.  Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Styling Hair Dryer System  We recently reviewed Shark’s latest hair tool launch, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. Sephora also stocks both the straightener and diffuser systems, but this version comes with several attachments — curling barrels, smoothing brush, finishing tool, and a concentrator nozzle — to achieve a variety of looks. Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Longwear Lip Liner Anywhere Caffeine, Wherever Walnut, Endless Cacao…the list of beloved shades of this Make Up For Ever pencil goes on and on. From makeup artists to beauty tastemakers like Hailey Bieber and Suni Lee, these beautifully pigmented, long-lasting pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. Patrick Ta Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duos Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta only recently launched these shimmering eyeshadow duos, and they’ve already begun to make waves online. If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that these will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Sol de Janiero Cheirosa Perfume Travel Minis Set Can’t choose a favorite Sol de Janeiro fragrance? With this set, you don’t need to. Featuring the brand’s most popular Cheirosa scents, this quartet of mists is already a steal at $34 — and that’s at full price. Olehenriksen Pout Preserve Hydrating Peptide Lip Treatment There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but this Ole Henriksen one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. From luminous pinks to decadent cocoa, there’s a shade (including crystal clear) for everyone to stock up on this sale. Glow Recipe Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum Another recent editor-favorite launch comes in the form of Glow Recipe’s new Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum, which gently yet effectively sloughs off dead skin cells before they get a chance to cause breakouts and dullness. Don’t miss out on trying it for yourself, and at a discount! Sephora Collection Best Skin Ever Full Coverage Multi-Use Hydrating Concealer If you’ve been sleeping on Sephora’s in-house range of products, now’s the time to wake up. One of our choice picks is the Best Skin Ever concealer, which has been lauded as a dupe for high-end brands. It’s creamy, blendable, and provides full coverage with a natural finish — and at only $11 and change during the sale. K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil K18 launched its hair oil in 2023, and it’s been a staple in my routine ever since. I’ve yet to find a more concentrated, hydrating formula that makes my hair smooth and super shiny. A little goes a long way, but this sale is a great time to stretch your savings by knocking dollars off the $65 price tag. Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, $23 Rare Beauty’s liquid blush is intensely pigmented, available in gorgeous shades for every skin tone, and is utterly giftable as a perfect stocking stuffer.

    "description": "We know better than anyone that a good hair day can make or break your entire mood. However, sometimes the key to always nailing a look is having the right haircut. Whether it's layers, something mid-length, or a full-on buzz cut, having a cut you're obsessed with will make getting ready in the morning that much more enjoyable. The latest cut everyone's eyeing right now? The \"halo\" haircut. One part Elvira Hancock in \"Scarface\" and one part Violet Beauregarde in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" the look is anything but basic. The bob-esque style will frame your face like a halo, and you might just wind up looking angelic AF. Bob haircuts have only grown in popularity over the last few months, and the newest on-trend style is sticking with that theme. It's short, it's round, and it's ready to be worn through the upcoming season and beyond. Whether you already have an appointment scheduled or you're suddenly interested in making a change, the halo haircut might just be your saving grace. Ahead, experts break down everything to know about the popular new haircut, like how to ask your stylist for the look, who it looks best on, and how you can maintain the style at home. Keep reading to learn more about the halo cut. Experts Featured in This Article Justin Toves-Vincilione is a celebrity hairstylist and Authentic Beauty Concept Advocate. Sunnie Brook is a Biolage hair ambassador and celebrity hair stylist. Amy Abramite is the creative director at Maxine Salon in Chicago. Tom Smith is the creative director at Evo Hair. What Is the Halo Haircut? Put simply, it's a short, shoulder-length bob with rounded layers and bangs. \"It looks much like a bowl cut or a round crop haircut,\" Justin Toves-Vincilione, celebrity hairstylist, tells PS. The good news is the style works well on any hair type or texture. \"It's one of my favorite haircuts for curly or textured hair,\" celebrity hairstylist Sunnie Brook says. \"The layers can enhance the hair's natural volume and shape to create a halo effect for bouncy, lively curls.\" Brook says the cut also adds movement and softness for those with straighter hair, which will give it a voluminous and dynamic appearance. What to Ask Your Stylist For at the Hair Salon Asking for the look at the salon is easy. \"Explain that you like roundness and volume,\" Toves-Vincilione says. \"Ask for layers that are uniform in length and create a round silhouette when dry.\" Although the style is most often seen with bangs, you can specify whether or not you want to add that feature. \"Be flexible and prepare to let go of some length if it's needed to create the desired shape,\" Toves-Vincilione adds. If you have curly hair, you should also be sure to ask about curl shrinkage, to ensure you and your stylist are on the same page about the length you want your hair to be after your wet cut. \"When in doubt, bring inspiration photos of hair types very similar to your own,\" Toves-Vincilione says. \"Preferably similar in color as well, as this cut does visually read differently depending on hair color.\" When it comes to maintenance, Maxine Salon creative director Amy Abramite says you should plan to visit the salon for a trim every six to eight weeks. \"If the length becomes too long, the ends will flip up rather than roll under,\" she says. However, Evo Hair creative director Tom Smith says there is one work-around to the frequent in-salon visits: \"If a halo silhouette has been created around the face, a fringe or bang trim can help to reinstate it without the need to have the full shape recut.\" How to Style the Halo Haircut If you have straight hair, Abramite suggests blowing out the hair smooth using the Trademark Beauty Easy Blo Dryer ($32, originally $39). From there, she suggests locking in the shape by setting the ends with Velcro rollers, which will help reinforce the bend. If you have curly hair, Brook suggests towel blotting or using a hair plopping technique once you're out of the shower. \"Avoid putting your hair up in a bath towel as it will really make your hair frizzy with this cut,\" she says. She suggests adding the Biolage All-in-One Coconut Infusion Multi-Benefit Treatment Spray ($26) to hair for added shine and to help control frizz. \"If you want more volume, use a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment to enhance your curls or waves - be sure to use the low to medium setting to keep frizz away.\" If you're ready to take the plunge and book an appointment with your stylist, keep reading for some inspiration photos you can bring with you to your next salon visit.",

    "description": "If scrunchies, banana eyeliner, and blush draping have taught us anything, it's that old things become new again in the beauty space - you just have to give them time. That's why we're not surprised the flipped hairstyle is making a huge comeback. Flipped hair has been around for decades - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Priscilla Presley both wore the style back in the day - but the new hairstyle trend puts a modern spin on it. Instead of lots of volume at the crown of the head, this version features sleek, pin-straight hair with the ends curled up into a sharp C shape. \"Whether it's paired with a ponytail, half-up half-down, [or] all down with a side or middle part, I think it's such a fun way to spice up a sleek, straight look this spring,\" celebrity hairstylist Hayley Heckmann tells PS. \"The style is super flattering on everyone and totally elevates a look.\" Experts Featured in This Article Hayley Heckmann is a celebrity hairstylist and Unite Hair Care brand partner. Devin Toth is a NYC-based hairstylist at Salon SCK. The Comeback of '60s Hairstyles: Flipped Hair We've seen the flipped hairstyle pop up a few times over the last couple of years, but it's gotten even more popular recently, thanks to celebrities and beauty-lovers on TikTok. Ariana Grande, Cardi B, Keke Palmer, Zendaya, and Jennifer Lopez have all rocked the retro look on more than one occasion, with each putting their own spin on it. If you need any further convincing, see Kim Kardashian's look for the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala. \"The hair flip - where it's a bob haircut or long hair in a pony - gives a cooler-than-school, '60s retro vibe,\" hairstylist Devin Toth previously told PS. \"And who wouldn't want that?\" The retro look is fun and flirty for spring, and we're predicting there will be even more celebrities embracing the trend in the coming weeks as the weather warms up more. To see the '60s hairstyle action, keep scrolling.",
