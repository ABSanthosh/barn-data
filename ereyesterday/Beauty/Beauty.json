    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Dimitrios Kambouris Something we can all get behind: celebrities being more transparent and opening up about their personal skin-care journeys. We've seen it in the past, like when Keke Palmer spoke about her acne and PCOS, and now, Hailey Bieber is doing the same with her perioral dermatitis. Bieber posted a close-up photo of her skin on her Instagram Story on Jul. 18, 2025, explaining that she was having a perioral dermatitis flare, as well as what products she was using to manage it. \"Always flares when I'm traveling a lot, sleep deprived, hormones, the wrong SPF, new products, stress,\" one of the posts read. In the second slide, Bieber shared the products that work for her. \"What I use when I have a flare: so minimal. Rinse my face with water, prescription azelaic, hypochlorous acid, clindamycin, Glazing Milk ($32).\" Image Source: Instagram user haileybieber This isn't the first time Bieber has been candid with her followers about her skin struggles. In 2020, Bieber previously opened up about what perioral dermatitis is and how she learned to manage it. \"This is day 3 so it's calmed down a lot,\" read the text on Bieber's 2020 image of her slightly red cheeks and tiny blemishes. \"Since I like to be as transparent as possible about my skin: I have something called perioral dermatitis which I've had for a few years now.\" Image Source: Instagram user haileybieber Perioral dermatitis is an inflamed scaly or bumpy red rash that appears on the face, usually concentrated around the mouth. Back in December 2020, Bieber explained what the triggers are for her skin. \"Some things that I noticed trigger it: trying a new product, a product that's too harsh, weather, masks, sometimes certain SPF.\" But the biggest one for her is laundry detergent. She stressed the importance of seeing a board-certified dermatologist to get a diagnosis if you're experiencing an issue with your skin. \"It also took me getting the proper diagnosis from a dermatologist after stubbornly trying to treat it myself,\" Bieber wrote. \"Sometimes it gets so irritated only a prescription cream will calm it down. Self diagnosing is a no no.\" Tell 'em, Bieber.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-ami-cole-makeup-48459651",
    "description": "In recent years, beauty brands have started catering to a wider range of skin tones, making it possible for me as a Black woman to find a foundation, concealer, or bronzer that enhances my natural complexion without changing it completely. Of all those beauty players, none struck a chord with me the way Ami Colé did. The brainchild of Senegalese founder and CEO Diarrha N'Diaye-Mbaye, Ami Colé catered to melanin-rich skin, a category that has historically been overlooked. From the warm website imagery to its emphasis on diversity, the clean beauty brand put people like me at the center of the narrative - not as a result of giving in to public calls for inclusion but as part of a genuine commitment to uplifting Black beauty. The clean beauty brand put people like me at the center of the narrative - not as a result of giving in to public calls for inclusion but as part of a genuine commitment to uplifting Black beauty. Now, four years after Ami Colé was founded, N'Diaye-Mbaye announced it'll be officially closing in September 2025. In an article for our sister brand, The Cut, she revealed that the brand is shuttering in part due to a lack of support from investors. \"Instead of focusing on the healthy, sustainable future of the company and meeting the needs of our loyal fan base,\" she wrote, \"I rode a temperamental wave of appraising investors - some of whom seemed to have an attitude toward equity and 'betting big on inclusivity' that changed its tune a lot, to my ears, from what it sounded like in 2020.\" Her story echoes that of several Black founders who note that support for Black-owned brands has waned following the racial reckoning in 2020. Still, Ami Colé's impact is long-lasting and immeasurable, and we tapped beauty insiders across the industry to speak to the enduring legacy it leaves behind. Inspired by the beauty of Black women and the way we show up in the world, the collection includes an award-winning skin-enhancing tint, a light-catching highlighter, and a lip treatment oil that our editors raved about - all made from hydrating ingredients such as baobab-seed extract, hibiscus extract, and pumpkin-seed extract that draw on the founder's heritage. These products are still available to shop at Sephora, Amazon, and the brand's site through the end of September 2025. Ahead, read love letters to Ami Colé from several beauty editors. And keep scrolling to explore a curated edit and bring home these thoughtful pieces while you can.",

    "title": "Buzz Cuts To Soft Locs: 8 Black Women On Their Breakup Hair Transformations",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/post-breakup-hair-transformation-black-women?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Breakups are hard, but what comes after is harder. The heart-in-your-throat sadness, denial in the form of scrolling past their story like you didn’t already watch it three times (six if you count the times you told your friends to stalk their page), and the sporadic bursts of anger looking back at past conversations. Finally, there’s acceptance. And for a lot of Black women, healing often means change, and that usually starts at our roots with a hair transformation.  The breakup hair change is more than a cliché. For Black women, it’s a ritual. A reset. A quiet rebellion. Whether it’s a buzz cut, blonde box braids, a fresh silk press, or a full return to natural kinks and coils, the post-breakup hair transformation says more than any goodbye text ever could. Hair has always been loaded for Black women; it’s political, personal, and oftentimes policed. So it makes sense that in moments of emotional chaos, we turn to it for clarity. Changing our hair isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s about healing.  Unbothered has explored the intimate connections between breakups and hair transformations through the lens of Black womanhood. We hear from Black women about the choices they made after breakups — the drastic cuts, the color changes, the protective styles — and what those choices meant. Some wanted to shed the version of themselves that was in the relationship. Others wanted to feel seen again. For many, it was simply about starting fresh, and there’s something undeniably Black about turning heartache into a beauty statement you have complete ownership of. Because sometimes, the most revolutionary thing a Black woman can do after heartbreak is decide who she wants to be next. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lydia, 27, London: “Dyeing my hair made me feel daring.” Lydia’s breakup had forced her to confront something bigger: how little she had been willing to settle for. “I realized I was waiting to be chosen instead of choosing myself,” she says. That clarity sparked a chain of events. She quit her job, applied for a teaching role abroad, and moved to Thailand—all within weeks. “That hairstyle became symbolic of a whole new chapter.” “I just didn’t want to look at how I was feeling,” says Lydia, reflecting on the moment she walked out of the short but emotionally significant relationship. Instead of spiraling, she booked an appointment and chose something she’d never done before, long, burgundy soft locs. “It was my first time getting that style and going that color,” she says. “It made me feel cute. It made me feel good, like new hair, who this?”. Lydia wanted to feel like herself again because she says she was beginning to look unfamiliar. “I’d been living safely, comfortably. But dyeing my hair that color made me feel daring. I was finally doing something I’d only talked about.” For Lydia, the hair came first, but the woman who emerged after was completely transformed. Tahirah, 34, Brooklyn, New York: “Cutting my hair was the most empowering thing to do.” “I just went balls to the walls, full Britney Spears buzz cut because it was the easiest thing for me to do at the moment,” says Tahirah.  After a painful six-year relationship that was a huge part of her youth, Tahirah found peace in the impulsive decision to cut her hair late at night with a pair of red scissors. “I was feeling really insecure and neglected… cutting my hair was the most empowering thing to do.” For her, the buzz cut was about regaining control over her life. “Cutting my hair and going into that buzz cut moment was allowing me to have visibility,” she explains, highlighting how her identity as a Black woman shaped her relationship with her hair. “My beauty is not defined just by my hair; it’s about my aura, how I choose to show up.” Through her cut, she gained renewed confidence, attracting both new opportunities and compliments. “I felt power. It was a moment of release, but also a power move for me. I didn’t care about the hair because it always grows back,” says Tahirah. This candid reflection highlights how, for most Black women, hair is deeply intertwined with their identity and, in some cases, defines who they are, shaping how they are seen, understood, and received by the world. Remi, 31, Milton Keynes: “Red is loud and signifies a new chapter.” “Red is loud,” says Remi, staring into the camera during our video chat, “but it was also me playing it safe because red was the only color that my hair had ever been when I was younger, other than my natural hair color.” She hadn’t worn the color since her early twenties, a time when she was a freer and more joyful version of herself. After a major breakup in her late twenties, she returned to the familiar deep red to signal a new chapter.  It was more than just color; she opted for a leave-out weave, a drastic shift after years of wearing braids. The color “reminded me of a time in my life where I just enjoyed my experience and the things that I was doing and the way that I was living,” says Remi.  Everyone processes a breakup differently; some burrow into deep, dark depression, and some snap out of it in the blink of an eye, like the relationship never happened. For Remi, it wasn’t only the hair change that helped her move through her emotions, but writing about it was also an unexpected emotional release. She surprised herself by writing and sharing a deeply personal project called Crying Over Breakfast on her Instagram.  Split into three parts —heartbreak, hurting, healing— the series gave her space to reflect on the relationship, her emotions, and her growth. “The heartbreak was very raw and very honest and very unfiltered. And then the hurting was more me settling into where I was at, based on what had happened. Not so much the impulsive like being upset, but  just sorting through the whole relationship and everything that happened, and then the healing part was just focused on, okay, what was I doing to heal myself?” Her hair change was just one piece of healing. She also focused on trying new foods, going out with her friends, and going to art galleries. The weave and red color marked a change, not because they were new, but because she chose them for herself. Ray, 32, London: “My blonde bob has brought a different energy.” Ray had locs for five or six years; they were a part of her identity, but they carried the energy of two major relationships. Following the end of her most recent one, she felt the weight of what hadn’t been processed. “Your hair carries energy,” she explained, “and I knew I needed to do something.” With the help of her mother, Ray spent three daunting days carefully unraveling over a hundred locs. Each strand unwound like a thread from the past, the process becoming both ritual and release. “It was a labour of love,” she said, thinking back on the memory. Funnily enough, this exact process was spoken into existence by her ex-boyfriend’s mother. “She’s been trying to get me to brush out my hair because we broke up,” says Ray. “She’s very spiritual and she’s always like, you need to go into your next stage of life, and this will be great for your mental health.” Locs are a serious commitment; they take time and care, they’re not something you choose to start lightly. So, what does a woman who had them for over five years choose as her next hairstyle post-breakup? A custom blonde bob wig, that’s what. “I’m a Bob girl,” Ray says with a smile. “It commands respect. And I needed to remember I was the planet, not the moon.” This was significant because she had shared that she had made her ex-boyfriend her entire planet, forgetting she could be one herself.  The blonde wig was Monroe-esque and glamorous. “I felt fully in alignment. That blonde bob brought a different type of energy, attention, and confidence.” Ray’s hair transformation mirrored her emotional one. Post-breakup, it wasn’t just about changing her look — it was about a complete return to form. Nuna, 32, London: “Shaving my hair off was like, you can’t tell me anything anymore.” Fresh off a year abroad in Toronto, 22-year-old Nuna returns home to London reeling from her first serious relationship. A toxic on-and-off two-year experience that left her feeling lost. The breakup prompted a dramatic change where she shaved her head completely. “I went down to the skin, it wasn’t even a pixie,” says Nuna. This act wasn’t just about aesthetics; it marked a turning point in how she saw herself. “I grew up in Peterborough, which is predominantly white. I remember going to my friend’s houses after school, and they’d do my hair, and it never looked right.” Nuna often mimicked European beauty standards, straightening her hair excessively and relying on damaging slick-backs. In her relationship, this cycle of trying to fit a specific look persisted due to her partner’s critical comments. “I was constantly trying to look how he wanted me to,” she says. “Shaving it off was like — you can’t tell me anything anymore.” The haircut was a gateway to self-discovery. She began experimenting with wigs and even learned to make her own after a disappointing salon experience. “I was spending £400 on bad wigs. I had to learn to do it myself,” she explains. Over time, this led her back to protective styles like braids and a deeper understanding of her hair. Now in her early 30s, she reflects on the haircut as a pivotal step. “It didn’t solve everything, but it started something,” she says. For her, the big chop was both an act of release and reclamation — a way to cut ties with damaging ideals and step into a more authentic version of herself. Tolu, 32, Walthamstow, UK: “The mullet is a symbol of my freedom.” “I just felt relieved,” says Tolu, remembering how a blonde mullet wig unexpectedly became her post-breakup armour. The relationship had run its course, and while the end wasn’t devastating, the transition still called for change. While many would expect heartbreak to bring on tears, Tolu’s reaction was the opposite. “I really didn’t give a fuck. I was so happy it was over.” The mullet was a symbol of freedom. “It felt like coming back to myself,” says Tolu.  Having always used hair as a form of expression, she wasn’t new to switching up her style, but this was different. The wig was unlike anything she’d worn before. It was short, in your face, blonde, and defied the age-old myth that dark-skinned women “can’t pull off blonde.” She could, and she did. “It just marked the end of something and the beginning of something else,” says Tolu reflectively.  Though she rarely wears the wig now, what it represents still holds weight. “I don’t hate it, but it sits in a weird space of time. It reminds me of the past,” says Tolu. The wig wasn’t about reinvention; it was about alignment. She didn’t need to reclaim agency; she already had it. The mullet simply echoed what she already knew, she was ready to move on — and she did. Liz, 26, Manchester, UK: “I needed to let go.” After ending a toxic relationship, Liz bravely chose to cut off her hair completely. “Hair holds a lot of energy,” she says. “I needed to get rid of it.” The breakup coincided with a move back to Manchester, and the timing felt right to start over. “I’d been neglecting my hair for so long. Letting go of the hair was like letting go of something that no longer felt like me,” says Liz.  She was 22 when she met her ex and 25 when the relationship ended.  Sitting in the barber’s chair, she felt lighter spiritually and emotionally. “It was one less thing to think about while moving on.” We met in the middle of lockdown, and over those two and a half years, I grew up fast. Mentally, I changed so much. Leaving felt like a Phoenix-rising moment,  like I was finally coming back to myself,” says Liz.  As a Black woman, the decision to cut her hair came with extra scrutiny. “People asked what my boyfriend would think. I didn’t have one anymore—wasn’t that the point?” she says. Her hair had always felt like a performance. She relaxed it to fit in, braided it during the natural hair wave, and even wore wigs, though she hated wearing them. Now, for the first time since childhood, she’s growing her hair naturally and learning how to care for it without trends dictating her choices. Her relationship with her hair mirrored her relationship with herself; both had suffered. “I wasn’t eating or sleeping well. My hair was fucked. I wasn’t happy.” Shaving off her hair put the power back into her hands. “Everything felt out of control, but this one thing was mine.” Romana, 30, Birmingham, UK: “Cutting my hair was like a spiritual purge.”  Two weeks after her breakup, Ramona walked into her hairdresser’s salon and asked for the chop. Not a trim, not a bob. A full reset. “I wanted to shave it all off and do a proper Britney Spears,” she says, half-joking, “but I thought that might be a bit too radical.” Instead, she opted for a shaved-back bowl cut. The decision wasn’t spontaneous – she’d been thinking about cutting her hair for over a year. But it took the unraveling of her relationship to make the move. “I didn’t lose myself,” she says. “I betrayed myself.” Cutting her hair felt like “a spiritual purge”, says Ramona. “There was so much trapped in it that I needed to let go of it”.  Watching her hair fall was scary and safe all at once. The terror that settled in while she was in the hairdresser’s chair shifted and made space for newness.   Post-breakup, she looked in the mirror and saw a version of herself that felt powerful. The haircut didn’t give her confidence; it revealed it. “Hair grows back,” she says. “You can start over as many times as you need to. There are no rules.” This article was originally published on Unbothered UK Like what you see?

    "description": "When you think of YSL Beauty, a few things come to mind. For me, I think of Touche Éclat concealer and Dua Lipa. For others, you may simply know the three iconic initials as an iconic French fashion house. All of these things are true, but during a recent trip with the brand to Marrakech (a home and huge source of inspiration to the brand’s founder, Algerian-born Yves Saint Laurent), I discovered that there was so much to YSL Beauty that meets the eye. And not to mention, some seriously excellent products to boot.  Over four days, I got the chance to visit Morocco’s Ourika Gardens, where YSL Beauty grows botanical ingredients for its suite of makeup, skincare products, and fragrances. (I’ll never forget hand-picking jasmine flowers that would end up in bottles of Libre perfume.) It’s as good a crash course as I could’ve dreamed of, and along the way, I tested out hundreds of dollars’ worth of product to determine which are the most exciting, covetable ones to try this year. DashDividers_1_500x100 Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil Gloss, $40 In a crowded landscape of lip gloss-treatment hybrids, YSL Beauty’s Loveshine is a standout. The shades are curated and truly unique — my two favorites are California Sunshine, a shimmery cinnamon, and Thunder Stealer, a sparkly frosted lavender that feels like it’s from the future. In addition to a kiss of color, the formula has ginger and pepper oils to boost circulation and naturally plump lips. DashDividers_1_500x100 Make Me Blush 24H Buildable Powder Blush, $45 These adorable powder blushes remind me of French macarons — colorful, cute, and utterly irresistible. Available in both matte and satin finishes, these silky powder blushes are intensely pigmented and have pretty impressive staying power. (They held up all day, even on the hottest days walking around Marrakech.) My favorites of the bunch are Peachy Nude and Berry Bang, but to be honest, there’s not a blah shade in the bunch. DashDividers_1_500x100 Candy Glaze Lip Gloss Stick, $42 Lip gloss in a stick? Genius, if you ask me. It’s easier to apply without a mirror, less prone to getting everywhere, and when the packaging is this good, what’s not to love? I love to wear this with a lip pencil for an easy, effortless lip combo. You can also wear it alone for a barely-there hint of hydrating color. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lash Clash Extreme Volume Mascara, $33 I’m pretty picky with my mascara. I like my lashes to look effortlessly fluttery and defined, even when I do a more bold, voluminous lash look. I’m wearing YSL Beauty’s Lash Clash mascara here, and as you can see, it’s all about flirty, look-at-me lashes without any heaviness or clumps. YSL Beauty’s Global Makeup Artist Sam Visser gave me a life-changing tip for applying lots of mascara: Wipe off any excess from the wand before applying it to your lashes, which gives you more control over building up coats as needed.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Couture Mini Clutch Eyeshadow Palette, $68 These compact eyeshadow quads are high fashion, but for your eyes. There are two new palettes to look forward to this year, Captivating Dunes and Sunrise Safari, and the former has become my current obsession. It’s the perfect mix of earthy, cool-toned neutrals that are super elevated. I like to apply a wash of champagne shimmer all over my lid, and then define the crease with the medium taupe. For date night, I turn it into a smoky eye with the dark chocolate matte along the upper and lower lash lines. The powders are silky and soft to wear — never chalky — and are actually infused with fig cactus oil from the Ourika Gardens that I toured.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Candy Glow Tinted Butter Balm, $42 Yes, it’s a lip balm — but a really, really nice one. Like, the nicest I own. I love the shade 8B (a warm rose) to prep my lips while I do the rest of my makeup. It’s silky and hydrating, but not too heavy. I will be honest, the tint on this is quite sheer; but that isn’t a dealbreaker for me since I’m not a huge lipstick person anyway. The packaging is also stunning, and looks like something Marie Antoinette would’ve kept in her vanity.  Libre Eau De Parfum, $140 I’m not normally a floral perfume girlie but Libre’s gorgeous mix of orange blossom, jasmine, lavender, and musk is like a warm, sensual embrace in olfactive form. According to perfumers Anne Flipo and Carlos Benaim, Libre was born from the idea of starting with a fougère — a traditionally masculine structure within fragrance — and adding feminine, floral notes for a juxtaposition. The result? A sexy, complex floral scent that evokes both strength and sensuality. We filled our own bottles in the gardens, and I love how the refills include two bottles’ (aka 100mL) worth of juice for $135. (A 50mL bottle retails for $140.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Hyper Luminize Powder Highlighter, $55 I’m not a huge fan of highlighter, since I already have very oily skin that usually gleams a bit too much on its own. (I also lived through the unicorn strobing trend of the mid-2010s and had years of highlighter fatigue!) But trust YSL Beauty to snap me out of my funk with this finely milled powder highlighter. It’s shockingly subtle, which is why it’s so good: I added a dusting along high points of the face (and even as eyeshadow!) for a bit of eye-catching brightness, as if I turned up my phone’s exposure levels. Hypnotic Honey is the prettiest golden-hour shade that doesn’t look too pigmented — just an expensive, gilded glow. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
