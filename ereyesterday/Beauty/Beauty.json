    "description": "In today’s crowded perfume scene, it takes something truly extraordinary to make our beauty editors sit up and take notice. This is especially true for spring and summer perfumes, when brands jostle for attention with new releases that promise to transport you to warmer climes and lift your mood. Given the current status of the world, I’m skeptical about perfumes that aim to spark joy. But when I heard about Noyz Detour Eau de Parfum, $85, a scent that claims to capture “the warm and happy memories of a road trip”, I was a little more than curious. If you’re a Refinery29 regular, you’re probably already aware of our love for Noyz, an LA-based fragrance brand with cool girl status. Renowned perfumer Jérôme Epinette, who has worked on bestselling perfumes for the likes of Byredo and Floral Street, is the creator behind the collection. Our beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is already a big fan: “My bathroom shelf is chock-full of fragrances, but I’ll always make room for Noyz,” she says. “The brand oozes cool, and its note combinations are so unique; Unmute Eau de Parfum, $85, for example, is like no other vanilla scent I’ve tried.” Detour, the brand’s latest drop, is another variation of that vanilla-heavy, “skin musk” perfume trend we’ve been seeing everywhere. But we actually think this has serious potential to stand out and emerge as the viral scent of the summer. Keep reading to learn the stamps of approval from two picky Refinery29 editors. DashDividers_1_500x100 Noyz Detour Eau De Parfum, $85 Call me a Debbie Downer, but “happy” olfactory notes don’t usually do it for me. Most gourmands — fragrances with sweet, edible notes — smell more cloying than comforting to my nose, and I tend to get sick of floral scents after a few wears. Meanwhile, citrus notes remind me of cleaning products. Admittedly, I wasn’t too convinced that I’d like Detour, which features all three components. But it proved me wrong. In fact, I fell in love with Detour at first spritz thanks to its bold initial blast: I could smell a burst of white florals, namely creamy jasmine and powdery gardenia, but it’s balanced out by equally powerful whiffs of crisp apple blossom and Spanish mandarin. This bright and juicy combination lingered in the air around me, and made me think of that first breath of summer air when you roll down your car windows. This was precisely Epinette’s intention. I couldn’t help but smile as fun memories of past summer road trips washed over me. Kilikita was also impressed by the scent’s incredible projection: “Just one spritz on my left wrist was enough to garner multiple compliments from friends on a recent night out,” she says, adding, “The staying power is akin to a perfume extrait, which boasts a larger concentration of fragrance oil.” This makes sense given the emerging perfume trend of pairing citrus with musk, which prolongs the wear time of a scent. As Detour settles, it transforms into something more intimate, with skin-wrapped musk and warm, comforting vanilla. Kikilita caught subtle hints of tobacco, coffee, and dried flowers, while it smelled more like caramel toffee to me. It has a warm, lived-in feeling that doesn’t try too hard to be “sexy” but rather, invites people to lean in closer. I’ve been wearing the perfume for a week straight and haven’t been able to stop sniffing my wrists. Ever better is how it changes throughout the day, gradually transforming from an invigorating citrus-floral bomb at the start of the day to a cozy, skin-like scent by nighttime. As someone who gets bored of a fragrance easily, this is such a blessing. This unique shapeshifting quality convinced us that Detour will be the cool girl’s scent of the summer. In fact, it has already generated lots of buzz since making its debut at none other than Coachella. It certainly has a fun and energetic burst that bodes well for festival season, while the creamy and musky dry down brings a slice of nostalgia for summer’s past. Personally, I can’t wait to break this out for my upcoming summer vacay, and will definitely be wearing this when I need a timely reminder of more carefree days. Like what you see?

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationOld Navy Launches Special-Occasion Dresses This spring and summer, Old Navy wants you to get dressed up — literally.

With prices ranging from $44.99 to $64.99, the capsule features elegant twist-front maxi dresses, sleek cowl-neck satin gowns, joyful bubble-hem mini dresses, all of which are available in sizes XS to 4X (or 0 to 30). “I’ve designed dresses for women in every scenario — from everyday moments to the red carpet — so it was a pleasure to lend my expertise to Sarah [Holme, Old Navy head of design and product development] and collaborate with the Old Navy design team on The Occasion,” chief creative officer Zac Posen said in a press release. “This collection is elevated, accessible, and truly makes any event feel special.” Shop now at Old Navy Old Navy Satin Cowl Maxi Dress, $, available at Old NavyCoach Becomes Official Partner of the WNBA Professional women’s basketball just got even more stylish because Coach is now an official partner of the WNBA. The deal — which, according to a press release, is meant to encourage players and fans to embrace and express all aspects of their personalities — will pop up in different ways throughout the 2025 season. That includes the WNBA Draft, which was held in New York City on April 14 and saw top prospects like Paige Bueckers (the first overall pick), Hailey Van Lith, and Aneesah Morrow sporting Coach at the event. Another aspect of the partnership? Coach will become the presenting sponsor of WNBA Pride, a platform celebrating the LGBTQ+ community.

Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones RoadCult Gaia Introduces Bridal Collection The brand behind the viral Ark bag and Cassidy Sandal — and the latest Gap collaborator — Cult Gaia is walking down the aisle. The LA brand has just launched its debut bridal collection, and it’s full of sculptural, statement-making styles that break the typical wedding-day mold — think a mini dress made from silk-chiffon braided material, a floral-lace gown with removable sleeves, a plisséd 3-D top, and more. “Crafted for the effortless bride, each piece is thoughtfully created to captivate, inspire, and evoke pure emotion on your most special days,” Cult Gaia founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat said in a press release.

The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour.

Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam.

Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better? It offers additional heat and UV protection, shields against frizz-inducing humidity, and brushes out with ease, leaving hair feeling soft and silky, not crispy or chalky. Shop now at SephoraColorWow Texas Hold 'Em Big Hold Hairspray, $, available at SephoraMagda Butrym x H\u0026MEach H\u0026M designer collaboration is an anticipated event. Whether you’ve previously recurred a pair of Simone Rocha beaded drop earrings or a corseted Mugler dress, the collaborations offer a chance to enter the world of luxury at a much sweeter price point. For the latest collection, the Swedish giant has turned to Polish designer Magda Butrym, who has dubbed the 19-piece collection a “celebration of femininity in bloom.” From denim bustiers with 3D rose adornments to shimmering gowns with glittering floral embellishments, this collection is made for spring soirees.Shop on April 24 at H\u0026MLike what you see?

    "description": "Another Coachella season is officially underway, and from it, we've had no shortage of fresh and inspiring beauty looks to take in. For starters, we saw Blackpink's Lisa's dramatic hair transformation to \"mushroom\" blond ahead of her first Coachella solo performance. The queen of the \"clean-girl aesthetic,\" Hailey Bieber, also had some fun with her nail art as she rocked hot pink \"lava nails\" that matched her outfit. But aside from those looks, we saw another trend emerge amongst the celebrities in attendance this year: every shade of red hair under the sun. The desert sun might have reached triple-digit temperatures over the weekend, but it still didn't compare to these hot, fiery looks. Megan Thee Stallion, Emma Roberts, Bea Miller, and Heeseung all jumped on the trend with their own unique twist. \"Copper cowgirl,\" \"cherry-cola,\" and \"calico\" are just a few of the variations we spotted. If you're considering going red for the first time, it's best to seek some help from a salon professional to ensure your big change leaves you feeling your best. In the meantime, let these celebrity red hair looks at Coachella inspire you. We recommend saving them as inspiration the next time you're itching for something new.",

    "description": "We don't know about you, but for us, if we're having a good hair day, it feels like nothing can stop us. It doesn't matter if the look took us hours to achieve or just a few minutes; there's nothing better than a G.H.D. (good hair day). We love a beachy look done with a curling iron, a fun blowout styled with a blowdryer brush, or even a simple air-dried look that's been made more cohesive with the help of some no-heat hair hacks. However, the days when our hair looks like it belongs to a supermodel and didn't take us longer than twenty minutes to achieve are the days we're most excited. On those days, we almost always used hot rollers. Hot rollers are great because you can pop them in and multitask. Whether you need to finish your makeup, fire off a work email, or finish cleaning the house before guests come over, they essentially do all the hard work for you, and you don't have to lift a finger. The hair tool has been around forever, but they recently had a resurgence in popularity thanks to hot roller content on TikTok. Not only will they give your hair tons of volume, but the curls they produce will last for hours as well. There are plenty of different options on the market, and ahead, we're breaking down the best options out there. Whether you're looking for the best hot rollers for long hair or the best hot rollers for damaged hair, we've got you covered. Keep scrolling to check out all of our picks.",
