    "description": "“I did not know it would be a thing,” Serena Page confesses, reflecting on the style and maintenance of her goddess braids that took the Love Island USA villa by storm. The reality star and her best friend JaNa Craig recently joined Refinery29’s Unbothered podcast Go Off, Sis during a live recording at Beautycon to spill the tea on their journey from the villa to their burgeoning careers. As the show’s winner, fans were amazed at how Page effortlessly maintained her hair in the humid weather throughout the show’s entirety. Her braids weren’t just a fashion statement; they were a symbol of community and connection among viewers. A former braider herself, Page didn’t anticipate the significant impact her hair would have on viewers until she returned home. She insists that experimenting with different hairstyles and looks is a form of self-expression. “I simply didn’t feel like dealing with a lace for 10 weeks on the show and didn’t know what the weather would be like. Braids are the only thing I can upkeep, and I needed something that I could switch up a lot. Before the villa, I had a new hairstyle every two weeks. Now, it’s a little more frequent. I express myself through my hair,” Page said. Despite the negativity, their sisterhood captivated viewers, becoming a fan favorite, often overshadowing the romantic drama. Her passion for hair has ignited her entrepreneurial spirit, leading the reality star to her next big venture: launching a hair care brand in 2025. Tailored specifically to the needs of Black women and their protective styles, the brand aims to revolutionize the industry. It’s no secret that our crowns symbolize heritage, as Black hairstyles are deeply rooted in African traditions and have been passed down through generations. Although she kept the specifics under wraps at Beautycon, Page assured fans that the launch is happening soon. On the other hand, while fans admired Craig’s flawless makeup looks, enduring 24-hour filming days in Fiji’s heat, it was post-villa that her beauty game truly evolved. The former Love Island USA contestant told co-host Unbothered VP Chelsea Sanders that she’s recently embraced blush and opted for more natural-looking lashes. As the conversation turned to friendship, co-host and Unbothered Global Deputy Director Kathleen Newman Bremang addressed the unfortunate reality of online trolls targeting the beloved “Power Puff Gang” (PPG) – Page, Craig, and Leah Kateb. Despite the negativity, their sisterhood captivated viewers, becoming a fan favorite, often overshadowing the romantic drama. However, their friendship was put to the ultimate test when online haters targeted Kateb with racist accusations. Page immediately shut down those rumors by defending her friend and highlighting Kateb’s unwavering support for both of them. “Leah is more in our corner than anybody,” she told the crowd. “She don’t play about us. I love Leah, and Leah loves us. She always protects us in any way she can, even if that means utilizing her platform.” When discussing their Love Island USA experience, the duo acknowledged the unfortunate trend of Black women facing early elimination or romantic struggles on reality dating shows. Because of this, they entered the villa with lowered expectations; however, once they connected, they knew their experience would be different in a positive way. And they were right!  Not only did they form a strong bond with each other, but they also found love. Since leaving the island, Page, and partner Kordell Beckham have jointly collaborated with major brands like Spotify, Bumble, Topicals, and Dunkin’ Donuts, to name a few. When deciding which brands to collaborate with, Page revealed that she and Beckham ensure that the collaboration aligns with their morals before accepting any offers, ensuring it resonates with their personal brands. Craig, who has also worked with brands like Dunkin Donuts and Agua De Kefir, shared similar sentiments about how she and boyfriend Kenny Rodriguez agree on which partnerships to film together. Reflecting on their pre-reality TV lives, Craig shared her entrepreneurial journey as a lash business owner, real estate investor, personal trainer, and day trader. Page, a former ASL interpreter, educator, and media planner, encouraged audiences to explore their passions, as they never know where they might lead. Unlike most cases, Page and Craig didn’t have to choose between leaving with a romantic partner or financial security. They secured both. As their influence and popularity grow, Page and Craig are using their platform to inspire the next generation of creators. Recognizing the many challenges Black women face in the industry and in the face of adversity, they encourage aspiring influencers to stay true to themselves and embrace their individuality. Their main advice for rising entrepreneurs and influencers is to approach their endeavors with courage, creativity, and a dedicated commitment to their craft, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and embracing opportunities. “You’ve got to be consistent,” Craig said. “… You’ve got to take the risks in life. You only have one life to live. And if you fail, at least when you’re 90 years old, you can look back and be proud that you tried rather than live with regret.” By fearlessly stepping onto Love Island USA as two of the few brown-skinned women, Page and Craig challenged the historically negative portrayal of Black women on reality dating shows. Embracing their authentic selves, they set a new standard for future reality TV, proving that Black women can thrive and succeed without settling for less. Unlike most cases, Page and Craig didn’t have to choose between leaving with a romantic partner or financial security. They secured both, and we love to see it. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/why-do-i-get-rash-after-i-shower-48586073",
    "description": "Picture this: You just indulged in a long, relaxing shower, but when it comes time to towel off, you find that your skin didn't enjoy the experience as much as you did. Splotchy, red, irritated patches of skin crop up on various parts of your body, even though the only things you've come into contact with are soap and water. If this post-shower rash sounds familiar to you, there are a few common culprits to know about. Shower rashes can crop up for a myriad of reasons. It could be a sign of dry skin, overly hot water, or merely the result of using a dull razor blade. However, rashes can also stem from more complicated skin conditions like contact dermatitis, which may be triggered by a particular substance. To learn more about what causes skin rash after showering and help you figure out the best course of action, PS consulted with multiple dermatologists. Read on to see their advice for finding relief and avoiding post-shower rashes altogether. Experts Featured in This Article: Michele Green, MD, is a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist based in NYC. Marina Peredo, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist, a member of the Women's Dermatology Society, the American Medical Association, and the International Society of Dermatology. What Causes Skin Rash After Showering? There are several potential causes for skin rashes after showering, so pay attention to your triggers. Some of the most common causes include: Dry Skin: According to experts, rashes that develop in the shower are often a sign of extremely dry skin (and your water temperature might be making things worse). \"Xerosis cutis, which is dry skin, is one of the most prominent causes for the development of a rash after taking a shower,\" board-certified cosmetic dermatologist Michele Green, MD, tells PS. \"This is because a high water temperature can strip the skin of the natural oils that keep it healthy and moisturized, causing it to become itchy.\" Hot Water: This means that overly hot showers can also cause skin rash and irritation. \"If a rash develops after taking a shower due to the temperature of the water being too high, it is common to experience symptoms such as redness, swelling, itching, flaking, or even peeling,\" Dr. Green says.   Shaving Practices: When it comes to post-shower rashes, poor shaving habits are another common culprit. \"Shaving can cause folliculitis - the inflammation of hair follicles,\" board-certified dermatologist Marina Peredo, MD, FAAD, says.\"If the blade is dull, it will irritate the skin.\" Can Skin Conditions Cause Post-Shower Rash? Pre-existing skin conditions can also play a role in these post-shower rashes. Here are a few to know about (but always check with your healthcare provider for the best personalized medical advice): Contact Dermatitis: \"Irritant contact dermatitis can cause the skin to become dry from taking hot showers,\" Dr. Peredo says. This skin disorder in particular can become aggravated during a shower routine, do to the number of potential irritants. \"The combination of hot water, fragrant soaps, and skin that isn't moisturized can make skin red, dry, and cracked,\" Dr. Peredo says. Cholinergic Urticaria: Both Dr. Peredo and Dr. Green agree that cholinergic urticaria can also cause a rash after showering. \"Cholinergic urticaria is caused by nerve fibers in the sweat glands,\" Dr. Peredo says. \"If you take a hot shower, your body temperature goes up, which can create hives.\" Eczema: The soap you use and the temperature of the shower itself can also make rashes appear for those who have eczema. \"Eczema can be triggered by substances that come in contact with the skin, such as soaps, cosmetics, clothing, detergents, jewelry, or sweat,\" Dr. Green said. \"Someone who struggles with eczema may experience a flare after taking a hot shower.\" How to Treat a Shower-Induced Rash There are several ways to help prevent skin rashes after showering. Here are a few expert-approved tips to start, but consider seeking medical advice if symptoms persist or worsen over time: Change the Water Temperature: No one's saying you have to take an ice-cold shower, but adjusting the water temperature is a great place to start when trying to avoid rashes. \"Keep the temperature of the water on the cooler side to help keep away any unwanted itching, redness, or discomfort,\" Dr. Green advises. A cooler shower is also much better for those with certain skin conditions. \"Taking shorter, cooler showers are good for irritant contact dermatitis and cholinergic urticaria,\" Dr. Peredo says. Stay Moisturized: Keeping skin hydrated is another simple fix. \"If your skin is dry, it's important to use a rich moisturizer that can strengthen the natural barrier of your skin,\" Dr. Green says. Dr. Peredo suggests moisturizing skin while it's still wet, so the lotion or oil gets a better chance to absorb properly. For those with extremely dry skin, it's best to consult with your dermatologist about a more personalized treatment plan. \"In extreme cases of dry skin, your dermatologist can prescribe topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone cream to reduce redness and inflammation,\" Dr. Green said. \"Oral antihistamines like Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin may also be needed to help alleviate any pruritic symptoms associated with your dry skin.\" Cool Off: Ease symptoms of a shower rash by cooling your skin down afterward. \"Using a humidifier and a cold-water compress can help soothe symptoms of the rash that appear after taking a hot shower,\" Dr. Green says. How To Prevent Skin Rash After Showering Creating regular habits for more hydrated, moisturized skin will reduce dryness and lessen the chance of developing a rash after the shower. Best practices to implement into your routine include: Moisturizing Skin: \"Apply a soothing, unscented body lotion to skin twice a day to keep skin well moisturized and prevent irritation,\" Dr. Green says. \"If you have dry skin, be sure to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water throughout the day in order to maintain healthy and moisturized skin.\" Getting Better Soap: Swapping out your existing body soap, shampoo, or skin-care products might also help prevent shower rashes. \"Stick to gentle soaps that don't have a fragrance to ensure that your rash is not an allergic reaction to an ingredient in your hygiene products,\" Dr. Green suggests. \"Skip using skin-care products that contain potentially irritating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), retinols, or retinoids. These ingredients are designed to increase the rate of skin-cell turnover and can be a cause for dry skin.\" Switching Out Razor Blades: If rashes are developing after you shave in the shower, it could be time for a new razor. \"Replace dull razor blades with new ones to help prevent folliculitis,\" Dr. Peredo suggests. Drying Off Well: Be mindful of how you dry off after the shower. \"Instead of rubbing your skin with a towel to dry after showering, gently pat the skin with a towel to prevent irritation,\" Dr. Green says. - Additional reporting by Chandler Plante Taylor Plumstead is a PS contributor.
