If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Skin tints are having a major moment. Internet searches for the product have grown by 46% over the past year, and it’s not hard to see why they have become so popular: Skin tints are the perfect middle ground between skincare and makeup, delivering just enough pigment to even out skin tone without erasing your natural texture or features. Unlike full-coverage foundations that can turn streaky or patchy without the proper blending tools or techniques, skin tints are beginner-friendly and can be applied with your fingertips. In addition to hydrating and plumping benefits, many also offer sun protection. The latest launch to join the chorus of buzzy skin tints is Milk Makeup’s Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36. It has a handful of unique selling points, specifically some buzzy skincare ingredients like hydrating and oil-minimizing niacinamide, as well as soothing aloe. Besides this, the lightweight, gel-based formula grips the skin without feeling heavy or cakey. Given Milk’s track record of viral hits (the Cooling Water Jelly Tint and Hydro Grip Primer are firm favorites in our editors’ makeup bags), we couldn’t wait for this new release. In fact, this skin tint’s launch date in the UK market was moved forward due to the immense hype and demand. Read ahead as four editors — all with different skin types — put this skin tint to the test. DashDividers_1_500x100 Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36 Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer She tried: MILK Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36, in shade 7 Skin type: Oily “I’m a fan of Milk Makeup’s Hydro Grip, which I recently tested for our makeup primers roundup, so I had high hopes for the Hydro Grip Skin Tint. According to the brand, it’s infused with three molecular weights of hyaluronic acid to offer long-lasting hydration, along with sheer, buildable coverage. I was surprised at the amount of coverage this lent; on my skin, this more closely resembled a lightweight foundation vs a true skin tint. That’s all to say, a little goes a long way with this product, which isn’t a bad thing! “It lasted all day even without setting it with powder or mist, and my skin still showed through. It’s billed as a ‘gel skin tint’ (aka oily-skin friendly), and I liked how the texture was dewy without looking too greasy. Shade 7, described as a ‘medium neutral’, wasn’t an exact match to my olive skin, but was close enough that it blended in just fine. I’ll definitely use up the tube, but I actually found myself wishing it were more hydrating and sheer after some repeated use. It’s nothing that a little moisturizer mixed into the product can’t fix, though.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Venus Wong, senior writer She tried: MILK Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36, in shade 6 Skin type: Combination “My makeup drawer is a graveyard of abandoned skin tints. It takes a lot to impress me, and I’ll stop using a product if I dislike the finish (either too greasy or too dry) or if I notice any signs of pilling — when your makeup balls up and rolls off your skin. After rigorously testing this new launch for a week, I can confidently say that this is going to become a makeup bag staple. It has a smooth consistency that reminds me of honey, but it’s not sticky. Instead, it melts beautifully on my skin when I apply it with my fingertips. It does a great job of evening out my skin tone and blurring some of the redness from recent breakouts. I didn’t notice any creasing or pilling, and the texture stayed close to my skin and felt comfortable to wear. My skin stayed hydrated all day, thanks to smoothening squalane, an ingredient I often incorporate into my cold-weather skincare routine. “The product claims to offer buildable coverage that can last for up to 12 hours, and that was accurate in my case. I’ve tested this tint on two occasions when I was out and about from 9 a.m. to almost midnight, and I received compliments from friends on how nice my makeup looked well into the evening. In fact, a celebrity makeup artist told me that I had beautiful skin — when I only had a thin layer of this tint on my face — and I had barely any sleep the previous night. My only negative feedback is that a lot of product gushes out when you unscrew the lid, so it can get messy, but that’s a small issue when I’m receiving non-stop compliments on my skin!” DashDividers_1_500x100 Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer She tried: MILK Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36, in shades 11 and 12 Skin type: “Normal”, dry “I’ve seen so much buzz online about this skin tint and was excited to try it for myself. The formula promises lightweight, buildable coverage for a radiant, natural look and a dewy complexion. It has a nice consistency with a texture that’s neither too watery nor too dry on the skin. There’s nothing I dislike more than a skin tint that dries down too quickly, so I really like that you don’t have to rush to blend it immediately after application. “While I did find it hydrating and long-wearing, I was surprised by how overly wet it appeared on my skin, and it didn’t settle, even after some time had passed. As someone who doesn’t wear setting powder, it wouldn’t make sense for me to add it just to tone down the glow and shine. That said, the formula didn’t feel sticky or heavy; it was so lightweight that it felt like I wasn’t wearing anything. I’d say the coverage is light to medium, depending on how much is applied. “Another issue I ran into was finding the right shade. I initially tried shade 11 (deep tan, neutral to warm), but it was slightly too light. I then switched to shade 12 (deep, neutral to warm), which I’m wearing here. Looking at the brand’s swatches, there’s a noticeable jump between shades 12 and 13. I think I’d suit a shade somewhere in between (something a little lighter and less warm).” DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director She tried: MILK Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint, $36, in shade 4 Skin type: Oily, acne-prone “I discovered skin tints a few years ago and haven’t looked back to foundation since. While I occasionally experiment with it, lighter coverage suits my oily, acne-prone skin better. It’s more comfortable, doesn’t settle into healing breakouts, and avoids a cakey or dry finish. This tint strikes the perfect balance: It’s lightweight with a punchy pigment that tucks away redness, blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I agree with Karina — a single drop is enough to cover your entire face, making it good value for money. “The finish is neither too matte nor overly dewy, and I love the subtle radiance it gives my skin in this photo. Since I’ve been using it, I’ve received countless compliments, including one from a dermatologist! Even better, it doesn’t aggravate my acne, unlike others that contain oils and waxes for a glowy effect. I’m convinced my skin looks better since using this, thanks to the oil-reducing niacinamide and hydrating hyaluronic acid. My only issues? The nozzle leaks slightly, so be sure to close the lid tightly to prevent any makeup bag spillages. The line also offers only 15 shades, and while skin tints can be sheered out or built up, I’d love to see more darker shades added to the collection.” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chrome-french-tips-manicure-nail-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "There is no nail design more classic than the French manicure. The secret to its enduring success? A nail artist’s ability to reinvent the style time and again, keeping it feeling fresh, modern, and universally appealing. Whether it’s the tinted “French glow”, the pared-back invisible French, or the chic French fade, there are so many iterations of this classic style to choose from — and the latest look that’s about to take off is the chrome French.  Taking the classic white-tipped style and elevating it with a pearlescent sheen, it’s a versatile manicure that we predict will be everywhere this spring. Plus, if understated nails aren’t your thing, then the chrome French can be easily adapted with a colorful chrome tip or a tinted top coat. Ahead, we’ve rounded up 12 of our favorite chrome French nail looks to inspire your next manicure. Skinny Bronze View this post on Instagram A post shared by МАНИКЮР ПЕДИКЮР ОБУЧЕНИЕ КУРСЫ МИНСК ФРУНЗЕНСКАЯ (@sofia_nailsaesthetics) If you usually opt for a pared-back manicure but want to step outside your comfort zone, a skinny French tip is the perfect way to go. This creation by nail artist Sofia uses a chrome copper shade for an unexpected pop of color. Try Essie Metallics Nail Polish in Penny Talk, $10, to recreate the look. Bubblegum Sheen View this post on Instagram A post shared by NAILS OF LA (@nails_of_la) Everything about this French manicure has been beautifully executed by Nails of LA, but the tinted top coat takes the whole look to the next level. Try Essie Special Effects Top Coat in Astral Aura, $13, to recreate the iridescent pink shine. Ballerina French View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝐀𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐚 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐫𝐚 (@amaliatheodora_nailexpert) From the squoval shape to the pearly pink base and milky white tips, Amalia Theodora’s delicate French manicure is picture-perfect.  Pixie Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amber Peraino (@amberperaino) Make like manicurist Amber Peraino and add a little pixie dust magic to your French nails with a subtly shimmery top coat. Nails Inc. Better On Top Glazed Treatment, $9, is great if you’re doing your own nails. Sunshine Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Haidar (@heluviee) It looks like summer has arrived early with this yellow French look by Sarah Haidar. We love the contrast between the opaque sunshine tips and the natural, chrome-tinted base of this manicure.  Ultra Glow View this post on Instagram A post shared by МАНИКЮР ПЕДИКЮР ОБУЧЕНИЕ КУРСЫ МИНСК ФРУНЗЕНСКАЯ (@sofia_nailsaesthetics) The key to an expensive-looking manicure? Megawatt shine. Nail artist Sofia’s glowy French manicure certainly delivers in that department. Manicurists will use a chrome powder to get this finish in a salon, but the Essie Gel Couture Top Coat, $13, will give you a similar gleam at home. French Créme View this post on Instagram A post shared by Anaïs | Formatrice (@sianaanails) While a classic French manicure uses quite a sheer base coat, choosing something with a little opacity like this look by Anaïs means you can create a softer, creamier aesthetic. Sally Hansen’s Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Once Chiffon a Time, $12.99, is a beautiful creamy pink. Pink Shock View this post on Instagram A post shared by Roshni Jay | SW London nail artist (@byroshnijay) We talk a lot about French manicures being a minimalist nail look, but the beauty of French chrome is that you can experiment with different colors and finishes. Victoria’s electric pink tips are so striking, and the shimmering chrome top coat on the entire nail adds so much dimension. Milky Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kailin (@kaiklaws) So simple yet utterly stunning, this milky chrome manicure by nail artist Kailin proves that the smallest of switches — in this case, a chrome top coat — can take a classic French manicure to another level. Almond Pearl View this post on Instagram A post shared by margareth’s nails⋆.*ೃ✧ (@cheveron7) While this classic chrome manicure works for every occasion, the pearlescent finish and almond shape created by Margareth means we think this will be particularly popular during wedding season. Holographic Gleam View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dluxe Nails 💅 | Nail Design Experts (@dluxenailspa) An iridescent top coat is the key to the perfect French chrome manicure, as illustrated by this lustrous look at Dluxe Nails. Choose something like Sally Handen’s Miracle Gel Special Effects Top Coat in Unicorn, $12.99, for a holographic finish that changes color depending on how it catches the light. Floating French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah – Nail Artist 🤍 (@sarahsnailsx) A more maximalist approach to the French chrome look, nail artist Sarah combines an invisible French effect trimmed with metallic gold, a matte peach French tip, and a slight dusting of chrome in the center. More is more.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/dermaflash-device-review-47142132",
    "description": "Body and facial hair have been a source of self-consciousness for me for way too long, probably thanks to some unimportant boy in middle school making a comment about my arm hair. In my teens, I tried electrolysis on my upper lip (spoiler: not for the pain-averse), but as an adult - and as someone who writes about beauty for a living - I've discovered a slew of tools that remove unwanted hair easily, sans pain, and from the comfort of my own home. Among my favorites is the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool ($199). And because my job doesn't make it possible to gatekeep, I'm about to break it down in excruciating detail (sorry, but also, you're welcome) so you can decide if it's worth adding to your beauty routine, too. About Dermaflash Luxe+ Sonic Dermaplaning + Peach Fuzz Removal Tool It's the newest version of the dermaplaning device. It uses sonic vibration technology to gently remove peach fuzz, flakes, and dead skin cells. Built-in safety features help prevent nicks and cuts (which, unfortunately, isn't always the case with dermaplaning tools). It comes in multiple color options, so you can choose the one that brings you the most joy. What I Like About the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool Before I get into why this device is so good, let's start with what dermaplaning is. Simply put, dermaplaning is an exfoliation treatment that removes dead skin cells and peach fuzz using a scalpel-like tool or, in this case, a vibrating one. The result is, most famously, baby-soft skin but also better skin-care product absorption and a base so smooth that foundation glides on like butter. What it's not is your standard razor job. Shaving only removes hair, while dermaplaning goes deeper, sloughing off the top layer of dull, dead skin. Which brings me to this device in particular: While I've tried and enjoyed manual dermaplaners that rely solely on a scalpel for exfoliation, I had a hard time avoiding tiny nicks on my face. But with this one, I've never had a single cut or scrape, just smooth and radiant skin. That's likely thanks to its built-in safety features, including a protective guard around the blade and a microfine-edge blade that's gentler than scalpel-style dermaplaning tools. Plus, the easy-to-hold design makes it feel intuitive and effective, even if you're a beginner. One underrated perk is that the Dermaflash Luxe+ comes with a charging stand that doubles as a storage solution, which I love. And when it's not charging, it can stand upright on its own. Most manual dermaplaners I've used don't offer a good storage option, or can't stand upright, meaning they end up tossed in my makeup bag, collecting who-knows-what. But because this one has a designated (and aesthetically pleasing) home, combined with how glowy and smooth it leaves my skin, has earned a permanent spot on my vanity among my other ride-or-die beauty staples. How to Use the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool The process of using the Dermaflash Luxe+ is similar to other dermaplaning tools, except that it's electrically powered. For best results, the brand recommends washing your face with its Preflash Cleanser to remove surface oil, patting it dry, then holding the device at a 45-degree angle, pressing the power button, and gliding it over your face in short, feathery strokes. If you haven't dermaplaned before (or it's been a while), you'll see peach fuzz collecting on the edge of the device as you go. Personally, I like to flick the fuzz into the sink mid-session and keep going. Once you're done, I always apply a fragrance-free moisturizer which tends to calm down redness on my dry and somewhat sensitive skin, before tossing the razor blade. The eject button on the device makes this part weirdly fun; just point it at the trash, press, and it'll quite literally send it flying straight in. According to the brand, you can use it as often as once a week, but I've found that bi-weekly is more than enough to keep my peach fuzz (and the random smattering of dark hairs that have popped up) in check so my skin's as smooth as possible. What to Consider About the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool One thing to keep in mind about the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool is that some users have reported issues with charging or the device unexpectedly shutting off. Personally, I haven't run into this problem after countless uses, but I'd be remiss not to mention that it's happened to some. Another factor to consider is that the brand discourages reusing blades, meaning you'll need to replace them regularly. While Dermaflash offers a subscription service for refills, it's an added cost that might not be ideal for everyone. Where Is the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool Available to Shop? The Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool is available on Amazon, as well as directly from Dermaflash's website and major retailers like Ulta Beauty, Sephora, and Nordstrom, among others.

    "title": "Black Women Deserve Better Than the Carcinogens Found in Braiding Hair",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/carcinogens-braiding-hair-49430501",
    "description": "Although significant progress has been made, the Black experience in America has always been limited - and the options for hair care are no exception. Before the rise of the natural hair movement, there were very few brands that catered to a Black woman's natural texture. Many were using methods like hair relaxers and straighteners to feel beautiful, but these practices were soon linked to uterine cancer. And though beauty companies have since elevated their offerings to include cleaner formulations that serve as an alternative to toxic chemical treatments, the trend of products made for our community being harmful is far from over. The proof is in Consumer Reports' latest discovery, which found carcinogens in synthetic braiding hair. On Feb. 27, the company's researchers published a new study that revealed carcinogens (agents that can increase the risk of cancer) are present in 10 popular synthetic hair-braiding brands, including X-Pression, Sassy Collection, and Sensationnel. Scientists tested each brand for heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and revealed they were found in 100 percent of the samples. Lead, an ingredient that causes skin irritation, was also found in nine of the 10 products, which explains why many users (myself included) have experienced an itchy scalp after getting fresh braids. Three of the products tested also contained benzene, a known agent that causes acute myeloid leukemia. \"It is strictly regulated and discouraged to use in laboratories because of its potential to cause cancer,\" Dr. James E. Rogers, PhD, Consumer Reports' director and head of product safety testing, said in a statement. All the samples also contained a probable carcinogen, methylene chloride, which is recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a certified hazard that can lead to cancer of the lung and liver as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. @consumerreports Could “protective hairstyles” like synthetic braids do more harm than good? Our latest investigation revealed surprising findings in some hair available today. Learn more through the link in our bio. #hairtok #braidinghair #blackhairtiktok #protectivestyles ♬ original sound - Consumer Reports These discoveries have created an uproar, especially on TikTok, but the CR team conducted these tests for good reason. According to a statement, when Dr. Rogers and his team began the research in 2024, he had three goals: to determine whether the chemicals were present, whether you could measure them and how much of each one was present, and to find out if there was a way to determine the possible risk to consumers who use these products. He also has two daughters who use extensions to get their hair braided. \"I know firsthand that getting braids is part of the culture, and alternatives to synthetic hair aren't always accessible or affordable,\" he said. He accomplished his mission, but I can't lie that hearing this news is disheartening - especially as a Black woman who wears braids. And though it's not entirely shocking, it brings up many questions: Why aren't there more regulations around hair extension products? Why are Black people put on the back burner in beauty? More importantly, why isn't this being discussed more so there can be a resolution? Under CR's post on TikTok revealing the news, many users expressed their disappointment, commenting, \"the attack on black women through hair products \u0026 extensions is crazy,\" and \"this is a form of racism.\" There's some truth to these statements. Hair extensions are primarily used by Black people and sold in Black neighborhoods, making our people the target market for these products and heightening our exposure to such harmful toxins. It also makes it even clearer how little care there is for our demographic. With these products being (most times) the only affordable option at a local beauty supply, that speaks volumes. Even in 2025, Black people are still not a priority in beauty. This void in the market is unacceptable, especially with Black consumers representing 70 percent of the hair extension industry, according to market data. We use braids as forms of self-expression, creativity, and connection - and we shouldn't have to risk our health to get them. It's time to hold companies more accountable for delivering the high-quality hair we deserve. Our lives, quite frankly, depend on it.
