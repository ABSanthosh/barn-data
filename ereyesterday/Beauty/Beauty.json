    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Every year seems to get better and better when it comes to innovative nail trends, but 2025 has already proven to be something of a standout year for manicure inspiration. While maximalist designs like Amalfi-inspired “Italian summer” nails and 3D beach nails have been taking off for summer, we’ve spotted a simpler take on nail art emerging as one to watch for the season ahead. Enter: polka-dot nails.  Somewhat of a retro print, this summer’s polka-dot manicures balance ‘80s charm with a modern minimalism, taking a simple dot and transforming it into endless creative nail art looks. Whether it’s a monochromatic polka print or a rainbow of mismatched dots, the beauty of polka-dot nails is that they are so versatile. Plus, they pair nicely with basically every other trend out there, from French tips to neon hues. Ahead, find 11 of the very best polka-dot designs dotting our social feeds right now.  Princess Polka View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMIRI | biab nails, bespoke facials, lashes + brows | newcastle (@amiri_studio) Proving that polka dots are the perfect nail art look for minimalists, this manicure created at Amiri nail salon layers monochromatic polka dots over a groomed and glossy princess manicure for an ultra-polished look. Espresso Shots Our collective obsession with Pantone’s color of the year, mocha mousse, is continuing into the summer with Caselyn Grover’s coffee-toned manicure proving it. Try Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Clove, $14, to recreate it at home. Rainbow Brite View this post on Instagram A post shared by GetNailed. (@getnailedkelowna) Why pick just one color when you can have, well, 20? This riotously bright nail look by GetNailed salon is essentially a dopamine hit in manicure form. Obsessed. Chestnut Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by GIA ARTISTRY | Sydney Gel Artist 🍒 (@gia.artiistry) If you don’t fancy an all-over print, then polka-dot French tips are proving popular right now. This look by Gia Artistry uses a warm chestnut brown tone with bright white microdots for a wearable everyday manicure.  True Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Mismatched polka-dot manicures are a huge trend, but if you prefer something a little more subtle, then opt for two tonal colors rather than a clash, much like this blue look by nail content creator Melanie Graves. Try OPI Shore Is Something!, $12.99, with Essie Gel Couture in Caviar Bar, $13. ‘80s Excess View this post on Instagram A post shared by HATTONNAILS (@elisahatton) An homage to the more-is-more aesthetic of the ‘80s, where polka-dot power two-pieces once reigned supreme, this jewelry manicure by Hattonnails embraces opulence in the best way. Quiet luxury? We don’t know her. Milky Sorbet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emma Maughan (@___embeauty) Sorbet shades are big news for summer 2025, so we expect to see more gelato-toned polka dots like this one by nail artist Emma Maughan. Dotted Borders View this post on Instagram A post shared by @beautybyabigailjessica Rather than going for all-over print, nail tech @beautybyabigailjessica has created a fun polka-dot-bordered manicure to frame some cute floral nail art. A fun and unexpected way to wear spots. Mix \u0026 Match View this post on Instagram A post shared by VIBE • NEWCASTLE, NSW (@vibe_nailartistry) The eclectic mix of French tips, negative space and pops of red makes this striking set created at Newcastle’s Vibe nail salon the ultimate cool-girl polka-dot manicure. Jelly Dots View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shannon Elias (@elias.nails) Between soap nails and juicy nail tints, it’s clear that sheer and dewy manicures have dominated this year. So it makes perfect sense for nail artist Shannon Elias to opt for a pink jelly base for this microscopic polka-dot design. Essie Jelly Gloss in Blush Jelly, $13, makes the perfect at-home color for this look. Dalmatian Spots View this post on Instagram A post shared by SYDNEY’S #1 NAIL \u0026 BEAUTY SALON ♡ (@acenails_andbeauty) Like Cruella de Vil in manicure form, this stiletto-shaped nail look by Ace Nails and Beauty is seriously glamorous.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available to shop on July 10 at Levi'sCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available to shop on July 10 at Charlotte Tilbury Uniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available to shop on July 10 at UniqloCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaHuda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula. Our favorites are Cinnamon, a rosy taupe shade, and Soft Nude for a \"your lips but better\" look.

The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/higher-dose-red-light-mask-review-49449932",
    "description": "Being a shopping editor is almost synonymous with being a product guinea pig - especially for beauty. I've had my fair share of trying the best (and weirdest) products approved by TikTok and celebrities, but I still had yet to try an LED mask. I've seen them everywhere, from my FYP to my Instagram feed, but being a minimal skin-care routine girl, I never gave into the hype (having relatively clear skin might have something to do with it). But alas, I've been influenced and finally gave into temptation with the Higher Dose Red Light Mask ($349) - and I get the hype now. There are so many LED masks on the market, so of course, I was super careful when choosing one for my first experience. This one from Higher Dose is not only TikTok-approved, but it's FDA-cleared, which gave me more peace about using it. Although I've only been using it for a little over a month, I've noticed even more brightness in my skin - so much so that I get compliments almost daily, and I'm highly considering going through most of the summer without foundation. Keep reading for my full review and find out why this mask is worth the investment. About the Higher Dose Red Light Mask The red light works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, boost collagen and elastin, reduce redness, and boost your mood. It comes with three straps for a secure fit, a controller and charging cable, extra plugs for international outlets, a pair of black goggles, and a dust bag for storage and traveling. Its dimensions and light features include: Bulbs: 66 LED bulbs; LEDs: 132 LEDs (two per bulb); RED: 630nm; NIR: 830nm; Irradiance: 50 mW/cm2 (power density of the LED lights); Time: 10 minutes or 20 minutes; and Size: 295mm (width) x 216mm (height). What I Like About the Higher Dose Red Light Mask All jokes aside, I love everything about the Higher Dose Red Light Mask. Admittedly, the red light is something to get used to (I definitely saw stars after closing my eyes first use), but its benefits surely make up for the temporary photopsia. With such a busy schedule, it's very rare that I do more than my usual 10 to 15 minute skin-care routine, but using this mask forces me to pause and relax. You can either use it by plugging it into the wall or through its cordless feature, but I love using it plugged in. Whether it's for the recommended time or a little longer, the red light is super relaxing and allows you to have some time to yourself - completely uninterrupted. Not to mention, it keeps me completely focused while watching this controversial season of \"Love Island USA.\" Apart from its calming abilities, I love how much my skin glows after using this mask. While I have relatively clear skin, it is sensitive so there are moments when I notice a bit of redness, but I'd never found a product to conquer the issue before. After my first use, I noticed a significant difference in my complexion and texture, and my skin even felt more refreshed - as if I had just gotten a luxurious facial. It also helped to clear some stubborn marks that pimples had left behind, and I can tell the progress will only continue. You can see the difference in my skin just one month apart. How to Use the Higher Dose Red Light Mask While it might look complex, the Higher Dose Red Light Mask is easy to use. It comes fully charged straight out of the box, and you can simply put it on after doing your usual cleansing routine. You can adjust the mask over your face using its side and top velcro straps (I rarely use the top because of my hair), and choose your time of either 10 or 20 minutes. And that's it - you're an LED mask pro! What to Consider Before Trying the Higher Dose Red Light Mask It's worth noting that the battery life on this mask isn't as long as other models. You get about three uses before having to recharge it, so I'd recommend charging it overnight. It's also a bit pricey, but the results make it worth the investment. Where Is the Higher Dose Red Light Mask Available? The Higher Dose Red Light Mask is available on the brand's website and at Sephora.

The best (and perhaps most overwhelming) part about this type of ink is that the options for tattoo quotes are essentially endless.
