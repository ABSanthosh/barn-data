    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Growing out my nails has never been my strong suit. Until recently, I could barely make it a few weeks before breaking one while doing something as untaxing as zipping up my jeans, let alone facing every nail’s nemesis: the ring pull on a can of Coke.  To give them a fighting chance, I’d take skin, hair, and nail supplements like they were going out of fashion, wear gloves while carrying out even the smallest of chores, and refrain from using my nails as tools to open my mail (we all do it). Frustratingly, none of those things worked. What I needed was some expert guidance.  Over the past year, I’ve collected tips and tricks from nail technicians, dermatologists, and even TikTok’s manicure obsessives. But I won’t gatekeep. These are the six simple, and most importantly, affordable, pieces of advice I was given for longer, stronger nails that actually worked.   I chose cuticle oil over nail hardeners Dr. Dana Stern, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Dr. Dana says that the cuticle is the nail’s natural protective seal. When it becomes dry and dehydrated, it’s compromised: “When this happens, water and moisture can enter the nail unit,” she says. “This causes all sorts of problems including redness and swelling,” and eventually, the nail could grow irregularly: “Think white patches, bumps, thickening, and discoloration,” she says.  While most nail technicians will trim or remove dead cuticle skin during a manicure for aesthetic reasons, using cuticle oil still offers multiple benefits for the remaining skin surrounding your nails as I’ve discovered: “Regular application of cuticle oil helps maintain hydration,” says Dr. Zainab Laftah, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson. “Hydration benefits both the nail and surrounding skin by reducing brittleness, enhancing nail health, supporting healthy nail growth, and preventing infections,” she adds.  Unlike nail hardeners, which can make nails a little too hard, session manicurist Ami Streets says that cuticle oil keeps nails flexible, withstanding everyday wear and tear. “Cuticle oil is the best product for growing nails — and my most recommended item to add to your beauty routine,” she says.  Dr. Dana recommends her Nourishing Cuticle Oil, $18, with jojoba oil and indigo naturalis, a Chinese plant known to repair and strengthen the skin barrier. Complete with a handy roller ball for easy, drip-free application, it’s an oil I can vouch for having used it down to the very last drop. Another of my favorites is Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail \u0026 Cuticle Oil, $7.49, with moisturizing vitamin E and a dream team of nourishing plant oils. Streets also loves L’Occitane Shea Nail \u0026 Cuticle Oil, $22, which is twice as moisturizing as the impressive hand cream in the same collection, and Jessica Phenomenoil, $20.40, another oil we’ve both used up.     Besides ingredients, exactly how you use your cuticle oil matters, too. Streets says that a single drop on each cuticle is ample — and it’s best applied at night to give the oil time to absorb. Not only does cuticle oil hydrate deeper than hand creams, but Streets and Dr. Dana say that the massaging motion could help stimulate circulation and promote nail growth, too.   I switched from traditional gel to builder gel — or BIAB Not all gel nail polish is created equal. On my brittle nails, most would chip quickly. I’d then pick off the polish and damage my nails even further. It wasn’t until a fellow beauty journalist recommended Builder in a Bottle — also known as BIAB or builder gel — that my nails grew long and strong. I’m almost a year in and I haven’t had a single chip or break. They’re growing so quickly, that I always ask my nail technician to cut them down.  “Builder in a Bottle is a specific type of gel that lends strength and structure to natural nails,” explains Streets. Thanks to its stronger base, Streets says that it’s a great option for those who want to reinforce their nails while trying to grow them, as they can last up to three weeks. Another great thing about BIAB is that it can be infilled, says Streets. This involves getting the grown-out gap near your cuticles filled in with more gel, rather than having to fully remove the polish each time. “This allows natural nails to maintain growth,” adds Streets, but she recommends a maximum of two to three repeated infills before having a short break to keep your nails healthy and happy. Thanks to BIAB’s harder, more durable finish, Dr. Dana says that it not only serves as a “protective armor” for nails, but it typically has a forgiving, less damaging removal process by soaking off, so it tends to be more advantageous than other nail enhancements like acrylics. “I’ve seen patients who use BIAB and have very healthy nails in comparison to my patients who wear acrylics and do constant soak-off gels,” she says, adding that BIAB’s durable nature also makes it a good option for nail biters.  I addressed my vitamin D deficiency When a blood test revealed that my vitamin D levels were low, I began taking a 2000 IU vitamin D supplement daily alongside my trusty omega-3, 6, and 9. While there are multiple health benefits to both, Dr. Laftah points out that they could have additional advantages for nails: “Addressing a vitamin D deficiency can improve nail health as low levels can result in brittle nails,” she tells me. Interestingly, one small study suggests that hapalonychia — a condition that causes nails to become soft and prone to breakage — has been associated with vitamin D deficiency. As for omega-3? “Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet may also benefit nails by providing essential nutrients that support overall nail strength and integrity,” Dr. Laftah says. However, Dr. Dana points out that no robust studies prove that vitamins or supplements benefit nail health. However, since nails are made of keratin (a type of protein) she suggests that if your diet lacks sufficient protein, it may be worth considering protein supplementation to improve the condition of your nails. Streets also advises incorporating more protein into your diet and drives home the importance of staying hydrated.  Before adding supplements to your routine, consult your doctor to ensure they’re safe and suitable for you. I took hand cream very seriously Previously, I’d only use lotion when my hands were uncomfortably dry and on the verge of cracking. Over the past few months, though, I’ve taken moisturizing very seriously, and I’m convinced that keeping my hands adequately hydrated throughout the day has also benefited my nails.  I was right. For clients who want longer, stronger nails, Dr. Laftah recommends moisturizing regularly to maintain hydration. “Using a nourishing and hydrating hand cream can help,” adds Streets. “Not only does it keep skin in a supple and soft condition, but it can also act as a protective barrier against environmental stressors,” — like cold weather. Streets says that dry, cracked skin and cuticles can lead to infection or weak nail growth, so consistent daily use of a moisturizing product is essential.  If you want fast hydration without the sticky feel, I love Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Hand Cream, $15. If your hands are especially dry, my all-time favorite hand lotion is L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream, $43. The silky soft feeling sticks around for hours — even post-hand-wash. “On application, make sure you use a massaging motion,” advises Streets. “It can help to boost blood flow to hands and cuticles, which supports new nail growth even further.” I started using a glass nail file Dr. Dana believes that many nail files, particularly traditional, rough emery boards, can be too abrasive for natural nails, potentially causing “microscopic tears” that lead to splits and breakage. That’s where glass or crystal nail files come in. On days when I gave my nails a break from BIAB, I’d file away rough edges with a glass file, which I’m certain is kinder on nails.  “In contrast [to emery boards], glass creates a perfectly smooth, split-free edge to the nail,” says Dr. Dana, who uses the Precision Glass File, $15. Likewise, Streets believes that a glass nail file is a worthwhile investment for at-home manicures: “They provide a finer and more controlled filing experience, and the smooth edges help seal the keratin layers at the nails edge, preventing splitting, peeling, and snagging that can occur when using a rougher emery board.” What’s more, Streets points out that glass nail files are non-porous and can be washed or sanitized between uses. Lastly, I exfoliated my nails With its ability to exfoliate the skin, leaving it smoother and brighter, glycolic acid is a staple in many skincare routines, but it can benefit your natural nails, too. In between BIAB appointments, I’ve often applied a glycolic acid toner to my nails and cuticles using a cotton swab, then followed with a glug of cuticle oil. The result? Fewer flakes and a stronger, smoother canvas for nail polish. If you’d rather not DIY, try the Dr. Dana Nail Renewal System, $30, a once-weekly, 3-step nail system that boasts glycolic acid, a nail primer, and a hydrating gel-oil to reveal healthy, hydrated, and shiny nails, fast. “It’s perfect for brittle, peeling, weak nails, post-gel damage, or if you simply want a gorgeous, healthy-looking shine without having to go to the salon,” says Dr. Dana.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/aimee-lou-wood-imperfect-teeth-personal-essay-49434966",
    "description": "Growing up in an environment with a parent who negatively commented on my appearance led to my inevitable self-doubt. My constant swirling thoughts told me that anything less than flawless is not to be tolerated. For most of my life, I struggled with my appearance - specifically my teeth. They had a mind of their own. Friends would attempt to make a discrete comment, saying things like: Why don't you just get braces? What about Invisalign? And I would think to myself, what an odd thing to say to someone. Perhaps it was genuine curiosity, but it came across as an unnecessary comment that only fueled my anxiety. I began to overanalyze my teeth at every waking moment. I attempted to accept that I did not have straight teeth and that it was not a big deal. If supermodels of the '90s could have gaps in their smiles, then mine wasn't an issue, either. But those mantras never stuck; my anxiety would pull down her glasses and giggle, saying, You're wrong. A significant turning point in how I viewed my teeth was when I saw season three of \"The White Lotus.\" I was expecting whimsical guests and a lavish hotel in Thailand; what I didn't expect was for the actor Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea, to turn my view of myself upside down (and eventually, right side up). Image Source: Courtesy of Lauren Levesque Upon watching, I quickly realized that Wood did not have perfect pearly whites, and she was strikingly ethereal in her beauty. Wood promptly became a fascination that I needed to explore and I quickly learned that she deemed herself \"rebellious\" in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter for not having work done to her teeth, such as getting veneers, like so many celebrities do. She was authentically herself - a disposition that seems lost in current culture today. By witnessing this simple act of protest, the teeth shame that I had been battling my entire life was quickly evaporating. Wood's expression of coming to terms with her \"weirdness\" and how that alone can be channeled into her superpower has made me re-analyze how I view my teeth. The take is refreshing, especially when society takes any opportunity to comment on a woman's appearance. Wood's confidence about her teeth and who she is deeply struck a cord within me and has made me feel that my \"imperfect smile\" is perfect for me.

    "description": "It's no secret that the world of skin care is complex. There are so many options and factors to be educated on to make sure you are choosing the right products for you. The amount of research that goes into creating a skin-care product and testing its efficacy takes years. Most of the progress and discovery in skin-care science, such as ingredient discovery, is thanks to medical-grade skin-care companies like the notable SkinCeuticals, the dermatologist favorite EltaMD, and Obagi Medical. The formulations are potent - usually a step below, if not comparable to, prescription products, and they are backed by testing and clinical trials. This type of skin-care is usually sold exclusively in dermatologists' offices, medical spas and clinics, and at Dermstore. This retailer houses brands at the forefront of research and innovation, and that's often reflected in the price. However, your whole routine doesn't have to be medical-grade to reap the benefits. We highly suggest having one to three medical-grade products maximum in your routine - the rest can be affordable finds from the drugstore or department stores. Luckily, Dermstore is the one-stop-shop for all your medical-grade shopping needs, and even hosts an Anniversary sale every year, where you can get the below picks at an irresistible price. We curated the best-of-the-best skin-care products from Dermstore that are worth the splurge and dermatologist-recommended. Looking to invest in a quality vitamin C serum? The Obagi Professional-C 20% is a potent option and is currently on sale. If you're on the hunt for a serum that can do it all, the pricey SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum is marked down, and perfect for anti-aging, acne control, and brightening. Ahead, we rounded up our top medical-grade favorites and the ones to snag from Dermstore to instantly elevate your skin care game.
