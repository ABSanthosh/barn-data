    "description": "Early access for Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale is officially on, and you know what that means: epic deals on designer fashion, chic home decor, and so, so much more. (Don’t worry if you’re not a cardholder – the sale opens to the public on July 12.) However, it’s my professional belief that the most compelling deals happen to be in the beauty space — not that I'm biased or anything.Unlike any other beauty event, the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is packed with sale-exclusive value sets on makeup, skincare, hair, fragrance, and beyond that you can only 1) find at Nordstrom and 2) shop for the duration of the sale. We're talking rarely (if ever) discounted brands like Charlotte Tilbury, Dyson, Westman Atelier, and Byredo, among many other treasures. For your haul, we've cherry-picked the 28 most stellar (and likely to sell out fast) deals that you’d be remiss not to cart ASAP.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/kim-kardashian-dollop-bangs-49451110",
    "description": "Image Source: Steve Eichner/WWD via Getty Images We'll be honest: we almost didn't recognize Kim Kardashian when she was recently photographed in Paris, France. During Paris Haute Couture Week, Kardashian was seen roaming the streets with a completely new hairstyle. Gone was the ultra-long, super wavy hair we saw at the Bezos/Sanchez wedding just the week before. Instead, the \"The Kardashians\" star was seen sporting a lob haircut with a severe side part and dollop bangs. Although the reality star is known for changing up her look almost every time she goes outside, she was seen on two occasions with the same retro-inspired swoop bang. This has us wondering, could this be a more permanent look? Dollop bangs, also known as kiss curls, were everywhere at the 2025 Met Gala, and they've been seen on an array of celebrities, from Bad Bunny to Sydney Sweeney. \"[It's] a style of fringe where the bangs are cut and styled with a rounded shape that lifts slightly away from the forehead, resembling a dollop of whipped cream or mousse,\" says Los Angeles and New York City-based colorist and stylist Jacob Sirianno. \"They're not flat, blunt, or overly thick but instead maintain a sense of fullness and lightness. This gives a fun, retro-inspired vibe.\" Kardashian's dollop bangs added the perfect touch to her bouncy, shoulder-length lob, which featured rounded, flipped-in ends. If you're thinking of trying the trend for yourself, know that you don't have to chop your hair to achieve the same result. Instead, you can opt to style a section of hair with gel or a hair cream to get a faux bang that looks similar to what celebrities have been sporting lately. If you're in the mood for more inspiration, take a closer look at Kardashian's dollop bangs, ahead.
