    "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be spotted on the city’s street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we’ve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‘90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles. Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC’s bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year — and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The “kicked” bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle spotted on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut — seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano — nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.

    "description": "January is that curious month where our new-year ambitions collide with the reality of winter. Many of us started off with grand plans to transform our lives — whether it was working out more or finally committing to daily journaling — but when it’s freezing outside, staying bundled up on the couch suddenly feels like the more reasonable choice. The anonymous data gathered from our shopping stories shows that our readers also felt this tug-of-war between lofty aspirations and the urge to hibernate.Exhibit A: The surge in running shoes and workout clothes. Clearly, many of you were determined to keep moving despite the temptation to stay indoors (honestly, kudos). At the same time, skincare buys also saw a major uptick, signaling a collective resolve to invest in self-care during the colder, drier months. These shopping trends prove that the start of 2025 was as much about nurturing our goals as it was about embracing comfort.

    "title": "LED and Cryo? This Mask Has Both - and It’s 100% Worth the Splurge",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/shark-cryoglow-led-face-mask-review-49427220",
    "description": "While testing a new mascara or lipstick will never get old, I get especially giddy when I get my hands on a new beauty tool. From microcurrent devices to smart hairdryers, there are a lot of innovative gadgets out there that bring with them professional-quality results - and I want to trial them all. The latest high-tech tool to make its way across my desk - and into my routine permanently - is the new Shark Beauty CryoGlow LED Face Mask ($350). How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. While I'm a long-time user of LED therapy and have a few at-home red light masks in my possession already, this new device from Shark Beauty also includes cryotherapy benefits, a combination I've never seen before in my many years as a beauty editor. After trying it for over three weeks, it really knocked my socks off. Allow me to explain. About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask This LED face mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. It features cryo technology in the undereye area that can be used during every LED treatment or on its own. It's cordless, allowing you to move freely during your treatment. The mask comes with a rechargeable smart remote that allows you to select your program and view your progress. It contains four treatment settings: Better Aging for collagen and wrinkles, Skin Clearing for acne, Skin Sustain to maintain your results, and Undereye Revive for depuffing. It was developed with dermatologists, is backed by clinical testing, and is FDA-cleared. What I Like About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask I've used my fair share of LED masks over the years, so when I first heard Shark Beauty was releasing its own version, I figured it'd be more of the same. This is not to say it wouldn't be great, but I didn't expect it to be very different from its competitors. Boy, was I wrong. Shark's CryoGlow is the smartest LED mask I've tried thus far. Humor me while I nerd out a little: The mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. What that means is each bulb has the capability to produce red, blue, or infrared light, allowing for full-face coverage no matter what treatment you choose. Many other masks on the market have different bulbs for different light settings, which means, for example, you could be getting red light from half of the bulbs in the mask and blue light from the other half, allowing for more gaps between treatment areas. The fit of the mask is also worth applauding. The hard shell features padding and an adjustable head strap meant to mimic the fit of snow goggles, which is to say it's super comfortable and secure. While some masks are flexible and sit flush with the face, this one is designed to hover at the perfect distance from your face to allow for better light coverage. Now, onto the super advanced remote that comes attached to the mask. The small controller features a wheel-style button that allows you to power on/off the device and toggle through the treatments. There's a small screen that displays each one, along with the key benefits and length of treatment. There's also an option to view your progress and see how many days you've used the mask. Being the impatient girl I am, I love that the remote shows you how much time is left while you're using it. The four treatments have you covered no matter what your skin goals are. Better Aging, which lasts six minutes and uses red and infrared light, promotes collagen and minimizes wrinkles; Skin Clearing is eight minutes long using blue, red, and infrared, to kill acne-causing bacteria; the four-minute Skin Sustain option uses red, blue, and infrared light and is designed to be used after you complete eight weeks of one of the other treatments to keep up the benefits you'll have seen. Lastly, you have Undereye Revive, which is a 5- to 15-minute treatment to depuff the undereye area; it has three temperature settings and can be used alone or coupled with any of the other LED treatments. I like to use the antiaging treatment for overall skin maintenance every day, while I reserve the acne treatment for whenever I'm breaking out. No matter what treatment I'm doing, though, I turn on the undereye cooling treatment, which helps with inflammation and puffiness. It feels heavenly and leaves me looking refreshed when I'm done. How to Use the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Using the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is simple. First, you'll want to ensure the head straps are properly fitted so the mask stays on while you walk around, should you choose to do so. From there, power on the device by long-pressing the button on the remote and scrolling to toggle to your desired treatment. The mask will instantly light up, and you'll hear a low fan running to ensure it doesn't overheat (don't worry, it's not too loud; you'll still be able to hear the TV or TikTok). You should only use it on clean, dry skin sans any skin-care products. Because of this, I usually reach for it either first thing in the morning or at the end of the day, after washing my face but before I do the rest of my routine. I'll use it while I'm scrolling on TikTok or cleaning my apartment. What to Consider Before Trying the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Though you may notice a subtle glow to your skin after using the mask just once, it's important to keep in mind that real results take time. Consistency is key with LED therapy, and the more you use it, the better your skin will get. Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Worth the Splurge? LED masks are expensive, and the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is no different. However, the brand did manage to make its device cheaper than many other options on the market. At $350, it's still a splurge, but it's well worth the price tag, in my opinion. It allows you to get a medspa-quality treatment (which can run a couple of hundred dollars for a single facial) from the comfort of your home, and if you use the mask regularly, it'll eventually pay for itself. Where Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Available? The Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is available on the brand's website. Rating:",

    "description": "First things first: I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan. I know, I know - it's blasphemous to all the Swifties reading this, but it's true. I like roughly two of her songs, I'm not huge on her outfits, and for the most part I abhor her makeup choices. (Sorry, I don't look good in a red lip.) All that being said, imagine my surprise when I saw Swift sporting an accessory I knew I wanted to try immediately: the Fazit Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16). At an Oct. 7 Kansas City Chiefs game, Swift wore the freckles while watching and supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. She paired her silver and gold freckles with a bold red lip and some intense cat-eye eyeliner, and I have to admit, although I'm not usually a fan of her looks, this one hit a little differently. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Fazit Glitter Freckles and find out why they're going to be my number one accessory for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. About the Fazit Glitter Freckles This product is a glitter makeup patch that can be applied like a temporary tattoo. The glitter freckles come in gold, silver, and rose gold as well as brown. They last up to three days and can be removed with makeup remover or cleansing balm. They come in packages of six, 12, or 18. What I Like About the Fazit Glitter Freckles I'm a retired rave baby, and I think these freckles make the perfect accessory for a concert, fun night out on the town, or special event. I recently went to a birthday party in Joshua Tree, and I loved how these glitter freckles elevated my look. I'm acne-prone, and these didn't break me out whatsoever, which is another plus. I also love that they come in gold, silver, and rose gold, because I snagged one of each - so I can always match up my freckles to my jewelry. I'm planning on going to an EDM concert later this month, and you can bet these freckles are going to come along with me. They're super cute and they're so easy to apply, you really can't go wrong. Plus, with the Super Bowl happening on Feb. 9, they're the easiest way to add a little something extra to my look without breaking the bank. How to Use the Fazit Glitter Freckles To start, the brand recommends peeling off the backing and placing the patch sticky side down on your face, wherever you want the freckles to appear. Next, wet a towel and dab the patch for 60 seconds. From there, you can peel off the patch. It should last for 24-48 hours. To remove, the brand says you can use makeup wipes, micellar water, or an oil-based cleanser. It notes not to scrub hard, and instead to wash gently in a circular motion. When trying these for the first time, I followed the instructions exactly and found they worked just as described. I put them on after finishing my entire face of makeup. They were honestly extremely easy to get off as well. All I needed was the tiniest bit of cleansing balm to work them off my face, and then I double-cleansed with a gentle face wash to remove everything else. What to Consider Before Trying the Fazit Glitter Freckles I would start out by doing one half of the freckles, then moving to the center, and then doing the other half on the other cheek. I found that it was easier to make sure all of the freckles were in place when doing it piece by piece rather than trying to get each side wet all at once. Where the Fazit Glitter Freckles Are Available The Fazit Glitter Freckles are available directly on the brand's website.
