    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/wolf-cut-haircut-trend-48379219",
    "description": "We don't need to tell you that shag and mullet haircuts have been all the rage for the last year - celebrity examples like Rihanna, Keke Palmer, Debby Ryan, Billie Eilish, and Miley Cyrus are all the proof you need - but a new type of haircut called the \"wolf cut\" is threatening to eclipse both of those styles, and it's all thanks to TikTok. The wolf cut haircut is everywhere right now, but what exactly is it, and why is everyone so obsessed? Keep reading to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Sally Hershberger is a celebrity hairstylist, founder of hair-care brand Sally Hershberger 24K, and a salon owner. What Is a Wolf Cut? If the shag and the mullet had a baby, you'd have the wolf haircut. It combines the length and volume of a mullet with the choppy layers of a shag for a very wild and edgy new look. \"[It's] a softer take on the mullet,\" celebrity hairstylist Sally Hershberger says. \"It's a really cool, lived-in, sexy look that has lots of movement and layers.\" The main difference between the updated \"wolf cut\" and your classic mullet is where the layers sit. Instead of the style being layer-heavy only at the top of the head, they're spread throughout. Although people on TikTok are cutting their hair themselves to get the look at home, a professional hairstylist will help you get the shape just right. Although the wolf cut only recently hit the mainstream consciousness here, the style has been a long-time favorite in South Korea. Many K-pop stars - namely Choi Beomgyu of the band Tomorrow X Together (TXT) - have worn the choppy, short-in-the-front, long-in-the-back hairstyle for quite some time. How to Get the Wolf Haircut At the salon, ask your stylist for a wolf cut and come prepared with reference photos. \"Ask your stylist for lots of shaggy, wavy layers,\" says Hershberger. \"Depending on the look you want, you can also go for bangs or curtain bangs, which both look really cool with this cut.\" She emphasizes that the trend can be as dramatic as you want it to be, meaning you can ask your stylist for even more texture for a true wolf-like look or keep it on the subtler side. How to Style a Wolf Cut Wolf cut hair isn't difficult to style but it does require some daily maintenance. Should you choose to leave it as is, depending on your hair type, the style won't have as much volume and may fall flat. If you have straight hair, curling it or blowing it out roughly will help give it more shape. If your hair is already curly or wavy, you can let it air dry. In terms of styling products, look for volume-boosting formulas and products that will add texture. Try sea salt sprays, texturizing pomades, and wavy-enhancing creams, and work them into your hair with your fingertips. We recommend the Not Your Mother's Sea Salt Spray ($10), the IGK Beach Club Soft Styling Paste ($25), and the Ouidad Curl Shaper Bounce Back Reactivating Mist ($24). To refresh the style throughout the day, simply tousle it with your fingertips to rough it up. Check out more examples of the wolf cut hairstyle ahead.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/dua-lipa-flower-nails-49446891",
    "description": "Image Source: Cindy Ord/MG24/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue It's not often that we spot a celebrity-loved manicure that we can easily re-create at home, but Dua Lipa is here to deliver. Not only is her latest manicure one of the easiest to DIY (more on that later), but it also drums up major feelings of nostalgia. If you went to the nail salon even once in the early aughts, chances are you got the exact flower manicure she's currently sporting during a trip to Italy. Obviously, the nail art space has evolved a lot since then, but there's something so sweet about Lipa's fresh take on this vintage (can we call the early 2000s vintage?) design. Even if you never got your nails professionally done as a kid, you probably came across this nail-art book at sleepovers teaching you exactly how to achieve this floral mani at home. That book, along with magazines, were the original source for nail inspiration long before Instagram was a thing. If you didn't try your hand at it when you were younger, now's your chance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by DUA LIPA (@dualipa) Lipa used just two colors to create hers: black and white. The color palette automatically elevates the look. She has two flowers on each fingernail, with one on the very edge and bleeding off the side of the nail. This allows the design to work on both shorter natural nails or nail extensions. How to Re-create the Look If you want to re-create this look at home, you'll need a base shade of your choice. We recommend something neutral like a pale pink or beige or even just your natural nail with a clear coat on top. Then, you'll need two more shades to create the flower designs. It's helpful to pick contrasting colors to help the different parts of the flower stand out. We love the O.P.I. Opaque Dark Black ($12) and the O.P.I. Opaque Light White ($12) polishes because they're not runny or see-through. Then, you'll need a tool with a rounded end to create the petals and middle of the flower. You can grab Art Dotting Tools ($6) on Amazon, or just use the tip of a bobby pin. Start by creating the center of the flower in one shade. To make the petals, first wipe off your tool and switch to a different shade to make the five dots surrounding the center. Yes, it really is as easy as you remember.

    "title": "10 Summer Perfume Trends That Radiate Good Vibes, According To Experts",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-perfume-fragrance-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "There’s something about the arrival of summer that calls for a clean slate — and a new perfume to go with it. If you ask us, switching up your fragrance is one of the easiest ways to usher in a shiny new season. Whether you’re looking to swap out your signature scent or simply want to grow your fragrance collection, this summer’s perfume trends offer something for every taste and budget. Ahead, we asked fragrance experts to share the trends that will shape this summer and beyond. Here’s what they predict — and where to shop them. DashDividers_1_500x100 Salted Scents Lee Howes, Lush fragrance category lead, predicts that salty, marine scents will dominate summer, providing an instantly refreshing antidote to hot and humid weather. But don’t underestimate them, says Howes: “They can either be bold and brash or subtle and sensual,” he says. “For a jolt of refreshment, Dirty Perfume, $55, or Dirty Body Spray, $42, offers an instant blast of cool herbal notes with spearmint, sandalwood, and thyme.” For something even more alluring, Howes adds that Salty Body Spray, $50, utilizes floral neroli and rose, as well as warming and grounding oudh, plus salted notes that smell like “warm skin after you’ve just stepped out of the ocean.” This, he says, is one of Lush’s best-kept secrets.  Also try Oscar Emil Sex On The Beach, $169, with salty cocoa, creamy sandalwood, and skin-like musk, and ‘Ôrebella Salted Muse, $72, with sea salt accord, zingy pink pepper, and comforting lavender. If you’d rather spend less, try Zara Salty Ocean Bouquet, $49. Created by Jo Malone, it boasts sea salt, citrusy bergamot, and floral orange blossom. Summer Rain Perfume Expert Aamna Lone, aka @perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram, explains, “Nostalgic memories of childhood summers and the fresh, earthy scent of rain are things we love to find comfort in through fragrance,” — and it all comes down to the notes. “The ‘summer rain’ aroma is linked to petrichor, which carries the specific scent of rain on dry concrete after a long dry summer, and geosmin, which is produced by soil bacteria. It gives rise to that damp, earthy freshness,” says Lone. Several fragrances capture this essence beautifully, she adds: “A standout is Vyrao Mamajuju Eau de Parfum, $220, and Perfumer H Rain Wood, $200, both of which bottle the essence of petrichor.” Lone also recommends Escentric Molecules Molecule 05, $160, which features cashmeran: “This compound has that crisp, clean quality of fresh rain, making it perfect for layering,” she says. Just Peachy Peach is undeniably the fruity It note of the year, says Eudora Nwasike, a fragrance specialist certified by The Fragrance Foundation. “Once seen as overly sweet or youthful, it’s now being reimagined in elevated, intimate ways,” she explains, often paired with soft musks, creamy woods, and sensual leather notes. “The result is a contemporary peach: velvety, nostalgic, and deeply sensual,” adds Nwasike. To her, the note feels comforting, playful, and radiant. “It’s perfect for a hot summer’s day, evoking the feeling of sun on your skin.” Speaking of skin, both Nwasike and Lone — who also tips peach as the next big fragrance note — describe Phlur’s Peach Skin Hair \u0026 Body Fragrance Mist, $25, as sunshine in a bottle: “This velvety peach is laced with juicy plum and sparkling Bellini,” Nwasike says — the ultimate summer cocktail. She also champions Guerlain Pêche Mirage Eau de Parfum, $425, with realistic peach and creamy sandalwood. Keen to spend less? Try Le Monde Gourmand Peche Delicieuse Eau de Parfum, £28, or Zara Peach Sorbet Eau de Parfum, $19.   Heatwave In A Bottle Summer is a time to indulge in heady revelry, says Howes, and some fragrance fans are turning to bolder, more intense perfumes that melt into the skin and linger in the warmth of humid summer nights. “Look for deeper rose scents, with hints of jasmine and even oudh notes to encapsulate those late nights over a cocktail,” suggests Howes. He rates Sappho Perfume, $270, and says it’s arguably one of Lush’s most sensual fragrances, thanks to a big dose of powdery orris blended with warm vanilla, and rich, smoky tobacco. “It’ll turn some heads in the best way,” says Howes. Also try Creed Eladaria Eau de Parfum, $300, with rose and vanilla, or H\u0026M Hopeful Romantic Eau de Toilette, $12.99, with jasmine and orange blossom.  Accessible Luxury A growing trend in the fragrance industry is the launch of smaller-sized bottles at more accessible price points, says Nwasike: “By offering 15ml sizes, for example, brands can meet this demand while introducing the next generation to the world of fragrance in a way that feels both aspirational and attainable.” It’s also a great way to sample a fragrance before committing to a full-size bottle. Loewe, Glossier, and Kayali are just a few brands now offering perfumes in sizes ranging from 8ml to 15ml.  Fragrance For Your… Pants Gourmand perfumes — inspired by sweet, moreish, edible notes — have surged in popularity, but can feel heavy in summer humidity. A clever workaround? “Spraying your gourmand fragrances on your [pants] or legs,” says Lone. “It’s a strange but great summertime hack to prevent a cloying gourmand bubble when mixed with heat,” she adds. The idea is simple: “You’ll get wafts of the fragrance when you walk around, so you can wear your gourmand perfumes in the summer without the [sickly] feeling.” Try Kayali Fleur Majesty Rose Royale | 31 Eau de Parfum, $100, with rose and peach, and Valentino Born in Roma Donna Extradose Parfum, $115, with rum and vanilla. Delicate Florals “This summer, expect florals to be less full-on or cloying,” says Howes. “Instead, perfume showcases a fresher, more gentle profile.” Howes’ pick? Lush’s Sakura Body Spray, $45. “This makes you feel like you’re walking through a cherry blossom-filled park under a slight breeze. Also try Shade Perfume, $55, which offers a gently wooded base offset with a very subtle lavender note to provide some respite from a busy, bustling life,” he says. We also love Balmain Glanc Galaxie Eau de Parfum, $190, with creamy magnolia and heady patchouli balanced by zingy bergamot, mandarin, and lime. Then there’s Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild Eau de Parfum, $90, and Cult Gaia Mast Eau de Parfum, $228, both with green vetiver and blossom. If you’re on a budget, try Floral Street Wonderland Peony Perfume Mist, $28, with dainty floral notes of rose water, powdery violet, and, of course, airy peony.  Smells Like Teen Spirit Fragrance mists are having a moment, and they’re now bigger, better, and more versatile than ever, according to Michelle Feeney, founder of Floral Street. “They are a glass-free, lightweight option to power up all over,” she says. Floral Street’s trio of mists will soon be joined by a fourth — Arizona Bloom, launching this summer. “With added non-drying, skin-friendly benefits, they’re made to create lasting memories of this year’s Glastonbury festival,” adds Feeney. Gourmand, But Make It Fresh “Over the past year, we’ve indulged in rich, dessert-inspired scents,” says Howes, “but now, there’s growing conversation around blending fresher elements with traditional gourmand notes like vanilla, toffee, and chocolate.” Howes expects to see fruitier elements come into play, and suggests looking out for bergamot, lime, cherry, strawberry, and orange to cut through sweeter bases. “This also provides comfort with lightness and playfulness,” says Howes. “Lush’s Chelsea Morning Perfume, $45, is perfect for this. Indulgent vanilla and tonka are peppered with zesty lemon myrtle to conjure thoughts of slow Sunday mornings over breakfast.” Beauty editors are going wild for The 7 Virtues Amber Vanilla Eau de Parfum, $94, with sweet santal and vanilla plus fresher skin musks. Also try H\u0026M Creative Visionary Eau de Toilette, $7.99, with creamy white flowers, heady patchouli, and juicy guava.  Vintage Vibes, Modern Mood This summer marks a return to classic fragrance notes like powdery orris, lush Damask rose, and heady patchouli — reimagined with a modern twist, says Feeney. While these rich scents make a strong statement on their own, they’re softened and uplifted by fresher, more delicate touches like lemon and peach, making them tonnes more wearable, she adds. Try Floral Street’s Iris Goddess Eau de Parfum, $97, with orris, lemon zest and chilli powder, and Chypre Sublime Eau de Parfum, $97, with violets, patchouli and incense.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Mango x Supriya LeleThose searching for their new resort wardrobe can stop right now. British Indian designer Supriya Lele has teamed up with Mango to create a hot-weather-ready collection, dubbed \"A Summer Reverie.\" Featuring 34 pieces, the selection includes a glittering gold two-piece, a sheer black maxi dress, and an ’80s-inspired metallic blue swimsuit. But our favorite of the collection has to be the crochet-knit mini with feathered trim, based on one of Lele’s existing designs. The collection stands as the first Mango Collective drop, a platformaiming to celebrate niche designers.Available to shop now at MangoSupriya Lele x Mango Puffed Open-Back Bodysuit, $, available at MangoGlossier Lip GlazeLip oils have become all the rage in the last few years. From Dior’s Lip Glow Oil to NYX’s Fat Oil Lip Drip, the glazed look isn’t going anywhere. Just in time for summer, the new Glossier Lip Glaze touts itself as the “next generation” of lip oil, with a melt-on-the-mouth sheer finish and cooling menthol effect. Infused with ingredients like liquid shea butter and jojoba oil, the lip gloss replacement promises to leave lips feeling hydrated and nourished. Available in six different tints (including a frosty lilac and rich russet red), it’s the non-sticky summer formula we’re ready for.Available to shop now at GlossierGlossier Lip Glaze, $, available at GlossierConverse x Isabel Marant Converse and Isabel Marant are reuniting to bring back the wedge sneaker. The footwear brand's latest collab with the Parisian label reimagines two beloved Converse styles — the Chuck 70 (in both high- and low-top silhouettes) and Chuck Wedge — with artful bandana-scarf prints borrowed from the latter's spring/summer 2025 collection. “Good design will always be noticeable, and you’ll never get bored of something that is well achieved — much like the Chuck,\" Marant said in a press release. \"This collection speaks to a cool, easy, and playful attitude.\"  Find the new sneakers in brown and red colorways. Shop on June 3 at Isabel Marant and June 5 at Converse.Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid BlushCream blush has been on trend, but some find the staying power lacking. That’s why cream-to-powder products are on our radar this summer, including Kylie Cosmetics' latest Hybrid Blush. Combining the easy-to-blend nature of cream makeup and the smoothing effect of a powder, the new product brands itself as “mistake-proof.” Available in eight different shades, our favorite hues include Sienna (a terracotta orange) and Slow Jam (a punchy grape shade).Available to shop now at Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid Blush, $, available at Kylie CosmeticsLevi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sAnastasia Beverly Hills Smooth Blur Contour StickStick applicators have redefined contouring, making it easier than ever to accentuate cheekbones and add dimension to the face. Now, Anastasia Beverly Hills is joining the conversation with the launch of its Smooth Blur Contour Stick. The gel-like creamy formula is meant to sculpt while maintaining a dewy look and lightweight coverage. Available in four different cool-tone shades, the sticks promise a non-greasy, non-comedogenic formula, enriched with vitamin E for added moisture.Available to shop on June 23 at Anastasia Beverly HillsPeachy Summer CollectionLondon label Peachy Den has made a major name for itself thanks to It-Girls like Raye, Lila Moss, and Dua Lipa sporting its looks around town.

JVN is launching its first formula, promising a product without residue, buildup or a white cast, while still providing oil reduction, volume and lift. With ingredients like micellar for cleansing, rosemary for scalp circulation and hemisqualane for hair health, the product is formulated to be kind to strands in between wash days. Plus, the fragrance combines warming amber, violet leaf and crisp apple, making it a treat for those around you, too.Available to shop now at JVN JVN Perféct The Essential Dry Shampoo, $, available at JVNConverse 1908 Collection, Curated by Tyler, The CreatorTeaming up with long-time collaborator Tyler, The Creator, Converse is bringing the nostalgia this summer with a new vintage-inspired collection. Featuring two footwear styles, the 1908 drop reinvents the Naut-1 (a classic sailing style shoe) and the Coach Jogger (a slimline running trainer). For those interested in a ‘70s trackstar look, the forest green Le Fleur Coach Jogger with gum sole is the go-to, while the stone Naut-1’s with floral embroidery are perfect for those wanting something more preppy.Available to shop June 20th at ConverseConverse GOLF Le Fleur* Jogger, $, available at ConverseLike what you see?
