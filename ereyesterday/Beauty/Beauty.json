    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/human-design-astrology-skincare-routine?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I’ve never been good at sticking to a skincare routine. I love testing and collecting products — whether for work or myself — but using them every single day? Extremely difficult. It often felt like another task I couldn’t commit to, even when I knew my skin would thank me for it.  I needed a nudge in the right direction, and who better for that than licensed esthetician Mikaela MacLean? What sets MacLean apart from the many other skincare experts out there is that she specializes in “Human Design.”  What is human design, and how can it help improve your skin? Depending on who you ask, Human Design is either a wellness system that blends elements from astrology, Kabbalah, I’Ching, the Hindu Chakras, and quantum mechanics or an esoteric approach to self-discovery. Using the date, location, and time of your birth, Human Design practitioners create a “body graph” that ostensibly offers insight into how you’re wired to make decisions in life. While most people use the concept to help influence their career path or improve their relationships, there’s no reason why it can’t be applied to other areas. In fact, beauty is Human Design’s new frontier. As an astrology girlie and tarot reader, I’m all about this kind of mystic and spiritual structure, but I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure how it would work with skincare — a scientific and physical endeavor.  Combining wellness, mental health, and beauty is nothing new. Psychodermatology as a concept has been trending over the last few years. We’re seeing more and more brands jump on board and market themselves as neurocosmetics, suggesting that skin issues aren’t just physical concerns; they can also be mental ones. Even celebrity estheticians like Joomee Song believe in a holistic approach to skincare, looking at the skin as part of a larger, interconnected system, not just something to be treated topically with products. This holistic approach to skincare is important to MacLean, who believes that nothing is ever skin deep. “We’re all stressed, we’re all dysregulated,” she told me. Scientifically, we know this has an impact on how we look. Stress, for example, raises cortisol levels, which can lead to increased oil production with breakouts for some and a weaker skin barrier with dryness for others. “To me, there’s a missing piece, which is the inner piece,” she continued. “If you don’t feel happy and beautiful with who you are on the inside, it doesn’t matter what’s going on on the outside.” McLean suggested taking a look at my Human Design profile to see if it could potentially uncover the secret formula for me sticking to a skincare routine.  The consultation \u0026 my human design profile The first step was a virtual consultation, where MacLean walked me through my Human Design profile and explored the significance of specific elements. She describes it as “reading lab results from the universe.” The experience reminded me of getting my birth chart read by an astrologer, and for good reason: “In Human Design, you get two sides of the chart. One corresponds to the normal astrology chart, and the other is 88 degrees of the sun or approximately three months before your birth, which is really cool because there’s all this imprinting that happened before we were even here,” MacLean told me during the consultation. These two sides are also called ‘Personality’, which describes our mind or the subconscious, and ‘Design’, which describes our tissue and physical bodies.  The first half of the consultation focused on my emotional and lived experience, and how my profile validated that — my struggle with finding community, my sensitivity, and even my gift for writing. Afterwards, I received a 100-page PDF breaking down everything about my profile and MacLean’s interpretations. At a glance, out of five possible main types and 12 profiles, I’m a “Projector” type with a 5/1 profile, the Heretic/Investigator. According to MacLean, everyone has a two-number profile that defines key personality traits. Mine — 5/1 — represents a “powerful blend of leadership and foundational knowledge, with a profound potential to help others. I’m also non-sacral, which means my energy levels are inconsistent — something I need to learn to work with.  I also have a “smell cognition,” which means I process information through scent. I’ve always sort of known this about myself (I’m obsessed with fragrance), but MacLean reminded me that that means my skincare products need to smell good for me to commit to using them. MacLean also called out other interesting aspects of my profile and how I could use them to live closer to my “inner design”, which is when your actions are in harmony with your Human Design profile. For example, in my profile, my North Node (my soul purpose) in Virgo (daily routines, wellbeing, and health) is in Gate 46 (the love of the physical body) and my Venus (the planet that represents the goddess of love and beauty) is in my Gate 19 (sensitivity). All of these are important placements for me to harmonize with my inner design. It means I need to think of my skincare as a ritual and that I should prioritize products made for sensitive skin. The last part of the consultation was the “auric facial”, where I was instructed to turn off my lights and lie in bed while MacLean constructed a crystal grid in the formation of my profile and played 528Hz frequency. It felt similar to experiences I’ve had with Reiki: I went to a meditative headspace and opened my eyes feeling new and light.  How my skincare routine was chosen The first thing MacLean recommended was to replace the word “routine” with “ritual” to start thinking of it as part of my spiritual practice. “This is the physical vessel. And so, you have to really love that and really take care of it,” she told me. I connected with that right away. As a tarot reader and bruja, this change of perspective already worked wonders — and I hadn’t technically done anything yet!  One of my placements “sensitizes the entire system,” making me sensitive in every area of my life — a fact I know all too well, and I’ve had to learn how to manage, whether it’s my dry skin, my chronic pain, or absorbing other people’s emotional burdens. Because of this and my smell cognition, MacLean chose products that were safe for sensitive skin and had aromatherapeutic benefits.  The skincare routine \u0026 the products As the lead educator for organic beauty brand LilFox, MacLean selected all of my products from them. I received my lineup a few days after our consultation, and I couldn’t wait to get started. Taking photos along the way, I tested my new skincare ritual for three weeks. A disclaimer: I used only the products she recommended, except for a pimple patch.  Step 1: First, I was to begin the ritual with a special intention. I used it to get closer to my guides, thank them, and ask for protection. Then, I would get started, massaging the Amazon After Dark cleanser onto dry skin, and rinsing it off. I liked it, but it wasn’t anything too special. My skin never felt stripped or tight like some other cleansers have left it, but it felt clean.  Step 2: Applying the Bitter Orange Neroli Toning Mist and the Flower Goo Botanic Ferment Stem Cell Serum. The serum is formulated to tackle dehydration, dullness, hyperpigmentation, loss of firmness, and fine lines, while the mist hydrates and brightens. This was, by far, my favorite step in the ritual — I sprayed way too much of the toning mist every day, and I’m now almost out. It smells amazing and feels incredible on the skin. MacLean instructed me to mist before every step of the ritual, but I definitely did a little bit more than just one spritz in between.  Step 3: Massaging one-to-two pumps of Dewy Bean Dream Smoothing Night Serum + Retinol Alternative into skin at night to address uneven texture, redness, acne, and more. Because retinol instills fear in me, I used one pump to begin with, just in case of any adverse reactions. But as I got more comfortable and I had no reactions, I used two pumps.  Step 4: Misting skin with Bitter Orange, then applying Succulent Pudding Super Calm Emulsion to soften and soothe sensitive skin. This is a rich cream, which I would use more on my dry, colder days. It felt incredible, and I used it around my eye area. I would then mist skin again with Bitter Orange. Step 5: Applying two to five drops of Maracuja Face Nectar. The oil felt luxurious, and I would feel the urge to slowly massage it into my skin, like I was giving myself a facial. Finally, I would finish with a final layer of Bitter Orange mist.  Step 6: This bonus step was meant to be incorporated once a week and required applying the Moss Hydra-Bright Mask. I only ended up using this product a few times during this experiment. While it smelled incredible, I’m not much of a mask girlie and had so many other products that I ended up loving more.  The final result When I first saw the recommended ritual, I was worried it would overwhelm me and my skin, and I assumed using so many products would feel too heavy. I had gotten used to my three-products-every-other-day routine, so I was skeptical of going back to a six-product routine. Except, this was different: this ritual was designed for me. I looked forward to it every day, and I will continue to, even after this article is published and it’s not “for work” anymore. Everything from the scent to the feel of the products made it feel like I was at a spa getting a facial every night. Ultimately, the products weren’t what made that difference; it was my change of perspective. The way I approach skincare has taken a complete 180, and I no longer dread the task of a routine. Instead, I look forward to my ritual of taking care of myself.  Like what you see?

    "description": "There’s something uniquely uplifting about the smell of sunscreen. Perhaps it’s the way it instantly brings back childhood memories by the sea: sticky popsicles, salty hair, and afternoons spent burying your toes in the sand. Or maybe it’s the joy of having decent weather again. Now that temperatures are ticking upwards, it makes sense that beachy fragrances — with coconutty, skin-like notes that smell like sunshine mixed with our favourite SPF — are seeing a surge in popularity. Even if your upcoming plans don’t involve a tropical vacation abroad, these trending summer perfumes are here to lift your spirits with their nostalgic alchemy. From creamy coconut to citrus florals, the breezy scents ahead deserve a spot in your beach bag this summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Phlur Beach Skin Body Mist, $25 “‘Scent of the summer’, ‘perfect summer spray’, and ‘summer in a bottle’ are just a few of the ways reviewers have described Phlur’s Beach Skin — and I’d say that secures its place as the ultimate warm-weather fragrance. Like its fruity counterpart, Peach Skin, it’s far more understated than I expected. I imagined a bold plume of coconut and citrus, but it’s actually light and airy, with top notes of salty air, bergamot and pink pepper. I love spritzing it in my hair on grey days; it catches the breeze as I walk and reminds me the sun does still exist.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director “Aftersun” by Vacation Eau de Toilette, $60 “I normally wouldn’t go near aquatic scents, but Vacation’s “After Sun” is the lone exception. (It also doesn’t hurt that it shares the same name as my favourite weekend Love Island recap episode.) Like all of Vacation’s products, it has a sort of nostalgic, endless summer vibe, but doesn’t rely on the cool factor alone. It’s a truly unique and unstereotypically summer: there are top notes of aloe vera gel (inspired by the brand’s actual post-beach aloe gel, which I also love), green tea, and cheekily, minibar gin. If a gin rickey were a perfume, it would be this. Each spritz is bright and refreshing, and as of this month, it’s nabbed the 2025 Fragrance Foundation Award for Fragrance of the Year. Need I say more?” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Diptyque Ilio Eau de Toilette, $185 “To celebrate the season, Diptyque has unveiled the Dream Summer Fruit Garden, a limited-edition lineup of fragrances and candles decked in whimsical illustrations by Parisian artist Marie-Victoire de Bascher. But what I’m most excited about is the return of Ilio Eau de Toilette. Powdery iris (that’s where the likeness to sunscreen comes from) meets sweet orange blossom, zesty bergamot, and juicy prickly pear to form a balmy and well-rounded scent that captures the perfect Mediterranean getaway. It smells like my skin when I’ve just come out of the pool and reapplied SPF spray. Previously available only in the summer, Ilio will now be a part of the brand’s permanent collection, which is excellent news for me, as I simply can’t get enough.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Ellis Brooklyn Miami Nectar Eau de Parfum, $115 “I reviewed this scent when it first launched in 2024, and it’s still a go-to of mine. (I also recently waxed poetic on the dry shampoo version, made in collaboration with Amika.) I can’t think of a more perfect beach scent: Ellis Brooklyn’s ode to Miami has tropical notes of pineapple and coconut water, plus sweet plumeria and vanilla, rounded out with base notes of sensual amber and woods. It’s giving expensive cocktails, white sand beaches and dancing the night away.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Zara Solar Summer Skin Hair \u0026 Body Mist, $25.90 “If you want to smell like you’ve just spent a lazy day at the beach, Solar Summer Skin is the one. Salted caramel, jasmine, and sandalwood blend into a creamy, nectarous scent that radiates positivity without veering into cloying territory. It has a soft and powdery dry down that reminds me of the end of a summer holiday, when my skin still feels warm from soaking up all the sunlight. I wish the scent wouldn’t fade away so quickly, but for this very reasonable price, I’ll happily douse it all over my hair and arms. In fact, I recommend keeping this in the fridge for a cooling, juicy spritz.” — Venus Wong, senior writer LOEWE Paula’s Ibiza Cosmic Eau de Parfum, $175 “Perfume doesn’t get more beachy than this — and I’d expect nothing less from Paula’s Ibiza. The sweetness comes from coconut cream and juicy mango, but it’s balanced by cypress resin, cedarwood, amber, and sandalwood, which add a green, salty edge. As it dries down, it melts into a soft, skin-like scent — like wrapping yourself in a sun-warmed towel after a dip in the Mediterranean sea. Truly gorgeous. If you’re after something even fresher, try the original.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Sol de Janeiro Agua Mistica Perfume Mist, $25 “In my opinion, a great beachy scent needs to smell like sea, sunshine and serotonin in a bottle, but also a) not be too expensive, and b) be packaged in a way that you don’t need to be too precious about tossing it into your beach bag. Sol de Janeiro’s Agua Mistica ticks all these boxes. Like all Sol de Janeiro scents, it packs a punch on a budget (at $25) and it comes in a plastic spray bottle. First, you’re greeted by an intoxicating cloud of neroli water and tangerine — it’s bright, bold, and juicy. This dries down into a warm, musky, and salty scent that lingers on the skin for a surprisingly long time considering the affordable price. It reminds me of the warm and heady post-sea swim feeling as you let the salt water dry in the sun. All in all, a delicious-smelling, budget- and travel-friendly perfume mist perfect for capturing your dream holiday mood.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writer Jo Malone Beach Blossom Cologne, $118 “Most sunscreen scents tend to make an aquatic or creamy first impression, but Jo Malone’s limited-edition summer cologne dials up the energy one step further. Upon first sniff, my nose is immediately hit with invigorating whiffs of lime and mint, while refreshing coconut water completes the zingy, cocktail-like profile. I can also smell bananas, though that’s probably the creamy tonka in the base note. In short, this is a happy-go-lucky fragrance that evokes sipping on an iced-cold piña colada on a palm-fringed private island. I’m sadly not due to make a trip like this anytime soon but spritzing this cologne is the next best thing.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Kayali Vacay in a Bottle Maui Eau de Parfum, $100 “When Mona Kattan launched her hotly anticipated Vacay in a Bottle fragrance collection, I was instantly drawn to Maui. To me, it smells like coming home from a sun-soaked day at the beach — after a cool shower, slathering on aftersun, slipping into a floaty linen dress and heading out for dinner. With creamy coconut, heady jasmine, and a hint of banana, it’s the closest I’ll get to a far-flung escape this year, and I’ve been dousing myself in it. Of all four, this is the most beachy scent in the collection. The amazing thing about Kayali is its lasting power. I sprayed this on a shirt yesterday, put it in the laundry, and I can still catch a whiff on the collar.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Le Monde Gourmand Sel Océan Hair \u0026 Body Eau de Toilette, $28 “I’ve written at length about how Le Monde Gourmand is making some of the most multi-dimensional affordable perfumes at the moment, and the brand’s hair and body mist lineup is no different. Case in point: Sel Océan, which bottles up a salty sea breeze without smelling overwhelmingly marine. I attribute this to the pink sea salt, which has a more delicate, yet still noticeable aroma. A bouquet of pretty florals, including honeysuckle and lily of the valley, rounds out this gorgeous scent. Whenever I work from home during a heatwave, I love spraying this into my hair and turning the fan on full blast — it helps feed into my daydream about being by the sea.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Eau de Parfum, $195 “I first discovered Tom Ford’s Soleil Blanc in Duty Free before heading to Cannes. It came to define that summer holiday — and every one since. It’s a megamix of heady florals (think banana-like ylang ylang), warm, enveloping amber and splashes of citrus (that’ll be the bergamot). But it’s the addition of earthy pistachio accord that gives it a sexy, grown-up and luxurious edge. Whenever I wear it, I become a magnet for compliments. A rare feat: I never get sick of it — and that’s saying something, because I can be quite fickle when it comes to perfume.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "title": "\"Fishing Lure\" Nails Are the Hottest Thing For Summer",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/fishing-lure-nails-49448135",
    "description": "The sardine trend has exploded on social media in the past few weeks. The aesthetic captures a unique summer vibe that's reminiscent of an Amalfi Coast vacation. It transports you to a yacht in Italy, Aperol Spritz in hand, taking you away from where you actually are. We've seen clothing and accessories littered with fish iconography, but now, the trend has made its way to our fingertips with \"fishing lure\" nails. According to Molly Runty, a nail artist who recently crafted a set like this for her clients, this trend is \"inspired by real fishing lures, featuring colorful, shiny, iridescent finishes to create an eye-catching appeal.\" The trend is the perfect summer accessory and a great way to get in on the fun if you don't feel like stocking up on bags and tank tops with sardines on them (though we're big supporters of doing both). Ahead, get inspiration for your own fishing lure nails for summer, with options ranging from short natural sets to extra-long extensions. Plus, you'll find expert tips from Runty on how to achieve this look.",
