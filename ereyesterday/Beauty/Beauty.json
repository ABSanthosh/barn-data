And while it may feel early — after all, Halloween is two months away — that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jadeywadey-interview-jade-complexions?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When you’re a person online, your audience has a front-row seat to your evolution. Take the case of Jadé Marie — you might better recognize her by her online alias, JadeyWadey180 on Instagram and YouTube. The now holistic esthetician launched her career in beauty at 19 years old, sharing dramatic makeup transformations on YouTube and Instagram — false eyelashes, contour, the whole nine. She moved from Utah to L.A., grew her followers to over a million, and did the beauty influencer thing (brand trips, PR hauls, etc.). Then in late 2019, Jadé looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize herself. She realized the glam content and online persona she’d built for over a decade no longer resonated, so she endeavored to rebrand. Jadé describes her rebranding — she’s dropped the makeup entirely and is now a full-time esthetician specializing in holistic skincare — as a “coming home” to herself. Before anyone knew her as JadeyWadey, the makeup artist and influencer, Jadé was an esthetician in Utah. After graduating from cosmetology school, she worked in holistic wellness spas and clinical studios and learned about skincare (really, the base of makeup). But this happened to be the early 2010s, Instagram was still new, and makeup content was trending — people wanted the dramatic before and afters. “I’d share my skincare tips in my YouTube videos, but I didn’t feel like it was popping off at the time,” explains Jadé of the early days of beauty influencing on Instagram and YouTube. Makeup though? Her followers couldn’t get enough. As a savvy young entrepreneur and talented artist, Jadé followed the opportunities. “It was like this overnight transformation where JadeyWadey, really took off,” she says. “So for 10 years, I focused on the makeup side of things.” Here, Jadé opens up to R29 about the “really big pivot” that changed her life and career, how being online eroded her sense of self, the wellness tips she learned in her journey back, and how they influenced her to create her skincare brand, JADÉ Complexions. DashDividers_1_500x100 What was it like being an OG beauty influencer? How did being online at such a young age affect your self-perception? When I moved to L.A., I felt pressured to stay up with always looking glamorous and covering myself with makeup. I always struggled with this idea of perfection. When you’re on social media at a super young age, it does something to you. There are all these filters, FaceTune. You fall into this place where you have to keep up appearances. With makeup and enhancements, I tried to mirror what I thought I looked like online. But in my real life, it wasn’t who I was. You say you experienced a “really big pivot” in your life. What was that change? I was deep in the beauty industry — and this was right before 2020 — and I got to a point where I did not recognize myself anymore. I felt like I needed a total rebranding to get back to the core of why I got into the industry in the first place, which was to help other people feel comfortable in their own skin. Ironically, the more popular I was online, the less comfortable I felt in my skin. “The more popular I was online, the less comfortable I felt in my skin. ” Jadé Marie What practices and lifestyle changes helped you get back to yourself? I retreated for a bit. I was less focused on social media because I felt that taking care of myself was the most important thing. I started to dabble in mental health practices: meditation, affirmation, and holistic practices that I was taught at a young age when I first learned about skincare. I became plant-based. I did a 180. The transformation was so extreme; I saw it in my skin but in my mind, too. I was like, how can I get this methodology out to other people? How do you infuse these mindfulness and mental health practices into your facials? In my private skincare studio in West Hollywood, I have a Signature 180 Facial that starts with breathwork. I play a meditation. There’s also a sound bath. It’s more than a facial, it’s an experience for the skin and the senses. What does your social media content look like today? I knew it would be a big risk to do a whole pivot because people followed me for the makeup, but my passion and first love has always been skincare. So bringing that back and reviving the esthetician side of my career was honestly like coming home to myself. In my YouTube series, I talk about meditation and all the aspects that helped me on my own personal journey, mixed with skin education. “I knew it would be a big risk to do a whole pivot because people followed me for the makeup, but my passion and first love has always been skincare.”Jadé Marie What’s your skincare routine? I’ve never felt that you need a 10-step routine. I’m a big believer in getting facial treatments and doing them yourself. Through my YouTube series, I teach viewers how to do at-home facial treatments with minimal products. I’m a big believer in having an amazing exfoliator to help resurface dead skin cells and help with cell turnover. I love having an oil for self-massage, and a gua sha tool. Speaking of exfoliation, you just released your first skincare product, JADÉ Complexions Crystalline Marine Facial Polish. What inspired it? My little brother Stephen. He was dealing with a bunch of different skincare concerns: cystic acne, uneven texture, clogged pores, hyperpigmentation. I would give him facials once a month, but his skin wasn’t getting better. So I started mixing him custom blends. Over time, this little mask formula I made was helping his skin so much. I was like, ‘We might have something here.’ I never thought I was going to be creating a brand. But from the results I saw with my brother’s skin, I knew I wanted to help other people with similar concerns. It’s a physical and chemical exfoliant. On the physical side, it has a gentle amount of baltic gem powder, a tree resin that helps polish away dead skin cells. On the chemical side, it has glycolic and salicylic acid to help with brightening, acne, and breakouts. I also found this unique algae called Jade Alga, sourced from France, that’s very hydrating. [Ed note: The Facial Polish comes with an affirmation: ‘I am ready to shed what no longer serves me. I welcome softness.’] How do you use the polish? I use the facial polish as a 10-minute mask two times a week, at night. It smooths out uneven texture, dissolves pore congestion in clogged areas like the T-zone, and helps alleviate breakouts quickly. You could also use it as a pimple spot treatment or a clarifying cleanser, mixing this with an oil cleanser to enhance your cleanse experience. Exfoliation is so important if you want your other products to penetrate and work into your skin. If you layer serums and oils on top of dead skin cells, they’re not going deep enough into the epidermis to do anything for you to see results. You have over a decade of experience as a makeup artist. So I’m curious, what does your makeup routine look like now? It’s honestly become very simplified, because of this product. In the past, I struggled with breakouts and clogged pores, so I felt the need to add a ton of glamour. People probably miss the glam stuff I used to do…but now I love a good glowy, dewy tinted sunscreen look, minimal eye makeup, and lip balm. What advice would you offer young beauty influencers today? What would you want them to take away from your experience? I’m very open about speaking about the negative effects that social media can have. I think the biggest thing is to be authentic and not feel like you have to change yourself. The world needs that. The world needs to see the true us, unveiled and unhidden.  Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/glamnetic-magnetic-lashes-liner-review-49401509",
    "description": "I've only applied magnetic lashes once because eyeliner and I don't usually go together - at least not yet. Every time I try, my hands seem to have a mind of their own, and I end up getting frustrated and giving up. And let's not even talk about using glue to apply lashes. All my friends keep telling me that practice makes perfect, but the perfectionist in me wants to get it right on the first try, and that hasn't been the case. When I had the opportunity to review Glamnetic's viral magnetic lashes, I knew this was the push I needed to finally learn how to apply eyeliner. I tested four magnetic lashes - Glamnetic's Virgo Lashes ($30), VIP Lashes ($30), Venus Lashes ($30), Baby Girl Lashes ($30) - and I also used the brand's Magnetic Eyeliner Pen ($38) in black. I did try applying the eyeliner and lashes on my own, and while my application was messy, the lashes held up pretty well and they looked better than I expected. So, for all the girlies who struggle with applying lashes or eyeliner, this one's for you. Keep scrolling to read my full review of Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Pen. About Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen The lashes are made from a vegan-friendly synthetic fiber. The lashes come with a special magnetic case for safe-keeping. The magnetic liner is sold separately. There are a range of lashes to choose from, depending on if you like a more natural everyday lash or if you want a more dramatic look. There are two magnetic liners to choose from: black and brown. What I Like About Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen First and foremost, even though they're magnetic, the lashes slide into place after a little maneuvering to get them exactly where you want them. I didn't expect them to feel as secure as they did. I also appreciated that with some of the lashes I received, there was a small eyelash anchor included for added security. It's a small cluster lash that you can place on the underside of your magnetic lashes to secure them even more. Although I didn't try it because the lashes felt secure enough to me, I appreciated the thoughtfulness behind that addition. I also liked how natural all the lashes looked. Once they were on, I couldn't tell they were magnetic - and that's the beauty of the product. Honestly, that's what sold me! It was such a seamless process, despite my being a beginner at eyeliner. I also loved how you could easily switch out the lashes if you wanted to try a new set. In the past, when I've worn lashes with glue, I dreaded removing them. But with magnetic lashes, you literally just pull them off, and there's no damage done to your natural lashes. How To Use the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen First, shake the magnetic eyeliner pen to ensure the tip is saturated with product. Then, apply the liner to your upper lash line. I didn't do a winged eyeliner, but that's up to you on whatever your personal preference is. Next, grab the magnetic lash of your choice and place it along the area where you applied the eyeliner. Position it as close to your natural lashes as possible to ensure a seamless look. If you notice a gap between your natural lashes and the magnetic lash, pull them down and adjust to your liking. What To Consider Before Trying the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen Honestly, the only reservations I had about trying the magnetic lashes and eyeliner was the eyeliner. Because I'm very much a beginner, I assumed that it would be hard to get the lashes to attach to my shoddy liner job after I tried them on my own - but that wasn't the case at all. Who Is the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen Best For I think I've proven that it's best for anyone looking to try out magnetic lashes, no matter your skill level! If you're someone who loves a 10- or 15-minute makeup routine and thinks applying lashes the traditional way (using glue) would take up too much of your time, then Glamnetic lashes are definitely for you. And if you're a seasoned pro, they'll be a breeze to put on. Rating:",

    "description": "Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been all that people can talk about ever since the singer started to be a regular at the Chiefs games (and sat with the football player's mom). Their romance, which presumably began sometime around September 2023, has been a whirlwind to watch, with each star making headlines every time they supported the other's career endeavors. Kelce accompanied Swift on The Eras Tour and Swift followed Kelce all the way to the Super Bowl where his team secured a win. Naturally, this has led to an influx of new football fans curious about Swift's potential beau - more specifically, Kecle's tattoo collection. Searches for \"Travis Kelce tattoos\" have reached new heights, as people clamor to learn more about the three-time Super Bowl champion. Though he is well-known for expressing himself via his fashion choices, Kelce has no publicly known tattoos at this time. in a July 2024 episode of Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce's podcast, \"New Heights,\" the two talked about how they had previously discussed getting a family crest, but did not have any current plans to get any ink. Still, that isn't to say that there aren't any Kelce-inspired designs out there. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Travis Kelce (@killatrav) Famously, after losing a bet to both Kelce and his teammate Patrick Mahomes, musician Post Malone tattooed both their signatures on his arm backstage at a concert. \"He has a tattoo artist literally in the room,\" Mahomes told \"GQ about the ordeal.\" \"I'm like, 'Dude, you do not actually have to get a tattoo of our autographs.'\" It's not clear whether Kelce has any interest in getting some body art of his own; Swift's tattoo collection is similarly nonexistent. But who knows what the future holds for our favorite it-couple. Ariel Baker is the assistant editor for PS Beauty. Her areas of expertise include celebrity news, beauty trends, and product reviews.
