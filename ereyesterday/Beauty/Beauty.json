    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. The arrival of the first Monday in May meant one thing: The 2025 Met Gala returned to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The annual fashion event celebrated the Costume Institute’s newest exhibition —  “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” inspired by Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity by Monica L. Miller — and saw Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams join Anna Wintour as co-chairs, as well as Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Janelle Monáe, Tyla and more as part of the host committee.Following the night, we turned our attention to the new fashion and beauty launches making waves this month. From a new spring scent to a major designer collaboration, click through the slideshow ahead to learn about everything that landed this May.Tory Burch x BonBonSummer just got a little sweeter thanks to the Tory Burch x BonBon collaboration. The American brand has teamed up with the Swedish candy company for a limited-edition collection (and a campaign starring Riverdale’s Madelaine Petsch!) that includes joyful twists on house styles — think vibrant handbags “dipped” in beads that resemble a sugar coating, marshmallow-y puffed sandals in soft pastel hues, candy-shaped earrings and charms, and more.

The new Puzzle, meanwhile, is dubbed the Confetti and is covered in colorful rounds of leather in delightful candy colors. The Loewe Puzzle 10 Collection will be available to shop in select stores.Chanel Eau SplendideA new season often calls for switching up your scent, and Chanel’s latest fragrance couldn’t have come at a better time. Joining the colorful Chance cohort, Splendide’s lilac liquid is both fruity and floral, blending sparkling raspberry with powdery violet. Its heart notes include sweet rose geranium, some of which was even grown in Chanel’s perfumery garden in the South of France. Notes of cedar and white musk round out the fragrance. This is a spring scent if there ever was one.Shop now at ChanelChanel Chance Eau Splendide, $, available at ChanelReformation x Jimmy FairlyReuniting for a second collaboration, French eyewear brand Jimmy Fairly has teamed up with Reformation for another round of statement sunglasses.

    "title": "Belif Is The Korean Skincare Brand That’s Replacing All My Other Products",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "You don’t need me to tell you that Korean skincare is in a league of its own. For years, brands like Dr. Jart+, Beauty of Joseon, and CosRx (snail mucin, anyone?) have reigned supreme among skincare enthusiasts and dermatologists alike. And there’s good reason for that. Rather than wrecking skin with harsh acids and strong retinoids that often irritate, K-beauty prioritizes a healthy skin barrier, focusing on hydration, repair, and gentle exfoliation. While there are heaps of Korean skincare brands to choose from these days, only one has cut through the noise lately. Enter: belif.  The brand has been available at Sephora for a while now. In fact, it’s pretty well-known — some might say famous — among skincare enthusiasts. When it launched last September, The Aqua Bomb Eye Gel, $32, was the number one bestseller at the retailer, beating brands like Glow Recipe and innisfree, to name a few.  As a skincare obsessive, I had to see what all the hype was about — and I think I might have found my new favorite brand. I’m serious: belif has just replaced most of the skincare products in my routine. It’s that good.  Here’s my review of a handful of products in the bursting collection, including the two I recommend to everyone I meet.  DashDividers_1_500x100 belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb, $38 This moisturizer has seriously saved my skin lately — it’s officially earned a spot in my hall of fame. Before this, I was using a $70 lotion that just wasn’t cutting it. My skin felt tight after applying it, and even though it had a light texture, I’m convinced it was exacerbating my hormonal acne. By contrast, this one has a much more cushiony feel, and it’s exactly what my dull, dehydrated skin was crying out for. The key ingredients — moisturizing glycerin and squalane, skin-strengthening peptides, and repairing ceramides — work together to heal and maintain the skin barrier (the outermost layer that locks in moisture and keeps bacteria out). Despite all that goodness, it’s featherlight and sinks in within moments, so I can go straight in with sunscreen or makeup without it pilling. I’m always surprised by the glow it gives, like I’ve just had a professional facial. It’s so good, I actually look forward to using it. That’s saying something, because despite my job, I often dread doing my skincare, especially in the evening, when all I want to do is flop into bed and scroll TikTok. I use it morning and night, and recommend it to all of my friends and family in the market for a new, no-frills face lotion.   belif Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser, $22 While this cleanser is a bit pricier than others I love — like The Ordinary’s Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, $12.50, and The Inkey List’s Oat Cleansing Balm, $7, — you only need the tiniest squeeze to cleanse your skin, whether you’re using it at the end of the day to melt away makeup and sunscreen, or first thing in the morning for a quick, gentle refresh. Hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin ensure my face doesn’t feel like it might shatter into a million pieces (you know the feeling), even though it turns into a rich foam on contact with water. Since using this, I’m convinced my skin has become smoother and clearer. Honestly, Korean cleansers are elite, but here’s how I know a product is truly excellent: when I catch my partner (famously finicky with skincare) using it too. belif Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask, $38 We’ve all been sleeping on sleeping masks. This one feels more like a moisture-rich night cream, minus the sticky residue, than a heavy face mask. It sinks in quickly, delivering hydration right where your skin needs it most. When I want to level up my routine, I apply it before any high-strength retinols to create a subtle barrier. When I do this, I don’t get any flaking or irritation. belif Super Drops Retinol \u0026 Peptide Barrier Serum, $34 It’s rare to come across a serum that does it all, especially at this price point. The star ingredients are retinol, which helps refresh and renew the skin by encouraging cell turnover, and peptides, which are proteins that smooth skin texture and soften fine lines. That said, both are fairly low on the ingredients list, but that doesn’t mean it’s a write-off. Far from it. Beyond retinol, there’s niacinamide, which helps minimise the look of large pores, controls excess oil, and brightens over time. You’ll also find arginine, a natural moisturizing factor already present in our skin, and ceramide NP, which keeps the skin barrier strong so it stays soft and smooth, not parched and flaky. In other words, it’s an all-rounder. I use this on days when I want to give my skin a break from higher-strength actives but don’t want to stop entirely. belif Aqua Bomb Eye Gel, $32 I’m notoriously anti-eye cream — I’ve always believed that taking your moisturizer up to your under-eyes and eyelids is more than enough. But this one is convincing me there’s real value in a dedicated product; so much so, I’ve already finished a full tube of it. It’s packed with brightening ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, both known for minimizing hyperpigmentation. But in my experience, the real benefit is the ability to keep moisture under lock and key. Alongside glycerin, it contains sodium hyaluronate — a smarter version of hyaluronic acid with smaller molecules that sink into the skin more effectively. Because hyaluronic acid plumps the skin, I’ve noticed a real reduction in the faint dehydration fine lines under my eyes, especially when I wear concealer. I no longer have to fish it out of creases throughout the day. The cooling applicator is the cherry on top, especially if you wake up puffy like me, but I usually use my ring finger to gently tap the cream in until it’s absorbed. belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb, $38 This is the face lotion I recommend to everyone with oily skin. It has a gel texture that disappears in seconds, yet it’s surprisingly moisturizing — thanks to a clever mix of ingredients. Glycerin, shea butter, ceramides, and squalane are top-tier moisturizing components, so it’s almost sorcery that it feels so lightweight. It’s the ultimate moisturizer to use under sunscreen in summer, especially if your skin gets greasy or clogged in the heat. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "description": "Image Source: Getty / CBS Photo Archive/ Mellow de La Loza Two years ago, Rachel Sun was finishing college, ready to put her new political science and international relations degrees to use, but she needed new nails for her graduation ceremony. \"I wanted some sort of 3D design, but there was nobody in my area who did nails like that,\" she says. \"So I thought, OK, I'll do one set for myself, and that's it.\" From there, friends saw what she was creating and began requesting their own manis. Sun started posting a few of them to her Instagram page, not thinking this would ever turn into a full-time gig. And then, Doechii called. It seems like true artistry recognized true artistry, but calling Doechii a true artist feels like an understatement - maybe visionary is more appropriate. There's a viral meme circling around the internet of the singer-rapper-songwriter-dancer extraordinaire announcing she got fired and that she was going to pop into recording studios to see if they had internship opportunities, noting that she had \"nothing to lose.\" Just five years later, Doechii accepted the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album for her first full-length, titled \"Alligator Bites Never Heal.\" Talk about manifestation at its finest. Doechii isn't likely to slow down anytime soon, and it seems as though she's taking her creative team with her. From world tours to Paris Fashion Week, magazine covers, and awards shows, Sun has been making Doechii's nails. To learn more about how Sun gets her inspiration and the designs Doechii is into now, keep reading. Doechii's Favorite Trends and Nail Polish Shades Image Source: Getty Images/ Katie Flores/Billboard and Courtesy of Rachel Sun Doechii is moving away from the original \"swamp girl\" aesthetic that defined her \"Alligator Bites\" album. \"She definitely had a slight style change since I met her in the beginning,\" says Sun. \"We wanted to really lean into nails that were reflective of her album, so I made some nails for her that [were like] crocodile claws. And at that time, she was really into more vintage colors, and now even though the color palette stays about the same, we've definitely leaned more into gold colors.\" The Inspiration Behind the Famous Button Set View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachel (@allhailthynail) Image Source: David Jaelin For her Frost Fest performance in California during Coachella weekend, Doechii rocked spinning button nails that matched her fastener-adorned ensemble by a small designer called Handsome Girly. \"Doechii's team sent me a photo of this button outfit, and they were telling me, 'This is popping off on Twitter, we want you to make a set that kind of reflects this',\" says Sun. \"I wanted it to be a little more interesting than just gluing a bunch of buttons on the nails, and I thought, OK, buttons are round, that would be cool if they could spin - especially because she's performing, she's moving with her hands.\" To create the spinning effect, Sun glued a spinning mechanism to the nails and a button on top of that. \"I wouldn't say they're the most practical to have on someone's hand if you were living with them every single day, but for something like a performance, I thought it'd be awesome to add them on.\" The Craziest Nail Request She Ever Got Considering she's worked with actual salmon fish scales, among other wacky materials, we were curious if there has ever been a request that Sun had to say no to. It turns out, even she has her limits. \"There was somebody a while back who wanted me to encapsulate mosquitoes into his nails,\" says Sun. \"'I was wondering, are you bringing them to me? Am I finding them myself? Are they dead already or do I have to kill them first?'\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not down for that one.'\" 2025 Nail Trend Predictions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachel (@allhailthynail) It's hard to find an artist out there who's quite as innovative as Doechii, and her nail artist definitely follows suit. Sun is predicting some major new nail trends for 2025. First up, something that's all over Sun's page: asymmetrical nails, where each nail is a different shape and length. It began with \"me not being able to wear full-length nails when I'm working,\" says Sun. \"There are some nail techs out there that have super long nails and still can do perfect nail art, but I'm not one of them. I said, I'm going to do two of my nails short and leave three long.\" Sun says clients saw her nails and started requesting the same style for their various jobs. The functionality, plus the visual aspect, make them one of Sun's most requested styles. Doechii even rocked nails of all different lengths by Sun for her Tiny Desk Concert. \"I definitely think the queer community started this,\" she says, referring to \"lesbian nails,\" which have a similar look. Another trend she expects to take off is a new shape she's calling \"cube\" nails. Think: a cube sliced right down the middle, width-wise. \"They're shaped in a rectangular prism, so it's square nail tips, but they're raised into a cube shape,\" Sun says. \"You can encapsulate things inside of them, but it's still flat on top. Cube nails are the same thickness throughout.\" You can spot Sun's cube nail designs in Doechii's music video for the song \"Anxiety.\" How Doechii and Other Celebrities Keep Their Nails Healthy This was one of our most burning questions, since we can't even get a gel manicure without it weakening our nail beds. \"I was introduced to these gel sticker tabs a while back, and I think those are really nice because they don't ruin your nails at all,\" says Sun. \"If we do anything too crazy or need to do nail changes, we'll use the glue stickers.\" That way, the nail extension gets glued to the gel sticker instead of the client's natural nail.

According to Nails Inc. founder Thea Green, the trend looks best on almond, coffin, ballerina, or oval-shaped nails, but ultimately it works for all shapes and lengths. \"Longer nails allow for intricate medieval-inspired designs, filigree work, and gemstone embellishments,\" Green says. \"If you want a more practical style, opt for an almond or oval shape with rich colors like deep red or emerald green.\" How to Get Castlecore Nails To start, you'll want to decide on a nail shape and length that fits the aesthetic you're going for.
