    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-influencers-sun-exposure-tanning-dangers?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Love Island UK wouldn’t be the same without the blazing sun setting the scene. Even the more recent winter edition was relocated to South Africa in search of that ‘summer of love’ climate. You wouldn’t expect a bombshell to don a bikini in sub-zero temperatures now, would you? Like it or not, Love Island is built on the premise of young, slim people wearing swimwear and flirting with each other somewhere hot, but beyond valid concerns about the lack of body diversity represented on the show, that amount of bare skin combined with intense sun exposure also presents another ethical dilemma. Tanning has become the unspoken backdrop to the Love Island UK visual, be it tense chats on the sun loungers or girl huddles by the pool. It’s not uncommon to watch the Islanders’ skin tones significantly deepen before our very eyes, nor is it abnormal to see pink-tinged noses and chests after a day outside in the villa’s famous pool area. Who could forget Dr. Alex George, whose red, raw sunburn became one of the main narratives of his Love Island UK story? Or Molly Mae Hague’s mum spotting a changing mole on her leg while she was on the show? It was later found to be cancerous. Besides Hague, Faye Winter, Liberty Poole, Olivia Attwood, and Paige Turley are among the former Islanders who have also reported mole scares since leaving the villa. The truth is, it goes beyond the contestants. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that more people are diagnosed with skin cancer every year in the US than with all other cancers combined. It also reports that cases of melanoma — the type of skin cancer Molly Mae had removed, and which can spread to other areas of the body if not caught early — are estimated to increase by 5.9% in 2025. Most melanomas are caused by sun exposure. Of course, there’s no official prerequisite to be tanned on Love Island, but it certainly seems to be an unspoken beauty standard — one that’s practically unavoidable given the constant sun exposure the Islanders face. It begs the question: Is this bronzed ideal quietly influencing the rest of us, too? The cases of Islanders reporting mole removal following their time in the villa are hard to ignore, as is the amount of screen time given to the contestants lying in the sun. Consultant dermatologist Dr. Alia Ahmed describes the day-to-day sun exposure shown on Love Island UK as “pro-tanning behavior”, which normalizes habits that increase the risk: “Having a tan is a sign of skin damage caused by UV rays from the sun,” she explains. “Every time you tan or burn, you damage the DNA in your skin, and the more you damage your DNA, the greater your risk of getting skin cancer.” The Skin Cancer Foundation also reports that just one severe sunburn during childhood or your teen years can more than double your risk of melanoma later on. Dr. Ahmed doesn’t mince her words: “There is no such thing as a safe tan. As a dermatologist who treats skin cancer daily, I think showing pro-tanning behavior in the media is highly dangerous,” she warns. Dr. Ahmed adds that it’s up to broadcasters to be more responsible in the images that are being portrayed. But of course, a golden tan seems to be part of the Love Island look, be it from the bottle or, sadly, tanning beds. As you might expect, some former Islanders have admitted to using tanning beds before entering the villa, aiming to appear tanned from day one. In 2022, UK season seven star Liberty Poole said that she’d used tanning beds beforehand, but after finding a “weird mole” that appeared on her stomach when she returned home, she shared that she had given up tanning beds for good.  Still, it seems the pressure to appear tanned to fit in on the show is very real. I asked former Islander Abigail Rawlings, who also appeared on series seven in the UK, whether she felt any need to be tanned before she entered the villa: “Absolutely,” she said. “The year that I went in, they had banned [self] tan,” Rawlings told me, referring to a baffling former rule which was thought to be introduced to prevent staining on the villa bed sheets. Rawlings continued, “I hated going in there when everyone else already had a tan. Me and Chloe [Burrows] were using a bronze-tinted face moisturizer on our bodies just so we didn’t look as pale next to everyone else who was already in the villa.” Self-tanner is now allowed on the show again, meaning Islanders can opt for a sunless glow, but according to UK season 11’s Harriett Mae Blackmore, it isn’t a popular choice. Speaking on the Saving Grace podcast, she claimed that during her season, no one used self-tanner due to concerns about streaks, and that many of the women were using tanning beds before the show to develop a deeper tan on-screen. UK contestants Laura Anderson and Olivia Attwood have also spoken about previously using tanning beds, and both admitted they didn’t realize the dangers. Seeing those 10/10 stunning girls on my TV screen every night, especially during the summer, has definitely influenced my decision to use [tanning beds]. That’s why a lot of people, including myself, turn to products like tanning accelerators, drops and even nasal sprays.Kelsie, 21 While Love Island UK has improved its welfare measures in recent years due to the potential mental health impact of appearing on the show, it is worth noting that this includes the Islanders’ physical health, too. ITV told Refinery29 that, owing to its partnership with UK drugstore retailer Boots, factor 30 and 50 sunscreen is readily available in the villa, as are hats and sunglasses. According to the former Islanders interviewed for this article, the show’s 24-hour health and welfare team is attentive to sun safety. Rawlings tells me, “I remember that I burnt my bum one day, and then the welfare team was on my case after that.” She continued, “Both welfare and production were advising me on limiting my sun exposure and telling me, ‘No sun today.’ It was my fault that I burnt myself, as I was lying on the wrong side of the day bed, being silly. There are plenty of areas of shade.”  Amy Hart, who appeared on series five in the UK, also shares that in her experience, the Love Island UK team was vigilant: “The welfare producers came in twice a day to chat to us and check we had drunk enough water and had sun cream on,” she says. “If we were down at the challenge stage, they would be coming over and checking if we needed more SPF. Because I’m a bit more fair, they would often check in with me.” Hart also shared that lunch was always served under big umbrellas to provide some extra shade. Rawlings adds: “I think the only time that you are at risk of getting burnt is when they do a re-coupling or activity during the day in the sun, but they are constantly reminding you and advising you to make sure you have sun cream on. But I never felt like I didn’t want to be outside. Because it’s nice and warm, you naturally want to be out there.” Both women added that there was no specific requirement to be out in the sun, apart from challenges, but since these make good TV, that’s what we tend to see more of, which can send the wrong message. Despite precautions, it’s undeniable that most Islanders are seen spending significant periods of the day out in full sunlight, which, though perhaps their prerogative, far exceeds the amount recommended by dermatologists: “No one should be exposed to as much sun as the Love Islanders are,” says Dr. Ahmed. Dermatologists advise avoiding exposure to the sun between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. when UV rays are most intense. Dr. Ahmed adds, “Though I agree that sun exposure probably has some mood-boosting benefits, the serious risk of dangerous outcomes like skin cancer or tanning addiction is real. Many skin cancer patients tell me that they were irresponsible in the sun when they were younger because they didn’t know any better,” she says. “I’d hope that if people were correctly informed, they would avoid such prolonged sun exposure.” Watching how tanned [the Love Islanders] become as the weeks go on definitely influences me, 100%.Grace, 24 As for whether this so-called ‘pro-tanning behavior’ is having an impact on audiences is hard to quantify, but there has certainly been a recent shift towards tanning bed use and tanning, particularly among Gen Z. Tanning bed tanning has shown alarming popularity among younger generations on TikTok. On the social media platform, influencers often film themselves inside tanning booths, even promoting high-risk treatments such as Melanotan II nasal sprays — illegal in all 50 US states — to stimulate pigment in the skin. Multiple experts believe that we are being influenced by online discourse promoting tanning beds as a “wellness” tool. Many tanning shops are framing tanning bed sessions as a form of self-care and relaxation, or introducing red light hybrid tanning beds, which use red light therapy and UV, leading users to believe they are rejuvenating their skin rather than damaging it. But here’s the thing: there are no health benefits to using tanning beds, just health risks — a fact often overlooked in tanning’s recent rebrand.  Since Love Island UK’s core audience is 16 to 24-year-olds, it’s not wildly assumptive to infer that the show has had some impact on attitudes to tanning. After all, we’re already aware of its undeniable influence across fashion, aesthetic treatments like filler, and wider cultural conversation. I spoke to 21-year-old Kelsie from Belfast (dubbed the ‘sunbed capital’ of the UK), who recently began using tanning beds again regularly. Kelsie says she was exposed to tanning culture from a very young age and doesn’t feel like herself without a tan: “Most of the influencers we see online are always perfectly bronzed, and over time that just became the standard,” she says.  “I actually stopped using [tanning beds] for a couple of years, trying to stick to [self-tanner] instead,” she says, “but it’s a full-time job trying to keep it looking decent with all the scrubbing, reapplying, and patchy ankles. A few weeks ago, I’d just had enough. I was so pale that people were asking if I was feeling okay, which definitely didn’t help my confidence.” Do the Love Island UK contestants influence you, I ask? “Without a doubt. Seeing those 10/10 stunning girls on my TV screen every night, especially during the summer, has definitely influenced my decision to use [tanning beds],” she says. “That’s why a lot of people, including myself, turn to products like tanning accelerators, drops, and even nasal sprays. Tanning has just become so ingrained in how we see beauty and feel good about ourselves.” Grace, 24, explains that she uses tanning beds in the run-up to the summer every year; the majority of her friendship group does the same. It’s hard to hear her reasons: “Being pale makes me feel like I look ugly, especially in the face. When I’m tanned, I get praised a lot. I get a lot of compliments on my tan and how quickly I tan on holidays, so it could also come from the external validation,” she tells me. Of the potential health implications of tanning, Grace muses: “I do worry about the risk, but I have quite sallow skin naturally, and I think as long as [tanning beds are] used in moderation, it would be okay.” Since the Skin Cancer Foundation reports that just one tanning bed session before the age of 35 can increase your risk of developing skin cancer by 75%, it’s another worrying trend. Grace continues, “I’m probably more concerned about aging my skin more than anything, so I hide my face while in the tanning bed to prevent sun damage.” As for the Love Island UK influence, she agrees with Kelsie: “Watching how tanned they become as the weeks go on definitely influences me, 100%,” she says. Beyond my instinct to reassure these young women of their beauty and shield them from our image-obsessed world, I’m struck by how openly they share both their insecurities and their tanning bed use with me. Later, I reached out to a couple of nationwide skin safety organizations to get their take on the portrayal of sun exposure in the media. Both stated that everyone — Love Islanders included — should be able to “enjoy” the sun, but safely. Dr. Rachel Orritt, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, commented: “On-screen portrayals of people sunbathing or not protecting their skin can give the misleading impression that tanning is harmless or even good for us.” As such, Dr. Orrit recommends using sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, applying it generously and regularly. If you’re out and about in direct sunlight, you should generally be reapplying SPF every two to three hours. Will Love Island UK ever take a different approach to showing sun exposure on screen? It’s a tough one. Ultimately, the clue is in the name. The odds are that the show’s not going to relocate to Iceland for the next series. As for whether it could be doing more to protect the Islanders from the sun, ITV did not provide an official comment for this article, though it’s clear that the channel does include sun safety within its welfare protocols. But the cases of Islanders reporting mole removal following their time in the villa are hard to ignore, as is the amount of screen time given to the contestants lying in the sun. As a precaution, Dr. Ahmed would suggest full skin checks before, during, and after the show for all contestants: “I’d also like to see the Islanders encouraged to promote sun safety more frequently on screen,” she says, “like applying and reapplying sunscreen on camera.” It’s doubtful that Love Island UK will be pieing off its sun-drenched settings anytime soon, but perhaps it’s time the show updated its duty of care procedures to address sun safety, as Dr. Ahmed suggests. Currently, it’s missing from the show’s (publicly shared, at least) welfare information. Maybe those infamous morning debriefs could include a dedicated SPF session. After all, a summer of love shouldn’t lead to a lifetime of sun damage.  Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paulas-choice-weightless-body-treatment-bha-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Breakouts can be common — and frustrating — during the summer. The combination of heat, sweat, and pollution can wreak havoc on our skin, especially on parts of our bodies that are more exposed to the elements. That’s why Paula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA, $32, has become my go-to recently, helping to keep my skin smooth and clear for the warmer days ahead. For those yet to discover Paula’s Choice, the brand has long been the gold standard for treating breakouts on the face using gentle but effective exfoliating acids. Its 2% BHA Exfoliating Toner, which enlists salicylic acid, has garnered acclaim from beauty editors and dermatologists alike. When I found out that the brand also offers an exfoliating body lotion with salicylic acid, I couldn’t resist giving it a go. What is salicylic acid and what are the skin benefits? Salicylic acid is a BHA or beta hydroxy acid that gently dissolves the compacted mix of dead skin and oil, which leads to clogged pores and eventually breakouts. Besides exfoliating salicylic acid, this lotion boasts a handful of soothing, moisturizing ingredients like vitamin E and chamomile flower extract, too. With festival season in full swing and summer adventures calling, I tested this lotion to see if it’d help keep body breakouts at bay — and I’m impressed. DashDividers_1_500x100 Is the Paula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA any good? Before diving into my review, I asked the experts to help me understand the science behind the key ingredients. According to aesthetic doctor Dr Mehri Pourkand, chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid are always preferable over a physical scrub for a few reasons: First, they tend to go much deeper into the pores, making them more effective. Second, unlike scrubs, they are less likely to cause micro-tears in the skin due to friction. Salicylic acid is probably the most famous BHA out there, and for good reason: “BHAs are oil-soluble, which means they can dive right into your pores to clear out all the built-up sebum and dead skin,” Dr Pourkand explains. “Salicylic acid is especially great if you’re dealing with blackheads, breakouts, or congestion; it also helps smooth rough texture and refine the look of large pores over time.” If you deal with keratosis pilaris (also referred to as KP or “chicken skin” thanks to its bumpy texture), this lotion can help smooth these rough, red bumps with consistent use. Salicylic acid does more than exfoliate and treat congested pores. “It also has calming, anti-inflammatory properties,” Dr Pourkand adds, “so it doesn’t just treat breakouts, it soothes them, too.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Unlike many of the exfoliating body products I’ve previously tried, which tend to be heavier in texture, Paula’s Choice’s version feels more similar to a lightweight lotion. But don’t underestimate it. While it absorbs in seconds, allowing you to pull on clothes quickly and easily, it’s substantially moisturizing thanks to nourishing vitamin E, as well as allantoin and the emollient dimethiconol. I will say that the formula carries a natural, slightly yeasty fragrance, but it disappears within a few seconds. This lotion is excellent at evening out skin tone and smoothing bumpy skin texture. Before using this, I had hyperpigmentation on my legs as a result of mosquito bites, and it started to fade after two weeks of consistent use. My previously rough knees and elbows felt a lot softer, too. My skin gets easily irritated during periods of frequent travelling, and I often get back acne after taking a long-haul flight, but this lotion quickly calmed any spots that started appearing on my back, even after a 16-hour journey to Asia. One glance at the product’s glowing review section proves that I’m not the only one who is impressed. One reviewer says that this product single-handedly cleared up the back acne they had had for four years: “I’ve tried many products, including prescription antibiotic cream, but this lotion was the only one that worked,” they wrote, adding, “I use it every morning after showering and now have completely clear skin on my back.” Whenever I had tried body care products that contain active ingredients like exfoliating acids, my skin has suffered from purging — redness, itchiness and irritation. I’m very happy to report that this lotion, which contains an effective 2% salicylic acid, didn’t cause any reaction. I asked Dr Emma Cunningham, aesthetic doctor and founder of Dr Emma Clinics, to shine more light on why that might be the case: “Green tea and chamomile are both packed with antioxidants and have calming, skin-soothing properties,” she told me. “While the salicylic acid is doing the heavy lifting on the exfoliation side, these ingredients help reduce redness and keep everything balanced.” For people new to acids or those with sensitive skin, Dr Cunningham recommends using the lotion two or three times a week and observing how your skin responds. The lotion can be used in the morning or the evening, but if you’re using it in the daytime, applying a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen to exposed areas of your body before venturing into the sun is always a good idea, since exfoliating acids can make skin more sensitive to the sun. Paula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA has earned a permanent spot in my summer travel bag after doing a great job at keeping my back spots at bay. I also noticed improved overall smoothness on my arms and legs. Given its speed at clearing my body acne, I feel much more confident about wearing my tank tops and backless dresses this summer. The weightless consistency made it a joy to use when travelling around. Trust me: this is a must-have for anyone looking to target body breakouts, all without the irritation.

    "description": "If you left the theater after \"Materialists\" starring Dakota Johnson thinking to yourself, 'I want bangs.' You don't want just any type of bangs, you want \"Birkin\" bangs. And you're not alone. Bangs of all varieties - curtain, blunt, micro, curly, surfer - are having a moment right now. With the return of '70s-inspired shags and even Y2K side-bangs, you can customize your haircut and add even more personality to your look with the fringe of your choice. \"Birkin\" bangs - not to be confused with equally famous Birkin bags - are named after Jane Birkin's iconic fringe. As a model and actress in the 1960s and '70s, Birkin's bangs became a key component of her signature look. Now, with the increased interest in retro haircuts, they're gaining a new wave of fans. Keep scrolling to learn everything you need to know about the trending style. Experts Featured in This Article Devin Toth is a hairstylist at Salon SCK. What Are Birkin Bangs? Birkin bangs are characterized by their wispy, piecey look. Traditionally, they're a bit longer and hit in that space between your eyebrows and your eyelashes, without being so long that they'd be considered curtain bangs (which typically stretch to midcheek to chin-length). \"They're not heavy bangs at all and are, in fact, sparse enough to expose the eyebrows despite being long enough to cover them,\" Devin Toth, hairstylist at Salon SCK, says. \"The bang section of hair doesn't originate that far away from your hairline - only an inch or so - and then extends in sparse gaps to the lowest arc of the brows.\" The vibe of Birkin bangs is effortless and airy thanks to their wispy nature. They look just as great with your hair down as they do when you have it pulled up into an updo, like a ponytail or messy bun. As previously mentioned, a handful of celebrities have tried the look on for size, including Zendaya and Megan Fox. Birkin bangs look particularly good paired with long, straight, layered haircuts, but the style can work on all hair types. \"Any hair type, texture, and style can be inspired by them and pull them off as long as the rest of the face-framing layers are well below the chin and don't connect to the bangs,\" says Toth. How to Style Birkin Bangs How you style bangs largely depends on your starting hair type. \"Birkin bangs are paired with a center part and are usually styled with a subtle effortless bounce - not a full-blown bump, but just picture soft and straight with a bend,\" says Toth. \"They're almost clumpy and flow with the cowlicks of the hair.\" To style them, he recommends you rough-dry your hair, then take a round brush to your ends and do a quick pass of a flat iron to your bangs. \"Less is more.\" Ahead, see more inspiration shots of the Birkin bangs haircut trend to save for your fall hair appointment.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/alpaca-haircut-49445784",
    "description": "What do butterflies, wolves, manta rays, and jellyfish all have in common? Besides the fact that they're all animals, they're all also the names of trending haircuts. We might even go so far as to label 2024 the year everyone went crazy for dramatic, animal-themed chops. And if you thought the weird animal-inspired haircuts were behind us, you thought wrong. The latest, called the \"alpaca haircut,\" is gearing up to be the cut of the summer. The name stems from the fact that those who wear it look kind of look like . . . well, an alpaca. It's sheared short on the sides but fluffier on top than a cloud. Similar to the broccoli haircut, this look is a short hairstyle primarily seen on men (think some of your favorite TikTok-ers, like Noah Beck), but it really has the versatility to work on anyone. Ahead, we're breaking down everything you need to know about the trending look, like what hair type and texture it works best on, how to ask your hairstylist for the cut, and how to style it at home. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Brendnetta Ashley is the professional digital artistic ambassador for Schwarzkopf. What Is the Alpaca Haircut? When it comes to the alpaca haircut, the motto is the fluffier, the better. \"The alpaca haircut is a short, layered cut known for its soft, fluffy texture and rounded silhouette - reminiscent of an alpaca's plush coat,\" says Brendnetta Ashley, professional digital artistic ambassador for Schwarzkopf. The look typically features a rounded shape around the crown of the head, very full face-framing bangs, volume at the roots, and tapering on the sides or the back. \"This cut really shines with those who have curly or wavy hair,\" Ashley says. \"If your hair is straight, it's suggested you get a perm to achieve the look.\" How to Achieve an Alpaca Haircut The best way to ensure that you and your hairstylist are on the same page at your appointment is to show up with inspiration photos in hand. Try to look for someone with a similar hair type and texture to your own. \"Ask for a short, layered haircut with a rounded silhouette,\" Ashley says. \"It should be shorter on the sides than it is at the crown of the head.\" One thing to note: if you want to keep up with the look, you will find yourself in the salon chair at least once a month. \"With a cut this structured, maintenance is key,\" Ashley adds. \"I would recommend getting a trim every three to four weeks to maintain the shape of the cut.\" How to Style an Alpaca Haircut \"[When] styling a cut like the alpaca, it's important to control frizz while maintaining volume,\" Ashley says. She recommends using the Schwarzkopf OSiS+ Upload Volume Cream ($22) on the top of the head to add lift and body. \"For the shorter sides of the cut, I would recommend using a wax, like the Schwarzkopf OSiS+ Flexwax [$22], to keep hair in place without the traditional wax stiffness,\" Ashley adds. Pro tip: if your hair type is naturally curly, Ashley recommends diffusing the hair prior to applying product, which she says will help define your hair's natural shape.
