If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If you’d told me a few months ago that I could achieve a salon-quality gel manicure — at home, by myself — I wouldn’t have believed you. That was before Olive \u0026 June leveled up the DIY nail game with its Beauty Innovator Award-winning Gel Mani System. Olive \u0026 June has always championed making salon-quality nails accessible to everyone, but gel remained a tough nut to crack for at-home use. “With our salon heritage, [launching gel] was especially emotional for me,” says Olive \u0026 June founder and CEO Sarah Gibson Tuttle. “We’ve gotten so many requests from the community for gel, and we know they wanted the Olive \u0026 June version of it.” Here’s why gel is tricky: Many pro-grade gel lacquers contain HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate), an adhesion-promoting molecule that ensures longevity. While gel nails are beloved for their long wear time and glossy finish, HEMA has also been flagged as a potential irritant when it comes into contact with skin. Licensed technicians mitigate this by cleaning the sides of nails before curing, lowering the risk of irritation. But Olive \u0026 June took it a step further by formulating its gel without HEMA altogether. Olive \u0026 June The Gel Mani System, $85 “We [always] knew we needed to formulate without HEMA,” Olive \u0026 June’s Head of Product Development Anne Reigle tells Refinery29. “We ended up testing a ton of different ingredients and landed on a proprietary blend of adhesion promoters that last up to 21 days.” The brand also designed a custom UV LED lamp for foolproof at-home curing. “After rigorous testing, we found the ideal setup: 17 precisely placed LED bulbs paired with a reflective surface to evenly disperse light and ensure your nails are cured from every angle—quickly and thoroughly, every time,” Tuttle explains. The lamp’s UV exposure is safe for home use, but if you’re extra cautious, applying sunscreen or wearing UPF fingerless gloves (as I do) is a great habit.“Because we were creating the lamp at the same time as the [gel polish] formulation, we were able to have control over every aspect and make it work with exactly the type of bulbs and the type of light intensity that we needed,” Reigle explains. I personally like to apply sunscreen to the backs of my hands before a gel manicure or wear UPF fingerless gloves to be more mindful of UV exposure. In typical Olive \u0026 June fashion, the brand drew from fan-favorite polishes to create a starting lineup of gel shades, along with a gel base coat, top coat, removal system, and, most notably, a peel-off base coat that works with regular polish — even stubborn glitters. (If you’ve ever been tempted to rip off your gels, this innovation will be a game-changer.) The packaging walks you through the steps: Shaping and prepping your nails, applying the base coat, two coats of color, and top coat, curing between each step. Pro tip: Clean up the edges before curing for a neat, salon-like result. As someone who’s very comfortable with DIY manicures but new to gel, I found the process surprisingly forgiving.,. The thicker formula allowed for steady, precise application, and within 30 minutes, I had glossy, plump nails that looked professional. The real test? Durability. My hands go through the wringer — cooking, cleaning, dog mom duties, and workouts —  yet my manicure stayed flawless for two solid weeks. While it could’ve lasted longer, I was ready for a change by week three.  Removal is where most gel disasters happen, but Olive \u0026 June’s system simplifies things. After filing off the shiny top layer, I used the brand’s reusable silicone nail caps and acetone-soaked foam pads to gently lift the gels in lieu of cotton rounds and squares of foil. For peel-off base coats, a quick scrape under the edge makes removal even easier. A little buffing, hand lotion, and my nails were back to their best. Olive \u0026 June’s Gel Polish System starts at $85, with individual gel polish priced at $10. As of 2025, you can also find the lamp and polishes at Target, both in-store and online. For the math-minded, here’s the kicker: “We’re making it possible to get a $50 to $100 manicure at home for $2,” Tuttle says. “And I really wanted to deliver the same or better results at home that you get in the salon.” Like what you see?

    "description": "There are early adopters of trends and those who set the trends themselves. I’d categorize Park Eun Kyung aka “Unistella” as the latter. She is, after all, the creator of the shattered glass nail and the go-to manicurist for global trendsetters like Jennie from BLACKPINK and G-Dragon. With the new year just beginning, I caught up with Park to talk about all things nails: what’s in, what’s out and what’s to come. For starters, she’s taking a step back from 3D embellishments, which I was initially surprised to hear considering she’s well-known for her sculptural designs.  For Park, the pendulum has swung in the other direction. “Lately, I’ve been into softer, classic nail shapes and more muted, nostalgic nail art,” she tells me over coffee in Seongsu-dong. As such, she’s been favoring shorter, rounded off tips over super sharp or pointed shapes and utilizing good ol’ fashioned scrapbooking techniques to craft her designs. “I cut out specific words or images from scraps of paper and paste them onto the nails,” she explains.  After seeing a few of her references and obsessively researching a few more of my own, I’m calling this burgeoning trend “scrapbook nails.” What are scrapbook nails? A bit retro or even a tad kitschy depending on the exact colors and designs used, scrapbook nails resemble something your high-school self might have collaged for your notebook or binder. Think: Cute little doodles or pasted on typeface cut out from newspapers or magazines. There’s no rhyme or reason to crafting scrapbook nails—just vibes—which is a large part of their charm. Ready to get crafting (or book an appointment at your nearest salon)? I’ve pulled together 11 scrapbook nail ideas to inspire your next manicure. DashDividers_1_500x100 View this post on Instagram A post shared by UNISTELLA TREND NAIL /유니스텔라_네일 (@unistella_kr) For my minimalists out there, let’s start with a classic French mani and add some light lettering to just the thumbnails—en Français, bien sûr! (P.S. The words Park chose for this particular design translate to “right hand” and “left hand,” which is just about as cute as that little pom-pom ring she paired with the manicure.) View this post on Instagram A post shared by UNISTELLA TREND NAIL /유니스텔라_네일 (@unistella_kr) If French tips are a little too simplistic for you, perhaps this mix and match design will be more to your liking. Incorporating a muted color palette of milky whites, black and gray, this is definitely a design that would be easy to match with pretty much anything in your wardrobe. Also, the subtly studded stars on either pointer finger offer a nice counter to the free flowing letters. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 부미 VUMEE (@moonvumee) Prefer more colors? Here’s a doodle-filled delight to consider. The hand-drawn design incorporates both polish and colored pencils, which I’ve seen manicurists throughout Seoul use to sketch art directly onto your nails for better precision and to get that charming coloring book effect. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 마석네일 에이치네일 원장,뮤온 수제네일팁 (@h_nail_shop) For even more charm, here’s a smattering of designs drawn entirely with colored pencils. The soft, almost watercolor-like art is anchored by super fine lines and detailed shading throughout. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 라라살롱•마곡네일•발산네일•네일아트 (@lala_salon_nail) Old meets new with this love-themed design. Blending 3D metallic embellishments with a milky base color and sketched on letters, this is a solid option for someone who wants to rock both futuristic and retro elements on their tips.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by 지니네일스튜디오 | 공덕네일 | 마포네일 (@jininailstudio) It doesn’t get much cuter than this thumbnail-sized love letter. The whimsical design includes a tiny envelope and corresponding note adorned with wishes for the year ahead. (Note: You can actually see the colored pencils in action here.) View this post on Instagram A post shared by 묘해, myohae (@__myohae__) Presenting: the “art” in nail art. Notice how the manicurist layers tonal shades and textures to create that scrapbook paper effect before adding the birthday design on top. Speaking of birthdays, a masterful mani like this would make an excellent gift to yourself, just saying.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by 오요이네일스튜디오 (@oyoi_nail) Is it even a scrapbook if you don’t have at least one guest appearance from a Sanrio character in it somewhere? This design features both Hello Kitty and My Melody aka the dynamic duo that decorated many a Trapper Keeper throughout the early 2000s. If Hello Kitty was the icon of my tween years, Miffy is the mascot of my thirties. (Her official bio states that she “has a positive attitude and is always open to new experiences,” which is a smart way to approach life, if you ask me.) To honor the sentiment of this little bunny, I asked Park to add some Miffy to my most recent mani, which she did by laser printing several variations of the character onto waterslide decal paper before cutting and transferring each one onto my nails.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by 오요이네일스튜디오 (@oyoi_nail) Here’s another look at a cut and pasted on print—of a sleeping cat, no less. I especially appreciate how the sharp edges of the printed photo are balanced out by the softer hand-drawn designs on the remaining fingernails.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Borahhhhh (@borah_unistella) Last but not least, this one goes out to all of my daydreamers out there who used to draw all over their notebooks during chemistry class. Zoom in to see the intricate shading and sliver of silver that frames each nail.  Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/keke-palmer-cowboy-copper-hair-49421954",
    "description": "Keke Palmer is switching things up, and we're taking notes. The actress, whose new movie \"One of Them Days\" hits theaters on January 17, was recently seen doing press for the film while sporting an entirely new look. Not only did Palmer go ultra-short with a chin-grazing bob haircut, but she also went bold with the color, opting for a fun \"cowboy copper\" shade. Palmer has been favoring longer styles and muted hues lately, so this dramatic chop and color refresh is a noticeable shift. Last year, plenty of celebrities took cowboy copper for a spin, including Riley Keough, Tessa Thompson, and Megan Fox. With Palmer on board, it's clear that the hair-color trend is going to stay at the top of the charts in 2025. Why? Well, for starters, it's more subtle than your typical copper hue; it's natural and uses your unique undertone to mellow out the look. \"Because this color generally has a natural background tone to it, a person's natural color can be the background tone, giving the shade a very customized, skin-tone-flattering tone,\" LA-based celebrity hairstylist Cherilyn Farris says. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kira Dior (@kiradiorhairco) If you're considering testing out the trend for yourself, know that it does come with some upkeep and will require regular salon visits as frequently as every six weeks to keep it fresh, depending on your natural hair color. However, you can keep your hair looking vibrant at home with the right mix of products, like color-depositing hair masks and hydrating shampoos and conditioners. If Palmer's new look has inspired you to take the plunge and book an appointment with your colorist, make sure you arrive with inspiration photos in hand. Personally, we'd suggest a screenshot straight from Palmer's latest Instagram post. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "description": "Since his debut in the acclaimed BBC screen adaptation of Sally Rooney's \"Normal People,\" Paul Mescal's career has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The Irish actor has starred in several successful projects in recent years, including \"All of Us Strangers,\" \"Aftersun,\" and the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator 2.\" While fans of the Academy-award nominee are familiar with his impressive acting résumé, not everyone knows about his equally fascination collection of tattoos, which features at least eight unique pieces. Mescal's tattoos are primarily concentrated on his arms, which makes them easier to cover when filming different roles. To honor his family, he has two tattoos: one dedicated to his mother and another reflecting a cherished childhood memory with his father. Additionally, he has a tattoo paying homage to an iconic line from the romantic classic film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And if you thought he didn't have any ink referencing his breakout role, you can rest assured that he has one specific piece of artwork that he cryptically confirmed is linked to \"Normal People.\" Ahead, we have rounded up all of Mescal's known tattoos, along with their significance to the actor.
