If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Along with the gloomy weather, the transitional period between winter and early spring brings forth myriad skincare challenges. Think dry skin, dullness, and chapped lips, to name a few. Some products just don’t cut it in when the air is cold and dry, as they are either not hydrating enough or too harsh on already-compromised skin. I speak to dermatologists and beauty experts for a living, and one piece of advice I hear time and again is to make subtle tweaks to your skincare routines around different times of year to adapt to your skin’s changing needs. So which products are they phasing out for the season, and which ones are they using instead? I’ve made it my mission to find out. Ahead, I spoke to a handful of dermatologists and skincare experts to find out the formulas they tend to sideline between winter and spring — and more importantly, the replacements they are bringing back into the fold. From swapping out foaming cleansers for gentler alternatives to ditching certain ingredients in favor of others, their recommendations will help keep your skin watered, balanced, and glowing through February and beyond. The following quotes have been edited for clarity and length. DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your foaming cleanser Use instead: Uriage Cleansing Oil, $21.69 “I tend to skip foaming cleansers because they often contain harsher surfactants that can strip the skin of its natural oils — and the colder weather already dries out my skin. During the winter and months leading up to spring, the skin needs extra hydration and protection so I prefer to use more hydrating, gentle cleansers that help maintain my skin’s barrier. Consider an oil-based option like the Uriage Cleansing Oil, $21.69. Oil-based cleansers help remove impurities and maintain the skin’s moisture barrier while being gentle — without stripping essential oils, which is crucial during harsher winter months. Additionally, their nourishing properties help keep my skin soft and hydrated.” — Dr Derrick Phillips, consultant dermatologist Shop our favorite cleansing oils DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your face oil Use instead: Chanel No. 1 De Chanel Revitalizing Serum, $165 “I’ve invested more time in my gua sha routine during the colder months, as it noticeably improves my skin’s firmness. While I used to rely on sunflower seed oil for its emollient benefits, my skin has become more sensitive, leading to breakouts. I’ve since moved on to the No. 1 De Chanel Revitalizing Serum, $165. Its lightweight formula — packed with moisturizing glycerin — lends enough slip for my gua sha tool without tugging and dragging at my skin, or clogging my pores. The star ingredient is red camellia extract, an antioxidant that boosts the skin’s radiance and firmness. I pair it with the No. 1 De Chanel Massage Accessory, $70, a tool that boasts 85% bio-based materials and features a ridged side for gentle exfoliation. Together, they keep my skin glowy and plump. When I finish the routine with a dose of No. 1 De Chanel Red Camellia Cream, $120, my hydration levels are even more enhanced.” — Venus Wong, Refinery29 senior writer Shop our favorite serums DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your exfoliating scrub Use instead: SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore Moisturizer, $155 “The colder weather makes skin dry, and abrasive scrubs with rough, physical exfoliants can irritate or strip away too much of the skin’s natural oils. Instead, look for [milder cleansers] with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, aloe, or ceramides. These ingredients help maintain moisture balance while still effectively cleansing. I’ve found that [such] cleansers leave skin feeling soft, fresh and nourished, without the dry, tight sensation that harsher exfoliants can cause. “This is [also] a time when skin needs extra hydration and protection. [Besides a mild cleanser] I’d recommend a richer, cream-based moisturizer to keep skin hydrated and prevent moisture loss. One of my top picks is SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore, $155. Not only is it hydrating, but it also helps replenish the skin’s natural lipids, which are often depleted in colder weather. It’s rich without being too heavy or greasy, leaving the skin feeling soft and nourished.” — Dr Edel Woods, consultant dermatologist and founder of ORA Skin Clinic Shop our favorite rich moisturizers DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your lightweight body lotion Use instead: La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+M, $17.99 “I tend to skip lightweight body lotions in the colder months, as the formulation feels too light. My legs get particularly dry and wearing tights worsens this. I replace my body lotion with La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+M, $17.99. I don’t like anything that feels too heavy or sticky, and this one still melts into my skin, which feels better hydrated. It combines humectants (like glycerin, which draws in moisture), with emollients (such as shea butter) to soften the skin. There are also prebiotics to balance the microbiome of the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] so that it hydrates my body effectively.” — Dr Ellie Rashid, consultant dermatologist and pro medical director of Klira Shop our favorite moisturizing body balms DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your lip balm Use instead: The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner, $8.70 “My lips always bear the brunt of the changing weather. You might instinctively reach for lip balm, but I need something a little stronger to tackle flaky skin — otherwise, I’ll end up picking at it. Enter: glycolic acid. This potent alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is an excellent exfoliator, effortlessly sweeping away dry, peeling skin. I recently had the chance to try dermatologist Dr. Idriss’ Barrier Baste Lip Peel, which harnesses the power of glycolic acid. “In the past, I’ve used The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner, $8.70, on a cotton swab, followed by a rich moisturizer — something substantial like La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, $18.99, — and the results have been impressive. Dr Idriss calls this method “lip basting”, and it’s a simple yet game-changing way to step up your lip care routine during transitional weather.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Refinery29 beauty director Shop our favorite glycolic acid treatments DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your sulphate face wash Use instead: Avène Tolerance Control Extremely Gentle Cleanser, $27 “Foaming cleansers, especially those with sulphates like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), can be too harsh in the colder months. While they effectively remove oil and debris, they also strip away essential lipids, leaving the skin dry, tight and more prone to irritation — especially when the skin barrier is already compromised. For my patients with more sensitive skin types, I recommend the Avène Tolerance Control Extremely Gentle Cleanser, $27. This ultra-mild, creamy cleanser is soap-free, fragrance-free and formulated with minimal ingredients to support the skin’s natural barrier. It relies on Avène’s signature thermal spring water and a milky, lotion-like texture to cleanse without disrupting hydration. It’s perfect for winter and early spring, especially for dry, sensitive, or reactive skin.” — Dr Ashley Magovern, consultant dermatologist and Dermstore medical advisory board member Alternatively, use: iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, $49 “I recommend the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, $49, to patients with oily or acne-prone skin. This gel-based cleanser is gentle but deeply cleans the skin without disrupting its natural moisture balance. It contains antioxidants and mild resurfacing ingredients, such as white willow bark (a natural form of salicylic acid), which help with congestion without overdrying. This cleanser works well for all skin types, including sensitive skin.” — Dr Ashley Magovern, consultant dermatologist and Dermstore medical advisory board member Shop our favorite gentle cleansers DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your petroleum jelly ointment Use instead: A hand cream with ceramides and urea, like Eucerin Urea Repair Plus 5% Hand Cream, $14.99 “I wouldn’t recommend applying just petroleum jelly on the hands, since it’s an occlusive [an ingredient that forms a protective layer on the skin but isn’t particularly moisturising when used on its own]. If your hands are very dry, you ideally need to have a moisturizer with ceramides to hydrate the skin from within. [Ceramides are lipids, or fat molecules, that make up your skin’s natural barrier and help retain moisture, keeping the skin smooth, plump and hydrated.] I’d also suggest looking for a hand cream with urea, which helps remove the dead skin cell build-up and further draws water into the skin for hydration.” — Dr Zainab Laftah, consultant dermatologist \u0026 British Skin Foundation spokesperson Based on Dr Laftah’s advice, we recommend trying Eucerin Urea Repair Plus 5% Hand Cream, $14.99. It’s rich in both urea and ceramides and is adored for its ability to alleviate cracks and flakiness on the hands, especially for people with contact dermatitis. If you really want to lock that moisture in, that’s when sealing your hand cream with a top layer of a petroleum jelly product, like Vaseline, can come in: This technique is also known as ‘hand slugging’.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Fashion Month is finally here to save us from the cold, dark winter nights. Just kidding, it’s still going to be cold and dark, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy watching some outrageous beauty and fashion moments while firmly wrapped up inside in our blankets. Of course, we’ve already had a little taste of what’s to come thanks to Men’s Fashion Week and Couture Week taking over Paris, as well as Copenhagen Fashion Week landing in Denmark’s capital. Tyla took on sub-zero temperatures by turning heads in a navy side slit dress at the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2025 show and Jenna Ortega proved that black is the new black with her ultra-chic goth girl ensemble at Christian Dior. There were plenty of eye-catching looks on the runways, too, with Willy Chavarria making the case for barely there brows and red hot lips and Schiaparelli proving that sometimes it’s about not overtaking the outfit by embracing a minimalistic slick-back bun. Plus, Copenhagen has been serving us all the street style inspo, with colored faux fur jackets, knitted hoods, and office-appropriate neck ties going straight on our mood boards.As we head into the marathon of women’s shows lined up across New York, London, Milan, and Paris we’re still keeping one eye on all of the major fashion and beauty drops happening across February. From a designer luggage collaboration to a new bouncy mascara, click through to discover all the new launches heading your way this month. Beyoncé and Levi’s Launch Chapter 2When Beyoncé dropped “Levi’s Jeans” on her Grammy-winning album, Cowboy Carter, it was all but inevitable that the superstar would team up with the iconic denim brand in some way. After reimagining a 1985 laundromat-set ad last year, Beyoncé is back with Chapter 2 of her Levi’s Campaign, this time reimagining a 1991 ad. Set to the backdrop of the musician’s country-tinged track, the video (directed by Melina Matsoukas) stars Beyoncé clad in a bedazzled denim outfit at a pool hall, where she takes on Justified actor Timothy Olyphant in a game. Highlighted pieces include Levi’s Ribcage Wide Leg Jeans, Braided Vest, and Spade Trench. “There isn’t another wardrobe piece that evokes comfort, modern elegance, classic Americana attire, and nostalgia the way denim does,” Beyoncé said in a press release.  “And when I think of all those things, I think of Levi’s. For the second chapter in our collaboration we had even more fun in reimagining the denim on denim narrative, through the lens of a woman, who can be sexy, bold and a fierce competitor, all at once. We wanted to celebrate the duality of grace and power.” Louis Vuitton Launches LV Biker BagA new luxury handbag style is about to take over this spring, courtesy of Louis Vuitton: the LV Biker. Originally debuting during the fashion house’s SS25 runway show, the leather bag is inspired by biker jackets, featuring side straps and buckles similar to LV’s iconic trunks. Available in three sizes, the bag is also ultra versatile: it can be worn as a clutch, on the elbow, over the shoulders, or as a cross-body, and it boasts a collapsible construction for easy storage, too.  Shop now at Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton LV Biker PM, $, available at Louis VuittonVictoria's Secret Launches Designer Collaboration With AltuzarraVictoria’s Secret has unveiled a new designer series: Atelier Victoria’s Secret x Alturzarra. The collaboration names New York-based designer Joseph Altuzarra as the lingerie brand’s first-ever designer in residence, a title under which he will create a number of limited-edition collections throughout the year. The debut spring 2025 collection features 11 pieces focused on closet basics, such as a bodysuit in the style of a classic white button-up shirt, a satin trench coat, tailored black trousers, a knit cropped cardigan, and a fitted wool blazer. “With this partnership, I wanted to bring my perspective to a brand known for celebrating femininity and sensuality,” Altuzarra said in a press release. “I focused on pieces that felt effortless and sensual, and imbued them with subtle elements of discovery — classic wardrobe styles, but always with a twist.” Prices range from $95 to $500.Shop now at Victoria’s Secret Atelier Victoria's Secret x Altuzarra Satin Bias-Cut Dress, $, available at Victoria's SecretStarface x Hello KittyStarface stickers are often seen to adorn famous faces including Justin Bieber, PinkPantheress, and Anne Hathaway to name just a few.

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Jessica-Alba-Tattoos-46416608",
    "description": "Jessica Alba just got a brand new tattoo, and it already has fans speculating about its meaning. On February 26, 2025, the actor and Honest Company founder posted an Instagram carousel featuring a photo of her sitting in a tattoo appointment with artist Daniel Winter. Her newest ink is a fine-line design that appears to read \"life is transformation is life,\" and the caption on her post reads \"The current chapter.\" While the exact meaning behind her tattoo is unclear, many are theorizing that it relates to her impending divorce from husband Cash Warren, seeing as Alba officially filed just weeks ago, on February 7, 2025. In the past, you might have seen some of Alba's tattoos on the red carpet. Their placements make it easy to catch glimpses of them, but the beauty entrepreneur has revealed that she also has tattoos that are usually covered by clothes. In addition to Alba's latest piece, she has six other pieces of ink we know of. In 2019, Alba got three tattoos on her forearm in honor of her three children. She shared photos of the ink on Instagram, showing off the three different astrological constellations representing her children's zodiac signs. In a 2019 interview with Refinery29, Alba shared that she regrets one or two of her designs. The first being a bow that is located in the middle of her lower back, and the second is a flower design she has on the back of her neck, which she says she's tried removing. \"I got it when I was, like, 17 and I'm so irritated that I got it,\" she says. \"I got it lasered many times and it's not coming out.\" If you're looking to check out all of Alba's pieces, we've got you covered. From her latest addition to the ink she's tried lasering off, keep reading for everything we know about Alba's tattoos.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/quiet-facelift-49429368",
    "description": "It's no secret that celebrities are a constant source of beauty inspiration. Lucky for us, over the last few years, they've gotten a lot more transparent about what it takes to look that good. Sure, they have experienced glam teams on speed dial and hefty budgets to splurge on the best of the best skin-care formulas, but their access to plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures is really what makes a world of difference. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Chrissy Teigen, and Bella Hadid have all been very open about the treatments they've had done, but there's a new trend sweeping Hollywood that's a little less obvious: the quiet facelift. The procedures celebrities are gravitating toward these days aren't your average, dramatic surgeries that make you look like a completely different person. There's been a shift to more undetectable procedures that change your features but in an obscure way. Similar to no-makeup makeup, the quiet facelift allows you to look super lifted and youthful without giving it away that you've done anything major to enhance your appearance. This new trend extends past Hollywood - Gen Z and Millennials are opting to take the full plunge, too. To learn more about the quiet facelift trend, we tapped a board-certified plastic surgeon to give some more clarity. Whether you're feeling inspired by your favorite star or particularly experimental with your beauty regimen, we're breaking down all there is to know about the quiet facelift, from its cost to its pros and cons. Experts Featured in This Article Akshay Sanan, MD, FACS, is a board-certified plastic surgeon at Boston Facial Plastics in Massachusetts. What Is a Quiet Facelift? Simply put, a quiet facelift is the more unassuming, advanced version of a traditional facelift, providing more natural and long-lasting results minus the obvious signs of surgery. \"It's a modern, subtle approach to facial rejuvenation that enhances a patient's natural features without making it obvious they've had work done,\" board-certified plastic surgeon Akshay Sanan, MD, says. \"This procedure is an extended deep plane facelift and neck lift, meaning it releases and repositions deeper layers of the face, including the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) and ligaments, rather than simply pulling the skin tight,\" which is what a traditional facelift does. This helps \"preserve a natural, effortless look,\" avoiding an overdone appearance. How Much Does a Quiet Facelift Cost? The cost of getting a quiet facelift is hefty and can vary based on the practice you go to. If done by a double board-certified plastic surgeon like Dr. Sanan, the procedure can range anywhere from $50,000 to $65,000. \"The price is higher if additional procedures like a brow lift, upper blepharoplasty, or lip lift are performed at the same time,\" Dr. Sanan adds. @drsananmd The \"Quiet Facelift Trend\" is redefining rejuvenation. #boston #plasticsurgeon #facelift #necklift #deepplanesurgery ♬ original sound - Dr. Sanan | Plastic Surgeon Pros and Cons of a Quiet Facelift While the risks of getting a surgical procedure differ for everyone, there are some general things to know about a quiet facelift. On the pros list, you get natural-looking results that last longer than other treatments like fillers or lasers. On the other hand, there's a longer recovery of 10-14 days. During this period of initial downtime, you can expect to experience some swelling and bruising. After that, it may take several months to fully heal, but Dr. Sanan notes that you may return to your normal activities (such as work) within three to four weeks. He recommends products like the LotFancy Face Ice Pack Wrap ($17) and Boiron Arnicare Pain Relief Gel ($9, originally $13) to help ease recovery. Who Should Get a Quiet Facelift? According to Dr. Sanan, the perfect candidate for this surgery is a person in their early 40s or 50s experiencing any looseness in their skin, from mild to moderate jowls, neck laxity, or deepening nasolabial folds. Aside from age, getting a quiet facelift is best for those who want to look rejuvenated without compromising their facial identity. What to Consider Before Getting a Quiet Facelift \"The most important factor is choosing a highly skilled, double-board certified facial plastic surgeon with expertise in deep plane techniques to ensure natural-looking results,\" Dr. Sanan says. Although the results may look subtle, the quiet facelift involves repositioning deep facial structures for a long-lasting effect. \"Patients should also consider the commitment to recovery, have realistic expectations, and understand that while the results are subtle and refined, they are still significant surgical enhancements,\" he says. And, of course, before anything, consult with a qualified surgeon to determine what procedure is best for you.
