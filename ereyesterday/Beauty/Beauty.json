If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. When it comes to holiday gift-giving, model/entrepreneur Georgia May Jagger is attempting something different this year: staying chill.  “I’m trying to start my mother’s approach, which is to buy things all year [round] when you see something someone will like. Then, you’re not in a mad rush,” Jagger, who’s the daughter of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall, tells Refinery29 over email. “I try to think about something they would not buy for themselves, but that they would want. It’s harder with some people than others. If I can’t really think of anything, I try to make something — I make miniature sculptures, so I make those for people who I am very close with. I think a successful gift is not about spending a lot of money, it’s about making someone feel something unexpected.”  As a new mom, Jagger has been relishing in getting baby gifts (“It’s so cute to see all the wonderful tiny clothes that people have picked out.”) But she also has beauty on the brain, having brought her plant-powered organic skincare line, May Botanicals, to the U.S. earlier this year. So, we asked Jagger to share the most covetable beauty products on her holiday wish list — for both giving and receiving. Read on to discover her top picks.  Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey  “I recently became obsessed again with this lipstick. I love the cool tone and that it’s more like a balm. And it looks great on everyone.” Diptyque Feu de Bois Candle  “I think this candle is a classic, but I just love it because it reminds me of my mum.”  May Botanicals Kelp! Seaweed Sheet Mask Set of 4  “The Kelp! sheet mask from my brand is actually made of 100% kelp and infused with a collagen boosting serum. The sachets are so great for travel and stocking fillers.” May Botanicals Golden Hour Face Oil  “My new face oil is amazing for winter. It’s infused with rosehip, chamomile, and carrot oils that really make your skin glow. It’s great to add to your moisturizer or use on its own.”  Isamaya x FaceGym Sculpt 01  “Isamaya [Ffrench] is so clever, and I absolutely love a face sculpting tool. I’ve been using this one every morning with the May Botanicals face oil. I really want to try the body sculpting tool she made as well.” Slip Lovely Lashes Pure Silk Contour Sleep Mask  “I love an eye mask — they’re so good for traveling and at-home use. I love gifting these cute silk ones.” Aesop Reverence Aromatique Hand Wash “With a newborn at home, we have been doing a lot of hand-washing, and this is my favorite one to use at the moment.” Call It By Your Name Large Padded Paisley-Print Cotton Cosmetics Case “I always find that cosmetics bags are never big enough for all of the things you need to put in them. This one is amazing, as it actually fits it all.” Bleach London Purple Reincarnation Shampoo and Mask “I’ve recently gone back to blonde, and this duo keeps my hair toned and healthy, reducing breakage.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Anytime anyone asks me what my love language is, I facetiously make the same routine remark: gifts. I’m exceptionally adept at receiving gifts, more so than its much loving counterpart: giving gifts. I could say it’s because I come from a family of terrible gift-givers. Growing up, my parents were often at a loss and gave me random items (self-help books, candles, and whatnot), like I was a next-door neighbor or some distant relative.  You would think that, as an adult, I’d compensate for my less-than-ideal gift-receiving history by becoming the greatest gift-giver of all time. But the truth is, I panic. What tends to happen is that I spend an entire year mentally bookmarking the things I think my loved ones would adore, and when the time comes, my mind blanks and I scramble. There’s a whole lot of hand-wringing and rapid-fire online ordering that often result in presents that they’d never use. Or as a last resort, I turn to gift cards (sorry, Lisa) or a bottle of wine (sorry, Rose).  That doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate and value the immense power of gifting. I recognize that it’s an art form. All I know is this: What differentiates a great gift from a mediocre one — a phenomenal gift from a great one — boils down to thought and intention. Factor in the recipient, their likes/dislikes, and the element of surprise, and securing “the perfect gift” can feel as elusive as finding “the one” on a dating app in 2024. Well, not anymore. IPSY, the beloved beauty subscription service that delivers a personalized box of favorite and new brands every month, now offers a gifting option, which means figuring out and giving the perfect gift is no longer such a seemingly impossible task.  This is how it works: You can send a three-, six-, or 12-month subscription of two different kinds of boxes. There’s Glam Bag ($50 for three months, $95 for six, and $180 for 12), which boasts five deluxe-size samples all housed in a makeup bag — perfect for the girly who’s all about experimenting with new beauty trends (or in my case, my friend Mariya who never fails to show up to our dinners with a new eye look). Then there’s BoxyCharm ($100 for three months, $190 for six, and $360 for 12) that comes with five full-size products from cult-favorite brands — perfect for anyone who loves beauty (like my beauty editor friend Marianne whose apartment essentially doubles as a giant beauty closet).  Neither gifter nor giftee needs to be an IPSY member. Once the gift is sent (which, by the way, you can send right away or schedule, and also leave a custom note), the recipient will be directed to take IPSY’s highly comprehensive Beauty Quiz, which will then inform their uniquely curated selection of makeup, skin care, hair care, and more in their Glam Bag or BoxyCharm. They’ll be asked questions about how comfortable they are with makeup, how often they use specific products, their favorite shades, and more.  And because they’re able to select one product for Glam Bag, and three for BoxyCharm, the result ends up being a truly delightful mix of familiar favorites and fun surprises — every month. In other words, my bad-gifting streak ends now. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Ever since making a memorable cameo in the Disney sitcom \"The Suite Life on Deck\" in 2010, Zoey Deutch has been steadily building a robust résumé that showcases her versatility as an actor. The year 2024, in particular, was a big one for the star thanks to her Broadway debut in \"Our Town,\" which she says has been a long-time dream for years. But that's not all, the actor also celebrated her 30th birthday this year, meaning it's time for Deutch's tattoo collection to grow, yet again. In 2022 during an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" Deutch shared that she got her first piece of ink at the age of 20 and has since added more designs to her collection every year. She also offered the reasoning behind most of her tattoo placements, which are all located below the knee. \"Every year for my birthday, I like to get a tattoo; that's my present to myself, but I do it ankle down,\" she said. \"It's ankle down, so that, you know, when I'm working and on set, I don't have to spend a lot of time covering them up.\" In an appearance on the talk show \"Today With Hoda \u0026 Jenna, Deutch revealed the next design she plans on getting for her milestone birthday, which was on Nov. 10. \"It's a big symbol in 'Our Town' for Emily Webb, and I'm going to get a sunflower.\" From her zodiac symbol tattoo to the designs that solidify her proud pet parent status, keep reading for a breakdown of all of Deutch's eight known tattoos so far, along with the inspiration behind them.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/scalp-detox-editor-experiment-49232685",
    "description": "I have no problem admitting that I'm an avid TikTok scroller - in fact, I've found some of my best beauty hacks on the app. Whether it's a quick hair trick or an entirely new makeup tutorial from one of my favorite celebrities, although occasionally it takes a little digging, there are plenty of gems to be found. Recently, scalp \"detoxes\" have been all the rage on the platform, and as someone who often deals with a dry, itchy scalp, I was curious about giving them a try. Put simply, a scalp detox helps rid your scalp of product buildup and dead skin cells through exfoliation. If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. We exfoliate and hydrate our bodies and our faces, so why not our scalps? However, TikTok's take is a little different. Users testing it out were forgoing any hair products for up to a week, then using products or professional treatments to completely clear up any buildup. To try it out, I opted to try a mix of a DIY at-home detox and a professional Keravive scalp detox treatment. I've previously gone a full seven days without washing my hair for a hair \"reset\" experiment, and while the results were great, the actual detoxing period was not fun. I only wash my hair once or twice a week, but skipping it altogether leaves me feeling pretty gross. This time, I patiently waited until the guy I'm dating went on a trip to Montana for a week, then I let things get . . . well, greasy. Each night before bed, I used the Diane Shampoo Massage Brush ($9) on dry hair to gently exfoliate, but other than that, I skipped out on products. That meant no dry shampoo, no hair oil - not even a hair stick to keep a slicked-back bun in place. Grease was my only hair product. My Scalp Detox Experience On day seven, when I could no longer stand it, I visited Nassif MD Plastic Surgery in Beverly Hills to try out a Keravive treatment. It was my first time, but essentially, it's like a facial for your scalp. The treatment started with an aesthetician using a suction device to vacuum up debris and gunk from my scalp, section by section. From there, they infused a peptide complex into my skin to help with hydration. The entire treatment took about an hour, and I didn't leave before checking out all of the sh*t they suctioned out of my scalp. Let me tell you: it was gross. After, I left with an at-home scalp spray that I was told to apply the next day and let sit for an hour prior to washing. The next morning, I was practically foaming at the mouth in anticipation of washing my hair. I applied the scalp spray, let it sit while I worked out, then got in the shower. When the shampoo touched my head, it felt heavenly. I was a little worried that so much exfoliation would leave me with more dandruff, so I decided to end my scalp detox with the Briogeo Scalp Revival Cooling Mask ($34). After shampooing once, I left the mask on for 10 minutes, shampooed again, conditioned, then got out of the shower. My Scalp Detox Results After blow-drying my hair, I immediately noticed that my scalp felt better than it had in months. It wasn't itchy, I couldn't see any flakes, and it felt squeaky clean. My roots didn't feel weighed down by product, either. Although I don't plan on adding a Keravive treatment to my monthly routine, I'll probably try to do it every three months as maintenance, but I absolutely plan on doing a DIY scalp detox at home at least once a month and incorporating the Aveda Scalp Solutions Balancing Shampoo ($39). If your scalp is oily, itchy, or flaky, or if you've been experiencing an increased amount of hair shedding, it could be due to buildup, and a scalp detox could help. If you can't get in to get a professional treatment, I'd suggest testing out the Aveda scalp shampoo. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
