    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/scalp-detox-editor-experiment-49232685",
    "description": "I have no problem admitting that I'm an avid TikTok scroller - in fact, I've found some of my best beauty hacks on the app. Whether it's a quick hair trick or an entirely new makeup tutorial from one of my favorite celebrities, although occasionally it takes a little digging, there are plenty of gems to be found. Recently, scalp \"detoxes\" have been all the rage on the platform, and as someone who often deals with a dry, itchy scalp, I was curious about giving them a try. Put simply, a scalp detox helps rid your scalp of product buildup and dead skin cells through exfoliation. If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. We exfoliate and hydrate our bodies and our faces, so why not our scalps? However, TikTok's take is a little different. Users testing it out were forgoing any hair products for up to a week, then using products or professional treatments to completely clear up any buildup. To try it out, I opted to try a mix of a DIY at-home detox and a professional Keravive scalp detox treatment. I've previously gone a full seven days without washing my hair for a hair \"reset\" experiment, and while the results were great, the actual detoxing period was not fun. I only wash my hair once or twice a week, but skipping it altogether leaves me feeling pretty gross. This time, I patiently waited until the guy I was dating went on a trip to Montana for a week, then I let things get . . . well, greasy. Each night before bed, I used the Diane Shampoo Massage Brush ($9) on dry hair to gently exfoliate, but other than that, I skipped out on products. That meant no dry shampoo, no hair oil - not even a hair stick to keep a slicked-back bun in place. Grease was my only hair product. My Scalp Detox Experience On day seven, when I could no longer stand it, I visited Nassif MD Plastic Surgery in Beverly Hills to try out a Keravive treatment. It was my first time, but essentially, it's like a facial for your scalp. The treatment started with an aesthetician using a suction device to vacuum up debris and gunk from my scalp, section by section. From there, they infused a peptide complex into my skin to help with hydration. The entire treatment took about an hour, and I didn't leave before checking out all of the sh*t they suctioned out of my scalp. Let me tell you: it was gross. After, I left with an at-home scalp spray that I was told to apply the next day and let sit for an hour prior to washing. The next morning, I was practically foaming at the mouth in anticipation of washing my hair. I applied the scalp spray, let it sit while I worked out, then got in the shower. When the shampoo touched my head, it felt heavenly. I was a little worried that so much exfoliation would leave me with more dandruff, so I decided to end my scalp detox with the Briogeo Scalp Revival Cooling Mask ($34). After shampooing once, I left the mask on for 10 minutes, shampooed again, conditioned, then got out of the shower. My Scalp Detox Results After blow-drying my hair, I immediately noticed that my scalp felt better than it had in months. It wasn't itchy, I couldn't see any flakes, and it felt squeaky clean. My roots didn't feel weighed down by product, either. Although I don't plan on adding a Keravive treatment to my monthly routine, I'll probably try to do it every three months as maintenance, but I absolutely plan on doing a DIY scalp detox at home at least once a month and incorporating the Aveda Scalp Solutions Balancing Shampoo ($28). If your scalp is oily, itchy, or flaky, or if you've been experiencing an increased amount of hair shedding, it could be due to buildup, and a scalp detox could help. If you can't get in to get a professional treatment, I'd suggest testing out the Aveda scalp shampoo. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/grace-stella-undereye-patches-review-49430410",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Larry Stansbury Let's be honest: we've all had those nights where sleep just doesn't happen. Whether it's a late-night Netflix binge, a looming deadline, or endless tossing and turning, the morning aftermath is always the same: puffy undereye bags, dark circles, and a vibe that screams, 'I didn't get enough sleep!' Thankfully, I've tackled them in my morning routine with Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches ($17, originally $26). And the patches are currently 35 percent off right now thanks to Amazon's Big Spring Sale. As someone with a busy schedule, I love a product that can work its magic while I get ready in the morning. After testing Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches, within 15 minutes, I looked more awake than usual. Keep reading for my full review of the undereye patches. About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches The patches are made of hyaluronic acid, retinol, glycerin, sea moss, allantoin, and ceramide to deeply hydrate and plump your skin. They're dermatologist-tested and unscented that works for all skin types. They provide hydration, reduce puffiness, and diminish dark circles. You typically see results in 15 to 20 minutes. The eye patches come in 6-count, 24-count, and 48-count packs. What I Like About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches What I love most about Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches is how effortlessly they elevate my skincare routine while delivering real results. From the moment I apply them, the cooling sensation feels like a mini spa treatment, instantly soothing and de-puffing my tired eyes. The patches stay perfectly in place, allowing me to multitask without worrying about them slipping. After just 15 minutes, my undereye area looks visibly brighter, more hydrated, and refreshed - like I actually got eight hours of sleep! Plus, the patches make me feel luxurious thanks to their vibrant color. They're vegan, cruelty-free, and free of harsh chemicals, which makes me feel even more confident about incorporating them into my routine. After applying the patches, I was preparing to go to a dinner party and needed to put on makeup. I barely had to use concealer to cover my undereyes, just tinted moisturizer. Image Source: PS Photography / Larry Stansbury How to Use the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches Using Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches is simple and perfect for a quick self-care boost. Start with a clean and dry face, making sure your undereye area is free from any makeup or oils. Carefully peel the patches from their protective backing and place one under each eye, ensuring the thicker part of the patch is positioned toward the outer corner of your eye. Press gently to secure them in place. Leave the patches on for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax or multitask - they stay put without sliding. Once time is up, remove the patches and gently pat any remaining essence into the skin for maximum hydration and glow. No rinsing needed. What to Consider Before Trying the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches If you've got sensitive skin or tend to get allergies, it's a good idea to do a patch test first. The essence has powerful ingredients like hyaluronic acid and botanical extracts, so it's better to play it safe.

Now the minimalist brand is expanding the collection with the Paloma Tote. The new bag is inspired by the silhouette of the OG, and is made with the same Italian double-faced leather that softens as it ages — but now comes with more room, plus extra exterior and interior zip pockets. Shop now at Cuyana Cuyana Paloma Tote, $, available at CuyanaZara x Style Not Com When Beka Gvishiani, founder of the mega-popular fashion Instagram account Style Not Com, was approached by Zara, he started the conversation by saying: “Let’s talk about fashion.” That phrase is now at the heart of the resulting Zara x Style Not Com collection, which takes the account’s signature cobalt blue hue and bold white text and splashes them across a variety of apparel. Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraPrada Beauty Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara How do you launch a new product in a way that will make a splash? Well, if you’re Prada Beauty, you tap Sabrina Carpenter for the campaign. That’s how the Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara was introduced to the world. Inspired by the brand’s durable Re-Nylon material, the buildable, clump-free product instantly and noticeably lifts and lengthens lashes for up to 24 hours. The mascara is also formulated with a hyaluronic acid complex to nourish lashes, while the 180° brush features nylon fiber bristles for easy application and definition. Shop this month at Prada Prada Pradascope Lash Lengthening Eye Mascara, $, available at PradaNew Hoops at Jenny Bird A new season approaching is the perfect time to refresh your jewelry collection, if you ask us.
