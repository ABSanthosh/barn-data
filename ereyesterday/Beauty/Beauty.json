    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/drake-tattoos-49173005",
    "description": "In the years since Drake entered the music scene, the Canadian rapper has built a chart-topping discography and an equally impressive ink collection featuring a unique variety of pieces. Starting with his very first tattoo of the OVO owl - the emblem of his official store, October's Very Own - on his back in 2011, the \"Rich Flex\" rapper has accumulated well over 56 designs. Drake's tattoos range from small script additions to massive ink portraits of his loved ones, with his latest being a block-letter design of his son Adonis's name. It's safe to assume that perhaps Drake's love language is getting permanent body artwork. From his parents to his musical idols and favorite characters from pop culture (he is a die-hard Potterhead, FYI), Drake has undoubtedly one of the most interesting and eclectic collections out there. In fact, when Celine Dion caught wind of Drake's imminent plan to immortalize her face on his torso, she hilariously implored her fellow Canadian musician not to, suggesting a list of alternative ways to express his admiration instead. While his ink is scattered prominently across his arms and back, he sent his fans into a frenzy when he debuted his first-ever face tattoo back in August 2022 and again, with another addition, in November 2023. He first got the letters \"sg\" etched near his left eye - a sentimental piece of body art dedicated to his mother, Sandra Gale. More recently, he got the word \"miskeen,\" which is an Arabic term that means \"poor\" or \"hopeless,\" on the right side of his face. The rapper also owns some beautiful designs that pay homage to his hometown of Toronto. If you're looking for an ultimate guide to Drake's tattoos, we rounded up all of them ahead. Keep scrolling to check out his entire collection and learn what each piece means.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/lizzo-cat-eye-nails-49451924",
    "description": "Lizzo just took the cat-eye nail trend on vacation. While partying at Hi Ibiza, a disco club in Spain, with Grammy-winning music producer Kaytranada, the singer showed off a fresh set on Instagram of silver cat-eye nails paired with head-turning, Game of Thrones-inspired icy blond curls. Lizzo's nails feature a chrome-silver base with a soft diagonal stripe of light - the telltale sign of a cat-eye manicure. The effect comes from a magnetic polish laced with iron particles, which shift when a magnet is held over the nail, creating a glowing, dimensional finish. The result is like a cross between velvet, shimmer, and molten metal - similar to the reflective surface of an actual cat's eye. Originally popular in the early 2010s, cat-eye nails have returned with a modern twist, thanks to a new wave of celebrity fans like Jenna Dewan, Sydney Sweeney, and Ashley Tisdale. While the look works in nearly every color, Lizzo's silver take feels equal parts mermaidcore and sci-fi. Image Source: Instagram user lizzobeeating Want to try it at home? All you need is a magnetic cat-eye polish or a silver glitter, like the Manicurist Nail Polish in Disco ($14) or the Cirque Colors Magnetic Nail Polish in Starry Eyed ($17). Whether you're headed to Ibiza or just want something eye-catching for the weekend, silver cat-eye nails might be your next move.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Rixo x Billie BhatiaGet ready to discover your new go-to summer dress in the Rixo x Billie Bhatia capsule collection. The British writer and Spill podcast co-host has brought her cool and vibrant sense of style to the print-forward fashion brand with a 16-piece line full of breezy dresses that will look just as at home at a vacation resort as they will running errands in your hometown. Think little black dresses with embroidered floral details, tiered maxi dresses with pretty frills, and long-sleeve halter-neck gowns in hand-painted prints inspired by Ibiza. “Creating a collection of pieces that I know every woman in my life would look and feel their absolute best in is more than I could have imagined,” Bhatia said in a press release. “This collection is sartorial serotonin, it is freeing and fun and created to enable good vibes only.” Shop now at RixoRixo x Billie Bhatia Alina Midi Dress, $, available at RixoPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available at PradaPrada Lip Balm Prada Frosting Care in Banana Yellow, $, available at PradaUniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection.

If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available now at Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil, $, available at Charlotte TilburyDior x Louis Hamilton Superstar Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has teamed up with heritage fashion house Dior for another capsule collection (their first debuted last fall), inspired by Afrofuturism. Pieces showcase tailored jackets (including a short silhouette inspired by the 1968 Miss Dior line), slouchy knitwear, and the sporty B44 Blade sneakers in new colorways. “I [was] inspired to imagine the future of Black culture. The way we tell stories through art, science and philosophy is really special. Seeing these ideas brought to life through color and movement inspired me,” he said in a press release. “For me, fashion has always been about self-expression and embracing all the different parts of yourself. Being authentic to your style and communicating yourself through clothing is such a powerful feeling.” Shop now at DiorDior x Lewis Hamilton Necklace, $, available at DiorCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaCecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand.

Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPleats Please Issey Miyake to Launch Brand New DayIssey Miyake’s Pleats Please Brand has launched a new series called Brand New Day in collaboration with illustrator Hikaru Ichijo.

If you’re in NYC, you can also see an interactive installation that brings the Brand New Day illustrations to life from July 10 TO 24. Huda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula.

Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available at Levi'sDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x™ The Dyson Airwrap did to hair tools what TikTok did to the internet: it took over. The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonDyson Airwrap Co-anda2x, $, available at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes.
