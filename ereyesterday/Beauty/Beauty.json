    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It doesn’t seem like that long ago that our feeds were flooded with images of hyper-glowy skin that looked fresh (but never sweaty), with a healthy sheen. (Dewy makeup got so big, it even permeated pop culture; “my skin is gleamin,’” whisper-sang Ariana Grande in 2019’s “7 rings.”) Glow was the antithesis of the “Instaglam” look that predated it in the mid-2010s; think heavy highlight and contour, a full-coverage base, and bold, matte lipstick. But if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s that trends come, go…and find a way of coming back again. And sure enough, one word has been popping up everywhere in beauty launches lately: Blur. It’s not quite matte, but not quite glowy either. The blurred makeup trend occupies an interesting place between dualities that seems to be striking a chord these days. It delivers all the luminosity of dewy makeup with the diffused velvetiness of ultra-matte glam.  “The trend seems to be gaining momentum in response to the sharp makeup looks that have dominated social media for years,” makeup artist and Sephora Beauty Director David Razzano tells Refinery29. “Bold black cat eyeliner, graphic eyeshadow, intense contouring, and ultra-defined lip lines are beginning to feel a bit dated and overdone.” In comparison, ‘blurred’ makeup has a “fresh, effortless vibe,” per Razzano, that lends the skin a “filtered,” poreless effect. (I never thought I’d say this, but was Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse…ahead of its time?) The more I thought about it, the less surprising the trend was. After all, digitally airbrushed skin via social media filters had given way to products like e.l.f.’s Poreless Putty Primer and Milk Makeup’s (sadly discontinued) Blur Stick. But the 2025 version of blurred-finish products isn’t just about poreless, diffused skin. Instead of bottling blur in primers and touchup products, the soft-focus effect has made its way into lipstick, blush, eyeshadows, and more. Ahead, get the scoop on how to wear blurred makeup from lids to lips — and the pro-approved products to get the look this summer and beyond. DashDividers_1_500x100 Eyes When it comes to eyes, there are several ways to achieve a soft, diffused wash of color. I personally find cream-to-powder eyeshadows like Glossier Skywash or Merit’s new Solo Shadow the quickest, most foolproof way to get a blurred finish. “The Sephora Collection PRO Eyeshadow Brush #18 is my go-to ‘blurring brush’ for both eyes and lips,” says Razzano. “It has a small domed tip, which can be used to blur eyeliner or lipstick out – just gently sweep on the edge of any area.”  DashDividers_1_500x100 Skin When I hear “blurred makeup,” I first think of a soft, creamy complexion resembling something from a Vermeer portrait. Foundations like R29’s Beauty Innovator Award-winning Huda Beauty’s Easy Blur and Covergirl’s new (and already sold out) Clean Fresh Blurring Skin Tint SPF 30 are great options for one-and-done coverage with a petal-soft finish. You can also achieve a beautiful, blurred effect with your finishing products. Razzano loves Kosas’ Cloud Set Baked Setting \u0026 Smoothing Powder for lending a soft veil that reduces shine, not glow. “I’m obsessed with this powder! It sets your makeup in place while delivering an ultra-soft blurring effect, all while maintaining a natural, radiant finish,” he says. “This powder works particularly well when it comes to setting concealer — it blurs out fine lines and wrinkles, without creating dryness under the eyes.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Cheeks The blush craze shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon, and the latest launches all seem to have blur as a priority. There’s the Dua Lipa-fronted YSL Beauty’s new Make Me Blush, which comes in eight candy-colored shades and contains squalane to lend an optical blurring effect on skin. Some of Razzano’s go-to’s include Lawless’ Pinch My Cheeks Soft-Blur Cream Blush, which our editors also loved for its longwear properties and beautiful pigmentation. Another fave comes in the form of Danessa Myricks’ Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder, which also happens to be among my most-used products as well. “This formula is nothing short of pure brilliant beauty innovation,” Razzano declares. “Danessa created a hydrating balm-to-powder that instantly blurs the skin, while maintaining a hyper-natural look and feel. Plus, she has carried this formula into blushes and highlighters – so you can blur and add glow simultaneously.” On the bronzer side of things, Makeup By Mario’s SoftSculpt Blurring Bronzer offers the same sun-kissed glow you’d get from a bronzing powder with ingredients like spherical powders that provide an optical blurring effect. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lips Make it a summer of blurred kisses with products that have a soft, romantic finish that’s never dry or flat. “Refy’s Blur Liner boasts a domed tip, creating a natural, soft, and blurred look — an easy step in your routine,” Razzano explains. He also loves Prada Beauty’s Monochrome Soft Matte Blur Lipstick, which has the creamy texture of your favorite lippie but with a velvet finish. “No need to perfectly line your lips, since it softly blurs itself,” he says. “A few taps of your finger will blend it to perfection.” We also love Rhode’s Peptide Lip Shape crayons, which come in a variety of beautiful neutral tones with a soft matte finish.

    "description": "It's a lucky thing to have your mom as one of your best friends in life. Sure, you might have gotten into little squabbles over significant others and eye makeup when you were 13, but nothing compares to the bond you have with the person who brought you into this world. And what better way to celebrate that relationship than with mother-daughter tattoos? Getting a tattoo is one of the easiest ways to commemorate a special moment, date, or loved one, and in this case, sentimental mother-daughter tattoos are a permanent message to all that will listen, exactly how much you love your mom. If you've been on the hunt for tattoo ideas to inspire your own design, the beauty in body art is that you're in charge. This means that whether you want a hyperrealistic tattoo or a more obscure quote design - you get the final say on what goes onto your (and your mom's) body. Symbols that represented something important in your relationship are a popular option, such as a type of flower, matching hearts, or butterflies. Alternatively, popular mother daughter quotes for tattoos can come from song lyrics (throwback to \"You Are My Sunshine,\" anyone?) or a personal phrase from your childhood - perhaps a nickname or a book you read together growing up. It's always nice to put a little extra thought behind the design to give the tattoo an extra meaningful touch. Ready to jump in? Keep reading for mother daughter tattoo ideas, from hidden ink to small tattoo designs and beyond.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Hair-Color-Ideas-38048799",
    "description": "In the last five-plus years, hair color went from boxed hair dye and grown-out roots to some semblance of normalcy. Now, experts say the best new hair-color ideas you'll see for the rest of 2025 will lean one of two ways: either very low-key or kicked up 10 octaves. There is no in-between. What that means is there's something for everyone, whether you're looking for hair color ideas for dark hair, or even hair color ideas for redheads. \"Many people are steering toward a low-maintenance direction,\" Bianca Hillier, a celebrity colorist at Andy Lecompte Salon in Los Angeles, says. \"In the past, people were more dedicated to visiting the salon and committing to color that requires frequent upkeep for highlights and bases that demand frequent toners. Right now, color that's extremely low-maintenance will be the vibe.\" The upside about this approach, she says, is that these easier-to-upkeep hues \"tend to have more depth and muted dimension for movement.\" The downside: it doesn't scratch that itch for a big hair transformation that so many people are experiencing. That's where the next wave of trends comes in: of brighter blonds, streaks of copper, and bold, single-process colors. We're talking cherry red, glossy blacks, and, in terms of hair-color ideas for blonds, gala gold. No matter which camp you fall under, there are countless hair-color ideas to look forward to for 2025. Ahead, we've asked a handful of pros to break down each and every one.",
