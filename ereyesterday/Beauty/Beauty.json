    "description": "Hair color trends are famously lighthearted. We ask for “sun-kissed” highlights or a “cool” blonde base. But in this economy, colorists are sensing a vibe shift. The trend about to hit your group chat? Recession hair. “I’ve started to hear from more and more people wanting to stretch the length between appointments and lean into low-maintenance looks,” explains Natalie Rotger, a colorist at Jenna Perry Hair Studio in New York. Not only does this approach create a more natural, effortless style, but it helps color clients save money by reducing the frequency of salon visits. For context, even partial balayage can cost upwards of $150 in New York City (a half-head of foils could easily be twice that), and with costs rising across the board, it makes sense that people are looking to scale back their hair appointments.  For many people, going from blonde to a natural shade of brown is an aesthetic choice rather than a penny-pinching one: “I know everyone is talking about ‘recession hair’ now, but I think Hailey Bieber started this [trend] years ago,” says Rotger. “Once she stopped highlighting and started going darker, so many of my blondes did the same thing — or started to embrace their natural color a lot more.” Leaning into a more natural hair color is certainly a more affordable option, but it’s not the only way to save money. Ahead, color experts tell us exactly how to stretch longer between appointments (don’t just ghost) and inch closer to your natural shade in a way that feels expensive. Follow their tips ahead — and don’t call it recession hair. Talk openly about your hair budget Yes, your grocery bill is astronomically high, but ghosting your colorist is not a long-term strategy — it’s an avoidance tactic. Instead, get ahead of your fears and have a vulnerable conversation about financial planning with your colorist. You can do this at your next appointment. When you’re sitting down with your colorist and they ask, “What are you thinking?” give an honest answer. Maybe you say, “I’d love to be a bit blonder this summer, but I’m concerned about the upkeep cost. My budget will only allow for two color appointments this year — can we work together to develop a plan?”  Your colorist wants to help. “When a colorist knows your goals and your budget, they can suggest [a color plan] that will make you feel great,” explains NYC-based colorist Julie Fortiz. “Custom color is very thoughtful and can be budget-friendly if done right,” she adds. Plus, they’re living in this economy too, so they get it. Make a “big events” calendar It sounds simple, but plan your hair color around your life, not the other way around: “Make a game plan,” suggests Rotger. “Think about specific events in your life — like a wedding, birthday, or vacation. Work backwards from there.” Put on a playlist, get out your calendar, and plan your color appointments around the most important dates. You’ll probably see a few months-long blocks that are safe skips.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Natalie Rotger (@natalierotger) Figure out how to be low-maintenance If you’re blonde and want to transition to a low-maintenance brunette, there’s a pretty simple playbook: Let your natural color grow in as much as possible, then go in for a tint-back service. The tint-back is a series of glosses that match your previously-highlighted hair to your root color so there’s no demarcation. “After that, there’s little to no maintenance,” explains Rotger. “After a few months, maybe you can add a little face-framing highlight,” she adds, but once you’ve successfully transitioned your hair, you’re in full control of your color budget. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Natalie Rotger (@natalierotger) Trade brightness for shine While a hair gloss won’t brighten your hair (only bleach can do that), it will add incredible shine, which can have a highlight-like effect: “Glossing treatments go a long way,” says Fortiz. “They can make highlights or dyed hair a little sparklier and stretch out your visits to the salon.” Some even have hair benefits beyond depositing color to cover grays or root growth, and adding shine. For example, Redken Shades EQ Gloss is infused with strengthening wheat amino acids and bonder technology to repair hair damaged by bleach, heat, or environmental aggressors. Most salons carry Redken Shades EQ, so it might be worth asking your colorist if they would consider it for your next appointment. A hair gloss costs, on average, $50 to $100, while a full color service might be three or four times that. There are also at-home options. “A tinted conditioner is nice because it works like a baby gloss at home,” explains Fortiz. She likes the Davines Alchemic Conditioner, $37, and the Christophe Robin Shade Variation Mask, $53, for their shade ranges.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Natalie Rotger (@natalierotger) Air-dry whenever you can “A lot of people think coloring is what makes your hair dry — and it can — but it’s really the constant at-home heat styling that fries your hair,” explains Rotger. If you want to stretch a little longer between color appointments and avoid crunchy ends, you’d be wise to reduce your heat styling and opt for air-drying where you can this summer. Rotger’s go-to air-dry products are Crown Affair Leave-In Conditioner, $48, for all hair types, Rōz Milk Hair Serum, $52, which boasts added heat protection, and Color Wow Dream Coat Anti-Frizz Treatment for Curly Hair, $42. If you don’t want to give up heat styling or even cut back, make sure you’re taking precautions to protect your hair. First, always use a heat-protecting spray. Unite Hair’s 7SECONDS Detangler, $40.50, is a failsafe option, offering frizz control and heat protection. Second, use your blowdryer on low heat, and diffuse on low heat if you have curls. Lastly, consider air-drying to 90%, then hitting the hair with low heat to dry any damp strands and add polish. Use the non-fancy (but color-safe) shampoo Colorists agree you don’t need expensive or extraneous hair products — not in this economy. Beyond a simple conditioner and heat protectant, consider a color-safe shampoo. This is important because it will be made with gentle cleansing ingredients free of harsh sulfates that could strip color quickly. “If there’s one thing you’re going to invest in, it’s a color-safe shampoo,” echoes Rotger. Our favorites include the Color Wow Security Shampoo, $24, Amika Bust Your Brass Shampoo, $28, and the L’Oréal EverPure Hydrating Shampoo, $9.99. You can safely skip the clarifying or detox treatments, especially post-color. Often with hair products, the adage holds: Less is more. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/professional-pedicure-tips-advice?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "One look at my feet will tell you I recently had a pretty bad pedicure. For starters, my toenails are uneven, sloping dramatically instead of forming a classic straight line. As a result, the skin on one side has hardened and turned noticeably whiter than its twin on the other. Then there’s the cuticle situation: instead of being neat and uniform, it’s bumpy, with random gaps that make it look like a very small but very enthusiastic hen gave them a few curious pecks. This sort of thing doesn’t usually happen to us seasoned beauty journalists. Part of our job is to know all the places to go and the people to tap up for great beauty treatments. But to save money, I decided that instead of having a medical pedicure with my usual podiatrist, I’d opt for someone with far less expertise. That was a huge mistake. While they tried their best — and probably would’ve been fine to carry out a very basic shape and paint — they didn’t have the experience to deal with toenails as naturally curved as mine and, in one swift but catastrophic move, cut down the sides to release them from pressing against the edges of the nail bed. They then went way too hard on my soles, filing to the extent where I wondered if they’d make it beyond the tough skin and onto the necessary layer separating my blood from the world. I should’ve left, or at the very least mentioned all this afterwards, but I instead sat there wincing quietly, resolving to never put my feet in this position again. So that you — and I — have a checklist to refer to next time, I spoke to experts about what separates a good pedicure from a bad one. Here are eight rules to stick by every single time. File dry or don’t bother Ami Streets, a session nail technician and pedicurist, suggests requesting dry pedicure prep every time: “Over-soaking the feet during treatment is a common issue and can cause the skin to become overly soft or macerated,” says Streets, which is when the skin becomes weakened from prolonged exposure to moisture. Soaking makes it difficult to gauge how much hard skin to remove safely, continues Streets: “As a result, it may lead to uneven exfoliation or accidental damage to healthy tissue.” Asking for dry prep is one rule most pedicure experts drive home. Louise Stokes, ORLY Nails brand ambassador, agrees that dry foot filing is the way to go: “It gives you more control and helps to avoid removing too much skin,” explains Stokes, adding, “If feet feel sore or the skin looks red or shiny afterward, it’s been overdone.” In this case, the best approach is to let your feet heal naturally. You could also try applying a gentle, fragrance-free lotion to soothe the skin. Trim straight across — no exceptions Unless you want to end up in the situation I now find myself in, with toenails trying to push their sharp edges into my skin, you should always ask for your nail to be cut completely straight. The same goes for an at-home pedicure: Stokes advises that “rounding the edges can lead to ingrown toenails.”  A straight-across cut helps the toenail grow out seamlessly, rather than curving into the surrounding skin, which can be painful and may even require a visit to a medical professional, like a podiatrist. When it comes to cutting a straight line, toenail clippers are typically more precise compared to nail scissors. If you’re doing it yourself, try not to cut too close to the skin to avoid an ingrown nail. Leave the tops well alone A jagged toenail is not only a sensory nightmare, catching on socks and bedsheets, but over-filing the top or the free edge of the toenail is considered one of the biggest pedicure faux pas since it can compromise its health and potentially lead to problems like ingrown or uneven toenails in the long term. Stokes says that filing your toenails isn’t a complete no-no: “Light buffing is fine, but filing the top of the nail too much can really weaken it,” not to mention damage the surrounding skin. If you think your pedicurist is going too far with the nail file, always (politely) speak up — especially if it’s painful. Push, don’t snip Those little tools that cut cuticles may make things look neat in the short term, but they can damage nail health over time, given that the cuticles are there to protect the nail, support healthy, even growth, and maintain moisture levels. Beyond encouraging uneven growth, cutting into the toenail cuticles can also invite infection, since it disrupts the skin’s natural barrier, the outermost layer that keeps bacteria out. Instead of chopping, a qualified pedicurist might remove dead tissue simply by pushing toenail cuticles back. Most professionals use a softener like ORLY Cutique Cuticle Remover, $9.97, which is available for at-home use and makes the job easier thanks to its sesame seed oil formula. Everything should be sanitized  Sanitizing tools is a legal requirement for pedicures under several health and safety regulations in the US, and any equipment that can’t be sanitized — think porous emery boards and buffers — should be used just once to avoid infection. Barbicide and dry heat sterilizers are common methods pedicurists use to disinfect tools between clients, but don’t hesitate to ask about their specific protocol. Nothing should bleed — ever Not your cuticles, not your heels. Nothing. If a mistake is made — and they do happen — antiseptic should be applied immediately. Streets adds that if you feel uncomfortable or like the health of your feet is being compromised in any way, it’s worth speaking up: “It’s important that your comfort and preferences are taken into consideration during the service,” says Streets, adding, “Don’t be afraid to mention any concerns; adjustments can always be made to your treatment if needed.” Choose your polish carefully (and don’t leave it on for too long) Streets warns that even if you leave with perfectly painted toenails, you should remove the color after a while: “We’re all guilty of leaving our pedi polish on a little longer than intended, but to maintain healthy nails, classic nail polish should ideally be worn for no longer than a week at a time,” says Streets. Leaving it on too long can lead to dehydrated and stained toenails, which may appear chalky or yellow, especially if a base coat isn’t used, says Streets. If you prefer classic polish over gel, Streets recommends asking for Kure Bazaar — a brand popular in many salons. Its nail polish collection is designed to maximize nail health thanks to ingredients like moisturizing glycerin and plant oils. Let the pros handle it This last tip may sound so obvious that it’s not even worth mentioning, but the reality is that there’s very little legislation surrounding how much training is required to give a pedicure. If you need anything beyond a basic trim and polish, it’s worth doing some research. If, for example, you need someone to deal with ingrown toenails or calluses (areas of thickened, hard skin), your practitioner should have a doctor of podiatric medicine degree, a qualification that ensures your feet are in safe hands — literally.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/ami-cole-lash-amplifying-mascara-review-48927082",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy I was in the market for an everyday mascara that gives me just the right amount of length and volume for an effortless yet enhanced look. Most of the ones in my stash give me a glam, false-lash-like appearance that's a bit over the top for a daytime vibe. One of my friends and fellow PS editor introduced me to Ami Colé, a clean beauty brand catering to those with melanin-rich skin. She raved about the brand's Lash Amplifying Mascara ($19) and convinced me to give it a chance. With just a few swipes, it was exactly what I was looking for, and I became an instant fan. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the queen of everything beauty: Mrs. Hailey Bieber herself is also a fan. Bieber dropped her complete list of beauty must-haves in the 2025 summer edition of Vogue that just dropped, and this mascara is one of her top picks. With that in mind, here's what I loved about the mascara for myself. What I Like About the Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy The Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara is the ultimate \"my lashes but better\" mascara. I love that the wand is long and thin; I can get near my lash line, lift at the root, and lengthen at the tip. The tapered shape of the brush helps reach areas like the inner and outer corners for a fanned-out look. With the densely packed bristles, I can coat every lash with the pigmented formula while separating them for a defined look. The formula is on the wetter end with a creamy consistency, which I appreciated since the subtle slip helped glide the wand easily, coating each hair without dragging or pulling my lashes. The mascara's jet-black shade also gave the appearance of thicker, fuller lashes. After applying a few coats and shaping my lashes exactly the way I wanted them, I realized how weightless the formula felt. It truly feels like nothing is on my lashes. It was no surprise when I discovered that the Lash Amplifying Mascara contains conditioning ingredients like shea butter, jojoba esters, vitamin E, beeswax, and glycerin to soften and nourish each hair. The best part? The design of the wand and the flexible formulation make this mascara resistant to clumping. As I was layering and combing out each lash, I noticed how I didn't have to break up bigger clumps and spider lashes. It even has a long-lasting, day-to-night wear that doesn't flake or irritate my eyes. What's Worth Noting About the Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Although the Lash Amplifying Mascara has a buildable formula, this will not give you that falsies-like appearance. This mascara is one of my go-to picks for an everyday natural look. It's great for those looking to enhance their natural lashes and give them a little zhuzh and subtle drama rather than something more glam. The mascara wand also picks up a good amount of the formula from the tube. If you like to apply your mascara a little bit at a time and assess accordingly, it's best to swipe the excess off. That way, you'll have better control as well. This mascara can hold a curl, but it doesn't give you a curl. It's best to use your lash curler beforehand and then apply the mascara. Who Is the Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara Best For? The Lash Amplifying Mascara does exactly as it says, amplifying your lashes for a lifted and voluminous appearance. It gives your eyes a fresh, awakened look as well. It's perfect for anyone who wants something ideal for an everyday look, whether you are feeling the \"clean girl\" trend, prefer soft glam, or fall somewhere in between. At $19, the Lash Amplifying Mascara is on the more affordable side, considering other higher-end mascaras, which is a big plus. If you're in the market for a quality, everyday mascara that is clean and conditions your lashes, this is a budget-friendly pick. Where Is the Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara Available? The Ami Colé Lash Amplifying Mascara is available on Thirteen Lune and Goop ($19). Rating Anvita Reddy (she/her) is a former assistant editor for PS Shopping.

    "description": "If anyone reading this cares about my personal well-being, you should know that I'm going through yet another break-up (does it count if it's always with the same guy?). This past week, I was unwell - I'm talking full body sobs, red, puffy eyes, face swollen beyond recognition, friends are taking care of me in shifts, kind of unwell. Since my schedule was fully packed with crying, wallowing, and mourning, I hardly had time to wash my hair. I'll admit, I'm not always this . . . disheveled, but I do like to go plenty of days in between a full hair cleanse. This requires me to be inventive with ways I can cover up my seriously greasy roots. Of course, using a hat like a baseball cap is always a go-to solution, but I've realized that wearing my hair down with a hat doesn't always look good. If I'm wearing my hair up in a ponytail or a claw-clip, things are fine, but when I want to put my hair in front of my face, my ears either stick straight out or my hair gets stuck over them and I look like I have a bump in my hair. I didn't think there was a solution until I saw a TikTok video of user Raven Nolan going viral with what looked to be the easiest solution ever. The other good news? All that the trick required to master it was two products I already owned. Since I was on day seven (or was it eight?) of not washing my hair, I decided to try it out the first time I was able to get myself out of bed and go out in public. @ravennaelan #stitch with @Lulu | Size 10 Fashion ♬ original sound - ravenna elan Testing the hack was honestly the easiest thing I've done all week. All I needed to try it out was a stretchy fabric headband (the kind that we used to wear as children but are suddenly having a resurgence) and my hat of choice. I used the Amazon Sport Headbands ($8) in black because the color matched not only my hair but the shade of the hat I was wearing. After I brushed my hair out to make sure there were no knots, I took the headband and put it over my head, positioned it around my neck, and flipped my hair over it. Then I pulled the headband over my face and over my hair, making sure that it was covering my ears. Pro tip: covering the ears is absolutely necessary - don't skip this step or it won't turn out like it's supposed to. (You can leave your earlobes out if you have earrings on.) Next, I pulled my hair over the headband and in front of my face. The final step was putting on my hat. Once I had it on, I needed to do a small amount of adjusting to make sure that you couldn't see the headband. My hair needed to be pulled forward more, but once I was finished, I was pretty shocked with how it turned out. The end result was perfect: my hair looked good, my hat looked good, and while I didn't necessarily feel good, I looked a lot better than I did when my hair was a ratty, greasy mess. If you've been struggling to figure out how to wear cute hats over your hair this summer, give this hack a try before you give up. I promise it's worth it.
