If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In 2017, Glossier debuted its first fragrance, You. At the time, founder Emily Weiss likened the unique woody-musk blend to “your boyfriend’s neck after he has been wearing cologne for eight hours.” Back then, skin scents were only beginning to take off, and Glossier perfectly captured what the people didn’t even know they wanted: To smell good, but not in a “Hello world, I’m wearing perfume” way.  As such, Glossier You was undoubtedly a hit, garnering both mass and industry acclaim (including a 2018 Fragrance of the Year award). But if there’s one thing we know about Glossier, it’s that it doesn’t launch products according to calendars or trends; it launches them when it feels that the time is right — and expanding its fragrance offering was no exception. After seven long years, the brand is finally serving up not one, but two additions to the You library. Introducing Doux and Rêve (which mean “soft” and “dream” respectively, en français). If you ask me, these are two of Glossier’s best products in years. Both versions have the same thumbprint glass bottle design as OG You, reimagined in creamy ivory (Doux) and juicy berry (Rêve). And while Glossier’s packaging never misses, it’s what’s on the inside that counts.  Glossier You Doux, $78 Let’s start with Doux, which, spoiler alert, has become my new all-time favorite fragrance. (High praise, I know!) I’m not exaggerating when I say I have not stopped wearing it since my testers arrived, and I truly don’t have anything negative to say about it — other than I might need it in a larger size. It’s a warm, woody fragrance, but one that somehow feels light as air. It’s sensual and earthy, but brightened up with invigorating, smoky Palo Santo, frankincense, and myrrh. Like the original You, I can’t really pinpoint specific notes when it’s on my skin, and that’s what I love about it.  Refinery29’s deputy beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is equally as enamored by it, drawing comparisons to another beloved brew, Le Labo’s Santal 33: “Doux has a sweeter, softer, skinlike edge, which I’d expect from a Glossier You fragrance,” she said recently “They’re meant to be close and cozy.”  She added, “Like the OG Glossier You, the first spritz is intense but it dries down to something really comforting and nostalgic. I predict this will be the most popular of the bunch, especially when you consider that it’s a snip of the price of Santal 33.” Glossier You Rêve, $78 Onto Rêve, which Glossier bills as a “lush, dreamy gourmand.” Unless you’ve been living under a perfume-starved rock, gourmands are having a moment. It began in earnest with the vanilla perfume renaissance, which gave way to the cherry perfume trend we saw earlier this fall. Rêve slightly breaks the mold with notes of plum butter and toasted almond, giving the scent an overall delectable, juicy vibe without being overly saccharine. (It reminded me of Sabrina Carpenter’s Cherry Baby, which IMO, is a very grown-up, sexy take on fruit-forward scents.) Cherry is exactly what Kilikita gets from Rêve, too: “This is probably really niche but if you remember the Baby All Gone doll that was popular in the ‘90s, you’ll know that she came with a little jar of magnetic cherries, which you’d feed her,” she said in a recent review. “Those cherries smelled amazing — like maraschino and marshmallows — and I’ve spent my entire life looking for a fragrance that smells similar,” Kilikita adds. “I think I might’ve found it in Glossier Rêve.”  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 UK (@refinery29uk) The question on everyone’s lips is: How long do they last? Doux and Rêve had decent staying power on my skin and clothes, and lingered from morning until my afternoon shower.  Both new You scents retail for $78 apiece for a 50ml bottle, and are available to shop at Sephora and Glossier. (If you need more You, Glossier currently has a rollerball Discovery Kit of You, You Doux, and You Rêve for $82, or a full-size trio for $200 — a saving of 15% off the à la carte price.)  One thing is true: rarely do beauty launches deserve the rabid hype they receive online — but this one most certainly does; if this is what the future of Glossier has in store, then I for one, cannot wait for more. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "The leaves have turned golden, and there’s a hint of chill in the air, which means it’s time to swap out your breezy summer perfumes for something that feels a bit more snuggly. This time of year calls for fragrances that wrap you up like a cashmere sweater — think warm and enveloping amber, restorative woody scents and a touch of sweet, comforting vanilla. Cherry perfumes and tobacco notes also tend to get a boost in popularity around the fall.Lucky for us (and you), a fresh collection of fall-inspired perfumes has just hit the shelves, many of them doing a fabulous job at bottling up the perfect autumn day, a steamy mug of apple cider optional. Our editors have spritzed their way through all these new releases to present you with a list of perfumes that will instantly get you in the mood for fall, no matter your budget. Whether you’re into spicy, warm scents that evoke long naps by the fireplace or a classic vanilla perfume that will linger on your scarf for days, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be updating this story with more tried-and-tested feedback as more new scents are dropped, so make sure to keep this one bookmarked.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Thanks to the earthy palo santo, herby frankincense and warm amber, it has a very similar, woody quality but it isn’t too masculine. Instead, it has a sweeter, softer, skinlike edge, which I’d expect from a Glossier You fragrance; they’re meant to be close and cosy. Like the OG Glossier You, the first spritz is intense but it dries down to something really comforting and nostalgic. I predict this will be the most popular of the bunch, especially when you consider that it’s a snip of the price of Santal 33. I share mine with my boyfriend; it’s genderless.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraGlossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraGlossier You Rêve Eau de Parfum“This is probably really niche but if you remember the Baby All Gone doll that was popular in the ‘90s, you’ll know that she came with a little jar of magnetic cherries, which you’d feed her. Those cherries smelled amazing — like maraschino and marshmallows — and I’ve spent my entire life looking for a fragrance that smells similar. I think I might’ve found it in Glossier Rêve. Toasted almond, plum butter and creamy sandalwood make this equal parts sweet and smoky. It’s a grown-up version of that nostalgic smell and I love it.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraGlossier You Rêve Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraLes Essences de Diptyque Eaux de Parfum“Let’s not beat around the bush: This is an extravagantly priced collection. But for true-blue fragrance nerds or diehard Diptyque fans, this set is a special collector’s item. Les Essences de Diptyque features five scents inspired by beautiful treasures found in nature: coral (Corail Oscuro), mother of pearl (Lunamaris), tree bark (Bois Corsé), water lily (Lilyphéa) and desert rose (Rose Roche). You can get a set of minis for $200 and the individual, full-size bottles are $330 each. They all smell elegant, fresh and well rounded but there are two standouts in my book.“If you like coffee and caramel perfumes, you’ll be enchanted by Bois Corsé, a grounding, woodsy scent mixed with tonka bean and black coffee. As for Lilyphéa, let’s just say that I wish this came out last year when I got married, as it would have been my wedding scent. I’ve been looking for a perfume inspired by water lilies — my favorite flower — for years and years. No other perfume has bottled it as accurately as Lilyphéa alongside notes of violet leaf, ginger, vanilla and cardamom. This green, aquatic scent is so uniquely uplifting and I’ve been carrying the mini bottle with me everywhere as a good luck talisman.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop DiptyqueDiptyque Les Essences de Diptyque Eaux de Parfum, $, available at DiptyqueOakcha Silent Melody Eau De Parfum“Most vanilla perfumes are not my cup of tea but I absolutely adored Burberry Goddess, when I tried it in duty-free. So I was very excited when this affordable alternative landed on my radar. For those unfamiliar with Oakcha perfumes, they are spot-on replicas of some of the most popular high-end fragrances on the market, at a snip of the price. In the case of Silent Melody, the vanilla notes are delicately balanced by hints of lavender, ginger and cacao. The end result is a sensual and powdery, floral-vanilla combo that smells so comforting — but with none of the cloying, cupcakey sweetness I normally associate with vanilla scents. Compared to Burberry Goddess, the Oakcha dupe has slightly weaker projection (how easily you can smell it in the air around you) and staying power. But considering that it’s so much cheaper than the OG, that’s a very minor thing to overlook.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop OakchaOakcha Silent Melody Eau De Parfum, $, available at OakchaCreed Delphinus Eau de Parfum“There’s a reason why amber perfumes are trending ahead of winter. Like a cashmere jumper, they’re warm and cosseting on the skin. But here’s the thing: They often wear off quickly. Not Delphinus, though. At first spritz, this packs a serious punch thanks to pink pepper and patchouli, but it dries down to something so cosy and comforting thanks to the vanilla-like tonka bean and incense. It’s spicy, slightly smoky and lasts forever. I sprayed it onto a jacket last month and I can still smell it. I find myself reaching for it more and more now that the nights are drawing in.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromCreed Delphinus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromParfums de Marly Palatine Eau de Parfum“To my nose, Parfums de Marly’s latest launch is giving all kinds of demure and mindful. Palatine’s top notes — pear, bergamot and mandarin — are crisp and invigorating, reminding me of a comforting pot of fruit-infused tea. The next thing that hits you are violet petals in the heart notes (which echo the boudoir-style purple glass bottle and tassel design). This combo really speaks to me. It smells so clean and powdery but never like a cleaning product. The scent gets more intimate and warm as it dries down thanks to base notes of sandalwood, vanilla and patchouli. It’s so intricately layered and exactly what I would imagine a vintage luxury bath soap would smell like.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop Saks Fifth AvenueParfums de Marly Palatine Eau de Parfum, $, available at Saks Fifth AvenuePHLUR Soft Spot Eau de Parfum“Floral, musky and a little bit woody, a sniff of Soft Spot is like walking through a flower-peppered wood after rainfall. This isn’t a floral perfume as you know it. Rather, it’s light and spring-like thanks to its initial, fresh hit of mandarin and freesia. It’s creamy, too, but not cloying. This won’t give you a headache, but it will hug your skin for hours with the scent of jasmine petals, amber and musk lingering on your clothes in the best way. It’s bright and comforting at the same time; nuanced and layered in a way that makes it easy to reach for all year round.” — Humeara Mohamed, SEO writerShop NordstromPhlur Soft Spot Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLush Chelsea Morning Perfume“I’ve been seeing so many viral TikToks about the Lush Sticky Dates Shower Gel and the new Body Spray. People can’t seem to get enough of the mood-lifting sugariness of dates and carob resinoid, a Lush flavoring that resembles baked goods and chocolate. But if you were to ask me, they’re sleeping on Chelsea Morning, another new fragrance from the brand. I’d describe it as the more sophisticated neighbor of Sticky Dates, with a far less overpowering first impression (if you’re not a fan of gourmands, the Sticky Dates Body Spray is going to be too potent for your nose).\"The sweetness in Chelsea Morning comes from the tonka and vanilla, with notes of toffee biscuits thrown in for that warm and inviting feeling. You catch whiffs of butterscotch but it’s never too much, and the lemon myrtle adds a zingy twist. The smell is like sipping an iced lemon tea on the sunny terrace of a five-star resort — and that’s a vibe I’m desperate to hold onto as the weather starts to get chilly.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop LushLush Chelsea Morning Perfume, $, available at LushAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum“I have one of the most sensitive noses of anyone I know: I can instantly tell if the stove hasn’t been turned off from a floor level away, and bath products in the mall give me migraines. It’s a challenge to find perfumes and candles that don’t make me feel ill, so I’m constantly on the hunt for warm, woodsy scents that aren’t too pungent. I was eager (and nervous) to try Ariana Grande’s Lovenotes Pink Woods — and I’m in love.“The perfume smells bright and sparkly at first spray, thanks to the Italian bergamot and lotus flower, but it turns warmer and muskier as it sits on my skin (that would be the vetiver and cashmere woods talking). The fragrance reminds me more of a cologne, which I tend to prefer, but there are hints of sweet candy, which makes sense, as there are notes of cotton candy in it. This one feels more mature and luxurious than Grande’s earlier fruity and floral fragrances. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my sense of smell or give me a headache.” — Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writerShop UltaAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum“Barénia is the first chypre scent (think a citrus-mossy-woody hybrid) by Hermès. This new perfume takes inspiration from its namesake, a type of high-quality leather used in the most iconic bags from the luxury fashion house. I haven’t liked a single leather-inspired perfume in the past, so I wasn’t 100% sure I’d enjoy this. However, just one sniff is enough to change my mind: The patchouli tickles my nose and harmonizes with the oaky base note to create a soft leather-like aroma. It conjures memories of my vintage leather bomber jacket, one of my prized possessions.“The leathery notes fade away quite quickly, and you’re left with a cloud of tart berries and sweet butterfly lilies that drifts around you for the rest of the day. If you’re looking for a cozy signature fragrance for the winter, you can’t go wrong with Barénia. The striking bottle design, created to resemble an Hermès calfskin stuffed bracelet, makes this a certified collector’s item.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist“Often super sweet, fruity, and playful, most Sol de Janeiro fragrances skew much younger to me, as someone in her early thirties. But consider Cheriosa 76 the fragrance family’s chic older sister. She’s still fun and full of energy (that’ll be the zingy blackcurrant), but she’s also sophisticated and put-together (the creamy jasmine, heady freesia, and skin-like amber woods make sure of that.) Starting at $24 for a mini bottle, it’s considerably cheaper than the fragrances on this list, but it boasts brilliant staying power. It gets warmer and more comforting as you wear it in, making it the perfect autumn perfume if you’re on a budget.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist, $, available at SephoraMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum“I normally don’t associate fruity perfumes with autumn, but Marc Jacobs’ latest addition to the Perfect Eau de Parfum lineup has managed to surprise me. Perfect Elixir greets you with the sweet and tart aroma of plums, which happen to be in season during the early months of fall. The scent then warms up with cozy amber and vanilla bean accords, while rhubarb and patchouli add a dash of crispness. It reminds me of a plum and almond tart — the perfect autumnal dessert — but it doesn’t smell overly saccharine on the skin, thanks to delicate orange blossoms in the middle notes. It’s a very grown-up but still flirty version of a vanilla scent that has impressive staying power, but you’ll be tempted to reapply even way before it fades.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop UltaMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense“This new scent is my absolute favorite out of Givenchy’s ever-growing L’Interdit perfume range. The jasmine in the other variations is quite pungent, which can be polarizing to some people. Givenchy L’interdit Absolu presents you with a white floral bouquet that is much softer, creamier (thanks to the combo of neroli, lavender, and cardamom) — and a little bit boozy, due to the addition of rum. It’s also enriched with tobacco absolute that warms up the scent and lends a soft smokiness, making the wearer feel more sexy and enticing. Compared to the OG version, L'Interdit Absolu sits closer to the skin, creating a more intimate experience overall.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at UltaDedCool Aura Eau de Parfum“Fuelled by top notes of pear and lemon, DedCool Aura is layered with middle notes of jasmine and patchouli, which dry down to bottom notes of musk, caramel, and vanilla. The resulting cocktail is bright and juicy, sparkly but mature, and thick and luxurious — but never headache-inducing. It’s an exquisite, nostalgic balance between sweet and herby, and it’ll wrap you with warmth on cold, rainy days. It has all the makings of a ‘signature’ perfume that all of your friends and acquaintances will associate you with from here on out.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop DedCool DedCool Aura Eau de Parfum, $, available at DedcoolJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense“I was recommended this scent because I don’t like sweet, gourmand perfumes, and this is basically the opposite. It’s true: Hand me a cherry perfume, and my nose will instantly wrinkle. This, then, sounds perfect on paper. Inspired by the Japanese ritual of ‘forest bathing,’ it’s studded with tree-like notes, including Japanese hinoki cypress (which smells a bit like eucalyptus) and cedarwood. As someone who spends 99% of their time in lakes and green spaces, it sounds right up my street, and, at first spritz, it really is.“The initial smell is super fresh, but elevated, like a posh laundry detergent, in the best way. You begin to notice the woody elements a little more as it dries down, and this is where things get complicated. The clash of fresh and woody notes makes it smell a little too home spray-like. It’s a lovely scent, but perhaps a little too piney for my skin. I’d love this in a candle; I prefer something softer and more suggestive in a fragrance. However, if your preference is strong and heady fragrances that last all day, this will be a winner.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop NordstromJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense, $, available at NordstromINITIO Parfums Privés Atomic Rose Hair Perfume“I’ve been on the lookout for a signature hair scent for years. As a petite girlie, I’m convinced that lovely-smelling hair is a great way to make an impactful first impression since most people tower over me and can only see the top of my head. With these new hair mists by INITIO, I’ve landed on the hair fragrance of my dreams. These perfumes are alcohol-free, which means they won’t dry out your ends, while panthenol (vitamin B5) moisturizes the hair and makes it shinier without weighing it down.“Atomic Rose is my favorite out of the range: it casts a veil of jasmine, rose, bergamot, and vanilla that stays on my hair, and I’m hooked on the luxurious floral scent. I keep holding the ends of my hair for a sniff throughout the day, and every person who has hugged me has complimented my smell. It’s still an investment at $91, but the price point is significantly lower than the eau de parfum version, which starts at $240.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromINITIO Atomic Rose Hair Perfume, $, available at NordstromVictoria’s Secret Daring Eau De Parfum“I have a soft spot for Victoria’s Secret perfumes. I think they are quite good across the board and definitely hold their own against fancy designer ones. The latest launch is named Daring, and even before I smelled it, I knew it would be right up my alley. It’s a crisp, woody scent (two words not usually paired together), and features a unique blend of bergamot, amber, and oakmoss for a complex result — bright and verdant at the beginning, but then dries down to reveal sensual earthy notes. I’ve been loving it for fall, since it feels very feminine and elegant (but not in a granny way), but also a little masculine with its oakiness and hint of edge. It also doesn’t hurt that the bottle is the prettiest pale green hue, which is my favorite color.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop Victoria's SecretVictoria's Secret Daring Eau De Parfum, $, available at Victoria's SecretPenhaligon’s The Dandy Eau de Parfum“I only just received The Dandy and I’m already a quarter of the way through the bottle. In fact, I’m calling it: it’s my new signature scent. I’m obsessed with the 1920s (the haircuts, brooding speakeasies, the infamous parties) and The Dandy is what I imagine every stylish flapper girl smelt like. It opens with a splash of whisky (rich and earthy) then makes way for raspberry (tart and floral) but it’s the notes that remain — creamy, musky, skin-like ambrox, rich oak, spicy cedarwood and intoxicating smoke — that make this so special.“On the dry down, the cocktail-esque notes dissipate, and it transforms into something really soothing. Throughout the day, I catch delicious, delicate plumes of it, like the fragrance is simply an extension of me — like clean, powdery skin. The other day, someone chased me off the train (bear in mind it wasn’t their stop) to ask me which perfume I was wearing. It’s really that memorable.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromPenhaligon's The Dandy Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?

    "description": "Growing up in South Florida with three brothers, I didn't care for beauty products or treatments. I played a lot of sports, so sweating + cosmetics = skin disaster. In high school, makeup was not in my vocabulary, and in college, I wore very little foundation and mascara (when I remembered to put it on). My skin routine was pretty simple, too: wash face with soap. Dry face. Perform twice daily. So, when I moved to New York City right out of undergrad, the change in climate and the adjustment to wearing makeup to work every day was a bit of a challenge for my face. Breakouts replaced my once-glowing, sun-kissed skin. And then scars followed. And, naturally, I was not happy. About five years ago, I went and had a Fraxel (a brand of fractional CO2 laser) performed - three times (once per month). It changed my skin texture, completely. I was shocked, amazed, and undoubtedly impressed. My acne scars were significantly decreased - most of them: all gone. It was the super problem-solving laser of my dreams! (Despite the recovery being a nightmare - more on that later.) Since then, I've tried other lasers - such as PicoSure, Clear + Brilliant, etc. - to enhance my skin, which gave me minor results. But I always maintained the belief that CO2 was the holy grail. And even though my skin has vastly improved over the past half decade using other methods, I still wanted to fix a few discolorations and the size of my pores. Also, I'm five years older now, and this baby is great for combating signs of aging. So, to reconfirm my thoughts and get a little touch up, I went to facial plastic surgeon Dr. Andrew Jacono for some zapping. Experts Featured in This Article Andrew Jacono M.D., F.A.C.S., is a double board-certified facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon. He is based in New York. What Is CO2 Fractional Laser? \"A fractional CO2 laser is designed to target aging and damaged skin by creating microscopic 'wounds' within the targeted areas well beneath the skin's outermost layer, which in turn, triggers the body's own natural production of new collagen and skin cells,\" Dr. Jacono tells PS. This sounds painful, as it very well can be on a bare face. Before the procedure, a numbing cream was applied to my clean, product-free cheeks for about 30 minutes. The actual process took less time than the prep - maybe 15 minutes at most (but it differs per person and depends on the area being treated, according to Dr. Shah). I could hear the buzzing of the laser. Only every so often - perhaps once every two and a half minutes - a jolt of pain, which felt like an intense rubber band snapping, would make me teary-eyed. My CO2 Fractional Laser Results My initial experience with CO2 left me hiding in my apartment for almost seven days. It was brutal. This time, I would expect nothing less. So I scheduled my appointment during a time of the year where I could hibernate/be antisocial/work was a bit more calm. \"After a fractional CO2 laser treatment, the majority of patients experience a few days of a sunburn,\" explains Dr. Jacono. And yes, I agree with that. A perforated sunburn. When the laser goes over your face, it creates lines and boxes, almost like graph paper. Immediately after my procedure, redness and swelling ensued. For the next week, I was prescribed an antibiotic and instructed to apply an ointment after washing my face twice daily with a gentle cleanser. I also had to avoid aspirin for 48 hours. Easy enough! After the first day, there was no pain, but my face didn't appear that way. Until day four, I was very visibly red. By day five, I could almost wear makeup again (but I didn't because my face was still peeling. On day seven, I was back to normal). Typically, it takes five to 10 days for recovery, according to Dr. Shah. At the end of my CO2 journey, my face looked clearer of discoloration, my pores were less visible, and my friends and I were in awe of my results (my downtime, not so much). According to Dr. Jacono, CO2 not covered by insurance will cost $2,000 to $5,000 per session, depending on severity. Three to six sessions are typically recommended. While it's a pricey procedure and makes you a bit less social for a couple of days, I found it worth it. I might not need five more sessions, but if I do, there's no doubt I would go back again.
