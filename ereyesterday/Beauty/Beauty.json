    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.With our Halloween outfits and vampy makeup locked away for another year, our heads are now firmly turning towards the practical parts of our wardrobe that work for all weather eventualities. Think striped sweaters, blanket scarves, and heavy-duty boots. But staying warm doesn’t mean dressing like you’re about to climb a mountain.This season, plenty of It Girls are inspiring our freezing fashion looks for the winter months ahead. For those seeking a chic and refined look, the Olsen twins remain superior thanks to their arsenal of tailored coats, turtlenecks, and classic loafers. If you want a cozier option, Katie Holmes is an ideal reference point for slouchy cardigans, well-fitting jeans, and low-heeled leather boots. A more elevated approach would be Taylor Russell, our inspo for all-out cold-girl glamor with caramel-colored coats, faux fur scarves, and gold statement jewelry. Then there’s makeup, and it’s safe to say that we’re embracing all things warm and glossy. Hailey Bieber is leading the mood board with a pumpkin spice-inspired lip and glowy peach cheeks. And for hair makeovers, we can’t take our eyes off Rihanna’s curls, dyed a very seasonal shade of autumn leaf. To uncover all the new fashion and beauty launches that are giving us even more inspiration this November, click through the slideshow ahead…Disney x Lululemon Good vibes await courtesy of the new Disney x Lululemon collab, which finds your favorite comfy pieces from the activewear brand adorned with playful Mickey Mouse motifs.

For the collection, the Noah team dug into Barbour’s archives and reimagined popular styles from the ’80s. There’s the unisex Wool Bedale Jacket, which features a corduroy collar and is made with Casentino wool (a fuzzy fabric dating back to the 14th century); the Cotton Bedale, with the same silhouette but in a salt-washed cotton canvas; and the Border Jacket, a longer tweed style. “For this season’s Barbour collection, we stuck to the classic jacket shapes we’ve always loved from them,” Noah founder Brendon Babenzien said in a press release. “Barbour jackets, more than any other, have a timeless quality that allows them to get passed down from one generation to the next.” The Noah x Barbour collab is available to shop now.Shop now at Noah and BarbourNoah x Barbour Wool Teddy Bedale Jacket, $, available at NoahMerit Retrospect Extrait de ParfumMerit is well loved for its beautifully crafted makeup products and now the brand is expanding into the fragrance space with a vanilla and crisp pear perfume.

    "description": "As a curly girl with coarse, dry, 3C strands, I always struggled to find products that did anything positive for my hair. Trust me, the Mufasa mane was real any time I would try your typical run-of-the-mill salon brand — it just didn’t work. Unfortunately, many other Black women tell me they’ve had similar experiences and that it’s frustrating trying to find what truly works for coarser hair textures. Enter: SheaMoisture. I’d honestly given up hope until I wandered into my local Target one day and decided to pick up a few products from the brand. I’d heard only positive things about it from my fellow curlies because it’s affordable and the formulas *actually* work. SheaMoisture products are designed with my hair type in mind — curly and coily textures that need more hydration than average to remain soft, frizz-free, and easy to manage.Another thing you should know about my hair is that I have a lot of it, so if I use the wrong products, things can go south very quickly. This made me skeptical at first to try anything new, but I decided to give the brand’s Manuka Honey \u0026 Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Treatment a go along with the leave-in. I was impressed. The two treatments are staples of mine to this day and I use them weekly. They both keep my hair so soft, tangle-free, shiny, and hydrated. I couldn’t ask for a better duo.Needless to say, I’d finally found relief and now that the holiday season has rolled around, I can now share this gift of next-level hair with someone else. If you have a friend or family member with a similar hair type, I’m here to provide your SheaMoisture gift guide featuring every key product they’ll love. Anyone whose hair is their pride and glory won’t be disappointed — including yourself if you’re looking to snag yourself a holiday treat. For everything I’m gifting from the brand this season, take a look ahead.Bond Repair Leave-In ConditionerFor anyone on your list who’s dealing with dryness, split ends, breakage, or chemical damage, SheaMoisture’s Bond Repair Leave-In Conditioner is just the ticket. It’s infused with amla oil, a restorative HydroPlex infusion, shea butter, and an amino acid blend that provides some serious TLC when it comes to hydration. On wet hair, it provides 12 times more moisture than normal and eight times more on dry hair. Detangling and smoothing curly and coily textures is a breeze when you use it and it even assists with humidity control.SheaMoisture Bond Repair Leave-In Conditioner, $, available at WalmartBonding OilIf your best friend happens to heat style daily, then this Bonding Oil is a must. It’s super lightweight but contains hydration heavy-hitters similar to the leave-in (shea butter and amla oil). The addition of sunflower, castor, and grapeseed oils in this formula, though, really helps lock in moisture and seal the hair cuticle against styling damage. Flyaways are also no match for it with 24-hour frizz control.SheaMoisture Bonding Oil, $, available at WalmartBond Repair ShampooOkay — you caught me. I’ll be buying this Bond Repair Shampoo for myself because it’s perfect for my hair type. It’s formulated for curl and coil types three and four and contains the brand’s unique amino acid blend. This ensures that the hair retains 60% more moisture and removes buildup without stripping it of its natural oils. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Shampoo, $, available at WalmartBond Repair ConditionerI have several family members who relaxed their hair recently and didn’t love the results (it left their strands damaged), so I know this conditioner will be perfect for them. It’s part of the brand’s four-step repair system along with the other Bond Repair collection items I mentioned. It really adds that extra moisture and softness to strands that are coarse or brittle while working to repair broken hair bonds. As a bonus, it’s also great for protective styles.SheaMoisture Bond Repair Conditioner, $, available at WalmartCoconut \u0026 Hibiscus Curl-Enhancing SmoothieThis is a classic SheaMoisture favorite that I loved when I started my natural hair journey because it’s perfect for leaving my thick curls defined. If you have a sibling with a similar hair type as you, don’t hesitate to buy it for them this holiday season. It’s packed with super hydrators like neem oil, coconut oil, and silk protein — a winning trio for dry, coarse curl types.SheaMoisture Coconut \u0026 Hibiscus Curl-Enhancing Smoothie, $, available at WalmartCoconut \u0026 Hibiscus Frizz-Free Curl MousseI know you have curly-haired friends who complain about the crunchiness that comes with using gel for definition. This gift will be their new holy grail because it completely solves that issue. The super lightweight, airy texture enhances natural curls and waves without weighing them down while adding much needed shine and volume.SheaMoisture Coconut \u0026 Hibiscus Frizz-Free Curl Mousse, $, available at WalmartCoconut \u0026 Hibiscus Smooth \u0026 Shine OilAccording to my friends who only wear protective styles, this lightweight oil is the GOAT. It helps keep baby hairs in place and adds shine without making your hair look greasy. Obviously, I’ll be buying quite a few this holiday season to fully stock them up.SheaMoisture Coconut \u0026 Hibiscus Smooth \u0026 Shine Oil, $, available at WalmartRosemary \u0026 Collagen Strengthening Scalp \u0026 Hair OilThis Rosemary \u0026 Collagen Strengthening Oil makes a great stocking stuffer for someone dealing with breakage or anyone who wants to promote healthy hair growth. Rosemary leaf oil is known to encourage length retention and this lightweight formula contains other hydration heroes like castor oil, soybean oil, and shea butter for healthier strands.SheaMoisture Rosemary \u0026 Collagen Strengthening Scalp \u0026 Hair Oil, $, available at WalmartLike what you see?

    "title": "Face-Framing Layers Can Completely Transform Your Haircut",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/face-framing-layers-49106312",
    "description": "One way to spice up any old haircut is with layers. Whether you have a U-shaped haircut or a classic bob, adding layers instantly makes the style feel fresh and new. It's important to note: not all layers are the same - it's more of a category, similar to how there's not one style of bangs. Some add volume, others remove weight, and then there are those that surround your face like a picture, drawing attention to your best features. Those are called face-framing layers. Even the classification of face-framing layers is vast, and there are several factors that can influence the final look. Different haircuts, hair types, and face shapes call for a slightly different approach. That's why it's imperative that you see a professional for this type of cut. Face-framing layers should be tailored to the wearer and when done correctly, have the power to completely change your hairstyle - even if you barely alter the style itself. What Are Face-Framing Layers? Face-framing layers simply border the face. They can be long and seamlessly blended, making them barely noticeable, or they can be short and choppy to make a big statement. Bangs don't always come attached to layers, but they are a great addition. For example, curtain bangs mimic the effect of face-framing layers, but they're shorter, reaching only cheekbone length. To differentiate true layers from bangs, they need to be longer. Many of the popular haircut trends of today are all about layering. This includes the shag, \"wolf cut,\" cub cut, and C-shape haircut, to list just a few. Face-framing layers can help remove weight from the front of your hair, adding more body and movement or, on the other hand, make your hair look fuller by adding texture. Most of all, they're very flattering and can accentuate your eyes, cheekbones, and jawline, depending on the length.
