    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "You don’t need me to tell you that Korean skincare is in a league of its own. For years, brands like Dr. Jart+, Beauty of Joseon, and CosRx (snail mucin, anyone?) have reigned supreme among skincare enthusiasts and dermatologists alike. And there’s good reason for that. Rather than wrecking skin with harsh acids and strong retinoids that often irritate, K-beauty prioritizes a healthy skin barrier, focusing on hydration, repair, and gentle exfoliation. While there are heaps of Korean skincare brands to choose from these days, only one has cut through the noise lately. Enter: belif.  The brand has been available at Sephora for a while now. In fact, it’s pretty well-known — some might say famous — among skincare enthusiasts. When it launched last September, The Aqua Bomb Eye Gel, $32, was the number one bestseller at the retailer, beating brands like Glow Recipe and innisfree, to name a few.  As a skincare obsessive, I had to see what all the hype was about — and I think I might have found my new favorite brand. I’m serious: belif has just replaced most of the skincare products in my routine. It’s that good.  Here’s my review of a handful of products in the bursting collection, including the two I recommend to everyone I meet.  DashDividers_1_500x100 belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb, $38 This moisturizer has seriously saved my skin lately — it’s officially earned a spot in my hall of fame. Before this, I was using a $70 lotion that just wasn’t cutting it. My skin felt tight after applying it, and even though it had a light texture, I’m convinced it was exacerbating my hormonal acne. By contrast, this one has a much more cushiony feel, and it’s exactly what my dull, dehydrated skin was crying out for. The key ingredients — moisturizing glycerin and squalane, skin-strengthening peptides, and repairing ceramides — work together to heal and maintain the skin barrier (the outermost layer that locks in moisture and keeps bacteria out). Despite all that goodness, it’s featherlight and sinks in within moments, so I can go straight in with sunscreen or makeup without it pilling. I’m always surprised by the glow it gives, like I’ve just had a professional facial. It’s so good, I actually look forward to using it. That’s saying something, because despite my job, I often dread doing my skincare, especially in the evening, when all I want to do is flop into bed and scroll TikTok. I use it morning and night, and recommend it to all of my friends and family in the market for a new, no-frills face lotion.   belif Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser, $22 While this cleanser is a bit pricier than others I love — like The Ordinary’s Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, $12.50, and The Inkey List’s Oat Cleansing Balm, $7, — you only need the tiniest squeeze to cleanse your skin, whether you’re using it at the end of the day to melt away makeup and sunscreen, or first thing in the morning for a quick, gentle refresh. Hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin ensure my face doesn’t feel like it might shatter into a million pieces (you know the feeling), even though it turns into a rich foam on contact with water. Since using this, I’m convinced my skin has become smoother and clearer. Honestly, Korean cleansers are elite, but here’s how I know a product is truly excellent: when I catch my partner (famously finicky with skincare) using it too. belif Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask, $38 We’ve all been sleeping on sleeping masks. This one feels more like a moisture-rich night cream, minus the sticky residue, than a heavy face mask. It sinks in quickly, delivering hydration right where your skin needs it most. When I want to level up my routine, I apply it before any high-strength retinols to create a subtle barrier. When I do this, I don’t get any flaking or irritation. belif Super Drops Retinol \u0026 Peptide Barrier Serum, $34 It’s rare to come across a serum that does it all, especially at this price point. The star ingredients are retinol, which helps refresh and renew the skin by encouraging cell turnover, and peptides, which are proteins that smooth skin texture and soften fine lines. That said, both are fairly low on the ingredients list, but that doesn’t mean it’s a write-off. Far from it. Beyond retinol, there’s niacinamide, which helps minimise the look of large pores, controls excess oil, and brightens over time. You’ll also find arginine, a natural moisturizing factor already present in our skin, and ceramide NP, which keeps the skin barrier strong so it stays soft and smooth, not parched and flaky. In other words, it’s an all-rounder. I use this on days when I want to give my skin a break from higher-strength actives but don’t want to stop entirely. belif Aqua Bomb Eye Gel, $32 I’m notoriously anti-eye cream — I’ve always believed that taking your moisturizer up to your under-eyes and eyelids is more than enough. But this one is convincing me there’s real value in a dedicated product; so much so, I’ve already finished a full tube of it. It’s packed with brightening ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, both known for minimizing hyperpigmentation. But in my experience, the real benefit is the ability to keep moisture under lock and key. Alongside glycerin, it contains sodium hyaluronate — a smarter version of hyaluronic acid with smaller molecules that sink into the skin more effectively. Because hyaluronic acid plumps the skin, I’ve noticed a real reduction in the faint dehydration fine lines under my eyes, especially when I wear concealer. I no longer have to fish it out of creases throughout the day. The cooling applicator is the cherry on top, especially if you wake up puffy like me, but I usually use my ring finger to gently tap the cream in until it’s absorbed. belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb, $38 This is the face lotion I recommend to everyone with oily skin. It has a gel texture that disappears in seconds, yet it’s surprisingly moisturizing — thanks to a clever mix of ingredients. Glycerin, shea butter, ceramides, and squalane are top-tier moisturizing components, so it’s almost sorcery that it feels so lightweight. It’s the ultimate moisturizer to use under sunscreen in summer, especially if your skin gets greasy or clogged in the heat. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/paris-hilton-beauty-interview-49442060",
    "description": "Image Source: Coutesy of Parivie and Paris Hilton It's the first sunny afternoon in New York after days of foggy rain, and Paris Hilton is launching her skin-care line, Parívie, with a rooftop party at Zero Bond, a celebrity hotspot in New York City. It seems almost too perfect. Hours before the party, Hilton walks into our interview in an all-pink ensemble, as if she personally banished the grey weather herself. She enters with a team of people, but they aren't pulling out chairs for her or fluffing her hair. Instead, they look at me and ask Hilton and me to pose for a Polaroid. Someone on her team asks her to sign it for me and she doesn't struggle to remember my name - she asks me how I spell my version of Brittany: \"N-E-Y or A-N-Y?\" making sure to get it right. She's intimidatingly beautiful, but within the first moments of our conversation, I feel myself relax. She's almost unimaginably approachable. She's not speaking in her \"Simple Life\"-era character voice; she's just another beauty-obsessed girl eager to gab about skin care. And, like Hilton, that's something I could go on about all day. Although Hilton has over 19 product lines, ranging from fragrances to cookware, Parívie is the first one in which she's the majority stakeholder. To make it all happen, she partnered with Alexandra Marsh, a startup and beauty brand veteran who was the former vice president of acquisition at Gunthy Renker. \"I've been in the product industry for a very long time now,\" says Hilton. \"I just celebrated my 20-year anniversary, my 30th fragrance, Iconic, and it's just all perfect timing. I've traveled the world, tried all of the best products, work at the best. I knew exactly what I wanted when I was creating this line.\" Image Source: Parvie/Paris Hilton Hilton's main goal was to create something that actually works. For this, the brand is banking on its bioactive complex (which they're calling inPHinite Youth Technology), found in products like the That's Tight Plumping Vitality Serum ($125) and the That's Quenched Barrier Support Crème ($64). \"It has this Benjamin Button effect,\" says Hilton, alluding to its ability to help you age in reverse. The complex is made up of next-generation peptides (including a peptide that was discovered by AI), potent antioxidants, and probiotic-fermented extracts that boost ingredient efficacy, help repair the skin barrier, and counteract visible signs of stress and screen time, according to the brand. With this line, \"I'm thinking about the health from the inside out,\" says Hilton. If she had to choose a favorite in the product lineup, it would be the That's Tight Plumping Vitality Serum that she called \"the ultimate multitasker, just like me.\" Famously, Hilton claims she's never gotten Botox or filler (it's hard to imagine an average NYC girl rejecting Botox, let alone a celebrity), but that doesn't mean she shies away from aesthetic treatments altogether. \"I feel that if you are preventative - plus I'm obsessed with beauty tech - there are just other ways,\" says Hilton. \"I'm really proud that I listened to my mom [and have had] a skin-care routine since I was 8 years old. I've been obsessed with it. [My mom] said to stay out of the sun and I'm such an undercover nerd and find out everything to do with the new tech gadgets that actually work.\" Hilton has built an entire at-home spa called the Sliving Spa that allows her to pamper herself 24/7. One of her favorite treatments that she has access to in her spa is the Hydrafacial, which is editor-loved. But it doesn't end there. \"I love the cryo chamber, which I go in every morning - four people can fit in it,\" Hilton says. \"And then the four-person hyperbaric chamber, which is an oxygen chamber.\" She also loves her Neo Light, which is a red light bed. Most recently, she added a Geneo X facial machine to the mix. The list goes on. As fun as it is to metaphorically step inside the Sliving Spa, as someone who grew up in the 2000s, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask Hilton about the iconic era, known for flip phones, body glitter, and haphazard makeup looks. It was an era when skin care wasn't nearly as advanced, and Sephora hadn't yet taken off. \"It was horrible,\" she says, reminiscing on the beauty sins she committed when she didn't know any better (which may have included a certain apricot scrub that we know too well). \"It's amazing how far science has come,\" Hilton says. Image Source: Getty/VALERY HACHE/AFP It wasn't all bad, though. \"I invented Y2K, I'm the blueprint,\" says Hilton. \"It's so fun seeing so many people recreating my looks - I just feel like I was always very ahead of my time in so many ways. Especially with fashion and now just to see so many people inspired by it just makes me feel really happy.\" But there's one Y2K look, in particular, that still makes many of us shudder - the fully lined black smoky liner that surrounded the entire eye. Surely she regretted that look, right? \"No, not at all,\" says Hilton. \"I love that trend. I would literally just be on my way to the club in the back of the car, not even looking in the mirror, and it looks so hot.\" She does have a way of making it sound fun. I'm instantly transported back to a time pre-social media of \"going out tops\" and grainy selfies taken on Blackberry phones. And suddenly, I'm reaching for my black smoky eye pencil again.

    "title": "The \"Topanga\" Haircut Was a Total Game Changer For My Fine Hair",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/topanga-haircut-editor-experiment-49318319",
    "description": "Ever since coloring my hair this summer, I've noticed that my ends look dry and frizzy almost constantly. I've been using hair masks and a few treatments off and on that have helped, but ultimately, I knew what I really needed was a cut. When figuring out which one would be best for me, after doing hours of research, I settled on the \"Topanga.\" The Topanga haircut recently went viral on TikTok, and although the voluminous '90s style is really nothing new, it's become the go-to look for anyone who wants a healthy chop but doesn't want to sacrifice bounce and movement. \"The Topanga haircut refers to a hairstyle inspired by the character Topanga Lawrence from the TV show 'Boy Meets World,'\" Abby Haliti, founder of Abby Halite Color Studio, says. It typically features a mid-length cut roughly five inches below the collarbone, with lots of layers. Experts Featured in This Article Andrea Henty is a celebrity hairstylist and owner of Bomane Salon in Los Angeles. Abby Haliti is the founder of Abby Halite Color Studio. I've been trying to grow my hair out for the past year, but I knew that I was going to need to take off some length in order to get the look I wanted, so I visited Andrea Henty at Bomane Salon in Beverly Hills to help me achieve my hair goals. We sat down to discuss what I wanted to do, and Henty said we'd need to cut a bit of length off to get it looking healthy again, but that she would be able to customize the style for me so that it would work with my hair type. The Topanga cut can be tricky on fine hair because layers can make it appear thinner, which I wanted to avoid. In order to make it work for me, Henty gave me a dry cut so she could see how my hair would fall. \"For the cut we really want to get that signature Topanga vibe we've all seen on TikTok, so we're taking about two and a half inches off of the length, which will make it more blunt and make everything look a lot more full,\" Henty says. She also cleaned up my face-framing layers as well as the ones all around my head, so I would have lots of movement. From there, we made our way over the shampoo bowl. \"I really like the Unite Luxury Shampoo ($43) and the Unite Luxury Conditioner ($48), because they make your hair feel very luxurious and very soft, and they also feel very light which is important for your cut,\" Henty says. \"You want to make sure the layers have life and they're not being weighed down by heavy products.\" After washing and conditioning my hair, we prepped it using the Unite 7Seconds Detangler ($38), which is my favorite product for detangling and protecting from heat. Next, we separated my hair and began blowdrying it. Her team used round brushes to blow sections of my hair dry with a blow dryer, and then they wrapped them inward to create a pin curl, which they secured to my head. After letting everything cool for a few minutes, they took the pin curls out and brushed them out. The final result looked bouncier, healthier, and shinier than it had in months. Plus, my hair has been so much easier to maintain at home. I've found that this style looks nice air-dried, but it looks the best when I give myself a blowout or loose waves. When styling at home, I typically start out by rough-drying my hair using a blow dryer like the T3 Aireluxe ($210), and then I either go in with the round brush attachment on my Dyson Airwrap ($599) and set everything using velcro rollers, or I curl my hair using a 1.5-inch curling iron like the T3 SinglePass ($170). If you've been looking for a cut to bring your hair new life but you don't want to sacrifice too much length or movement, ask your stylist about the Topanga haircut.
