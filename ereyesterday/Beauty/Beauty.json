    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/eltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf-46-review-49422176",
    "description": "Almost every skin-care professional will tell you that a good face wash and quality sunscreen are essential for a good skin-care routine. Although there are plenty of sunscreens on the market, most dermatologists recommend EltaMD's lineup, specifically the UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($44). It's sensitive-skin-friendly and has an oil-free formula that is non-comedogenic, according to the brand. As a 30-year-old who's been going to the dermatologist since age 13, I have been recommended EltaMD's UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 countless times. Although I've always loved how it doesn't exacerbate my acne, I've never been a fan of the white cast it leaves behind. But luckily, EltaMD came out with two tinted versions of its bestselling UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 in 2024. Ahead, I test the original, untinted UV Clear SPF 46, the Tinted UV Clear SPF 46 ($46), and the Deep Tinted UV Clear SPF 46 ($46) sunscreens. Keep reading to see why this brand is worth the hype, and whether the tinted versions reign supreme. About the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46: It is a hybrid chemical and physical sunscreen formulated with nine percent zinc oxide and 7.5 percent octinoxate, providing broad-spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 46 protection. The sunscreen is an oil-free formula containing niacinamide, vitamin E, lactic acid, and hyaluronic acid. It is available in three formats: untinted, tinted, and deep tinted. The sunscreen is ideal for those with oily to combination skin, acne-prone skin, rosacea-prone skin, and sensitive skin. What I Like About the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46: I've tried and tested plenty of sunscreens through the years, and I've noticed that mineral sunscreens leave some sort of white cast (even if it's subtle) unless they are tinted dark enough to match my tan skin. The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a unique hybrid formula that uses both physical and chemical UV filters so that its application - along with the look and feel - are more elegant on the skin compared to others on the market. The oil-free formula goes on thick and opaque but dries down to a demi-matte finish. It feels deeply hydrating on the skin but not heavy, especially during the colder months when my skin leans a bit drier. I've also noticed that some mineral formulations tend to break me out, but the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 does not clog my pores or make my skin feel congested. This sunscreen seemingly creates a barrier on my skin, similar to a makeup primer, shielding it from external dust, pollutants, and UV rays. Using the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 makes me feel like my skin is actually getting the broad spectrum SPF coverage it needs. Although the untinted UV Clear SPF and the Tinted UV Clear SPF do leave a minor white cast on my skin, it isn't as bad as 100 percent mineral-based formulas by comparison. The Deep Tinted UV Clear SPF blends into a nearly-exact match to my skin tone. Since it provides enough coverage, I don't have to wear foundation and just use spot concealer instead. If you have a fair to medium skin tone, the Tinted UV Clear SPF is a better match. How to Use the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Using the two-finger rule, I measure out the sunscreen for optimal coverage and blend it into my skin. Because of its thick consistency, I suggest applying the sunscreen in layers so that it isn't overwhelming to blend out. For a streak-free look, I dust some setting powder on top. The Deep Tint UV Clear adds a decent amount of coverage to my complexion that evens out my skin, so I follow it up with my go-to color corrector and concealer for a natural makeup look. What to Consider Before Trying the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a thicker consistency compared to other options on the market, especially those that are purely chemical-based or K-Beauty inspired. It might not be the ideal formulation for those who prefer a weightless, moisturizer-like feel. If you have a tan to dark skin tone like I do, the untinted and the light tint may give you a bit of a white cast, so it's best to go with the deep tinted SPF. Both the untinted and tinted versions of the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 are on the pricier side, ringing in at $44 and $46, respectively. Given how much sunscreen you need to apply daily, this isn't as affordable as other options on the market. I'd suggest saving this sunscreen for days with higher UV index numbers or when your skin is more sensitive due to facials, chemical peels, lasers, or other professional treatments. Where Is the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Available? The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 in untinted, tinted, and deep tinted formulas are available on the brand's site, Amazon, and Dermstore.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/blue-nail-theory-49422003",
    "description": "Staying current on social media trends is no easy feat. Every day, a new concept or technique seems to make waves on the internet. The latest? The \"blue nail theory.\" If you're curious about this, you're not the only one; it was one of the top 10 trending searches on Google in 2024. As it turns out, the blue nail theory isn't too dissimilar from the viral \"red nail theory.\" It has to do with your nail polish color and what it signifies. To learn more about this phenomenon, keep reading. Experts Featured in This Article Mi Nguyen is a nail artist and licensed master nail educator based in Charlotte, North Carolina. What Is the Blue Nail Theory? According to blue nail theory, if you ask your partner what color you should paint your nails, there's a strong chance their answer will be blue if they're a man. Many people recorded videos asking their significant others this very question to test it. Sabrina Smith was told \"light blue\" in the video she posted, while Hollie Thompson shared a similar experience with her partner in a different video. Some people say that blue nails are a code to signify your relationship status, letting others know you're off the market with just a glance at your fingertips. Though it may have started as a coincidence, it has evolved into the trend that we see on social media. To tap into the blue nail theory, whether you're in a relationship or not, nail artist Mi Nguyen recommends opting for soft blues and pastels. \"It can symbolize that you're calm and settled,\" she says. In general, blue nails have increasingly grown in popularity recently. Nguyen believes the interest in the shade is due, in part, to Sofia Richie and other celebrities who spearheaded the \"blueberry-milk\" nail trend. \"Blues used to be a color people thought was a bit wild, but on the contrary, it actually can be very chic and classy.\" Sydney Wingfield has been a freelance writer in the beauty and wellness space for six years.

    "title": "16 Hair Color Trends That’ll Take Over Salons This Year, According To Experts",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-color-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If your New Year’s resolution is to be braver, let top hair colorists lead the way. This January and beyond, you can expect an abundance of both striking and totally wearable hair color trends to infiltrate salons.  From mocha mousse (which takes its cue from Pantone’s Color of the Year for 2025) to amber blonde (a more muted take on the bold copper tones that dominated previous months), there’s something for everyone — whether you’re willing to put in the work to maintain your chosen hue or you’re a shampoo-and-go kind of person. DashDividers_1_500x100 Microlights View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ayesha Marr (@ayeshamarr) This year, blonde hair trends are going to be more natural and lived in, reports Nina Brown, senior colorist at Neil Moodie Studio — and they’ll take inspiration from no-makeup makeup. “This is achieved by a very subtle balayage technique [known as] babylights,” which are highlights on very thin strands of hair. “It’s like no-color color,” says Brown, “and the tones are moving more towards honey and strawberry blonde vibes.” This color on Ayesha Marr by BLEACH London is beautiful.  Airy Lights View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amelia Swaby (@ameliaswaby) Imagined by celebrity colorists Zoë Irwin and Nicola Clarke at John Frieda, airy lights are essentially teeny tiny blonde highlights that are dotted along both sides of the [hair part] and carefully laid over a darker tone for contrast, as seen on model Amelia Swaby. “These micro lights are really super fine,” says Irwin, “and the deepness underneath is important.” This means that it doesn’t look “manufactured”, says Clarke. “Instead, it’s so natural that it’s like [the highlights] are growing out of the scalp [as individual hair strands].” Depending on the shade of blonde, airy lights have many nuances, which leads us nicely onto the next trend… Oat Cendré View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) The French word “cendré” translates into English as “bonfire ashes” — a mix of grey and black tones. Oat cendré, then, is essentially a mix of ash blonde and creamy, oat milky tones. Look to this shade by Ryenne Snow. “This trend is all to do with the rise of the super natural, mid-blonde hue,” says Irwin, “and again, deeper tones lie underneath it.” Both Clarke and Irwin reference Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence.  Taupe Cendré View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sophia Karayiannis (@colourbyfie) The last hair color trend in the airy lights dynasty is taupe cendré — a dark blonde shade better suited to brunettes, like this color on digital creator Issy Sedgwick by Sophia Karayiannis. “There has been a surge in mid or ‘mousy’ blonde,” says Irwin, “but we prefer to call it taupe cendré [thanks to the] beige-y ash tones within this color.” When painting taupe airy lights onto darker hair, Clarke and Irwin never take the color all the way to the root. Stopping just short of the hair part lends a halo effect, says Clarke, as though there’s a ring light above your head.  Monobrown View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✨⛓ 𝔎𝔞𝔱𝔱𝔶𝔞 𝔐𝔞𝔯𝔠𝔢𝔩𝔞 ℌ𝔢𝔯𝔫𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔷 ⛓✨ (@dreamhairbycelaa) Tom Smith, a hairstylist and trend forecaster, notes that in the latter half of 2024, many of us ditched the lighter tones and went brunette. Take smoky brunette and candlelit brunette, for example. “There were lots of slightly different tones of deep brunette,” says Smith. “Some warmer, some more neutral and cooler, but the characteristic that they all share is that monochromatic finish.”  Enter: monobrown, a one-dimensional brunette color in its “most authentic” form rather than with heaps of highlights or lowlights. “[Monobrown is] very much a focus on healthy, glossy, monochromatic brunette,” says Smith. Look to this shade on a client of colorist and stylist Kattya Marcela Hernandez. Russet Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) Zoe Adams, international artist at Taylor Taylor London, says that while copper has long been a staple for autumn and winter, the salon demand has never been so high. “We’re seeing a full embrace of coppers, auburns and reds in the salon this season — and I see no sign of this trend slowing down into 2025.” Besides the diluted strawberry blonde hue as seen on Emma Stone at this year’s Golden Globes, Adams predicts that russet — a matte red erring on brown — will also take hold. “Our colorists are mixing softer, cooler tones into copper; you want to avoid anything veering towards orange.” Take inspiration from this shade on a client of Ryenne Snow.  Amber Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Z (@_zfemi) If the above is a little too bold for your liking, consider a more muted shade like amber blonde, composed of similar auburn undertones. “We’ll continue to see warm blondes triumph over icy tones in 2025,” says Siobhan Haug, cofounder of Haug London Haus. “This premium blonde blends honey, gold and a touch of auburn for a long-lasting, luminous tone,” says Haug. “It’s perfect for anyone who wants to stay lighter for winter but needs a break from bleaching.” Haug suggests asking your colorist for a glossing toner over blonde highlights or an all-over blonde color. We love this shade on makeup artist and model Z.  Sunflower Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Blonding Specialist Albuquerque (@hair_by_michellel) Smith recalls a time when gold and yellow tones were dismissed in salons. “They were characteristic of a badly done blonde,” he says. “But when you intentionally add golden tones into the hair, it has a very healthy, shiny, glowy and vibrant effect.”  Sunflower blonde is as warm and intense as blonde can be before it tips into strawberry blonde or copper territory, says Smith, like this shade by blonde specialist Michelle. Vibro-Reds  View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) “Hyper pigments like these tend to have a bad rap,” says Irwin, not least because they’re difficult to get rid of if you happen to change your mind — especially if you want to go lighter. She continues, “Actually, though, these reds can be super high fashion. Think Chappell Roan.” Clarke agrees: “Vibro-red is almost ‘80s-inspired with a mix of both copper and red.” Check out this shade on another client of hair artist Ryenne Snow.  Not So Boring Beige View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hairstylist ✂️ (@hairbyalyssaa_) Far from bland, beige is shaping up to be a big trend in 2025, says Caroline Spencer, senior color director at House of Sassoon, adding, “It offers a versatile and chic aesthetic that complements a range of skin tones.” Spencer points out that the trend’s popularity has been reflected on multiple runways, most notably Chloé AW24. Even Pantone’s Color of the Year — mocha mousse — takes a cue. “Whether it’s a light champagne beige or a rich chocolate beige, the adaptability of beige tones allows you to customize the look to suit your personal style and base color,” says Spencer. We love this shade posted to Instagram by hairstylist Alyssa. Iced Chocolate View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) Beige doesn’t always mean blonde. Spencer predicts we’ll spot the tone mixed into rich chocolate shades to create a dusty brunette hue that suits all skin tones, much like this color on Ryenne Snow.  Milk Tea View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jonny salon (@jonny_salon) Following on from beige, searches for “milk tea hair color” are on the rise this month, but your colorist will know it as dark ash blonde. This shade posted to Instagram by Jonny Salon illustrates the trend perfectly. Invest in a nourishing hair oil to enhance shine, like Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Huile Originale Hair Oil, $46. Bleach Dipping View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amira (@amira.locs) Rope twists, locs and twist-outs are the perfect styles for “bleach dipping”, say Irwin and Clarke, essentially dipped blonde ends. When you have bleached pieces like this, you can change the color really easily with a hair gloss or a temporary dye if you want to have fun and switch things up. Take inspo from Amira on Instagram. Heritage Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Live True London Salons (@livetruelondon) “Heritage blonde is not just cool in tone but also in [attitude],” says Smith. “[Compared to sunflower blonde], it’s more understated and relaxed.” It consists of various neutral tones woven into the hair almost like tweed. “When it comes to heritage blonde, you can’t see the story of where the color begins and ends,” says Smith. “It’s much more fluid and blended, and it doesn’t necessarily look like it’s been freshly done — nor does it look like it’s grown out. It’s definitely dirtier and more antique-looking,” hence the word “heritage”. It’s perfect for those who like low-maintenance hair color. Look to this shade by Sofia at Live True London Soho.  Terracopper View this post on Instagram A post shared by Michelle Thompson Hairstylist (@michellethompsonhair) Forget cowgirl copper. This year it’s all about terracopper — terracotta meets copper — which is earthier and deeper than traditional copper shades we’ve seen previously. “[This] winter, it’s getting even more vibrant,” says Smith. Take inspiration from this shade on Z, posted to Instagram by award-winning afro and textured hair specialist Michelle Thompson. “It’s not dark or really dense,” adds Smith. “It’s almost got a rose gold quality [to it] so it’s a really interesting shade, and it’s something that I think more people are going to be playing with.” It requires maintenance, though. Smith recommends investing in color-boosting conditioners or masks that contain red and copper tones to top up your hue. Try Moroccanoil Color Depositing Mask, $40.50, available in various shades. La Belle Bohème View this post on Instagram A post shared by PERTH BLONDE SPECIALIST SALON (@vivalablonde) The iconic photos of Kate Moss at Glastonbury festival serve as the ultimate inspiration behind the boho blonde hair color trend that flooded salons until recently. Fast-forward to 2025 and the shade has had a chic upgrade. “The blonde is more muted and sophisticated; it’s a fine lightness that only comes from the [hair part] section.” The hair is a lot deeper underneath, which makes it look luxe. “This lightness is almost like a veil on top,” says Clarke, much like this shade by Viva La Blonde.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Buying a luxury perfume is as much about the fantasy as the scent itself. More often than not, you’re paying for the name, the allure that comes with a much-coveted item and, let’s be honest, the pretty bottle that looks great on your nightstand. But what if you don’t care about all the extras? What if you just want to smell amazing without dropping hundreds of dollars? For those who don’t have a case of perfume elitism, this is where Dossier comes in. Much like Oakcha’s perfume dupes, the affordable fragrance brand has quickly gained viral status on TikTok for its spot-on recreations of high-end scents — all at $59 or less. Ambery Saffron, $49, a cheaper alternative to Baccarat Rouge 540, $210, is a particular favorite, racking up hundreds of thousands of TikTok views in blindfolded perfume tests. As beauty editors who own both the original designer perfumes and Dossier’s versions, we’ve done the side-by-side sniff test, and let us tell you — these fragrances deliver. Ahead, we highlight the best Dossier perfumes that replicate cult-favorite scents with none of the sticker shock. DashDividers_1_500x100 Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum The designer: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540, $210 for 1.2 oz The dupe: Dossier Ambery Saffron, $49 for 1.7 oz “Don’t ask me why, but most Baccarat Rouge dupes I’ve tried (Oakcha’s Sweven, Zara’s Red Temptation) all have a hint of burnt plastic to them. At first spritz, Dossier’s Ambery Saffron follows suit, but on the dry down — after about 30 minutes of wear — it becomes indistinguishable from its high-end counterpart. In a smell test where I sprayed one wrist with Baccarat Rouge and the other with Ambery Saffron, I really struggled to tell the difference. The only distinction is the staying power. I sprayed my coat with Baccarat Rouge last year and when I got it out of the wardrobe a few weeks ago, the smell immediately hit me. Ambery Saffron wears off quicker, but it really is close, and considering it’s a snip of the price, you won’t feel guilty about how much you use.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Yves Saint Laurent Libre Eau de Parfum The designer: Yves Saint Laurent Libre, $135 for 1.6 oz The dupe: Dossier Floral Lavender, $29 for 1.7 oz “I love spritzing Libre before an important work meeting or a chic girls’ night out. This bold and empowering perfume is a cult classic for a reason, with notes of lavender, white florals, vanilla, musk, and a squeeze of citrus for brightness. Upon first spray, Dossier’s Floral Lavender captures Libre’s lavender-citrus freshness almost note for note. It dries down to a warm floral vanilla that lasts fairly well throughout the day. While it doesn’t have quite the same longevity, its sillage [when a perfume lingers in the air] is moderate, leaving a subtle yet distinct trail. At a fraction of the price, it’s a similar enough experience for me without the high cost.” — Sade Akinsanya, perfume lover and content creator Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Valentino Born In Roma Donna Eau de Parfum The designer: Valentino Born In Roma Donna, $135 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Ambery Jasmine, $39 for 1.7 oz “This is a really nice, warm floral scent. I’ve never tried Dossier before, but this perfume has left a solid first impression. It’s feminine but not too heady, which I find can be the case with white floral scents. As the name suggests, Ambery Jasmine features base notes of amber, vanilla and cashmeran (a synthetic, musky compound), middle notes of jasmine, and top notes of blackcurrant, pink pepper and bergamot. It does indeed remind me of Valentino’s Born In Roma Donna with its mix of warm, musky florals and a touch of fresh fruit. For the price, I think it’s a pretty good alternative. My biggest pain point is that it didn’t last on my skin for longer than an hour or two (it’s touted as ‘long-lasting’ on the website so perhaps other users have fared better than I did). For this reason, this is a perfume I’d experiment with layering to extend or enhance the longevity of the fragrance — not necessarily a deal-breaker, but something to take note of.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Carolina Herrera Good Girl Eau de Parfum The designer: Carolina Herrera Good Girl, $122 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Fruity Almond, $29 for 1.7 oz “Good Girl was one of the first viral fragrances I bought myself a few years ago. The sweet, spicy and seductive scent was truly love at first sniff. Think tonka bean, vanilla and cacao, paired with jasmine, tuberose, almond, coffee and bergamot. It was a combo that I couldn’t get enough of. So how does Dossier’s rendition stack up? Fruity Almond opens with a sweet almond-coffee blend that smells close enough, but the notes of cigar are missing. It dries down to a creamy vanilla and tonka bean base that’s warmly reminiscent of the original, but doesn’t pack the same punch. Though it lacks Good Girl’s staying power, it has a noticeable sillage and provides excellent value as an everyday alternative that captures the essence of Good Girl without the luxury price. I have it in my work handbag for top-ups.” — Sade Akinsanya, perfume lover and content creator Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Le Labo Santal 33 Eau de Parfum The designer: Le Labo Santal 33, $235 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Woody Sandalwood, $49 for 1.7 oz “While Woody Sandalwood is a really nice fall perfume — similar to Oakcha Ruhe, another dupe of the Labo scent — I found the Dossier version to be much lighter than the original. At first spray, I picked up some additional florals (possibly orris) that I didn’t notice in Santal 33 at all. The staying power is not quite there, either. When I spray Le Labo, I can still smell it on my clothes days later, while the dupe wears off within a few hours. Unrelated to the formula, I do love the pump atomizer on the Dossier bottle, as it mists the scent so evenly and finely.” — Kate Spencer, senior affiliate partnership manager Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum The designer: Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum, $135 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Floral Honeysuckle, $39 for 1.7 oz “Gucci Bloom is an intermixture of lush white florals including heady tuberose and creamy jasmine — and until now, nothing has come close to nailing its instant dopamine hit and impressive sillage. Floral Honeysuckle, however, comes very close. On clothes, I can’t tell the difference between them, but Gucci Bloom is a little more intense and longer-lasting on the skin. Still, if you don’t mind topping up during the day, Dossier’s version is an extraordinarily similar alternative. I’ll be taking this on vacation with me rather than my full-size, chunky bottle of Bloom, as it’s a nifty 1.7 oz.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Eau de Toilette The designer: Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet, $113 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Citrus Peony, $29 for 1.7 oz “Though more under the radar than some of Dior’s other cult classics, like J’adore and Miss Dior, Blooming Bouquet has a special place in my heart. It smells so feminine, tender and optimistic, with fruity notes of pear and bergamot forming a joyful chorus with peony and Damask rose. Citrus Peony is pretty much spot-on, with a slightly fruitier profile (it also contains raspberry and peach at the base) and a muskier dry down. Blooming Bouquet has fantastic staying power for an eau de toilette, lasting for a whole day, while Dossier’s version wears off after four or five hours.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Jo Malone Wood Sage \u0026 Sea Salt Cologne The designer: Jo Malone Wood Sage \u0026 Sea Salt, $118 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Dossier Woody Sage, $29 for 1.7 oz “Owing to almost 10 years in beauty, my party trick is correctly guessing the perfume that people are wearing when I first meet them. Prada Paradoxe? I knew it. Phlur Father Figure? Unmistakable. I’d totally forgotten which high-end fragrance Woody Sage was meant to be inspired by, but at first sniff it came to me immediately: This is Jo Malone’s Wood Sage and Sea Salt down to a T. The high-end version is equal parts fresh and musky, which makes it my go-to in summer when I want something light and comforting — but I wish it lasted longer. I’m happy to report that Dossier’s iteration has pretty decent staying power. In fact, it outlasted Jo Malone on my skin by a few hours. At $29, this is a no-brainer.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop Dossier DashDividers_1_500x100 Maison Margiela Replica Beach Walk Eau de Toilette The designer: Maison Margiela Replica Beach Walk, $165 for 3.4 oz The dupe: Dossier Aquatic Coconut, $29 for 1.7 oz “Many have called Beach Walk the quintessential ‘sunscreen scent’ but it smells way more premium than your typical summer perfume. I normally wrinkle my nose at coconut-heavy fragrances but the creamy coconut milk is elegantly pared down by tropical ylang ylang and almondy heliotrope, finished off with zingy bergamot, lemon and pink pepper. Aquatic Coconut has an almost completely identical coconut sunscreen meets salty sea air opening, but makes a slightly less powerful first impression than the original. It smells lighter and more marine, which I happen to love as it reminds me more authentically of seaside walks. A common pet peeve for Dossier scents is that they’re not quite as long-lasting as the fragrances they’re inspired by so I was surprised by the longevity of this one: I can still catch traces of the perfume when I move my arms around the next morning. For $29, I’m beyond impressed.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Dossier Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
