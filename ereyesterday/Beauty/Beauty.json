    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Every year seems to get better and better when it comes to innovative nail trends, but 2025 has already proven to be something of a standout year for manicure inspiration. While maximalist designs like Amalfi-inspired “Italian summer” nails and 3D beach nails have been taking off for summer, we’ve spotted a simpler take on nail art emerging as one to watch for the season ahead. Enter: polka-dot nails.  Somewhat of a retro print, this summer’s polka-dot manicures balance ‘80s charm with a modern minimalism, taking a simple dot and transforming it into endless creative nail art looks. Whether it’s a monochromatic polka print or a rainbow of mismatched dots, the beauty of polka-dot nails is that they are so versatile. Plus, they pair nicely with basically every other trend out there, from French tips to neon hues. Ahead, find 11 of the very best polka-dot designs dotting our social feeds right now.  Princess Polka View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMIRI | biab nails, bespoke facials, lashes + brows | newcastle (@amiri_studio) Proving that polka dots are the perfect nail art look for minimalists, this manicure created at Amiri nail salon layers monochromatic polka dots over a groomed and glossy princess manicure for an ultra-polished look. Espresso Shots Our collective obsession with Pantone’s color of the year, mocha mousse, is continuing into the summer with Caselyn Grover’s coffee-toned manicure proving it. Try Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Clove, $14, to recreate it at home. Rainbow Brite View this post on Instagram A post shared by GetNailed. (@getnailedkelowna) Why pick just one color when you can have, well, 20? This riotously bright nail look by GetNailed salon is essentially a dopamine hit in manicure form. Obsessed. Chestnut Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by GIA ARTISTRY | Sydney Gel Artist 🍒 (@gia.artiistry) If you don’t fancy an all-over print, then polka-dot French tips are proving popular right now. This look by Gia Artistry uses a warm chestnut brown tone with bright white microdots for a wearable everyday manicure.  True Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Mismatched polka-dot manicures are a huge trend, but if you prefer something a little more subtle, then opt for two tonal colors rather than a clash, much like this blue look by nail content creator Melanie Graves. Try OPI Shore Is Something!, $12.99, with Essie Gel Couture in Caviar Bar, $13. ‘80s Excess View this post on Instagram A post shared by HATTONNAILS (@elisahatton) An homage to the more-is-more aesthetic of the ‘80s, where polka-dot power two-pieces once reigned supreme, this jewelry manicure by Hattonnails embraces opulence in the best way. Quiet luxury? We don’t know her. Milky Sorbet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emma Maughan (@___embeauty) Sorbet shades are big news for summer 2025, so we expect to see more gelato-toned polka dots like this one by nail artist Emma Maughan. Dotted Borders View this post on Instagram A post shared by @beautybyabigailjessica Rather than going for all-over print, nail tech @beautybyabigailjessica has created a fun polka-dot-bordered manicure to frame some cute floral nail art. A fun and unexpected way to wear spots. Mix \u0026 Match View this post on Instagram A post shared by VIBE • NEWCASTLE, NSW (@vibe_nailartistry) The eclectic mix of French tips, negative space and pops of red makes this striking set created at Newcastle’s Vibe nail salon the ultimate cool-girl polka-dot manicure. Jelly Dots View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shannon Elias (@elias.nails) Between soap nails and juicy nail tints, it’s clear that sheer and dewy manicures have dominated this year. So it makes perfect sense for nail artist Shannon Elias to opt for a pink jelly base for this microscopic polka-dot design. Essie Jelly Gloss in Blush Jelly, $13, makes the perfect at-home color for this look. Dalmatian Spots View this post on Instagram A post shared by SYDNEY’S #1 NAIL \u0026 BEAUTY SALON ♡ (@acenails_andbeauty) Like Cruella de Vil in manicure form, this stiletto-shaped nail look by Ace Nails and Beauty is seriously glamorous.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead.

Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup.

Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim.

    "title": "Indigenous Braids Help Me Honor My Ancestors - and My True Self",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/indigenous-braids-latina-identity-49449002",
    "description": "\"You know, if you wear braids and a big hat, it makes you look even more Indigenous,\" my aunt said, as if offering some kind of life advice. I felt a tiny part of myself shrink in that moment, but I quickly caught it, took a breath, and calmly asked, \"What's wrong with looking Indigenous?\" She looked confused and almost annoyed that I'd challenge her, and after a pause, she replied awkwardly, \"Because you don't want people to think you are less than.\" That's when I realized that in a warped, self-hating, colonized mindset, my aunt was trying to save me from ridicule, hate, or anyone second-guessing my worth. But I responded, \"Tía, whoever thinks that I am less than for looking or even being Indigenous is not for me. Plus, I feel really beautiful and powerful.\" She quietly accepted defeat, nodded her head, and served me a cup of freshly brewed café con leche. The truth is, I've heard different versions of that comment my entire life. I've been defending my Indigenous features and aesthetic since I was a child. It took decades of inner work - therapy, journaling, and solo travel to Peru - to feel secure in my identity. To respond with clarity and confidence, as I did with my aunt that day, was no small thing. It was the result of years of unlearning and reclaiming. Teenage Cindy would be proud. Growing up in New Jersey, I learned that Indigenous aesthetics were only socially acceptable for cultural shows or tourist photos, not for everyday life. That meant no braids, no big hats, and absolutely no ponchos. For far too many of us, hiding Indigenous culture or downplaying our connection to Peru has meant moving on up in the world. Many in my community saw assimilation as success, so minimizing Indigeneity was a survival strategy. Growing up in New Jersey, I learned that Indigenous aesthetics were only socially acceptable for cultural shows or tourist photos, not for everyday life. But all I saw were the effects of colonization running rampant. All I saw was the cost, the silence, the shame, and the erasure. I didn't have the words yet, but I knew I didn't want to keep carrying that kind of weight. To most, a braid might seem small. But for me - a Peruvian American woman of Indigenous descent - I know now that my hair carries resistance, memory, healing, and pride. Every braid, every curl, every strand has been a homecoming. In Peru, braids are synonymous with Andean identity, especially for Quechua and Aymara women, who many refer to as \"cholas,\" a term loaded with anti-Indigenous bias with historical ties to Spanish colonizers. Unfortunately, the word chola is still used to shame and degrade women who present as Indigenous. Braids are part of the ancestral language of the Andes - one braid traditionally signifying that a woman is single, and two indicating she is married. But beyond cultural symbolism, braiding is also a spiritual practice. The three strands represent the mind, body, and spirit, making it vital to braid with intention, sometimes even with prayer. Being mindful of your thoughts while braiding can influence your vibration for the day. Braids with colorful ribbons are traditionally reserved for celebratory occasions. Today, Indigenous braiding is experiencing a powerful resurgence among Peruvian youth, who are reclaiming their Indigenous heritage. Artists like Quechua hip-hop singer and activist Renata Flores are leading the way, using their platforms to challenge discrimination and assert that their identity is both personal and political. Flores wears braids, sings in Quechua, and makes ancestral heritage and pride beautifully visible. It's inspiring to witness this cultural resurgence in real time. \"I am proud of and connected to and recognizable to my ancestors,\" said Native American author, educator, and speaker Dr. Anton Treuer. Several years ago, he spoke about the spiritual significance of hair in native cultures - and how, historically, hair was weaponized against native people. That's how powerful braids are. Colonizers cutting them was often the first act of erasure, stripping native children of their cultural identity and forcing them to assimilate. Learning that history only deepened my commitment to growing my hair long, embracing my natural waves, and braiding whenever possible - to honor those who never had the choice. Hair, especially braids, is an energetic boundary, not just an aesthetic. During the pandemic, I decided not to use heat on my hair for a year as an experiment to see where my natural hair was. At first, I would use braids very practically to condition my hair or while I was hiking to avoid having my hair in my face. But then something shifted. After months of braiding, my childhood curls came back. So much so that my mom asked if I had gotten a perm. When I told her no, she was shocked. Braiding then transitioned from a functional to a spiritual experience - I started to feel stronger and more grounded while wearing my braids. Over time, it wasn't just about looking good, but also about feeling more connected. Braiding became a ritual. My mom started to notice the shift and suggested I be careful with who I let braid or even touch my hair. Because our hair is sacred, it is a form of energy work that requires serious care. Another major shift happened when I joined the Dance Your Ancestors program, led by Peruvian dancer, choreographer, and educator Cynthia Paniagua. Paniagua doesn't just teach movement - she offers us a spiritual map home. Through her, I was able to embody my ancestry in a way I had never fully accessed before. She gave language to what my spirit already knew but hadn't been able to name: that movement is memory, and dance is ceremony. In one round of the program, we studied tondero, a traditional courtship dance from Piura, the northern coastal region of Peru - my paternal grandmother's homeland. I never got to meet her, but learning this dance made me feel like I was finally standing in her story. Every step, every sway, every beat of the music was a conversation with her. In our final performance, we were asked to choose what hairstyle we wanted to wear, and I, not surprisingly, chose a braid. That moment sealed it for me - braiding, dancing, and remembering were no longer separate acts. They were all part of the same ritual: coming back home to myself. Today, I rock my braids wherever I go: to the gym, family parties, and even, still, hiking. I wear them in ways that I never felt allowed to before. What once made people uncomfortable now makes me feel whole. I still get comments from strangers, long, awkward stares, and wildly inappropriate comments for wearing my hair in braids, but I don't shrink anymore. I don't even explain. I refuse to soften my edges or water down my identity to make others feel comfortable. Every braid I wear is for the women or children who couldn't, and every curl carries a soft kind of resistance. I no longer hide; I honor my hair, like a spiritual cape. My hair is no longer policed, it is prayed over. Cindy Y. Rodriguez has spent 17-plus years crafting powerful stories.

    "description": "Since her days on \"Love \u0026 Hip Hop: Miami,\" Amara La Negra has been a powerful advocate for Afro-Latina representation. She has graced numerous TV segments, gone viral on social media, and appeared on various podcasts and radio shows, where she has openly shared her experiences with colorism and the importance of representation. All the while, she continues to work on her music, participate in empowering campaigns, and cohost Univision's daytime talk show \"Desiguales.\" She's even launched her own fragrance, Eternal Beauty by Amara. Yet despite all her achievements, critics still can't seem to leave her hair alone. Amara wants to make one thing abundantly clear: how she wears her hair is her business, and hers alone. Amara's early relationship with her hair - like that of many Afro-Dominican girls - was tangled in complexity. \"I'd be lying to you if I told you that in my younger years, I understood what my hair represented,\" she tells Popsugar. \"But I can definitely tell you that later on, growing up around the age of 15 or so, is when I decided to stop [relaxing] my hair.\" The constant messaging she received growing up was that her hair wasn't beautiful, and her natural beauty wasn't enough. \"I remember hearing in my household about my hair being bad - 'pelo malo,'\" she shares. As a child star and often the only Black girl in the room, Amara felt the pressure to consistently wear her hair straight in order to land opportunities. \"I remember hearing in my household about my hair being bad - 'pelo malo.'\" \"Having to even be on national TV and be in these hairstyling rooms where they couldn't manage my hair - my hair was [considered] unmanageable,\" she adds. \"I remember those days, and it was tough because I knew that I was definitely different from the rest of the girls because obviously their hair was quicker to do, and mine took a bit more love and affection.\" In her teens, after experiencing severe damage and hair loss from so much straightening, Amara reclaimed her power and ditched the relaxers, the blowouts, and the flat irons. She began embracing her natural hair, rocking a gorgeous Afro that quickly became one of her most iconic features on \"Love \u0026 Hip Hop: Miami.\" Black Latinas across the country celebrated seeing themselves represented and praised her for using her voice to advocate for the community. But as with anything that goes viral, the backlash wasn't far behind. And somehow, the haters always manage to be the loudest voices in the room. For the longest time, many people refused to believe that Amara was actually Black. The severe ignorance surrounding her Afro-Latinidad and the policing of Black identity was at an all-time high when Amara first went viral. People couldn't comprehend how someone could be Black in appearance, proudly Latina, and speak with a Dominican Miami accent - it was simply beyond their understanding. \"It was really annoying. It was aggravating. I just felt like everything I did was questionable. You know what I mean? Is your skin real? There's no way you're Latina and you speak Spanish and you're Black, so you must be taking melanin shots,\" she says, referencing false accusations that she took melanin shots to darken her skin. \"Every picture was a reason for them to judge me. They'd say, 'In this picture her skin is lighter.' Or 'In this picture her skin is dark.' It's like, have you guys ever heard of lighting?\" Amara's Blackness was so frequently questioned, particularly by other Latine individuals, that even years after the passing of the CROWN Act and other laws designed to protect Black women from hair discrimination, she still found herself in awkward and invasive situations. \"Even in interviews, TV hosts would be like, 'Oh let me touch your hair. I can't believe your hair is like this.' I'm like, why can't you believe it? There are people of African descent in every part of this world,\" she says. As uncomfortable as it was to have people touch her hair without permission, Amara has learned to navigate these moments with grace. She understands that, more often than not, these problematic behaviors stem from deep ignorance rather than malice. In recent years, Amara has faced comments suggesting that she somehow stepped away from embracing her Blackness simply because she's chosen to wear straight-styled wigs. She makes it abundantly clear that beneath those wigs, her beautiful Afro remains, and her reasons for wearing straight wigs are varied and personal. \"Wearing wigs is a form of protective hairstyling that protects my own hair from getting damaged from chemicals or even the picking of the Afro, which is something that most people don't talk about,\" she shares. \"Picking your Afro every single day to make sure it's perfectly round can be very damaging.\" She also admits that part of her decision to occasionally wear straight-styled wigs was strategic, helping her gain access to spaces where she feels her voice is needed. \"I think it's important to know how to camouflage yourself - if needed - to get into those right rooms,\" she says. \"If you go into those rooms still being authentic to yourself but knowing that you might have to camouflage yourself a little bit here and there to be able to have a seat at that table where you can really make a difference, then go ahead and do that.\" When it comes to critics who always seem dissatisfied with how Black women choose to wear their hair - whether it's a natural Afro, blown-out straight, or styled with a sleek wig - Amara's stance is simple: people need to find better things to do with their time. \"To me, it's like, mind your business,\" she says. \"I feel like there's bigger fish to fry. There are so many other things that you can be concerned and worried about, and a Black woman's hair shouldn't be your priority. So, if you don't like it, then don't look at it.\" As a Black, curly-haired Latina myself, I couldn't agree with her more.
