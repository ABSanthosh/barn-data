    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/elf-cosmetics-halo-glow-powder-filter-review-49426978",
    "description": "Hi, my name is Michelle, and I'm afraid of powder foundation. No, really, I'm someone with incredibly dry skin and, therefore, avoid powder foundation like it's the plague. That's because most formulas cling to my dry patches, feel heavy, and accentuate my fine lines, pores, and texture. The good news? I'm obsessed with product testing, which means sometimes I'm exposed to formulas that completely change my mind about an entire category of products. Enter the E.l.f. Halow Glow Powder Filter ($14); I recently tried this new launch and was taken aback by how incredible my skin looked - not a cakey spot in sight. Read on to learn how this powder works wonders for my skin. About the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter The formula comes in 12 flexible shades that include cool, neutral, and warm undertones, and fair, light, medium, tan, deep, and rich shades. The compact includes a velour puff and mirror for on-the-go application. The pressed powder formula can be used on its own as a foundation, on top of makeup for more coverage, or to touch up. It delivers a blurred, soft-focus glow. The formula is vegan and cruelty-free. What I Like About the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter As someone with dry skin who tends to avoid powder complexion products, E.l.f. managed to make me a convert with this finely-milled formula. While I typically rely on a pore-blurring primer before my foundation application, I don't need to wear one underneath this powder. It blurs the look of my pores and any uneven texture effortlessly, yielding a truly filtered, flawless look that I usually can only achieve with a liquid formula. While most powders cling onto dry patches (particularly on my chin and the sides of my nose), this one glosses right over them with no issue. Comfort-wise, it has a velvety finish that feels weightless on the skin - a tough feat for most powder formulas. How to Use the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter The beauty of this powder is that there are several ways to use it: on days I want all-over coverage, I use it on its own with powder blush and bronzer layered on top. Other formulas layer nicely on top without skipping, and I like that I can apply a light layer for every day or build it up for more glamorous looks. If you need your makeup to last, you can layer the powder on top of a liquid foundation - this helps control any oil that may pop up throughout the day. Finally - and perhaps my absolute favorite way to use this powder - is to take a big fluffy face brush and use circular motions to apply a light dusting onto my cheeks after I've finished my blush and bronzer. This instantly nixes any harsh lines and helps fuse all of my other products together for a seamless, blended finish. What to Consider Before Trying the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter One thing to note is that this powder has a soft focus glow, so if you're someone with oily skin, consider if your skin will mesh well with this type of finish. It also makes no claim on staying power, so if you tend to get greasy quickly, it may be wise to take the compact with you for touch-ups throughout the day. Where Is the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter Available? The E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter is available at E.l.f. Cosmetics, Ulta, Target, and Amazon.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/toasted-skin-syndrome-49426905",
    "description": "When the temperature is just about freezing outside, it's natural to want to cozy up by the fire or warm up with your trusty heating pad or blanket. While the warmth it provides is very much welcomed during chilly times, there's a rising concern about their use. Apparently, too much heating pad time can cause \"toasted skin\" syndrome. Knowing that your heating pad could be causing a skin condition isn't the news you want to hear during the winter season. If you have one, you know just how convenient it is when you're experiencing menstrual cramps, are sore from your new Pilates class, or when you're cold and need to warm up in bed after doing your nighttime skin-care routine. However, the prolonged use of heat on skin can lead to some uncomfortable and lasting side effects. TikToker Alexandra Sedlak shared her experience with toasted skin syndrome, which arose unexpectedly. \"Do you know what happens if you repeatedly sit in front of an electric space heater with your back to it? I would love to show you, but if I did, this video would get taken down,\" she said. \"But basically, you will turn into a marshmallow.\" If you're concerned about your accelerated use of heating pads, think you may have toasted skin syndrome, and want to prevent skin discoloration and other side effects, we got you. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the condition straight from experts. Experts Featured in This Article Kristina Collins, MD, FAAD, is a double board-certified dermatologist and surgeon. Alexandra Bowles, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at MONA Dermatology. What Is Toasted Skin Syndrome? Toasted skin syndrome, also known as erythema ab igne (EAI), is a skin condition characterized by \"a net-like reddish-brown discoloration caused by repeated exposure to moderate heat,\" dermatologist and surgeon Kristina Collins, MD, FAAD, says. Heating objects such as pads and hot water bottles, often used for pain relief, can create this condition when used directly on the skin for prolonged periods. But even surprising, unintentional sources of heat can cause it, as it can come from everyday devices. \"Another common cause of erythema ab igne is resting your laptop on your lap or thighs for extended periods of time, as the heat generated from the device can similarly damage the skin,\" Dr. Collins says. The condition can cause your skin to look almost net-like with a pattern of discoloration on the skin. Usually, it will begin as a red rash but can turn brown as time passes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Toasted skin syndrome can occur anywhere on your body that comes in contact with heat for long periods of time, which is defined as more than 15-20 minutes. What Causes Toasted Skin Syndrome? When toasted skin syndrome occurs, Dr. Collins says it's because \"prolonged exposure to moderate heat that is not intense enough to cause burns leads to gradual damage to the skin's blood vessels and an increase in melanin production.\" She continues, \"This cumulative heat exposure results in the characteristic pigmentation and changes in skin structure. Heating pads and laptops both deliver consistent heat to a localized area, which is why they are common culprits of this condition.\" And if you think it doesn't sound serious, be warned: \"Repeated heat exposure can damage the skin's deeper layers,\" says dermatologist Alexandra Bowles, MD. \"Over time, it can result in visible discoloration, and in rare cases, an increased risk of skin cancer due to cellular changes caused by heat.\" How to Prevent Toasted Skin Syndrome To avoid toasted skin syndrome, \"it's important to limit prolonged, direct contact between your skin and heat sources,\" Dr. Bowles says. There are a few steps one can take to prevent getting toasted skin syndrome. Dr. Collins says the following are key steps in prevention: For heating pads: Limit usage to no more than 15-20 minutes at a time. Always place a cloth or towel between the heating pad and your skin. Use the lowest effective heat setting. For laptops: Avoid resting the laptop directly on your thighs; use a laptop desk, stand, or cushion. Take breaks and change positions frequently to prevent prolonged heat exposure to one area. How to Treat Toasted Skin Syndrome In mild cases of toasted skin syndrome, you'll notice that the discoloration may fade on its own if the heat source is removed. \"For more persistent or severe cases, a dermatologist may recommend treatments to help improve skin texture and pigmentation,\" Dr. Bowles says. \"Early consultation is key to preventing permanent damage.\" If you're noticing signs of toasted skin syndrome, such as itching of the skin, redness, or discoloration, Dr. Collins says the following may be able to help: Remove the heat source immediately - \"Stop using heating pads directly on the skin or resting laptops on your thighs,\" she says. Apply soothing creams - Use a moisturizer or aloe vera to calm the skin. Use topical treatments - A dermatologist may recommend a retinoid or hydroquinone-based cream to help lighten pigmentation. Protect the skin - Apply sunscreen daily to prevent further pigmentation. Seek professional advice - If your discoloration persists or worsens, \"consult a dermatologist. In severe cases, laser therapy may be necessary to correct pigmentation,\" Dr. Collins says. While erythema ab igne is often benign, Dr. Collins says repeated heat exposure can potentially \"increase the risk of precancerous changes, so addressing it promptly is important.\" If you're concerned about getting toasted skin syndrome while using your heating pad, don't fret. Using it in the expert-recommended 15-20-minute increments will allow you to enjoy all the benefits that come with these magical warming devices without potentially harming your skin. If you're currently experiencing side effects of toasted skin syndrome, contact your dermatologist, as they may be able to help reduce symptoms.

But as someone who regularly changes their hairstyle, even before going short, admittedly I felt stuck. I was bored and yearning for a new style, with one in particular dominating my TikTok For You Page. Enter: The goddess braid bob.  I had long knotless goddess braids installed during the summer and they quickly became my favorite braided hairstyle. The waist-length braids with added curls made from human hair were a godsend on holiday, it was a much-needed lightweight alternative to the usual knotless braids and easy enough to style so that my hair still looked good in the summer evenings. But in 2025, I wanted to stick to my commitment to short hair, whether it be my natural hair or extensions. It wasn’t until I saw the goddess braid bob trend everywhere that I realized I could have the best of both worlds: a style I knew I loved and a short look. And with that, I booked myself in to get my first-ever goddess braid bob. DashDividers_1_500x100 What is a goddess braid bob and why is it so popular right now? According to the 30.6M posts on TikTok, the goddess braid bob is essentially a combination of the infamous bob hairstyle and knotless goddess braids, which are created with strands of synthetic or human curly hair left out “for a more relaxed and feminine vibe,” says Antoinette Ale, founder of Haircrush. This iteration of the style remains at chin or shoulder-length, allowing those who love braided hairstyles to experiment with a traditional bob or a long bob, creating the “perfect union” between two of the most “sought-after trends” of the past year, as Nneka Allison, founder of UK-based HoochTeeStyles explains.  “The bob is one of the hottest hairstyle trends over the last 12 months, so the goddess braid bob is the perfect union of these two sought-after trends and is a natural style evolution of the traditional goddess braids,” she tells Unbothered. Additionally, Ale says the goddess braid bob’s versatility and effortlessness align with current beauty trends, saying: “It’s versatile, lightweight, and low-maintenance, making it perfect for busy lifestyles. Also, the soft curls add a stylish, effortless touch, which aligns with current beauty trends favoring natural, soft looks.” @laurenjgordon anything else I should try? #goddessbraids #braidbob #bohobraids ♬ It’s ok I’m ok – Tate McRae Shorter braid styles have been rising in popularity, with the goddess braid bob leading as an example, and there are a number of reasons why short hairstyles are more favorable. For one, they’re just as fun and creative as long braids, but take less time to install, often feel lighter, and typically cost less. They’re also easier to maintain, meaning they’re the perfect style for the upcoming warmer months. Going from a short afro to long braids was going to shock my system, so a shorter braided style was welcomed with open arms. Allison confirms the goddess braid bob is the go-to, on-trend look if a low-maintenance hairstyle is what you’re looking for. “The most laborious stage [of the goddess braid bob] is the installation (which could take anywhere between four to seven hours), but once it’s done, it’s easy to maintain,” she says. “It’s a versatile look, that’s also cool, boho, and timeless.” DashDividers_1_500x100 How is the goddess braid bob installed? Celebrity hairstylist, Dionne Smith, known for styling the likes of singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Queen Charlotte star India Amarteifio, told Unbothered exactly how the goddess braid bob is installed. “The goddess braid bob is a braided hairstyle that combines both box braids and curls, at the length of a bob. It works by incorporating curly strands into the braids themselves to achieve a braided boho look.” Instead of buying pre-stretched Xpressions for the single knotless braids, my hairstylist and owner of Divine Salon in north London, Nadia Dedier, encouraged me to buy a regular pack of Xpressions, so we could adjust the length, making it shorter than the usual knotless braid. Then, I was told to buy curly hair of my choice, synthetic or human and no longer than 16 inches.   During my appointment, I had the luxury of two stylists working on my head at once, which made the process even quicker, but it was still more complicated than typical knotless braids. “I start as I would with normal knotless braids and add in the pieces of curly hair as I go, adding in two to three bits of the curly hair depending on how full the client wants the look to be and leaving them out, clipping them aside to later drop once the braid is complete. I like to make sure the end is curly for a bouncy look,” Dedier tells me.  I opted for synthetic hair and although I love the outcome, I regret this decision, as Smith tells me, using human hair would ensure the style lasts for longer. “This is because compared to synthetic hair, human hair would be less prone to tangles and knots. This will keep the hairstyle neat for a longer period of time,” she tells Unbothered.  Thus, in my efforts to save money, I might have added to my hair workload, but luckily styling my hair is one of my main hobbies. How do you maintain a goddess braid bob? So, with knotless braids and curly pieces of hair being combined to form the goddess braid bob, learning how to maintain this style is key to helping it stay cute for longer, keeping knots at bay, and helping your hair and scalp stay refreshed.  Smith explains that the curls can be the hardest thing to manage when styling the goddess braid wig, so she recommends using a foaming mousse and getting your nighttime routine in check. “One key product to use with this hairstyle is a foaming mousse, as it smooths and defines the curly hair. It would be beneficial to put the braids into two plaits before going to bed, in order to keep the hair neat, also avoiding tangles during sleep,” she tells us. Allison adds that wrapping your bedtime plaits in a silk or satin scarf can prolong the style further.  While I’ve been loving the got2B Twisted Curling Mousse for keeping my curls defined, bouncy, and voluminous, Allison recommends the ORS Olive Oil Wrap Setting Mousse to help “prevent frizz and fraying and to keep the loose boho waves moisturized and defined.” As with any protective style, it’s important not to neglect your scalp health, as moisturized and flake-free scalp can help your style look better for longer. For this, Allison encourages oiling the scalp with an argan and olive oil mixture every few days and using any leftovers on the ends of your goddess braid bob.   My thoughts on the goddess braid bob My routine is made up of the Kerastase Elixir Original Hair Oil, two pumps of which I use to plait and wrap my hair before bed, and during the day, I use the Bread Hair Oil Everyday Gloss as it’s non-greasy and keeps my bob smelling divine all day long. Every few days I opt for the Cantu Hair Refresher, made specifically for protective braided hairstyles, if I feel my braids could do with a pick-me-up. Ultimately, caring for my goddess braid bob has been simple. The length definitely plays a part in how lightweight and manageable my hair is, and importantly, I haven’t felt any tugging or tightness on my scalp, so I’m certain my hair is thriving beneath my braids.  Smith tells Unbothered that the goddess braid bob is one of the many glamorous ways for people to embrace protective styles that celebrate Black hair and culture and I couldn’t agree more. Thanks to the various ways it can be styled, (“For example, you can wear it down in a side or middle part, half up-half down, and even an updo,” Smith says) I feel as though the possibilities for this style are endless.  Although I’m sure I’ll go for human hair next time, I already know this is going to be my signature braided hairstyle for 2025 and I’m so happy to finally get involved with the bob trend, I think it suits me.  This article was originally published on Unbothered UK Like what you see?
