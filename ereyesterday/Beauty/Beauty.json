If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Perfume and luxury go hand in hand, but let’s be honest — sometimes you’re paying more for the name on the bottle than the scent inside (and if it brings you joy, that’s perfectly fine). Valentino’s latest fragrance collection, Anatomy of Dreams, completely flipped the script on what I thought I knew about haute perfumery. It’s not just perfume — it’s a sensory experience, blending couture artistry with bold, unexpected ingredient pairings that linger in your memory as much as on your skin. Rooted in the maison’s Rome heritage — though I got my sneak peek in Paris this summer (very fitting) — the collection takes classic notes like white florals, musk, and oud and shakes things up with unexpected Italian twists. Think: couture-level infusions broken out into seven olfactive “dreams,” crafted by different master perfumers — cappuccino accord, Calabrian citrus, and olive wood. It’s Valentino’s ode to la dolce vita, and trust me, it’s as dreamy as it sounds. And because this is Valentino, the bottles are just as jaw-dropping. Picture studded caps straight out of the Rockstud playbook and hand-cut canvas labels made from the same fabric as their couture gown boxes. It’s the kind of thoughtful, over-the-top luxury we don’t see enough of these days. Each one is priced at $330 for a 100mL bottle or $165 for 30mL (launching early next year). “The strength of this collection is found in the unexpected duos of ingredients, creating surprise and modernity,” says perfumer Andrew Everett, the nose behind one of Valentino’s new scents, Club Couture. Picking a favorite is nearly impossible, but here’s what stood out for me: L’Innocence de L’air is a daytime dream — light, airy, and bursting with rose and citrus. For nighttime, Punk Romantic stole the show with its mix of vanilla bean and earthy olive wood, like the fragrance equivalent of a dirty martini. To call them perfumes feels like an understatement; they’re moods, vibes, and moments bottled to perfection. “To create a perfume that breaks the rules, you must dare,” perfumer Fanny Bal, who created Punk Romantic, tells Refinery29. “Dare to go too far, dare to make surprising associations, dare to blur gender codes.”  Ahead, take a closer look at these seven dreamy scents — and prepare to wish you could smell them through the screen. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sogno In Rosso “When I composed Sogno in Rosso, I had two elements in mind [from] Valentino’s DNA,” perfumer Fabrice Pellegrin tells Refinery29. “The first element was this idea of red, which is the iconic color of Valentino. It’s the story of a strong contrast, of a chiaroscuro between notes of spicy black pepper and creamy milk foam.” Notte d’Oro  “Oud was the starting point of the creation,” shares perfumer Paul Guerlain. “It’s an ultra-luxurious ingredient — one of the rarest of the perfumer’s palette. To create a clash, a surprise, almond was a perfect choice because it’s soft and comforting. I wanted to bring an immediate delight.” L’Innocence de L’Air “L’Innocence de L’air combines what I love most about Valentino: the blend of timeless elegance, impeccable and modern cuts, all imbued with Italian sophistication,” perfumer Nathalie Lorson tells us of her rose and mandarin scent. “I wanted a certain fluidity in this composition.“I want people to feel a sense of beauty and strength with a touch of magic.”  Private Talk “The inspiration came from a personal memory of having a coffee on my terrace in Paris during the summer, surrounded by tuberoses,” says perfumer Nicolas Bonneville. “This unexpected encounter made me want to translate it into perfume.” The result: A sensual, not sexy, scent that leaves a lasting impression. Club Couture “I want people who wear Club Couture to feel energized, super elegant, with a sense of joy,,” Everett shares. “As the fig is very green and modern, we thought to blend it with patchouli, which is more classic, a little darker, but undeniably chic.” Punk Romantic “Vanilla allows so many creative possibilities — I was looking for a new twist with the olive wood accord, which adds a distinctive earthy depth, balancing the sweetness and spice,” Bal says of her creation. “The fragrance is designed to evoke a sense of boldness and confidence while creating a unique blend of warmth and intrigue. Even the name ‘Punk Romantic’ captures this contrast.”  Behind The Seen “Behind The Seen is inspired by a childhood memory,” perfumer Delphine Lebeau tells me, citing her great-aunt’s South of France home, surrounded by hazelnut trees. “I put everything I love in this fragrance: joyful memories with hazelnut wood, iris in the heart notes, and the powerful elegance of vetiver, which is one of my favorite raw materials in perfumery.” Like what you see?

As fun as it is to consistently try new skincare products in the name of journalism (and believe me, it is!), the truth is that it can do a number on our skin. (Beauty editors are not immune to breakouts!) And for that reason, we’re grateful to have our tried-and-true favorites to go back to. Below, read what Refinery29 editors had to say about their long-standing skincare products we simply can’t quit.   The nonstop beauty cycle has a way of giving us FOMO before a new launch even happens. But in a world where products go viral faster than we can blink, the true test of quality is whether we keep coming back to it year after year.  It doesn’t have to be the flashiest product on your feed to make the biggest difference in your routine. Beauty editors often share a love for those IYKYK gems that live up to their hype: the retinol that keeps skin glowing or the sunscreen that disappears without a trace but never fails to protect. The products below? We’ve gone through countless bottles — and we don’t see that changing anytime soon. As much fun as it is to test new skincare in the name of journalism (and believe us, it is), our skin isn’t always thrilled about it. (Beauty editors are not immune to breakouts!) For that reason, we’re grateful for tried-and-true staples that always deliver. Ahead, find the long-standing skincare favorites Refinery29 editors can’t quit.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Shani Darden Triple Acid Signature Peel, $125 “I was terrified of acids for the longest time. After a bad experience with an at-home peel, I swore them off completely. So, when I first got my hands on Shani Darden’s Triple Acid Peel, I was hesitant — even though countless beauty editors and experts I trust couldn’t stop raving about it. Shani herself reassured me it was gentle enough for sensitive skin but still packed a punch, and she was absolutely right. Everyone was right! This peel has been a total game-changer. I use it at least once a month or a couple of days before a big event, and it never fails to leave my skin radiant and glowy. The trio of acids work magic together, exfoliating away dead skin and dullness, revealing a complexion that feels completely refreshed. It’s an essential part of my routine now—I’m not sure how I ever lived without it.” — Sara Tan, Global Beauty Director Vintner’s Daughter Active Botanical Serum, $195 “While my skin is usually low-maintenance and non-sensitive, winter brings a whole new set of challenges: dryness, dullness, and flakiness. Over the years, I’ve tried everything from elaborate 10-step routines to budget-friendly hacks, but nothing truly worked—until I discovered Vintner’s Daughter Active Botanical Serum. Now, it’s my go-to all winter long. This nutrient-packed oil doesn’t just hydrate my skin; it leaves it radiant and glowy. The compliments I get when I’m using it consistently are proof enough. Paired with the brand’s cleanser and essence, it’s become my ultimate cold-weather trio. It’s a splurge, yes, but one I’ll never give up.” — Irina Grechko, Global Fashion Director Naturium Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2%, $17 “I first stumbled upon this product three years ago while dealing with some stubborn forehead texture — those tiny bumps that aren’t quite breakouts. After a late-night YouTube rabbit hole, I decided to give this $21 niacinamide serum a shot.  A few months of consistent use later, my skin was smoother, dewier, and totally transformed. I haven’t looked back since. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve repurchased it or recommended it to family and friends — it’s that good.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta® Universal Daily Peel Pads, $92 “After years of blasting my acne-prone skin with harsh actives,  I’ve learned to tread carefully when it comes to at-home peels and over-exfoliating. So, when multiple dermatologists urged me to incorporate gentle exfoliation into my routine, I approached these peel pads with hesitation. I fully expected them to sting like the fire of a thousand suns, but to my surprise, the two-step system was shockingly mild for the results it delivers: touchably smoother, visibly brighter skin with zero irritation. (Even the Extra Strength version plays nicely with my skin.)  I use them about every other day for maintenance, or the night before an event to ensure my skin is in tip-top shape. Also pro tip: These are such a good beauty travel hack because each single-dose packet is compact and spill-proof — a far cry from hauling around bulky jars. After years of battling uneven tone and texture, I can confidently say that nothing has worked better — or faster — than these Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Trish McEvoy Beauty Booster® Serum, $130 “One of the biggest skincare lessons I learned this year? Protecting and strengthening my skin barrier is everything. For years, my go-to for hydration was a hyaluronic acid serum, but since entering my 30s, I’ve started looking for formulas with a little extra oomph. Enter Trish McEvoy’s Beauty Booster Serum. This upgrade doesn’t just deliver hyaluronic acid; it’s packed with powerhouse ingredients like vitamin B5 (a.k.a. panthenol) to enhance moisture absorption and peptides to support skin regeneration. Plus, it’s got glycerin to help draw hydration deep into the skin. The texture is lightweight yet substantial, sinking in fast without a trace.  It’s officially become my skincare MVP year-round.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer The Inkey List Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $20 “If you told me I had to use one moisturizer for the rest of my life, I wouldn’t hesitate to choose this. It’s everything I’ve ever needed in a face lotion: Barrier protection (thanks to bio-active ceramides, which act like glue in between skin cells, keeping them healthy and happy), hydration (that’ll be the glycerin) and a priming effect (all down to softening shea butter). Then there’s gransil blur, a fine powder that lends skin a soft-focus effect, as though you’re wearing a very subtle filter. I’ve been through six tubs this year and my skin has earned countless compliments from friends and beauty editor peers — all of whom I’ve convinced to buy! Even better? It won’t break the bank.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/timothee-chalemets-blond-hair-color-49419099",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Steve Granitz/FilmMagic Timothée Chalamet all but broke the internet when he debuted blond hair at the premiere of his new movie \"A Complete Unknown,\" abandoning his signature brunette curls in favor of a honey-toned hairstyle that he topped with a blue beanie. Combined with a newly grown goatee and mustache, Chalamet's blond hair left him looking almost unrecognizable and, unsurprisingly, sparked a serious stir from his surprised fans. But while the blond color and beanie were certainly a stark departure from his more traditional red carpet looks, it turns out there is, in fact, a very poignant reason behind his transformation: an homage to music legend Bob Dylan. Chalamet, who plays Dylan in \"A Complete Unknown,\" took inspiration from one of the musician's own looks from more than two decades ago: channeling an appearance the rocker made at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. The actor didn't stop at the blond shade and wispy facial hair - he even copied Dylan's outfit, walking the red carpet in a Celine leather jacket, red flannel shirt, a grey plaid scarf, and a blue marled beanie. The result was a near-identical replica of the look that Dylan modeled all those years ago. Chalamet's \"method dressing\" marks the latest in a long line of steps he has taken to throw himself into Dylan's shoes, which also involved paying a visit to the musician's childhood home and learning to play the guitar. His efforts earned the seal of approval from Dylan himself, who praised Chalamet's skills in a heartfelt post on Dec. 4 on X, when he voiced his excitement at seeing his life story being told by the actor. \"There's a movie coming out about me opening soon called 'A Complete Unknown' (what a title!),\" he wrote. \"Timothee Chalamet is starring in the lead role. Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me.\" This is not the first time that Chalamet has made over his natural brunette hair in an attempt to bring a character to life. In 2022, for his role in the cannibalistic romance movie \"Bones and All,\" he had his hair cut into an '80s-style mullet that was then streaked with red. It remains to be seen whether Chalamet has what it takes to commit to the life of a blond - or whether his method dressing was merely a final nod to the iconic character he played.
