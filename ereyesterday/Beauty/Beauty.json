    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sephora-ceo-artemis-patrick-interview?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When I think of my most formative beauty memories, a few things come to mind: Stealing swipes of lipstick from my mom’s bathroom, donating my hair as a teenager (and then three more times after that), and the first time I walked out of a Sephora holding a black-and-white striped shopping bag.  I’ll never forget feeling like the most glamorous, confident version of myself leaving the store. (I still have my first-ever purchase: A long-discontinued shade of Urban Decay’s Deluxe Eyeshadow in a groovy, ’70s-inspired packaging. I haven’t used it anywhere near my eyes in years, but can’t bear to part with it.) As I eventually established a career in beauty media, Sephora always held a special place in my heart. For me, Sephora was where I discovered my favorite products that marked my biggest milestones: The Stila twist-up glosses I gleefully swiped on in middle school, and receiving my first “grown-up” fragrance, Marc Jacobs Daisy.  And even as the beauty retail landscape shifts faster than the refresh of an FYP, Sephora is still among the most coveted doors any brand could enter. The retailer’s highly-anticipated sales never fail to generate buzz (not to mention, get people genuinely excited about a beauty haul), and in a post-pandemic world, it’s a shining example of the appeal of the in-store experience. (At any given time, my local Sephora store is packed full of shoppers of all ages eagerly swatching products and navigating the aisles with hawk-like focus.) DashDividers_1_500x100 We don’t know what beauty will look like in 2025, but we recently got the opportunity to speak to Sephora’s CEO, Artemis Patrick, the next best thing to a crystal ball. The Iranian-born beauty powerhouse has been at Sephora since 2006, leading the charge to innovations like spotlighting indie brands, inclusive foundation shade ranges, and expanding its Clean at Sephora category — including defining exactly what that means to Sephora customers. Ahead, we chatted with Patrick on her career journey, current product crushes, and what trends she’s forecasting next year. Refinery29: I’d love to hear about your beauty origin story. Did you always want to work in the industry? Artemis Patrick: Growing up, I loved seeing how beauty products had the power to transform not only appearances but also confidence. I didn’t set out specifically for a career in beauty, but I was a product of the ’80s and ‘90s beauty culture, and I was drawn to it because of its universal impact and ability to connect people across cultures and backgrounds.  R29: I’m sure every day looks a bit different for you, but if you’re able to share a glimpse into a day as Sephora’s CEO, what would that look like?I travel quite a bit as I try to visit at least one to two markets across the US and Canada every month. It’s incredibly important for me to hear directly from our Beauty Advisors in our stores as they are the front line to what our customers are saying. When I’m home in San Francisco, every day brings new opportunities and challenges, but my mornings always start with a focus on balance. Sleep quality is important to me, so I love checking my Oura Ring to see my sleep stats. After that, I grab my first coffee of the day and check my email. Some mornings, I may have early calls with our Paris team, which can start as early as 7 a.m. Sometimes I might take calls as I walk to work. It’s about a 35-minute walk, which is a great commute.  Once I’m in the office, my workday is varied but, in a way, similar. I spend time with my leadership team, having candid conversations about where we are, where we want to go and how to get there. There is also a mix of creative brainstorming, problem-solving, and decision-making —whether we’re discussing new product launches, refining the customer experience, or tackling challenges that come up.  There are a few treats I keep around throughout the day. Chocolate-covered almonds are my go-to snack, and a Caudalie elixir and Rare Beauty hand cream are on my desk when I need a refreshing scent boost.  When I get home, I spend some time with my husband and daughter, see how their days went, making sure I’m present for those moments. Later in the night, when my daughter typically does her homework, I’ll check emails.  Ultimately, my days are about blending purpose and passion — for my family, for myself and for Sephora.  R29: You’ve been at Sephora for 18 years, which is incredible. What is it about the brand that has kept you coming back for more?AP: Sephora has an incredibly dynamic culture that makes it easy to stay inspired. We’re continually pushing boundaries, whether that’s finding new, diverse brands, creating immersive store experiences, or enhancing our digital offerings. Sephora encourages everyone to bring fresh ideas to the table and never settle, and that’s both exciting and empowering.  R29: How does a brand stand out — or resonate with a community — in today’s beauty landscape?AP: Authenticity and purpose are what truly make a brand resonate. Consumers today are looking for products that are high-performing but also align with their personal values. They want to know the story behind the brand, what it stands for, and how it contributes to positive change—whether that’s in sustainability, inclusivity, or social impact. At Sephora, we’re proud to champion brands that offer more than just great products; in fact, the biggest differentiator for any of our brands is they offer meaningful stories that connect with our customers. The brands that stand out are those that engage deeply with their community, are transparent, and fill a white space in the beauty landscape. R29: As someone with a front-row seat to everything new and innovative in beauty, I’m super curious: What are some brands and products you’ve recently discovered and are loving these days?AP: There’s a wave of innovation in beauty right now, and it’s thrilling to see brands pushing the envelope on performance and creativity. Lately, I’ve been drawn to brands that bring a fresh, bold approach to color and artistry, as well as those that are elevating skincare, fragrance, and hair with innovative formulations. I’m especially excited about the brands that have been part of our Sephora Accelerate program like Fara Homidi, Topicals, Brown Girl Jane, and Sienna Naturals. These brands introduce new perspectives and address needs that haven’t been met before. It’s inspiring to watch these brands evolve and gain traction with our community, bringing something truly unique to the table. R29: Do you have any career advice that you’d like to share with anyone aspiring to work in beauty? AP: Stay curious, and always be ready to learn. Beauty is an industry that moves fast and evolves constantly, so being adaptable is key. I also think it’s essential to have a strong point of view and to understand your values. Ask yourself, “Why do I want to work in beauty?” Whether it’s a passion for artistry, inclusivity, or innovation, having that clarity will help guide your decisions and keep you grounded. And finally, embrace collaboration. Beauty is a team effort, and every product or campaign we launch comes from a mix of different perspectives and expertise. R29: Why do you think Sephora has resonated with so many beauty lovers — hello, Sephora tweens! — and continues to do so?AP: “We belong to something beautiful” is more than just a mantra—it’s our commitment to making prestige beauty accessible to everyone. From our curated product selection to the diversity of our teams, everything we do reflects and celebrates the uniqueness of our customers. Beauty is a deeply personal journey, and we recognize that everyone expresses it in their own way. Whether someone visits us in-store or shops online, we want every experience to feel personal and supportive. It’s this commitment to inclusivity, authenticity, and empowerment that keeps people coming back. Sephora isn’t just a store or beauty destination; it’s a community that celebrates beauty in all its forms. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-find-signature-scent-fragrance?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "My dressing table is a graveyard for perfumes that I’ve spritzed, fallen in love with and, for some reason or other, suddenly become turned off by. I can’t really explain it but if I were to use dating terminology, I’d say it’s the ick.    Admittedly, those fragrances sit there until they expire (yes, perfume has a best-before date; don’t worry, I try my best to recycle the bottles) or until one of my friends gives them a proper home where they aren’t relegated to the dusty depths of a bedside cabinet. And while my friends like to swap fragrances and discover new loves, most of them have one thing in common: They all have an unwavering “signature” scent.  What is a signature scent? The concept of the signature scent (a perfume that’s unmistakably you; that feels right rain or shine, day or night) is nothing new but as someone who doesn’t have one, it’s intriguing. It seems I’m not the only one who thinks so. ‘What is my signature scent’ and ‘signature scent meaning’ are both commonly googled questions. Meanwhile on TikTok, the hashtag #signaturescent pulls up 24.1k posts with millions of views — and there’s no gatekeeping. Fragrance enthusiasts, influencers and even renowned perfumers wax lyrical about the one scent that ticks all their boxes, from Burberry Her and Baccarat Rouge 540 to more affordable offerings like Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62.   So how exactly do you find the seemingly elusive signature scent? And in a world where new perfumes are launched almost daily, is it possible to whittle it down to just one? I enlisted the help of perfume experts and popular fragrance houses to find mine — and here’s everything I learned in the process. Does the “signature” scent really exist? If anyone could point me in the right direction of a signature scent, it would be perfumer Jérôme Epinette, the nose behind Byredo’s Bal d’Afrique, Phlur’s Tangerine Boy and Victoria Beckham’s San Ysidro Drive. Most recently, he has created fragrances for Noyz, arguably the most talked-about perfume brand on the internet right now.  The signature scent certainly exists, Epinette tells me, and it should serve as an extension of your personality. “The signature scent acts as a statement of who you are, no matter the season or occasion,” he says. “Whether the perfume evokes personal feelings or memories, or if it reflects how you want others to perceive you, a signature scent leaves a memorable impression on anyone you pass.” David Benedek, perfumery expert and founder and director of niche perfume brand BDK Parfums, agrees. “It’s something that you find and you can never live without it,” he tells me. “To find it, it has to match perfectly with your personality. It’s part of your identity.” How to find a signature scent: Start with an emotion If asking “Who am I?” is enough to spark an existential crisis, Epinette suggests starting with an emotion. How do you want your fragrance to make you feel? And what do you want to channel more of? To help me out here, I headed to Lush’s Scent Sanctuary for a fragrance reading. Lee Howes, Lush’s fragrance category lead, encouraged me to choose one of five ‘tarot’ cards, each depicting a different emotion ranging from confidence, comfort and sleep to joy and groundedness. As an anxious person, I could do with more confidence and comfort in my life, so I opted for those two. With this in mind, Howes matched me to perfumes with “confident” notes (thyme, tarragon and sandalwood, as in Lush Dirty Body Spray, $40) and “comfort” notes (vanilla, lemon and tonka found in Chelsea Morning, $45, and Turmeric Latte, $65.)  “Confidence comes from a place of familiarity and comfort,” Howes told me, which is why we settled on Turmeric Latte as a real contender for my signature. “This perfume is the foam on the top of your coffee cup breaking through at the first sip,” said Howes. “It’s inspired by slowing down and stopping.”  Understand the different olfactive families Lush’s Turmeric Latte falls into the ‘gourmand’ category — a name used to describe fragrances that are slightly sweet and moreish. To really get a feel for what you like, Benedek suggests doing a little research into each fragrance family.  Besides gourmand, a non-exhaustive list includes ‘aromatic’ (characterized by green or grassy notes like sage and rosemary), ‘woody’ (like sandalwood and vetiver), ‘fresh’ (such as citrus and sea salt) and ‘floral’ (exactly what it says on the tin). Once you know what you like in a more broad sense, you can get granular by researching fragrances with similar notes, says Benedek. He pinpoints perfume website Fragrantica as an excellent source of information on the various note families and corresponding perfumes.  Department stores aren’t the best places to try new fragrances Suppose you’ve narrowed down your search to a handful of fragrances. Trying them on in person is the next obvious step — but you might want to avoid department stores. “The smell in department stores is very strong,” says Benedek, referring to the tens of perfume counters and free-flowing spritzes. “For this reason, I try any perfumes outside on the street and see how I go,” he adds. Benedek suggests requesting a small sample to take home with you. “Wear it for a day — even a week — and see how you feel about it,” he says.   Sure enough, brands with standalone stores provide a much more personalized experience, as I discovered at Parfums de Marly’s store. This brand has been on my must-try list for a while thanks to TikTok’s fragrance enthusiasts, who are obsessed with Delina (lychee, rose and vanilla) and Oriana (marshmallow, grapefruit and whipped cream). I was matched with fragrance consultant Surita, who selected a few fragrances (namely Valaya Eau de Parfum and Safanad Eau de Parfum) based on notes I like, for example, the subtle floralness of orange blossom and zingy citrus. Something about Valaya in particular — with notes of white peach, mandarin, musk and vanilla — won me over immediately. It’s clean, comforting and energising in equal measure. I had to add it to my list. Another store I love is Penhaligon’s, a perfume brand which offers fragrance profiling to match you to the fragrance of your dreams. The shop was a haze of freshly spritzed perfume but only one stood out to me this time: The Dandy. Boozy whisky accord, tangy raspberry and zippy bergamot shouldn’t work on paper but together they smell incredible. I knew it was a contender when I left my sample behind in a hotel room and called frantically to see if it was still there. (That, and the moment when a woman chased me off the train to know the name.) Always try perfume on your skin, rather than clothes At both Penhaligon’s and Parfums de Marly, I was encouraged to try the perfumes on my skin. This, say the experts, is the key to finding a true signature scent. “A mistake a lot of people make is spraying the perfume onto a blotter or card and making a decision solely based on that,” said Surita. “The pH balance on the skin is an important factor,” she continued. “I’d rather you go home, try it properly on your skin and fall in love with it, then come back tomorrow morning.” Epinette agrees: “Apply [your perfume] to the skin to see how it evolves and blends with your skin chemistry,” he says. “The dry down is the most important thing; it’s the lasting impression you are left with.” Considering that perfume smells slightly different on everyone, Benedek suggests unfocusing your attention on what’s trending, or what other people are wearing. “Stay the master of your choice,” he advises. “Following your own path is a personal approach to discovering a signature scent.” Consider the “bungee” perfume method Ultimately, a signature scent exists if someone wants it to exist, Howes told me. “Say, for example, someone wants to be defined by a particular style, and they get their confidence and joy from being consistent,” he adds. But life tends to be a little more nuanced than that. “We don’t wear the same clothes every day, so why wear the same fragrance?” asked Howes. For this reason, he prefers a “fragrance wardrobe” — owning a small selection of interchangeable scents. Picking and choosing between them is something Howes calls “bungeeing”. “You can have a signature scent but also ‘bungee’ out to different ones when the time is right — and then return to your signature,” said Howes. “I have fragrances that I wear more often than any others, like Vegan Leather Jacket, which is smoky, deep and resinous, but it’s not right every single time.” With that in mind, Howes encouraged me to think about how I want to feel in the moment. “If you’re dressing a certain way to get closer to a certain feeling, you could then match your fragrance to that and you might feel a little more aligned,” explained Howes.   Epinette agrees that having a fragrance wardrobe — and even layering some of these perfumes — is the ultimate way to express individuality and create something as unique as you. And there are no rules. “Layering allows the wearer to create something truly signature, and you can do this by experimenting with blends of fragrances,” he says. “Personally, I don’t have a signature scent,” concluded Epinette, “but I choose [to layer] fragrances based on my mood and the occasion.” There’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. Often, renowned perfumers are the brains behind more affordable fragrances. Epinette, for example, created \u0026 Other Stories’ Perle de Coco Eau de Toilette, $45, and Zara’s Bold Blossom Eau de Parfum, $35.90.  Among the many perfumes recommended to me by the experts here, I’ve found myself reaching for just one: Penhaligon’s The Dandy. It’s everything I need in a fragrance right now: a dash of confidence, a comfort element and the promise of lighter days. Here’s how I knew I’d found my signature: Leaving a work event recently, one of my beauty editor peers picked out my coat based on its lingering scent. I think that was all the proof I needed to know that it’s all mine. Like what you see?

Cosmetics, Charlotte Tilbury, and many more drop holiday collections every year, and the special calendars for 2024 are even better than last year. Not to mention, some of your favorite beauty retailers like Sephora, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, and more have come out with their own Advent calendars filled with goodies from a variety of the brands they carry. Those are the best bet if you're not sure exactly what product assortment your loved one would like best.

No matter what your price range is, you have options. Some luxury options can go for more than $500, while affordable drugstore sets have a more modest price tag.
