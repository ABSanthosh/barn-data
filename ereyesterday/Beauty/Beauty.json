    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-beauty-foundation-dark-skin-tones-miss-darcei?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When beauty influencer Darcei Giles first tried a popular cushion foundation by Korean makeup brand TirTir, she knew it was not going to match her skin tone — but that was the point. The Toronto-based creative is known for her social media series, ‘Black Girl Tries’, where she attempts makeup styles, techniques, and products that aren’t typically associated with Black women — from “goth” makeup to K-pop idols. “I made a video of myself being like, ‘Hey, this is an awesome foundation, the coverage is beautiful and I love it, but it doesn’t come in my shade,” she tells Unbothered over Zoom. Giles, who has a keen interest in Korean culture, says the video led to TirTir creating more foundation shades, going from nine to 40 shades last year. TirTir now offers one of the widest shade ranges among K-beauty makeup brands available in the US. Now, Miss Darcei has finished working with another K-beauty brand, Parnell, on an inclusive 40-shade range for its new Cicamanu Serum Foundation — a move that not only reflects her growing influence but also the undeniable spending power of Black beauty consumers in the West. It’s an exciting development, especially as K-beauty — skincare and makeup products made and innovated in South Korea — continues to leave a huge impression on Western beauty trends and self-care. Known for its innovation and effectiveness, it’s now a multi-billion-dollar import in the US, and a fast-growing market in the UK. And chances are, you’ve learned to speak the language of K-beauty over the last few years (from snail mucin serums to fermented rice water toners). Yet, while its skincare products have enjoyed mass appeal, Korean makeup brands such as Laneige aren’t known for catering to a wide spectrum of dark skin tones — something other major cosmetic brands have significantly improved over the last decade. For those of us with darker skin, many have asked: “Is Korean makeup for me?” Darcei has been helping to answer that question.Unbothered spoke to Darcei about why she’s encouraging more K-beauty makeup brands to cater to darker-skinned customers internationally (despite some backlash) and helping all women of color feel seen in the skincare and makeup aisle. DashDividers_1_500x100 UB: Hey, Darcei! You are known for your YouTube series ‘Black Girl Tries’. What got you interested in the world of K-beauty? And how did it become part of your channel? Darcei Giles: I had always been into Korean culture since I was a kid, even before YouTube, and I was only into K-pop and K-dramas. I wasn’t even thinking about makeup at all. Once I started getting into American-style makeup, I began to discover that there were American beauty gurus and also Korean beauty gurus. [When I watched] the Korean beauty gurus, I was like, Oh, that’s so pretty, but you know, it wouldn’t look good on me. Then, eventually, during that time, a trend came around where we would try the makeup routine of another creator. I thought it would be hilarious if I followed the makeup tutorial of someone who did not look like me at all. I thought, Oh my god, this is going to look so terrible and stupid at the end. So I started following the makeup tutorials of Korean beauty influencers, and then, to my surprise, a lot of the stuff turned out pretty good. It became a popular series on my channel of me trying the opposite of what you think someone who looks like me would try. It turned into the ‘Black Girl Tries’ series. Why is K-beauty so appealing for Black beauty lovers right now, especially when we don’t necessarily see ourselves in the marketing?  DG: Beauty is universal. A good glittery eye and a glossy lip — everybody can wear that. I feel like now people are also recognizing that not only is Korean beauty really good, the quality is really good, but it’s also a lot more affordable than the brands that we’re used to. [Korean makeup artists] have different ways of applying makeup, different styles, and it’s this novelty of trying something you’ve never seen before. I also feel like [the makeup] fits Black people’s features a lot better. We have a lot of features in common with Asian people. [Because of my channel], I have found this community of young Black girls. I get messages all the time from Black girls telling me, “Oh, I was afraid to try this type of makeup or this certain style until I saw you try it.” I couldn’t believe it because growing up, I was the only person who was into any of the stuff I was into. Like no one had even heard of what a K-drama was, what K-pop is, they’d never heard of that. Now I have found this online community of millions of people who are interested in the same thing that I am. You’ve been instrumental in advocating for expanded shade ranges in Korean makeup products. What made you want to call out the lack of shade diversity in these products? DG: It started back on YouTube when I started doing the Black Girl Tries series in 2018. Even back then, I was trying a lot of K-beauty brands, and some of them started to make dark shades, so I would try them out. But I started to notice a pattern. Every single time a Korean brand would come out with darker shades, they would get discontinued because they didn’t know how to market to people who have darker skin. And so people with darker skin didn’t know that it existed, or even if they did, they didn’t think that the brand was really for them. Eventually, the shades would always get discontinued, and it was really frustrating. Then COVID happened, and all of those brands completely disappeared from the market. Everything changed. So it’s only now that they’re all coming back.  This led to you making your now viral video with the brand TirTir, right? DG: Yes, so the makeup brand TirTir only had nine shades at the time, which is actually a lot for a K-beauty brand — the standard is like three. I was invited to an event by a local store in Toronto, and everybody at the event was getting the nine shades of the TirTir except for me because it didn’t come in my shade. But I was like, “Can I just have it anyway?” I get home and I try it [and I made a video of me] being like, “Hey, this is a really awesome foundation, the coverage is beautiful, it’s like a satin finish, and I love it, but it doesn’t come in my shade”. So I said, “If you guys ever expand [your shade ranges], call me.” The brand actually did contact me, and they came out with 20 shades, which was like unheard of for a Korean makeup brand. That 20th shade was my shade. Now they have 40 shades. You recently worked with another Korean makeup brand, Parnell, to help formulate darker shades for its foundation range. Why do you think K-beauty brands are choosing to diversify shade ranges now? DG: Parnell initially put out 30 shades, and even the darkest of the 30 shades was not dark enough for me. So I made a video saying, “There are 30 shades, but none of them are dark, and so they can contact me.” They were like, “Can you help us make 10 more dark shades?” And that’s exactly what we did. It’s important to have people like me who can come in and consult on the shades and make sure that we’re getting the right undertones and trying it on actual people. That’s what I found with working with Korean brands. It’s never a thing where they don’t want to [expand their shade ranges]. Is it true you went to Seoul, Korea, to help Parnell formulate darker shades? What goes into making sure that this is an inclusive product? DG: I was very picky with the undertones, and it took maybe like four or five months of back and forth. I didn’t go to Korea every time. [Parnell] would like to send them to me in Canada, and I would take pictures and give my notes, and then send them back. At the end of it, it turned out so amazing. The photoshoot was great. We had diverse models showing off all of the different foundations. We had an event with a lot of foreign creators who live in Korea, because I feel like people don’t know that there are a lot of foreigners in Korea. The Parnell foundation is very glowy and moisturizing, and that’s really what I like in my everyday kind of foundation. I’m excited for everybody to try it out. There have been a lot of conversations about whether Korean brands need to be shade-inclusive, as it’s largely a monoracial society. What is your usual response to this comment online? DG: My usual response is that, especially for the Parnell foundations, the expanded shades are actually only available in the US. They’re not even available in Korea. This was a US expansion. Like a lot of Korean brands, they would love to expand internationally, to come over to the US. It’s that a lot of them simply don’t know how. Because it is such a monoracial society, it’s difficult to find people to try on the makeup when the brand is formulating it — it’s a lot different trying it on a white piece of paper than it is trying it on an actual human being. They don’t have the kind of resources that they would have in the US, where it’s extremely diverse. There are some different needs when it comes to makeup for darker skin tones as opposed to lighter skin. What was it like having those conversations with Korean brands? Were there any missing nuances?  DG: Oh, for sure. [Expanding shade ranges] is not simply about making an existing foundation darker. I feel like [our needs] are almost the opposite of what people in Korea like. For example, some people in Korea may like a shade or two lighter for their foundations, whereas we want the perfect match. We want it to look exactly like our skin. We also have different undertones. We’re not all golden; we’re not all neutral; we’re not all cool-toned. I find that a lot of Korean foundations run a little bit pink. I think it’s because it has a brightening effect on lighter skin tones, but on us it ends up looking like Peppa Pig! How do you envision the future of K-beauty in the global market, especially in terms of its impact on beauty standards and trends? DG: I think a lot of people still feel like they have to stay inside a certain box of who they’re supposed to be, like they can’t step outside of it. But I hope we’re moving toward a future where everyone feels free to enjoy whatever they want. At the end of the day, it’s just makeup. There shouldn’t be all these rigid rules about who gets to use what.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Summer is the perfect time for a little reinvention — or at least a minor makeup shake-up. With lighter evenings and brighter mornings, there are more daylight hours to experiment (no dressing table lamp or big light required). There’s also a buzz in the air with weddings, festivals, and the thrill of getting dressed up again. The only catch? Sweltering heat, rising humidity, and icy blasts of air-con don’t exactly make the best conditions for makeup. With that in mind, we asked four brilliant makeup artists to share the summer trends that actually work in real life. Think butter skin, watercolor finishe,s and blurred lips: low-maintenance, high-impact looks that won’t slide off your face by lunchtime. DashDividers_1_500x100 Butter Skin View this post on Instagram A post shared by Violette (@violette_fr) Nature does our skin plenty of favours during the summer. Warmer temperatures create an effortless sheen, a little sunshine gifts us a golden glow (though sunscreen is always non-negotiable), and naturally dry complexions don’t need quite as much TLC to stay hydrated and happy. The butter skin trend is all about building on this, laying the foundations with good skin prep before layering up. “Cream and liquid products create a dewy, smooth glow,” says Jen Lyons, artistry manager at NARS. She suggests approaching skincare with a light hand; we’re aiming for butter that’s been out of the fridge just long enough to give it a touch of glossiness (á la this soft look posted to Instagram by Violette_FR), not so long that it’s a glass-skin-esque puddle in the dish. Start with a humectant-packed serum like Anua 7 Rice Ceramide Hydrating Barrier Serum, $22, and a lightweight moisturizer such as Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer, $38. Then move on to a hydrating primer and light-reflecting foundation. “Make sure you set it with a mist,” adds Lyons, just for that extra staying power. Try Kosas Cloud Set Airy Setting \u0026 Smoothing Mist, $36. Watercolor Makeup View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emily Wood (@emilywoodmakeup) Watercolor makeup takes its inspiration from the wishy-washy technique and sheerness of watercolor paints — and it can be worn on your cheeks, eyes and lips. Much chicer than your high school art class, Lyons explains that it’s all about “softly blended makeup that’s lightly diffused.” Makeup artist Emily Wood and her haphazardly blended eyes and cheeks are the inspiration here.  Think washes of color rather than pops, and blurred edges rather than harsh lines: “Layering multiple products without a strong pigment will help to enhance this multidimensional look,” Lyons advises. Just because the pigment isn’t bold doesn’t mean the shades can’t be, though. This is a good opportunity to brave brighter hues than you might normally. Try caliray Socal Superbloom Lip and Cheek Dewy Gloss + Blush Tint, $28, Armani Luminous Silk Cheek Tint Liquid Blush, $39, and Refy Lip Blush, $24. Once you’ve selected your products (liquid is best, and the thinner the texture, the better), it’s all about blending. The finished look should be seamless. Use a fluffy brush to buff out or use the warmth of your fingers to melt the makeup into place.  Blurred Lip Lines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kelly Ariella (@kellyariella) Too low maintenance to bother with a pristine lip? Jamie Genevieve, makeup artist and founder of VIEVE, understands: “A blurred Cupid’s bow is the perfect look for summer,” says Genevieve. “It embraces the romantic blurred lip trend, which focuses on softening the edges of the lips to give them a smoother, more rounded appearance,” much like this look on Kelly Ariella. This is music to the ears of anyone who finds it impossible to keep their hands steady as soon as they try to trace their lips, or that one side of their Cupid’s bow always looks better than the other. “I start by using lip liner to softly draw around the edges of the lip, pressing slightly firmer to get a more defined Cupid’s bow,” says Genevieve. “Then I go in with the VIEVE Poutder, $25. The soft, matte mousse melts into lips and creates this velvety finish.” To really achieve that blurred lip effect, gently smudge along the lip line of your Cupid’s bow with your fingertip before moving on to lip mousse or a stain. Texture Harmony View this post on Instagram A post shared by EVELINE VANDERSTRAETEN (@evelinevds_) Skin texture trends have come a long way, evolving from flat matte in 2015 to the butter skin we’re seeing today. But makeup artists suggest blending the two: “We are seeing people being meaningful with the textures they are creating on the skin,” says Carly Utting, senior artist at MAC. “Makeup lovers are no longer looking for all-over glowy foundations or completely matte skin; the magic happens when the two textures meet perfectly.” Think a demi-matte center of the face with a perimeter of glow around the edges, says Utting. “It keeps the skin looking reflective in the right areas but smooth and blurred in the center.” We love this makeup on Eveline Vanderstraeten. As the middle of your face is where you’re most likely to experience excess shine or redness, it makes sense to go for a higher coverage, less glowy finish here. Forgoing powder or mattifying primer around the edges of your face is an easy way to achieve the trend with minimal effort. Or for the makeup maximalists, use a different primer for each zone of your face. Favorites of ours include Iconic London Underglow Blurring Primer, $30, and e.l.f. Power Grip Matte Primer, $10. The ’00s Nude Lip View this post on Instagram A post shared by MYLA (@pradaolic) Crochet bandanas are back, so it was only a matter of time before ‘00s pale lips returned, too. “We’re predicting a ‘blanked out’ sheer wash of skin tones on the lips this summer,” says Utting, who pinpoints Gabbriette as modern inspiration. We also love this glossy look on artist Myla. Just don’t try to achieve it with a layer of Dream Matte Mousse: “For 2025, this trend has evolved to a more modern feel, with pale nude lips bringing a satin texture rather than opaque matte,” she says. Adding, “MAC’s Lipstick in Fleshpot, $25, is the ultimate 2000s lip shade. Try patting a small amount onto the lips with a clean finger just to knock back the color of the lips.” For deeper skin tones, the shade Stone, $25, is similarly cool in tone and provides the same effect.  This works especially well in summer, when skin looks naturally more vibrant and wardrobes get bolder, too. It’s not a look that pairs with a muted palette. For a subtler take, try layering one of these ‘blanked-out’ shades under your go-to neutral lipstick for a hint of the trend. Blue Jeans View this post on Instagram A post shared by UK Pro Artist Charlotte Tilbury (@gracesloanmua) The shade of summer skies started making a comeback on eyes at Fashion Week SS24 — and it seems to be sticking around for another season. The hue du jour for 2025 is denim rather than cobalt or cerulean, making this a far more wearable take. “With Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour bringing country and western style to stores — think blue suede tassels and washed denim jeans — it was only a matter of time before we saw this translate to makeup,” Utting explains. “This blue mixes a little grey onto the palette; try MAC Dazzleshadow Eyeshadow Stick in Bedazzled Denim, $28, or the eyeshadow in Tilt, $25.” Even in this muted hue, blue is still bolder than your average beige or taupe, so keep the rest simple, like this look by Grace Sloan for Charlotte Tilbury. Utting suggests combining denim blue hues with soft bronzed skin and a glossy lip. Self-Expression View this post on Instagram A post shared by KATIE JANE HUGHES (@katiejanehughes) The clean girl aesthetic has ruled for a while now (thanks, Hailey Bieber), but it’s starting to feel a little… dare we say, boring? As a result, self-expression is less a trend and more a movement: “Do whatever makes your makeup feel like you,” says Lyons. If you’re not sure where to start, she suggests thinking about your favorite feature: “Your eye color, lip shape, cheekbones. Create your makeup look around enhancing them.” No one does it better than makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes here. If you’re not ready to stray too far from the clean look, Emma Tilman, global pro artist at Estée Lauder, suggests dipping a toe in by embracing the creative side of makeup with natural skin, but an added pop of color, too. “Try a pastel lilac eyeliner or blue eyeshadow like we saw on the spring and summer runways, or a colored mascara for a more subtle approach.” We love Sephora Collection Size Up Supersized Volume Mascara in Blue, $15, and Revolution Wrap Lash Tubing Mascara Burgundy, $12. The rules are, there are no rules.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "description": "Image Source: Tom Hauck/Getty Images You don't have to know much about the Dallas Cowboys - let alone football - to know who the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders are. Arguably the most famous cheerleading team in the U.S., if not the world, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC for short) are the epitome of effortless glamour. But what does it actually take to look the part of America's Sweetheart? \"There's not one specific look to a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader,\" Kelli Finglass, current director and former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader, says on season one of Netflix's documentary series, \"America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,\" which came back for a second season on June 18, 2025. Finglass, along with many current and past DCC members in the hit documentary, emphasizes a certain \"it\" factor that each girl has to have to even make the squad. When it comes to their glam, it's an individualized look that considers everything such as eye color, skin tone, hair texture, and attitude that's later finessed to highlight their best features. \"I would describe the quintessential look of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders as very classy, with a touch of quiet luxury,\" Kevin Ozowski, stylist at Tangerine Salon, the Dallas-based official salon of DCC, says. \"Their hair needs to move with them while they dance; it needs to be bouncy and visible for the fans.\" It's \"natural glam-esque,\" adds Victoria Kalina, former DCC cheerleader and one of the main focuses of season one of the Netflix documentary. \"Not bold and overly dramatic, but we do need to have that glam aspect just because we are far away. We're on billboards [and] on HD screens in AT\u0026T Stadium; we do need to have that kind of high-def look to our makeup.\" For the record, there are no real strict rules on what colors women can or cannot wear for their makeup or how to do their hair. It's more of loose guidelines to help them strike that perfect balance between glam and natural. Former DCC cheerleader Katherine Puryear, for example, says she could experiment with teals or purples in her waterline to match her brown eyes. But stops at putting on anything that is too heavy or excessive, such as heavy eyeliner or crazy bold colors. \"A soft beat,\" says Puryear. \"You want to look like you have makeup on, but to a point where it looks natural and enhances your features.\" \"You still look like the girl next door while pulling off-stage makeup essentially,\" adds Madeline Massingill, another former member of DCC. \"You [also] don't want to take away from the uniform because it's the iconic uniform.\" Makeover Days The first step to looking the part is makeover day, and Tangerine Salon is where these transformations first happen. During training camp, Ozowski will attend a practice to watch the women and observe how their hair moves while dancing. Then, alongside Finglass, they decide on what styles and hair colors might look best on each girl. Day of, they'll do a consultation with each girl about the looks they're suggesting before handing them to their assigned stylist. The process can last anywhere from a few hours to most of the day, depending on how big of a change they're making. \"A look is important to the overall appeal,\" Finglass says in the documentary. \"Having renewed confidence or kind of an extra dose of glam certainly helps.\" But regardless of how drastic that change might be, Finglass, Ozowski and the styling team are there to help them ease into their new look. \"You know somebody's beautiful, but they just have the wrong hair color. We take them to the salon and address that,\" Finglass goes on to say in the show. \"Nine times out of ten, they love it and they're more photogenic because of it.\" \"Sometimes you can tell the girls are a bit nervous,\" Ozowski says. \"They are always excited, but I do try to reassure them that we are experts in our field and we wouldn't give them anything that wouldn't suit them.\" Massingill agrees and says makeover day actually helped her rediscover her natural curls. The former DCC cheerleader recalls coming to her first training camp with straight, jet-black hair. It ended up getting chopped and lightened, but it wasn't until she got cut from the team that she leaned into the huge transformation-at least hair-wise. \"When I got cut, I was like, OK, what does Maddie need to do to be Maddie?'\" she says. She came back the next year with light brown hair and her natural curls, and the rest was history. \"If I show up and I'm being myself and they love me, great. If I show up and I'm being myself and they don't, OK, I'm not meant to be there. When I came back, they were just as surprised as I was that I found my naturally curly hair. I'm really glad that they embraced it because I now can't imagine having any other curls.\" Tangerine Salon is also an Aveda salon, so the products Ozowski and the stylists use (and recommend moving forward) are a lot of the Aveda classics, such as the Control Force Strong Hold Hairspray ($40), Botanical Repair Treatment ($56), and Heat Relief Heat Protectant ($40). They also give the women hairstyling tips to take with them for game days, such as prep with hot rollers for volume, never forget to use a heat protector and hairspray, and how to curl hair for that quintessential DCC hair. Once done, these are the looks they keep throughout the season. Game Days How the women look on game day stays the same for any outside appearances, focusing on that natural glam. But the prep for game days specifically starts hours before kickoff, where the cheerleaders will do their full makeup and hair before boarding the bus to the stadium. The touch-ups, famously known as the \"Fluff and Puff,\" occur before rehearsal, before they perform their iconic opening entrance dance, \"Thunder,\" and during halftime. But there's not much time to re-apply a full face of makeup (though some might do it), so many opt for quick re-applications of their easiest products. \"The 'fluff and puff' was definitely necessary,\" says Massingill. \"We always felt way better headed back out feeling really good.\" As for the exact products they use for their glam, Massingill, Kalina, and Puryear share with PS all the products that got them through game day. See what they used below. Victoria Kalina's Beauty Routine Image Source: Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Kalina's glam started with skin prep using peel masks and moisturizer from Lancôme (\"Lancôme girly over here,\" she says). Then, she skipped the primer and went straight into makeup. For the base, her go-to was Clinique's Even Better Foundation ($39). \"It hides all of my blemishes,\" she says. \"You only need a little bit and it will do full coverage; it is amazing [and] a full bottle would last me all season.\" She loves pinks and would gravitate toward Bobbi Brown Blush in Desert Pink ($36) to add color to her cheeks and the Too Faced Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer ($38). For her eye makeup, she stuck to colors that complement her eyes best. \"I have green eyes, so I really stick to those pinker and purple shades,\" she says. Her go-to shadows came from an old Too Faced Valentine's Day palette they no longer make, the Ardell Wispies False Lashes ($13), and Too Faced's Better Than Sex Mascara ($29). And for her lips, it was all about the gloss. \"A lot of girls will say that gloss is a no-go just because there's so many hair flips, but I love a gloss,\" she says. \"So I will be glossing up my lips before game day [officially starts], after halftime, right before we go back out.\" She used the Clinique Chubby Stick in Woopin' Watermelon ($25), followed by the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Liner in Mauve ($23). Then, for extra shine, she'll layer on a light pink Lancôme Juicy Tube ($25). To lock it all into place, she'd spray the Too Faced 3-in-1 Hangover Rx ($38). As for her hair, she went with the classic, big Texas curls. \"Big hair, don't care. The higher the hair, the closer to God,\" she says. She would use Conair's 1-and-¼ inch Clamp Curling Iron ($26) and pin curl her hair. \"I would pin curl it before going on the bus. Then we would do rehearsal and I would come back whenever we had fluff and puff time to re-pin the curls.\" To set hair, she'd use SexyHair Big Sexy Hairspray ($10) while her hair is in the pin curls and the Sebastian Professional Shaper Plus Hairspray ($30) after. Katherine Puryear's Beauty Routine Image Source: Wesley Hitt/Getty Images Puryear's skin-care regimen included a double cleanse with an oil-based cleanser (especially useful for post-game when she needs to take off her makeup) and foaming cleanser, followed by gentle exfoliation pads that she can use everyday to lift excess dirt and debris. Because she has dry skin, she'd turn to a hydrating toner. Then, followed up with a dark spot corrector (niacinamide, snail mucin, and vitamin C are key ingredients), an eye cream, moisturizer, and sunscreen. For her makeup, she'd start with placing primer around her smile line and nose. Followed by the Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation ($52), a contour in a cool tone, concealer, the Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Creme \u0026 Powder Blush Duo ($38), and bronzer. She opted for the Fenty Beauty Flyliner Longwear Liquid Eyeliner ($24) and Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Longwear Lip Liner ($24) and then she'd spritz the One/Size by Patrick Starr On 'Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray ($34) to set it all in. To get those voluminous curls, she turned to a tried-and-true hair trick: the sock curl. \"I would sock curl it the night before,\" she says. \"They look absolutely crazy when you wake up, but by game time, they have fallen so beautifully that all you need is a quick touch-up during halftime.\" She'd lock in her makeup and strategically place deodorant to act as a barrier to ensure she didn't sweat off her makeup. \"A little deodorant on the hairline helps a little bit,\" she says, warning to do this carefully. \"[Do] not use sweat blockers on your face. It burns so bad, dries your face out, and makes your makeup crack. It truly was the worst learning experience ever.\" Madeline Massingill's Beauty Routine Image Source: Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images As beauty lovers know, prepping for makeup starts with prepping the skin. Massingill looked for products that helped protect and support her skin barrier. \"I really like the Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin ($49),\" she says. \"It has a bit of tackiness to it, so my makeup sticks really well to it, and it's just good for my skin barrier while makeup [is] put on it multiple times during game day.\" Her favorite foundation was Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless Liquid Foundation ($11), which she says did not move on game day. \"It's just thick enough that it stays on really well and it's just matte enough to not add shine to the sweat.\" During her time with DCC, she says they were sponsored by Kiss and wore Kiss strip lashes for added volume. Her trick to making them look as natural as possible was sticking the strip underneath her lash instead of on top. \"I have pretty small eyes, so I would cut my [strip] lash in half and just the long half on the outer edge,\" she says. \"I would put my lashes underneath because I found it looked a lot more natural and would hold up on a game day a lot better.\" Toward the end of her time cheering with the Dallas Cowboys, she would experiment with a cat-eye. But she mostly opted for a neutral smoky eye, which she said looked best on her, and leaned towards more mauve-like shades for her lips. Her favorite was Urban Decay Vice Lipstick in Rapture ($21). And to make sure her makeup wouldn't move, she reached for the Fitish Don't Sweat It $24). \"It's a small company in Dallas,\" she says. \"And your makeup will not move. So whenever people ask, 'How do you keep your makeup on all game day?' That was my holy grail.\" She teased her curls for game days using the DevaCurl Devafuser ($55) to add volume and a paste mixture of the Bed Head Masterpiece Shiny Hairspray ($26) and SexyHiar Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing \u0026 Texturizing Powder ($23) for a strong hold. She credits her teammates for any hair tricks and tips she learned over the years. \"That was one of my favorite things my rookie year,\" she says. \"One of my leaders, Jenna, would sit in her locker, and I would sit on the floor right in front of her locker. She would tease my hair for me because I didn't know how to do the Texas tease.\" The getting ready process was a \"sisterly bond\" for everyone, and the beauty lessons learned were later passed down to new teammates. \"Beauty is a community on our team,\" she says. \"We sat in our lockers together. We would share all of our products. You never had to be worried about if you forgot something; someone had it, and someone would share. . . It felt like I had 35 older sisters.\" Audrey Noble is a beauty writer who covers breaking news, writes celebrity profiles, and does deep-dive features about the ways race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity impact society via the beauty industry.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/bella-hadid-rich-girl-nails-49448162",
    "description": "Bella Hadid is officially bringing back the \"rich girl\" manicure. OK, to be fair - it never really left, but the subtle, pared-down manicure has taken a back seat as of late in favor of more maximalist options. If you're ready for a break from looks like fruit nails and aura nails, you're going to want to pay attention. Hadid showcased her glossy new manicure in a recent Instagram carousel, giving followers a behind-the-scenes look at a photoshoot for her fragrance brand, 'Ôrebella, in collaboration with Wildflower phone cases. Hadid's nails were filed into a mid-length square shape and painted with a nude, cool-toned polish - the ultimate rich girl shade. The manicure was first coined by celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik, who works with some of the biggest celebrity names in the game, like Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, and Hailee Steinfeld. \"'Rich girl' nails are a modern take on a sophisticated classic,\" Bachik previously told us about the trend. \"[The] color is a creamy, full-coverage nude paying homage to the greige inspiration originally seen with Chanel.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by sydney lynn (@sydneylynncarlson) Bachik first created the look for Jennifer Lopez with a beige shade on a square, tapered nail. Hadid's newest manicure follows the rich girl formula to a T, and it has us picking up our phones and scheduling our next nail appointment. We're ready to go back to basics, baby. If you're as excited as we are but wondering what shade to pick for the perfect rich girl manicure of your own, don't worry - we've got you covered. \"I like to choose a tone one shade lighter or one shade darker than your natural skin tone, so nails are subtle yet deliberate,\" Bachik says. Our current favorite shades for the trend are the Chanel Le Vernis Longer Nail Color in shade Particulière ($33) and the OPI Nail Lacquer in Do You Take Lei Away ($12). And of course, don't forget a glossy topcoat to finish everything off. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
