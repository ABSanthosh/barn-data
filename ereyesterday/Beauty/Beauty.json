    "description": "If you were to text your best friend and ask if they have a cowlick, there is a high likelihood they would reply “Oh, let me tell you about it.” Even though most of us have learned how to hide them with a straightener or styling gel, cowlicks are everywhere — over 98 percent of the population has one. But for anyone unfamiliar, a cowlick is a small section of hair that grows differently than your other hairs, often taking on a swirl-like shape. “It can stick straight up or just lay in a completely different angle,” explains Nick Latham, one half of the London-based salon team The Hair Bros. Latham sees a lot of cowlicks in his line of work. His salon requests that clients come in with their natural hair (air-dried, not heat-styled), making it easier to identify those delightfully swirled or against-the-grain hairs. “Often, we can identify them visually, or a client will mention their cowlick,” Latham explains. Most will assume that their hairline cowlick prohibits certain hairstyles. For example, “There is a common myth that bangs and cowlicks cannot work,” says Latham. This assumption hinges on a narrow view of what a bang is and who it’s for. “In the past, where bangs were perfect — straight and very blunt — it is true, a cowlick would cause chaos,” says Latham. “But these days, where everything is softer, hair moves more, and a cowlick can work beautifully with your bangs.” According to Latham, the aspects of a cowlick that we often rage against — the texture or angling — can reinforce a bang and create a nice lift to the hair. For example, Latham references a recent client with a cowlick that “opened slightly” around her face. “We thought, why not really lean into the nuances and bends? In came this bang!” What are cowlick bangs? Every cowlick is different, thus a cowlick bang is personal. “A bang with a cowlick is actually more individual than any other,” explains Latham. What differentiates cowlick bangs from other styles — baby bangs, curtain bangs, ’70s bangs — is its movement and shape. “They are different in the sense that they will not lie flat,” adds Latham. “Instead, they have more volume and more of a bend, which can really open up an individual’s eyes and compliment features like cheekbones.” “They have more volume and more of a bend — which can really open up an individual’s eyes and compliment features like cheekbones.” To compare the cowlick bang to other bang styles, Latham says, “It is shorter, more the vibe of an actual bang as opposed to a longer, swoopier shape.” Whatever its length, a cowlick bang will often have a natural openness, exposing the forehead. “A cowlick bang can still part like a curtain bang,” Latham adds. “With a cowlick bang, we encourage embracing the nuances as opposed to wanting the hair to sit too perfectly.” How to ask for cowlick bangs The length of a cowlick bang can be tailored. But Latham’s pro tip: “Start a little longer and judge how your bang is behaving before going shorter.” As for specifics of the cowlick bangs, “We like to keep the middle of the bangs slightly blunter than normal,” explains Latham. “This adds extra weight, which will help control the bangs, and help with the day-to-day styling. Often we will keep a little more length past the corners of the eyebrows, which adds an element of versatility, especially if you want to brush the bangs back into a more 80’s-vibe blow-dry.” But what if you have curly hair? Textured hair specialist Luke Castillo says the same rules apply. “Due to the nature of the way the curly hair grows out of the scalp, curly and coily hair clients can be prone to cowlicks,” Castillo explains. “More so in curly hair, this acts as a huge advantage as it creates a natural root lift to the hair which, in turn, enhances the volume of hair.” For the cut, he uses a razor to “soften through the bangs so that the hair blends in with the cowlick,” he explains. “Another way to work with the cowlick, especially on curly hair, is to create a heavier bang or take the bang on the shorter side and make it a point of view rather than working against the cowlick.” How to style cowlick bangs This depends on your hair texture. But whatever you do, don’t be too precious with your styling. Latham recommends using a no-dent hair clip to flatten the middle of the bangs and then “bevel the edges” into a ’60s shape using a round brush. “Bear in mind that the cowlick may rise throughout the day, so don’t be too scared to go a little flatter,” he explains. “Remember also that bangs do not need to be parted in the middle, and that the beauty of a cowlick bang lays in some strands bending in slightly different directions.” “The beauty of a cowlick bang lays in some strands bending in slightly different directions.” Another great option for a fuller effect is to use a hair dryer and round brush (or a heated round brush, if you have one) and set the bangs forward and under “in three, fairly small sections,” Latham recommends. “After doing this you can brush the bangs back into an up-and-over type of movement (think Claudia Schiffer).” Before your appointment, Latham recommends looking up a few references. “Do your research with references, explain yourself and your hair thoroughly,” he advises. “But also don’t obsess too much when styling. Remember your bangs shouldn’t look the same every day.” Cowlicks are cute, let them do their thing. Like what you see?

    "description": "Choosing a signature scent is a deeply personal decision, but our purchases can be so easily swayed by social media trends. A single viral TikTok can often be the reason behind a fragrance's overnight fame, turning a once-niche scent into a sold-out cult favorite everyone suddenly needs in their collection. Case in point: Baccarat Rouge 540, which was first introduced back in 2016 but enjoyed a massive spike in popularity many years later thanks to PerfumeTok.Instead of waiting for the algorithm to decide what’s next, we’ve decided to go straight to the experts — fragrance industry specialists, experienced beauty editors, and rising content creators — to find out which trending perfumes will be the next breakout hits. With their sixth sense for predicting trends, these pros are nominating their favorite up-and-comers before they sell out. These picks range from sultry ouds to aromatic tea blends, proving that 2025 will be yet another interesting year in fragrance. Some of these perfumes are already bubbling under the surface, while others are fresh launches poised to take over your FYP any minute now.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.For more can't-miss shopping and travel stories delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our Most Wanted newsletter.Victoria Beckham Beauty 21:50 Rêverie Eau de Parfum“I predict that 21:50 Rêverie from Victoria Beckham Beauty will become a cult favorite along the lines of Baccarat Rouge 540. Its main notes are vanilla and tonka bean, but unlike most vanilla-forward perfumes, it’s not too saccharine. Tobacco leaves, cedarwood, and plum ground the sensual blend with some depth. As someone who gravitates towards more floral fragrances, I didn't expect to love it so much, but from the first spritz, I was addicted. It was apparently inspired by a memorable date night Victoria had with David Beckham on the island of Java, so it's no surprise this fragrance feels like sex appeal in a bottle. Be prepared to feel like the most confident person in the room when you wear this.” — Kristina Rodulfo, beauty editor and content creatorShop Victoria Beckham BeautyVictoria Beckham Beauty 21:50 Rêverie Eau de Parfum, $, available at Victoria Beckham BeautyBy Rosie Jane Dulce Eau de Parfum“Dulce is the perfect balance of what people loved about the gourmand boom of 2024: creamy, cozy vanilla, married with an airy softness that feels like a second skin. It doesn’t overwhelm; instead, it envelops you in this understated, intimate scent bubble. Vanilla is undeniably beloved, but the musky, skin-like finish of Dulce makes it feel modern and endlessly wearable, almost like an invisible cashmere sweater. It’s indulgent yet effortless, which is the vibe I think people are craving right now.“I’ve seen complaints that Dulce fades too quickly, but I also believe 2025 will be the year we move away from obsessing over a 12-hour performance in fragrance. Dulce is a perfect example of why: It’s a scent you want to reapply, not because it disappears too quickly, but because the act of wearing it feels luxurious. It fits the evolving mindset around fragrance as something more intimate and personal and lingers softly on the skin; less about projection and more about enhancing your own experience.” — Caroline Stern, perfume content creatorShop Sephoraby rose jane Dulce Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum“Phlur can do no wrong in my eyes. The brand releases banger after banger, often going viral in the process. (Vanilla Skin Eau de Parfum, which just nabbed a R29 MVP Award for fragrance, comes to mind.) The secret, in my opinion, is that the brand makes each scent appeal to all. But despite this widespread allure, each scent somehow makes the wearer feel unique and special. Golden Rule is my next pick for soon-to-be-viral status. Upon first sniff I’m drenched in sunny, juicy notes of mandarin that lure me right in. Rather than smelling sickly sweet, the scent is fresh and fruity, drying down to a smooth base of coconut milk and vanilla cream. This is juxtaposed with a hit of sandalwood to keep it from falling into the gourmand category, which I’m not a huge fan of. If you don’t like foodie scents but don’t mind a fun injection of sweetness, this one’s for you.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop SephoraPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at Phlur\u0026 Other Stories Blank Pages Eau de Toilette“In 2025, I’m choosing to support mid-to-low-priced fragrances that are credible, well-made, and sit nicely on the skin — and most importantly, don't pretend to be anything other than an easy-going scent to top up every few hours. I recently tried the new perfumes from \u0026 Other Stories and think they will do well throughout the year. Blank Pages is the clean skin, pillowy scent that seems to be catnip these days, and has a silky profile that reminds me of warm pajamas just pulled out of the dryer. The woods and white musks remind me of cracking open a fresh new paperback novel. It’s so subtle and lightweight, but that’s the type of scent I want to be wearing to brace myself for another chaotic day. The best part? It's only $45.” — Alice du Parcq, fragrance presenter, expert, and hostShop \u0026 Other Stories\u0026 Other Stories Blank Pages Eau de Toilette, $, available at \u0026 Other StoriesLoewe Solo Vulcan Eau de Parfum“Resinoids have had everyone in a chokehold lately and I see this continuing in 2025. This plant extract produces a syrupy balsamic note that notably made Lush’s Sticky Dates collection a TikTok sensation. Solo Vulcan takes this to the next level, featuring a signature Loewe accord — an ambery, resinous note drawn from Iberian rockrose wildflowers — layered with lavender, thyme, and orange flower absolute. Herbaceous scents are more often a miss for me, as they remind me of dried seasoning from the grocery store, but this one feels so much more elevated thanks to a hint of balsamic tickling the nose. The overall profile is very fresh and ‘wet’ in a sense, like strolling through a herb garden right after a rain shower. It dries down to a gorgeous sweet floral that makes me want to sniff my wrists again and again. Even though Solo Vulcan is marketed as a pour homme spray, I predict it will really take off as a genderless fragrance.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop Net-A-PorterLoewe Solo Vulcan Eau de Parfum, $, available at Net-A-PorterD.S. \u0026 Durga Pistachio Eau de Parfum“Pistachio fragrances are big right now. D.S. \u0026 Durga’s Pistachio is the first pistachio perfume I’ve ever tried, and is almost certainly the last, as it’s pretty much perfect. The initial impression is light and subtly sweet like a scoop of pistachio gelato, but is beautifully balanced with notes of warm, earthy cardamom and patchouli. The nuttiness definitely shines through thanks to the titular ingredient in the heart, mid, and base, but it also has a marzipan-like sweetness thanks to almond and vanilla crème. I love wearing it alone or layered with one of my woodier scents (I think pistachio and sandalwood are utterly gorgeous together) to switch things up.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Pistachio Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at NordstromPrada Infusion de Rhubarbe Eau De Parfum“All of Prada’s fragrances are a cut above the rest. They’re so unique and interesting — and Rhubarbe is no different. With tart rhubarb accord, zingy green mandarin and lush rose, it’s equal parts grassy and syrupy, and I just can’t get enough of it on my skin. Once it dries down, it develops into a soapy and clean scent that’s really comforting; something about it reminds me of the ‘90s. It’s nostalgic in the best way. What’s more, the bottle is absolutely beautiful.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop SephoraPrada Infusion de Rhubarbe Eau De Parfum, $, available at SephoraSidia Soaked Solid Perfume“Fragrance boomed in 2024, and I don't see the category slowing any time soon. In fact, I've noticed a spike in other formats through which to experience scent, such as solid perfume. Sidia Soaked Solid Perfume is one of my recent favorites. The tiny but weighty compact is home to a balm version of the brand's signature blend of jasmine, cypress, and musk, which is somehow both comforting and invigorating. Since it’s solid, I can dab the scent exactly where I want it — like on my inner wrists or behind my ears. I find the fragrance lasts for several hours, but if I want to top up, I love that I can do so at my desk without accidentally spritzing my coworkers.” — Dianna Singh, features director, AllureShop SidiaSidia Soaked Solid Perfume, $, available at SidiaCreed Fragaria Eau de Parfum“Fruit-forward perfumes, particularly ones with citrus and berry notes, are making a comeback. No, I’m not talking about the body mists that were staples during our teenage years. The trending assortment of fruity scents are way more complex and grown-up, with far higher concentrations of perfume oil — and therefore longevity. Creed’s Fragaria is the perfect example. It opens with a sharp and punchy blend of mandarin and bergamot that almost smells like fresh mangos, before the succulent strawberry heart notes break through. This all sounds similar to eating sorbet, but thanks to spiky pink pepper and powdery violet, the actual olfactory experience is vibrant yet sensual. Patchouli, vetiver, and cedarwood ground the strawberry note and help it linger on my skin for hours. Fruit notes normally don’t last very long, so I’m rather impressed that I still smell like a walking strawberry field hours after application.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop SelfridgesSelfridges Fragaria Eau de Parfum, $, available at SelfridgesZara Elegantly Tokyo Eau de Parfum “Even though Elegantly Tokyo came out back in 2021, I truly believe it’s poised to have its time in the sun this year. Created by perfume legend Jo Malone, it encapsulates the best qualities of a woody floral — an enduringly popular scent category — while offering unbelievable value for money. The luscious cocktail of lily and jasmine envelops you in a luxurious-smelling cloud that refuses to evaporate; I’ve sprayed this on my sweatshirt and can still smell traces of it the next day. It has a musky, almost incense-like dry down, thanks to akigalawood at the base. Fans have compared it to Mugler Alien, another jasmine-heavy perfume, but I prefer Elegantly Tokyo’s sparkling initial blast. I’ve been carrying the travel size in my handbag everywhere, asking my friends to smell it and guess how much it costs. I love watching their jaws drop when I tell them that it’s only $23. Zara, please never discontinue this scent!” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ZaraZara Elegantly Tokyo Eau de Parfum, $, available at ZaraMaison Crivelli x Jordi Fernandez Oud Cadenza Extrait de Parfum“Oud Cadenza begins its journey with an explosion of hot spices, the sweetness of sugar cane and caramelized dates wrapped in an oud accord. But it’s not an overly sweet gourmand, which is one of the reasons why I love it and think it will be a big hit this year. The deepness of oud, leather, and patchouli coupled with the spices and smokiness of incense seamlessly balances and prevents it from becoming too sweet. It also lends a mature character to the gourmand notes, while maintaining its seductive and addictive quality. As the fragrance makes its way to the base, it reveals a rich, warm, resinous creaminess that makes you want to constantly sniff yourself. This one needs to be added to the collection for winter date nights or if you want to be the center of attention in any room you walk into.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop HarrodsMaison Crivelli x Jordi Fernandez Oud Cadenza Extrait de Parfum, $, available at Harrodsd’Annam Matcha Soft Serve Eau de Parfum“I’ve been seeing lots of buzz for Matcha Soft Serve, a creation by Vietnamese fine fragrance house d’Annam. While I don’t think vanillic, sugary gourmands are going anywhere just yet, I’m noticing a marked shift towards photorealistic scents [perfumes that smell like a real-world thing]. All the cool girls are swapping their daily flat white for an iced matcha latte, and the ingredient is sweeping into the fragrance space, with this matcha-forward scent selling out a few times over. Think earthy ceremonial grade matcha, soft milky vanilla, and the sweetness of a traditional waffle cone all blended together smoothly. It’s simply delicious: not too sweet and not too grassy.” — Sade Akinsanya, perfume enthusiast and content creatorShop d’Annamd’Annam Matcha Soft Serve Eau de Parfum, $, available at d’AnnamLike what you see?

Depending on who you are, that might mean the next few weeks look like romantic plans with a partner, dedicated nights out with friends, or embracing self-love in the form of self-care. (It could also include all or none of the above because this isn't a Hallmark movie.) If you're a fan of all things beauty, there's also an opportunity to fall head over heels for the latest product launches. This month, you can expect plenty of newness from all your favorite beauty brands, from Ilia to R.em. to Crown Affair. Whether you're looking for the perfect deodorant that will leaving you smelling good all night, a scent that will last through even the longest of dates, or an at-home masking kit that will help you put your best face forward, there's a little something for everyone. If you're not sure where to start, we've enlisted the help of PS beauty editors to narrow down the list for you. After spritzing, swiping, and swatching our way through hundreds of different products, we're ready to announce our favorites. We found love in makeup products that made us glow as bright as the North Star, creams that quenched the driest skin, and skin brighteners that faked a wide-awake look faster than a cup of coffee. Ahead, check out some of the best new February beauty launches, including picks in the hair, skin, body, makeup, and nail categories.",

    "description": "Image Source: Getty / Gilbert Flores Kevin Mazur Scott Winters AnthiaCumming Yuriy_K and Illustration by Aly Lim Before Taylor Swift became the NFL WAGs poster child - signature red lip, custom bomber jacket, and all - there have, of course, been other sports wives and partners. Behind many of them on the Kansas City Chiefs (plus 14 other NFL teams) is makeup artist Allison Kaye. After getting her start in the beauty industry a decade ago, Kaye's entry to the WAGs world came by way of the 2021 NFL Draft. In April of that year, she was presented with the opportunity to do the glam for Sophie Scott, who is Mac Jones (the now quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars)'s girlfriend. From that night on, word of mouth did its magic. Other WAGs started following her on Instagram, and soon thereafter, the bookings for game day came pouring in. \"I thought doing makeup for the NFL draft was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it turned into something much bigger,\" she tells PS. \"My favorite part is that now teams will fly me out to do their makeup for Sunday game days.\" Here's exactly what a day in the life of a WAGS makeup artist is like. Getting Ready For Game Day First, it's worth noting that Kaye is hired by the WAGS themselves - not the NFL. Because of that, \"my schedule is random.\" Kaye splits her time between Cleveland and Miami, so during football season she'll often glam up the WAGS of the Browns and Dolphins teams in each respective city. That means she also has to fly out to wherever another team is playing, which is paid for by her WAGS clients. \"Last year I was flown out by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles, and the Jacksonville Jaguars to do glam on location for a home game this season,\" she says. As for the day-of run of show, she'll typically head to either their house or hotel two to three hours before kickoff, working with anywhere from two to eight WAGS per game, depending. \"The girls like to get to the stadium early because they can go on the field and say hi to their husbands and get photos before the game,\" she says, adding that she'll send each client off with their own \"makeup touchup kit\" to reapply as needed. While she has done some light-touch makeup for the athletes themselves - mostly a little foundation, concealer, and eyebrow grooming - for photoshoots, game day makeup is mostly for the WAGS. Image Source: Courtesy Allison Kaye Her Game Day Makeup Picks The makeup looks vary depending on the WAGs' preferences, but typically her clients opt for a \"neutral soft glam,\" she says, which usually entails a medium to full-coverage foundation, blush, bronzer, neutral or pink lip color, and neutral eyeshadow. More importantly, however, is that the makeup stay put all day. To help, she leans on the Temptu Airbrush Foundation ($52) \"because it is waterproof and sweat-proof.\" Then, she reaches for neutral shadows like the 12 shades in the Makeup by Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette ($50) and Dibs Beauty Duo blushes, both the powder Duet ($34) and the cream Desert Island ($36). For lips, Kaye swears by Charlotte Tilbury's lip products \"because they are long wear and blend nicely on the face.\" (We personally recommend the brand's Lip Cheat Lip Liner ($25) for the same reason.) If you're after a Swift-approved lip pick, we recommend her tried-and-true Pat McGrath Labs LiquiLust Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34) in the shade Elson 4. \"A lot of teams aren't able to wear a classic red lip due to the teams colors but I do know a few of the Chiefs girls love to wear red lipstick because for them, it matches,\" she says. Her Super Bowl Beauty Prep Like years past, in which she glammed six wives of Kansas City Chiefs players, Kaye was busy with her makeup brush ahead of the 2025 Super Bowl - no, not on Swift (who has her own glam team, as you would imagine a globally renowned pop star might) - but for WAGs from both the Chiefs and Eagles teams. \"When curating game day looks I always ask for [inspiration] photos and for them to tell me what they are wearing,\" she says. \"A majority of the clients that hire me tell me that they trust me and to glam them with what would be my signature glam, a neutral soft glam.\" Whether you're a major football fan and watched for the game itself or you just tuned in for fear of missing out, you've gotta admit: it was a night to remember.
