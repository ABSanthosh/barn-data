If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. As much as we love curating the perfect Halloween costume, an argument can be made that it’s not the outfit, but rather the hair, nails, and makeup that truly complete any spooky transformation. The Bride of Frankenstein would be nothing without her towering updo, just as skeletons don’t have the same creepy effect without bone-white pallor and toothy grin. (And that’s not even including the world of special FX makeup, which takes things to a whole other level.) And every year without fail, beauty brands celebrate spooky season with limited-edition collections and collabs with iconic Halloween movies past and present. This year, two of the season’s most buzzed-about films — Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and Wicked, — are popular picks, with several beauty brands creating products inspired by the respective films. Below, we take a closer look at the best Halloween-themed beauty products to get your hands on, stat. (Costume optional.) DashDividers_1_500x100 NYX Cosmetics x Beetlejuice Beetlejuice An eyeshadow palette for the recently deceased and sandworm-inspired lip gloss are ]two of the spooky yet sweet items you’ll find in NYX’s recent collection inspired by Tim Burton’s highly-anticipated Beetlejuice sequel. Elsewhere, you can try cooling undereye patches covered in Beetlejuice’s signature psychedelic monochrome stripe pattern to leave your eyes looking bright and certifiably un-dead. ColourPop x Stranger Things Collection You don’t need to venture into the treacherous depths of the Upside Down to channel spooky makeup vibes this Halloween. From Eleven-approved, waffle-flavored lip masks to an inky cream brush that morphs into a custom pink shade based on your skin’s pH, Colourpop’s new collab is certainly strange — and in the best way.  One/Size X Wicked Olive x June Halloween nail art is, yes, very cute — but for a full set, it won’t come cheap. Here’s where Olive \u0026 June’s salon-quality press on nails come in. Whether you want spiderweb French tip, blood-red chrome, dainty Jack-o-Lanterns, or something else entirely, the brand has you covered with its delightfully spooky designs. Patrick Starrr knows a thing or two about using makeup as a vehicle for self-expression and transformation, so it’s no surprise that Wicked tapped the brand for a collab. Our must-have from the collection? This wonderfully witchy brush inspired by Elphaba’s preferred mode of transportation. OPI x Wicked Craving some fall mani inspo? Look no further than OPI’s collab with Wicked, which offers something for every witch this holiday season: Metallic berry, shimmering forest green, twinkling onyx, and more. Splat x Beetlejuice Beetlejuice As much as we love experimenting with fantasy hair colors, there’s nothing scarier than fried, damaged strands. Splat’s new assortment of temporary hair makeup allows you to try vibrant colors that gleam under UV light — like Beetlejuice’s office, perhaps? Wet n Wild x Disney Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas Even 31 years (!)  after The Nightmare Before Christmas’s debut, Jack Skellington and his creepy pals continue to inspire Halloween collections — most recently, with beloved drugstore makeup brand Wet n Wild. Each product channels a character from Tim Burton’s iconic animated flick. Don’t miss your chance to try Sally’s tricolor blush and highlighter compact or a shimmery white liquid eyeliner named after Jack’s ghostly pup, Zero. Like what you see?

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October. To find out all the latest beauty products and fashion collections catching our attention, click through the slideshow ahead…All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Ganni x Barbour Ganni and Barbour are back with their third collaboration in as many years. The collection is made up of nine pieces that reimagine the British heritage brand’s classic outerwear with Scandi twists — think: leopard-print waxed jackets with oversized corduroy collars, patchwork barn jackets, and belted trench coats. “This collection is all about celebrating friendship, our mutual shared community, and the beautiful blend of our two worlds,” Ganni creative director Ditte Reffstrup said, in a press release. Ganni x Barbour 3.0 will be available to shop online on October 30, with prices ranging from $130 to $645.Shop on October 30 at GanniReformation Drops First-Ever Jewelry Collection with Clare Waight KellerFor the first time ever, Reformation dropped a line of jewelry — and to do so, it partnered with former Givenchy head/current Uniqlo creative director Clare Waight Keller. The launch includes a selection of 1920s-Paris-inspired earrings, bracelets, and necklaces designed to feel both contemporary and heirloom-worthy, made with materials like recycled 24-karat gold vermeil and semi-precious stones. The Clare Waight Keller for Reformation jewelry collection is available to shop now, with prices ranging from $168 to $898.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Clare Waight Keller Gertrude Cuff, $, available at ReformationReformation x Clare Waight Keller Bechet Earring, $, available at ReformationEverlane’s Western Collection The Western trend is staying strong going into the last couple of months of 2024. The proof? Everlane’s Going Western collection, which aims to elevate the saloon look via a range of denim (including a ranch jacket, culottes, and a midi skirt), barrel pants, riding boots, and more that would fit right in at a ranch (or a “Cowboy Carter” listening party).Shop now at EverlaneEverlane The Midi Quilted Liner, $, available at EverlaneEverlane The Denim Culotte, $, available at EverlaneEverlane The Outlaw Boot, $, available at EverlaneJennifer Fisher Chavez Collection For the latest jewelry launch under her eponymous brand, Jennifer Fisher looked to celebrity stylist/personal friend Nicole Chavez (who has worked with stars like Kristen Bell and Rachel Bilson) for inspiration. The six-piece line evokes Chavez’s effortless style with two-tone jewelry (a first for the brand), including rounded rings, earrings, huggies, and an ear cuff. Shop now at Jennifer FisherJennifer Fisher Chavez Huggies, $, available at Jennifer FisherFilson x Birkenstock 1774 Filson and Birkenstock 1774 are celebrating their lasting legacies in a new collaboration that blends the American heritage brand’s rugged and rustic aesthetic with the German footwear label’s comfort-focused silhouettes. There are three styles: the Lahti, a soft, collapsible boot made in part with wool; the Skykomish, a utilitarian boot with oiled-cloth, leather, and rubber components; and the London Moccasin, a suede and leather slip-on adorned with a buckle. Prices range from $375 to $625.

Now, the luxury brand is aiming to capture that sense of history and timelessness in the Le Damier de Louis Vuitton fine jewelry collection, which boasts grids of alternating polished and diamond squares wrapped around rings, tennis bracelets, and earrings. All in all, there are 12 elegant pieces available in yellow and white gold.Shop now at Louis VuittonLouis Vuitton Le Damier de Louis Vuitton Small Ring, Yellow Gold and, $, available at Louis VuittonLouis Vuitton Le Damier de Louis Vuitton Small Bracelet, $, available at Louis VuittonGlossier You Rêve and You DouxThe original Glossier You eau de parfum became a viral sensation for smelling completely different on everyone. Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity. Catch us looking cozy (and tall) in this collection throughout fall.Shop now at UGGUgg New Heights Platform Xtra, $, available at UggBebe x CiaraDespite being a nostalgic brand for many, Bebe continues to be discovered by new generations: The label is currently all over TikTok thanks to its diamanté Y2K spaghetti tops and fitted hoodies. It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn. Luckily, dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross has expanded the DermInfusions line just in time for the mercury to drop, launching a new Blur and Repair Cream that delivers serious hydration. Containing rich shea butter and skin barrier-boosting ceramides, the cream aims to improve elasticity while hydrating hyaluronic acid and skin-strengthening peptides draw in moisture, leaving a plump and glowing base for makeup application. The formula is non-comedogenic, too, so it’s less likely to cause breakouts.Shop now at SephoraDr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions™ Blur + Repair Cream, $, available at SephoraDaily Paper x ConverseDaily Paper, which started out in Amsterdam in 2012, celebrates African culture through its luxurious pieces boasting monogram prints. This October, the label is collaborating with footwear giant Converse on a range of unisex sneakers and clothing, the most eye-catching of which has to be the playful Chuck 70s featuring black logo embroidery, contrast multicolored stitching, and interchangeable laces available in red, yellow, and green. Those searching for something more stealthy might enjoy the Chuck 70 De Luxe Squared, with its all-black snub-toe silhouette and brightly colored bottoms; those wanting something more snuggly should check out the logo fleece hoodie and sweatpants.

The 16-piece collection experiments with tailoring and layering through fall-ready pieces like quilted jackets, skirts over pants, sweaters with armholes, and a combo bustier/button-front top. Gu x Rokh will be available to shop on October 18, with prices ranging from $29.90 to $99.90.Shop on October 18 at GUGu x Rokh Striped Sailor Collar Sweater, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Hoodie Scarf, $, available at GUGu x Rokh 2 Piece Skirt And Pants Set Checked, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Mary Jane Shoes, $, available at GUStarface Hydro-Star Recovery PatchThe main benefit of a pimple patch is to gently draw out gunk; generally speaking, they do very little to reduce the angry redness that often accompanies an acne breakout. That’s where Starface’s new recovery patches enter the picture. While the brand’s famous yellow stars aim to shrink spots, the new purple patches are designed to soothe inflammation after an (ill-advised) picking sesh. Containing soothing aloe vera and vitamin A to promote cell turnover, the recovery stars are all about bringing down redness fast. With the addition of licorice root to help with scarring, these patches put in the work to heal skin and get rid of the evidence.Shop now at StarfaceStarface hydro-star® recovery, $, available at StarfacePleasing x Disney Fantasia Revel in the nostalgic magic of the 1940s animated classic Fantasia with Pleasing’s latest collaboration. The Harry Styles-backed brand has partnered with Disney on a line of apparel, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Find three nail polish sets (each of which borrows cues from different segments of the movie), a new edition of the Big Lip HA Moisture Balm, hoodies, tote bags, and more. “When visiting the Disney archives, we had the opportunity to look through lots of archived and special illustrations which was very exciting — especially as a child who went to the Disney parks — getting a peek behind the curtains of how these beautiful movies and moments are made felt truly inspiring,” Pleasing creative director Harry Lambert said, in a press release. “From very early on, Fantasia was always in the front of our minds at Pleasing; the aesthetics, the mood, the bold illustrations, the colors, and, ultimately, the epic world that Disney has created, were very much a world that resonated with Pleasing.” Prices range from $25 to $289.Shop now at PleasingPleasing x Disney Fantasia L’Apprenti Sorcier Tote in Blue, $, available at PleasingREFY Plum Lip CollectionThe onset of autumn might have some people thinking of sunset-colored trees, cinnamon drinks, and baked pumpkin goods; for us, it’s all about the arrival of vampy makeup. A wine-stained lip is arguably the most sophisticated makeup trend for this time of year and REFY is joining the party with a brand-new, plum-hued lip combo. Comprising a dome-shaped Blur Liner and tinted lip gloss, the kit lends a plummy ombre effect that can be diffused by day and built up for a statement look come cocktail hour. Shop now at REFYREFY Plum Lip Collection, $, available at REFYCharlotte Simone Winter DropBritish designer Charlotte Simone has been known for her It-girl coats for quite some time. Taking inspiration from 1970s silhouettes, her Penny Lane-style jackets with flamboyant fluffy collars and larger-than-life shearling cuffs have been seen on everyone from Dua Lipa to Charli XCX to Florence Pugh. This autumn, the label is offering a sleeveless faux-suede vest, leather bomber and leopard-print Mongolian lambswool coat. If you aren’t ready to go full Almost Famous, the latest drop also includes some shaggy ombre scarves to liven up just about any layer.Shop now at Charlotte SimoneCharlotte Simone Naomi, $, available at Charlotte SimoneLike what you see?

    "description": "Dreadlocks - preferentially known as \"locs\" - are a popular hairstyle that includes sections of hair that have been matted and knotted together to create a rope-like appearance. Locs hairstyles have been around for what feels like forever (historians have dated its origins back as far as 2500 BC, according to Ebony), but whether you've officially decided to try it out for yourself or it's still something you're looking into, there's a lot you should know about the process and maintaining the look before you get started. If you're interested in trying a new natural hairstyle like locs but unsure of where to start, read ahead for a quick and easy-to-follow breakdown of everything you need to know. Experts Featured in This Article Gabriele Benjamin is a loctician based in New York City. Dreads vs. Locs Locs hairstyles feature ropes of hair also known as Jata (in the Sanskrit language), dreads, and locs. Though all the names are accurate, the most popular and preferred name of them all is \"locs,\" due to the negative connotation of the word \"dread.\" The origin of the term \"dreadlocks\" is believed to be associated with the slave trade, a period in time when enslaved people didn't have the time or resources to properly groom their hair. As a result, enslavers often referred to this hairstyle as \"dreadful\" and enslaved people who wore this look were criticized for it, ultimately making the term a reminder of a traumatic history for African American communities all around the world.

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what Dolly Parton's natural hair color is? Parton may have spent the last five glorious decades in the spotlight, but several aspects of the country singer-songwriter's life are still somewhat shrouded in mystery. Her tattoos (which say perpetually hidden), for instance, have long been the subject of one of the biggest pop culture conspiracies. Her larger-than-life wig collection, for two, is another staple in Parton's beauty routine, and it has covered the superstar's real hair for the majority of her public life. If you can't picture her without her signature platinum-blond hair color, you wouldn't be alone. Therein lies the mystery of Parton's real hair. Despite what many might believe, Parton is in fact a natural blond, although her real hair color is closer to a sandy shade. On Oct. 24, Britney Spears dropped her highly anticipated memoir, \"The Woman in Me,\" which playfully featured an iconic quote from Parton: \"I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb. And I also know that I'm not blond.\" In a similar fashion, Parton gave fans a rare peak at her natural hair in her own 2020 memoir, \"Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics.\" Throughout her book, Parton included a bunch of throwback pictures from throughout her life, a few of which showed her with sandy-blond hair. She also shared a black-and-white picture on her Instagram showing the singer in a recording booth with her natural color. Though it's hard to pinpoint the actual hair hue, you can see it swept loosely in a side parting, with her blond ends distinctly highlighted in the monochrome photograph.

I started buying peroxide as soon as I could afford it! I just am a blonde. That's just my nature. It's me.\" Parton also touched on this subject in her 2012 chat with Interview Magazine: \"I'd already bleached my hair and got in big trouble. I have blond hair, but it just wasn't radiant, it's sandy blond. It wasn't yellow and white and bright.\" She's also previously opened up about what sparked her fondness for wigs. \"I always wore my hair all teased up,\" she wrote in her 2020 book. \"Whenever that style started, I was the first to get my hair all poofy. Then, as soon as I could buy those hairpieces and wigs, I wanted them. For one thing, they were so handy. Plus, my hair would never do exactly what I wanted it to do. So the wigs became kind of my trademark.\" In another 2021 interview with Vogue, Parton shared that she initially switched to her now-iconic wigs as a preventative measure to avoid hair breakage due to over-styling. \"I started wearing wigs because I quickly realized that bleaching and teasing my hair every day would cause breakage and not look good,\" she said. There was, of course, another upside: saying goodbye to the ever-imminent bad hair days. \"It was handy to have several looks that I could just choose from and never have a bad hair day.\" So, there you have it. Parton is a natural blond, even though she doesn't always prefer wearing her hair au naturel and often opts for platinum wigs. We love a relatable queen.
