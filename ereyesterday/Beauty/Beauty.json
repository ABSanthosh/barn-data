Available in two shades — peachy Watermelon Flush and warmer Berry Flush — the formula is also buildable, so you can opt for a dewy and sheer look or a more pigmented finish. Shop now at Glow RecipeGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush, $, available at SephoraJ.Crew’s Spring Catalog After relaunching it last year, J.Crew is back with the latest edition of its beloved catalog.

The line’s first drop features playful takes on GU’s wardrobe staples — think relaxed trousers and blazers and T-shirts with signature Undercover motifs illustrated by Takahashi, like the “Noise Burger” character. GU x Undercover collection is available now, with prices ranging from $5.99 to $69.99; a second drop is expected next month. Shop now at GUGU x Undercover Broadcloth Shirt, $, available at GUGU x Undercover Deck Shoes, $, available at GUK18 AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray Fed up with using multiple products in your hair care routine?

Now the minimalist brand is expanding the collection with the Paloma Tote. The new bag is inspired by the silhouette of the OG, and is made with the same Italian double-faced leather that softens as it ages — but now comes with more room, plus extra exterior and interior zip pockets. Shop now at Cuyana Cuyana Paloma Tote, $, available at CuyanaZara x Style Not Com When Beka Gvishiani, founder of the mega-popular fashion Instagram account Style Not Com, was approached by Zara, he started the conversation by saying: “Let’s talk about fashion.” That phrase is now at the heart of the resulting Zara x Style Not Com collection, which takes the account’s signature cobalt blue hue and bold white text and splashes them across a variety of apparel. Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraPrada Beauty Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara How do you launch a new product in a way that will make a splash?

    "title": "It’s Time To Restore Professionalism In The Black Hair Salon Experience",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-hair-stylists-unprofessional-experience?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As Black women, we take great pride in our hair and will go to great lengths to make sure we achieve the perfect style — no matter the time or effort it involves. And honestly, we will pay whatever the cost. So it’s not surprising that the global Black haircare market is expected to reach $4.9 billion by 2033, up from $3.2 billion in 2023.  With so much time, money, and energy invested in our hair, finally securing an appointment with the right stylist should feel like a win. And at first, it does. But what happens when that excitement falls short of expectations? What once was a cultural safe haven for women, a place for community and a sanctuary to literally and figuratively let your hair down has become a source of frustration or, worst case scenario, a complete nightmare due to an increase in unprofessional hairstylists. Let’s take a collective deep sigh because we need to talk about it. I know it’s not just me because I have these conversations every other week — at brunch, in coffee shops, or in the group chat about the latest saga of lack of professionalism in Black hair salons. From booking to the final styling, the complete disregard for basic business practices shows up at every step of the process. It wasn’t always like this. So what happened? Now, I pride myself on being a law-abiding Black-hair client. I take the time to read all the terms and conditions before booking an appointment. Through my experiences, I’ve become well-versed in what has seemingly become the industry standard. The average late fee is between $15 and $30 if you arrive up to 15 minutes late to the appointment. Many stylists will understandably require you to reschedule the appointment for anything beyond that, and you will forfeit the security deposit. But professionalism is a two-way street. If there’s a financial penalty for me as a client, there should be one for the stylist. For me, one of the first signs of an unprofessional stylist is the lack of a policy on how they handle running behind schedule. It does not sit right with me that I am required to be on time to avoid a late fee, yet many stylists don’t offer any type of discount on my service when they’re running late. Our hair is more than just aesthetics, it’s a symbol of our individuality, a form of personal self-expression that deserves to be handled with care. Some unprofessional stylists cancel appointments at an unreasonable time. I understand that life happens and things come up. However, if clients are a no-call, no-show, or cancel less than 24 hours before the appointment, stylists will charge at least 50% of the service booked (in addition to the forfeited deposit) with the credit card on file. Yet, there was no one for me to charge for the inconvenience when a Houston stylist canceled my 7:00 a.m. sew-in appointment around 8:43 p.m. the night before. She texted that she did not have the hair I requested but suggested I could still get serviced with my own extensions, with different hair she had available, or I could choose a different service. The stylist not having the hair wasn’t the problem — it’s the fact that the service and hair were available to book in the first place. If she had alerted me earlier in the day, I could have found hair extensions in Houston and, while annoyed, still made the appointment. Why shouldn’t I demand that my service be 50% off when using her rules? This particular stylist has permanently lost me as a customer. I continue to warn my inner circle to avoid her services because God forbid she cancels on my family or friends before their first day of work like she did me. The unprofessionalism plaguing the hair industry is bigger than deposits, cancellations or no-show fees. My sister, who has locs down to her waist, stopped going to her loctician because she frequently took breaks to gossip on the phone in another room.   A growing number of stylists — mainly braiders— now expect clients to arrive with their hair already washed and blow-dried. And if your hair is longer than shoulder length or considered thick, extra charges will likely be added for certain styles, from braids to silk presses. DeAnna Maxwell, who considers herself an “old-school” stylist and founder of Unto Him Hair Salon and Spa in Akron, Ohio, says, “I always teach consumers, whether my client or somebody else’s, to interview your hairdresser the same way you would ask questions to a company during a job interview.” She added, “Find out about the hairstylist policies and processes. They should not service you if you feel uncomfortable.” This reinforces a valid point that client-stylist relationships should be built on mutual trust, respect and understanding. Undeniably, stylists face financial challenges from unreliable clients, leading to many having opted to set up terms, conditions and deposits. As hairstylist and TikTok user hairstylistbusinesscoach states, “I run a business and not a charity. When you book a time slot, that’s a time slot that we couldn’t give somebody else. Y’all gotta realize this is how we take care of our families. This is how we pay our bills.” This highlights the business realities driving these policies. It’s also clear that some hairstylists have probably reached their breaking points with foul clients. Although these are justifiable frustrations it shouldn’t lead or translate into unprofessional conduct across the board.   As a community and for our culture, it’s time to get back to a place where getting our hair done is a positive experience, not a hassle. According to fashion and costume historian Shelby Ivey Christie, one significant reason for unprofessional hairstylists is the lack of experience. “A salon suite does not make a professional stylist,” she said on X, in response to the viral incident involving Jayla Cunningham, a Maryland stylist facing second-degree assault charges for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old and cutting out her extensions over a payment dispute. Cunningham told local reporters the teen she serviced tried running out of the appointment without paying. However, the teen’s mother says she sent the money to the wrong Cash App user. “Professional is not describing your ability to take payments. Professional is actually alluding to your level of mastery in your skilled work and your years of experience,” Christie continued. Further reiterating that the situation could have been de-escalated with greater experience and professionalism. Maxwell, who has been an entrepreneur for nearly three decades, reinforces this, stressing the importance of mentorship for younger hairstylists beginning their careers in the industry. “Many new hairstylists come out of school with false hope and think that hair school teaches you everything you need to know, but hair school only teaches you how to pass state boards,” she says. “Mentorship will teach professionalism and allow new stylists to retain clientele to thrive in this business.” As more clients continue to speak out in hopes to hold stylists accountable, I hope this moment ignites a reckoning between hairstylists and clients. I hope we can find common ground, where we respect each other’s time, uphold professionalism and reclaim the joy in our haircare experiences.  Otherwise, at least for me, the alternative is investing in a one-on-one class and learning some of these skills myself. Since many of us are already required to come with our hair washed, blow-dried, and stretched out, we’re halfway there in the styling process. Imagine how much money and frustration we could save by bypassing the stylists who show little to no regard for professionalism or our hard-earned coins. At the same time, we can’t ignore the rich legacy we all stand on. The rise of Black women entrepreneurs today is built on the foundation of pioneering women like Madam C.J. Walker, who transformed the haircare industry through mastery, innovation, and service. Both stylists and clients are descendants of this legacy, one shaped by women who took great honor in their craft and reputation. Our hair is more than just aesthetics, it’s a symbol of our individuality, a form of personal self-expression that deserves to be handled with care. When we have a lackluster experience, it doesn’t just waste our time and money. It diminishes the artistry and cultural significance of our crown. As a community and for our culture, it’s time to get back to a place where getting our hair done is a positive experience, not a hassle. A space of community, self-care, comfort and excellence—where professionalism isn’t optional but expected. Like what you see?

    "description": "While I write about makeup nearly every day, I'm still a beginner. I can confidently say that I've mastered my base, which consists of my trusted foundation and concealer. Being that I've gotten so used to this combination, I've never thought of switching out my beloved foundations for another product - until now. In all my years of wearing makeup, I've always used foundation. But on warm days, the staple doesn't always prove to be the best option - especially since I have normal to oily skin. Sure, I've tried sweat-proof foundations and some of the best setting powders on the market, but the formula would still feel heavy after a few hours. Fortunately, I've found the perfect base product to help me solve this problem without compromising on coverage: Milk Makeup's Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint ($36). As someone with sensitive skin, I often return to the phrase \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" when it comes to my routine. In other words, once I find a product that works well for me, I'm sticking with it. While every beauty aficionado I knew was going wild for skin tints, I stuck with my foundation. Yet, Milk's managed to win me over with its coverage, thanks to its impressive formula and second-skin feel. Keep reading my full review of the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint, and find out why it's well worth the TikTok hype. About the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint It's packed with skin-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide that improve skin texture and boost hydration. You can get up to 12 hours of wear without experiencing any fading, caking, or settling into fine lines. It comes in 15 shades from neutral to cool undertones. The gel formula is safe for acne-prone and sensitive skin. What I Like About the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint Immediately, I fell in love with the Hydro Grip tint's texture. Admittedly, I went a little heavy with the application initially, but after using the brand's blending brush, the tint instantly absorbed into my skin - similar to how water saturates a sponge. I also loved how it didn't crease over time, so I didn't have to go back in with a setting powder to eliminate any lines. You'd truly have to try it to understand. How to Use the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint The Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint comes in a handy tube that you can easily squeeze onto the back of your hand for application. After applying a few dabs on the desired parts of your face, you can blend it with your fingers, a beauty sponge, or a blending brush if you want that extra seamless finish. Take the dewy look a step further with the Hydro Grip Set + Refresh Spray ($38). What to Consider Before Trying the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint This product is a tint, so if you're looking for more coverage, you can pair it with your concealer to get rid of any unwanted blemishes. Also, its texture is pretty dewy, so be sure to pair it with a trusted setting powder or spray. Where Is the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint Available? You can purchase the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint on the brand's website, Sephora, and Kohl's.
