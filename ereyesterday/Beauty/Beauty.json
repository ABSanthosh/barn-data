    "description": "Sephora’s Spring Savings Event ends tonight, and if you haven’t gotten a chance to stock up (or even if you have, and you’re coming back for more), now’s your last chance. If you’re not familiar with the ins and outs, here’s the lowdown: Depending on your Beauty Insider tier, you can score up to 20% off every purchase during the sale period. It’s the perfect chance to snag those pricey, rarely discounted products or try something new without paying full price. The sale is now open to all Beauty Insider tiers, meaning VIBs and Insiders can get 15% off and 10% off, respectively, until the sale ends. (Rouge members got first dibs on April 4 with a generous 20% off.) Plus, the retailer’s in-house label is getting some extra love with 30% off all Sephora Collection products, no matter your tier. Just use promo code SAVEMORE at checkout. Maybe the biggest note of all: There are no brand exclusions during this year’s sale, so gird your loins, prep your wishlists, and be prepared to go wild with your haul before the sale wraps on April 14. Since Sephora can sometimes feel like a dazzling maze of beauty treasures, we asked our savvy R29 editors to share the must-buys they’re adding to their carts during the event. Keep scrolling to shop them all. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Multi-Styler, $349 “Ever since I first reviewed the Shark FlexFusion, it’s been my ultimate hair tool obsession. It’s astonishingly user-friendly, delivers salon-quality blowouts, and dries hair in single-digit minutes. The brush attachment boosts natural bounce and volume, while the curling barrels effortlessly create soft waves (I sometimes brush through to loosen the curl a bit). There’s no better time to invest in one with a 10% discount that saves you over $30 is on the table.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Glossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $78 “Glossier didn’t hold back with its expansion of the You cinematic universe, and I’m endlessly grateful for that bold move. This warm, woody scent has skyrocketed to the front of my fragrance collection, and I even have it in rollerball form to refresh during the day. It has subtle floral notes of violet, with sultry palo santo and ambrox (the hero ingredient in every You scent). Glossier rarely does discounts, so this Sephora sale is a rare, sneaky chance to knock a few bucks off.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Fara Homidi Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil, $36 “I’m not typically a lipstick or gloss girl, but I’m always on the hunt for the perfect everyday lip pencil to pair with a basic balm. Fara Homidi’s Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil in minky nails that natural pinky-brown nude that’s balanced and never too warm. The formula is soft, blendable, and comes in packaging that feels utterly luxe.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Ilia Limitless Lash Lengthening Clean Mascara, $29 “ILIA’s mascara has always been a favorite of mine because it delivers a natural look without irritating my sensitive eyes. Now, with a newly-released brown shade in the mix, I’m using the Sephora sale as the perfect excuse to add it to cart.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm, $24 “Every purse of mine is a graveyard for balms and glosses I’ve loved, used, and, sadly, forgotten about — except one. Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm — it’s  the only product I’ve finished down to the last drop, and I keep coming back for more. I love the Iced Coffee and Hot Cocoa shades, both of which lend a wash of juicy nude that’s perfect for everyday wear. Cherry is the next hue on my list. It’s giving juicy, just-bitten glossy lips while nourishing with shea and murumuru seed butter — unbeatable!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush, $27 “Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush brings a radiant, backlit glow to my complexion (it’s so convincingly natural, people always ask what’s my secret). It blends seamlessly (unlike most powders) and doesn’t budge until I’m ready to call it a day. I’m so smitten that I even gifted various shades to my mum and grandma. The airbrushed finish serves major smooth and plump. Plus, I love using a touch on my eyelids for a subtle, effortless glint.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Amika Reset Cleansing Oil, $30 “I’ve tried my fair share of clarifying hair products, but Amika’s Reset Range remains the gold standard for me. I started using this cleansing oil in college as a pre-shampoo treatment, and it still works wonders for banishing buildup and that greasy scalp feeling. The charcoal-infused formula transforms into oil and foams up beautifully. I go through it fast, so I’ve got my calendar marked for a discounted restock.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Milk Makeup Hydro Grip + Glow Illuminating Primer, $30 “I’m already an OG Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer stan — it locks in makeup all day, hydrates without greasiness, and creates a flawless base (sans pilling). For summer, I’m excited to give the Illuminating Grip + Glow Primer a go, which promises to prime, prep, and give my skin that lit-from-within glow.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $24 “I swear by this lip sleeping mask! I keep two pots close by my side— one as the final step of my nighttime routine (waking up to baby-soft lips), and one on my desk for an on-the-go boost of softness and sticky-free shine. The Sephora Spring Sale is the time to stock up.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Chunks Medium Box Hair Claw Clip in Olive Check, $22 “If you’re hunting for a hair claw that won’t snap after a few uses, look no further — Chunks clips are elite. The AAPI-founded brand cracked the indestructible code with its FSC-certified cellulose acetate, a plant-based bio-plastic. I’m almost always rocking an updo, and these never hurt my head – this olive checkerboard print is calling my name for spring.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Ultra Violette Supreme Screen SPF Facial Sunscreen, $36 “Our beauty editors introduced me to this Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette, and I’ve been eager to test the Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer for my daily SPF protection. With sun season fast approaching, I’m thrilled to add this non-greasy, no-pilling formula to my daily routine.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Merit Signature Lip Sheer Lip Liner, $24 “Lip liners are the moment, and I’m loving MERIT’s latest fleet of buttery-smooth, beginner-friendly blurring liners. They add just the right dimension without looking overdone. I’ve been defaulting to Brownstone to match my coffee-hued lip gloss for a ‘90s-inspired look, but I’m excited to get my hands on Coupé —  a soft pink that’s quite difficult to find in a shade.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ghost-layers-waves-haircut-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Since growing out my bob, I found myself in a hair rut. Once sharp and purposeful, my lengths had begun to fall lifelessly around my shoulders — and not even my failsafe claw clip could work its usual magic. So when I met Queer Eye superstar and JVN Hair founder Jonathan Van Ness at the recent launch of his Repair range, I have to admit that I was a little embarrassed (especially when I realized he’d be the one blow-drying my hair). My split ends made it obvious I was long overdue for a trim, but before I could even apologize for the state of my hair, his scissors were already glinting in his hand. You see, few people could convince me to say yes to an impromptu haircut, but Van Ness is one of them. A firm non-negotiable? I didn’t want him to cut too much length off.  Much to the envy of my beauty editor peers, Van Ness spent nearly an hour snipping and perfecting. When I looked at the floor, there was a heap of hair, but when I glanced in the mirror, it looked like I’d just had a refresh; my lengths felt lighter and swishier and had a lot more shape. That’s when I realized that Van Ness had unwittingly given me the smartest haircut of the moment.  Enter: ghost layers. What are ghost layers? LA-based hairstylist Ramòn Garcia is the mastermind behind ghost layers, essentially “invisible” layers that add shape and movement but blend seamlessly into the rest of the lengths. Although the cut is not new, it’s seen a resurgence lately, likely thanks to the rise of ghost waves — the 2025 iteration. Ghost waves were coined by hairstylist Tom Smith, who has earned the moniker “hairvoyant” for his ability to predict season-defining haircut trends — and this one is sure to take over spring. The look is named after its subtle, barely-there waves, which Smith describes as softly undulating in an ‘s’ shape. Undetectable layers further enhance the waves, creating extra dimension.  I didn’t even need to tell Van Ness what I wanted; he instinctively knew how to cut the style. After washing my hair with JVN Revive Repairing Shampoo, $24, and Revive Repairing Conditioner, $24, Van Ness added a generous pump of Revive Rapid Repair Bond Gloss, $36, from root to tip and got started by carefully dusting away my split ends. Then he added a handful of invisible layers through my mid-lengths and ends. The key, he said, was not cutting them too short. Mine end about an inch — or in some spots, two — from the longest pieces, so even when my hair is pin straight, they camouflage into the rest of the length.  To prevent my hair from drying in a triangular shape, Van Ness used thinning scissors to reduce bulk, making it easier to style and air-dry. He finished the look by cutting in long, graduated curtain bangs to add a little more dimension.  How do you style ghost layers with waves? Ghost layers with waves are an unexpectedly relaxed style for spring, says Smith, and while the cut can be coiffed with a curling wand or shaped using a blowdry brush, accidentally perfect waves can also be achieved by air-drying if your hair has a natural bend, like digital creators Nicole and Franny below. A cream-based hair product — like JVN Hair Complete Air Dry Cream, $28 — will minimize frizz and impart shine. Also consider trying a mermaid waver — a tong with three barrels, like Amika High Tide Deep Wave Hair Crimper, $120 — to further enhance natural waves. The final step is to use a wide-tooth comb, rather than a brush, to separate the waves for a lived-in feel, suggests Smith.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by nicole (@maybeitswavybaby) I like to style my hair by spritzing Typebea’s S.2 Sea Salt Texture Mist, $26, which offers hold and heat protection up to 210°, into towel-dried lengths before blow-drying using a paddle brush. Then I reach for my trusty ghd Chronos Hair Straightener, $329, to fashion some delicate bends. Twisting the straightener halfway through each pass will create soft, natural-looking waves. Lastly, I pull my fingers through my lengths to break up the waves for a relaxed, effortlessly tousled finish.  Styling is pretty easy, but what I love most about the ghost layers haircut is how it grows out seamlessly. Unlike other layered styles that can eventually create an obvious step-like effect, this one maintains a smooth transition. The compliments I’ve received from others have been a welcome bonus, too. No previous haircut has amassed as much love as this one — people keep commenting on how much fuller and healthier my lengths look. Even better, the invisible layers and feathery curtain bangs add shape to my hair, making it look great without the need for over-styling. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Franny (@frannfyne) How do you ask a hairstylist for ghost layers with waves? If your hairstylist isn’t familiar with ghost layers with waves, simply ask for soft, subtle layers that enhance your natural texture; bangs are optional. For a more polished look, request gentle bends created with a flat iron or a flat curling iron. ghd’s Curve Classic Wave Wand, $209, is a popular tool in many salons.  Getting my hair cut by the legendary Jonathan Van Ness may have been a one-off, but it’s safe to say that I’ll be asking my hairdresser for ghost layers from now on. The undetectable layers and the way they take shape when styled have completely won me over. It’s the ultimate cut for anyone who wants high-impact hair with minimal maintenance.

    "description": "Image Source: Getty/ Chris DELMAS / AFP If you're dying to know what happens between Mook and Gaitok after the season finale of \"The White Lotus,\" we can't exactly help you. . . But if you want to know all of the details on Lalisa Manobal's (aka Lisa) brand-new hair color change, we absolutely have you covered. During night one of Coachella, the Blackpink singer completely changed her look with \"mushroom blond\" hair. According to Lisa's colorist, Jacob Schwartz the \"Fxck Up the World\" singer went from a warm chestnut brown (the same shade she rocked for \"The White Lotus\" premiere) to a soft mink bronde hue. Schwartz used a combo of the Schwarzkopf Professional Igora Vibrance Demi-Permanent Tone on Tone Hair Color ($12) and the Schwarzkopf Professional Igora Vario Blond ($30) to achieve the look. The mushroom-blond hair color trend mixes shades of blond, beige, and light brown for a unique, cool-toned look. The blend of dark and light colors comes together to create a subtler variety of blond sans all of the harsh bleaching that you get with brighter hues. What's really great about this trend is that you can go longer between salon sessions without experiencing the brassiness that so often comes with bright blond colors. Lisa, along with bandmate Jennie, both had solo performances at Coachella bill this year, marking a new era for the band. Lisa was dressed for the occasion from head to toe, as makeup artist Haemin Commune created the perfect matte-grey smoky eye to complement the new hair color, along with subtle glitter eyeliner in the corners of Lisa's eyes. Nail artist Juan Alvear crafted extra sharp claw nails using Aprés Nail products for a sci-fi futuristic look. If Lisa has taught us anything from her beauty choices so far, it's that she's ahead of the curve, so expect to see tons of mushroom-blond shades popping up for the summer of 2025.
