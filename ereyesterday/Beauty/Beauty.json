    "description": "This year served up some incredible beauty trends on a silver platter. They were all so good, we had a hard time selecting the most impactful moments - but here we are. While 2023 was the year of niche aesthetics, 2024 had some overarching themes that were classic but with a twist. Instead of leaning into Barbiecore or quiet luxury this year, we almost saw a \"back to basics approach\" to beauty. Folks favored easy (but effective!) TikTok hacks, updated versions of universally beloved haircuts, and natural, flattering makeup that looks effortless and chic. Unsurprisingly, most of 2024's viral moments also revolved around TikTok. Some users were on a mission to prove you don't need injections to make your lips appear fuller, while others gave the full rundown on finding your most flattering look possible based on contrast. Trends that gained the most traction were extra serviceable and wearable. Dessert-inspired nail colors à la Hailey Bieber also went viral for the same reason, piggybacking off last year's food-inspired nail-art craze. Overall, there's so much to talk about. While it seemed like something new was popping up daily, we identified a few of the biggest beauty trends that defined 2024. Keep reading for the full report. Reflective Hair Colors Every season of 2024 brought us some exciting and vibrant hair hues. Rich and reflective colors trended the most, from summer's wildly popular \"cowboy copper\" shade to fall's \"syrup blond.\" Now that we've fully steeped in the winter season, shades like maroon and the ultra-reflective \"winter gold\" are having a moment, with celebrities like Beyoncé and Kaia Gerber leading the charge. Big Chops Bob haircuts are nothing new. The bob is actually one of the most classic and timeless haircuts around, but this year, we saw a few chic and fresh versions take center stage. From the \"Prada bob\" and \"broom bob\" to the Italian bob and \"cowgirl bob, there's a style out there now that suits every face shape and hair texture. Simpler Styles Instead of heavier foundation and extra bold makeup looks, 2024 favored subtle and natural complexion enhancing techniques. Trends like the demi method and contrast makeup theory took over the internet. In the hair department, 2024 welcomed back pin-straight styles (yes, like the kind you rocked in the early aughts) and unfussy sleek buns after larger-than-life '90s blowouts climbed to the number-one spot of hairstyles in 2023. Sweet Treat-Inspired Looks Last year, we saw an uptick in food-inspired nail art, which continued well into this year. However, as time went on, we noticed a refinement of the trend and an extension past just our fingertips. Sweet treat-inspired nail colors and designs were prominent. As usual, Hailey Bieber paved the way for this trend with her maple syrup and cinnamon-roll nails, but other shades like cherry mocha and chocolate milk were also a huge hit. In the hair and makeup department, jelly-doughnut blush and cherry-cola hair satisfied our sweet tooth. Natural Aesthetics Natural aesthetics were paramount in 2024. Invasive plastic surgery procedures took a backseat to \"tweakments,\" such as ones utilizing stem cell injectable therapy, lasers, and radio frequency microneedling. Even our own editors dabbled in on-the-rise treatments like Sculptra, which helps regenerate your own collagen, and Skinvive to give skin an organic-looking boost. Other noninvasive procedures, like the \"liquid nose job,\" took TikTok by storm because of their ability to create real results without going under the knife. Lip-Focused Treatments TikTok-lead beauty hacks have dominate for years, but 2024's batch of favorites was heavily focused on lips. From a viral hack for subtle \"movie lips\" to a lip combo inspired by Angelina Jolie, picture-perfect pouts were the goal. Even modified takes on traditional lip filler, like \"butterfly lips,\" gained momentum in the beauty community this year. Not to mention, 2024 was the year of the lip oil, with countless brands launching their own spin on the product category.

    "description": "The 2025 Golden Globes will officially kick off award show season on January 5, 2025, so prepare to see some of Hollywood's biggest stars churn out a seemingly never-ending stream of jaw-dropping hair, makeup, and nail moments in the upcoming weeks. If you're like us, you're not only waiting to devour every single detail of your favorite celebrities's looks, but you may also be a little curious about what exactly goes into those mysterious gift bags that are constantly referenced in postshow interviews. Luckily, we got the inside scoop on what is going to be in the 82nd annual show's bag, and let's just say each attendee is about to have a beauty routine fit for royalty. While not every attendee will receive each item, the total cost of everything included is valued at well over one million dollars. For starters, each gift bag will come with a one-night stay in a Beverly Hills suite at the L'Ermitage Beverly Hills, valued at over $1,500. Not interested in jetting off to Beverly Hills? No worries, they'll also receive a five-night stay in a Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman Resort, which is valued at $55,000. The bags will also be filled with hundreds of dollars worth of beauty products from prestige brands such as La Prairie and Perfumehead. If that wasn't sweet enough, there are also treatments to win (and they're very, very good). If you still want to know more, keep reading to discover the beauty products in the 2025 Golden Globe Awards gift bag.",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ndeye-peinda-black-community-makeup?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity, and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. In partnership with NYX, our latest subject is beauty content creator and rising social media star Ndeye Peinda. This story was told to Shawna Hudson and edited for length and clarity. My passion for beauty started long before I began creating content online. As a young, dark-skinned Senegalese girl growing up in Harlem, I was captivated by content creators on YouTube and how they would do their hair and makeup — but none of them looked like me. Even so, I couldn’t wait to try everything they were doing. I’d run to the drugstore to buy the same products and follow the same steps. Did I look like an ashy, gray mess at first? Yes, but I didn’t care — I was just excited to find something I loved.  Fast forward a few years to college when I was hit with a revelation: There was a gap. There were no Black makeup content creators — I was taking tips from people who were three or four shades lighter than me. So I thought to myself, Why don’t I see if I can do this? At first, I was scared. This was in 2017 when there was still a lack of inclusivity in the content creation community. Originally, I didn’t even want to be the face of my own content. I tried my hand at being a makeup artist because I wanted to provide the best makeup tips for deeper skin tones. But it was disheartening in the beginning — I wasn’t getting booked enough. So I pivoted and started to share tips using myself as a model. I was afraid of putting myself out there, of mean remarks, of haters. But the responses exceeded all my expectations. I was on a mission to be of service to people who look like me, and I finally started to feel like the content I was making really resonated with people and I was calling back my power. Black women are often left out of the conversation or are an afterthought when it comes to most makeup products. When I first started posting, there weren’t many brands that had inclusive foundation shade ranges, which made it harder to do my job. Now, I have plenty of foundations that I can use, but when it comes to other products like blush, contour, and bronzer, there aren’t as many options that work for my skin tone.  I’ve noticed (even to this day) that few brands go above and beyond for Black beauty consumers. There doesn’t seem to be much excitement around products that cater to Black women. NYX is one exception — the brand’s Butter Gloss in Gingersnap was the first lip gloss I fell in love with. It’s this stunning shade with incredible color payoff, and it just complements Black skin so well. Every time I wear it, I always get compliments. I felt like NYX, which offers these beautiful products that blend artistry with value, was one of the first beauty brands that made me feel seen. The fact that I can find shades in multiple makeup categories that work for me is nothing short of revolutionary.  My content now is all about representing folks who look like me and showing up as my authentic self. This confidence I have stems from within, and when it matches my appearance (especially when my makeup is on point, my hair is done, I’ve spritzed on a fragrance), there’s a completely new energy. I feel like I belong in whatever room I step into. Makeup gives me that freedom to create whatever look I want and feel like my best self.  And that’s important to me as a Black creator in a world where things look uncertain for us right now, from less diversity in the workplace to few Black women at the C-suite level. I see that and it makes me want to champion our community even more. I’m always going to show up for the community that I’ve fostered. It’s time to show brands that we’re still here, we still want to buy their products, and we shouldn’t be forgotten about.  Inclusivity is important because everyone deserves to feel like they belong — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexuality, or identity. We live in a society with these “rules” that are set out for us before we’re born and your value is based on where you “fit” into society. We’re told that only thinness, whiteness, and proximity to whiteness is what beauty is, so every day, I work toward breaking that stereotypical beauty mold. That’s why an inclusive beauty campaign is everything to me — it makes me feel like I fit in, that I belong. People need to know that they’re valued, beautiful, and that they deserve access. If I could speak to my younger self right now, I would tell her that the things you get made fun of are going to be the things that people clap for in the future. Don’t feel bad about yourself — everyone else will catch up. Shop Ndeye’s makeup look: Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sephora-ceo-artemis-patrick-interview?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When I think of my most formative beauty memories, a few things come to mind: Stealing swipes of lipstick from my mom’s bathroom, donating my hair as a teenager (and then three more times after that), and the first time I walked out of a Sephora holding a black-and-white striped shopping bag.  I’ll never forget feeling like the most glamorous, confident version of myself leaving the store. (I still have my first-ever purchase: A long-discontinued shade of Urban Decay’s Deluxe Eyeshadow in a groovy, ’70s-inspired packaging. I haven’t used it anywhere near my eyes in years, but can’t bear to part with it.) As I eventually established a career in beauty media, Sephora always held a special place in my heart. For me, Sephora was where I discovered my favorite products that marked my biggest milestones: The Stila twist-up glosses I gleefully swiped on in middle school, and receiving my first “grown-up” fragrance, Marc Jacobs Daisy.  And even as the beauty retail landscape shifts faster than the refresh of an FYP, Sephora is still among the most coveted doors any brand could enter. The retailer’s highly-anticipated sales never fail to generate buzz (not to mention, get people genuinely excited about a beauty haul), and in a post-pandemic world, it’s a shining example of the appeal of the in-store experience. (At any given time, my local Sephora store is packed full of shoppers of all ages eagerly swatching products and navigating the aisles with hawk-like focus.) DashDividers_1_500x100 We don’t know what beauty will look like in 2025, but we recently got the opportunity to speak to Sephora’s CEO, Artemis Patrick, the next best thing to a crystal ball. The Iranian-born beauty powerhouse has been at Sephora since 2006, leading the charge to innovations like spotlighting indie brands, inclusive foundation shade ranges, and expanding its Clean at Sephora category — including defining exactly what that means to Sephora customers. Ahead, we chatted with Patrick on her career journey, current product crushes, and what trends she’s forecasting next year. Refinery29: I’d love to hear about your beauty origin story. Did you always want to work in the industry? Artemis Patrick: Growing up, I loved seeing how beauty products had the power to transform not only appearances but also confidence. I didn’t set out specifically for a career in beauty, but I was a product of the ’80s and ‘90s beauty culture, and I was drawn to it because of its universal impact and ability to connect people across cultures and backgrounds.  R29: I’m sure every day looks a bit different for you, but if you’re able to share a glimpse into a day as Sephora’s CEO, what would that look like?I travel quite a bit as I try to visit at least one to two markets across the US and Canada every month. It’s incredibly important for me to hear directly from our Beauty Advisors in our stores as they are the front line to what our customers are saying. When I’m home in San Francisco, every day brings new opportunities and challenges, but my mornings always start with a focus on balance. Sleep quality is important to me, so I love checking my Oura Ring to see my sleep stats. After that, I grab my first coffee of the day and check my email. Some mornings, I may have early calls with our Paris team, which can start as early as 7 a.m. Sometimes I might take calls as I walk to work. It’s about a 35-minute walk, which is a great commute.  Once I’m in the office, my workday is varied but, in a way, similar. I spend time with my leadership team, having candid conversations about where we are, where we want to go and how to get there. There is also a mix of creative brainstorming, problem-solving, and decision-making —whether we’re discussing new product launches, refining the customer experience, or tackling challenges that come up.  There are a few treats I keep around throughout the day. Chocolate-covered almonds are my go-to snack, and a Caudalie elixir and Rare Beauty hand cream are on my desk when I need a refreshing scent boost.  When I get home, I spend some time with my husband and daughter, see how their days went, making sure I’m present for those moments. Later in the night, when my daughter typically does her homework, I’ll check emails.  Ultimately, my days are about blending purpose and passion — for my family, for myself and for Sephora.  R29: You’ve been at Sephora for 18 years, which is incredible. What is it about the brand that has kept you coming back for more?AP: Sephora has an incredibly dynamic culture that makes it easy to stay inspired. We’re continually pushing boundaries, whether that’s finding new, diverse brands, creating immersive store experiences, or enhancing our digital offerings. Sephora encourages everyone to bring fresh ideas to the table and never settle, and that’s both exciting and empowering.  R29: How does a brand stand out — or resonate with a community — in today’s beauty landscape?AP: Authenticity and purpose are what truly make a brand resonate. Consumers today are looking for products that are high-performing but also align with their personal values. They want to know the story behind the brand, what it stands for, and how it contributes to positive change—whether that’s in sustainability, inclusivity, or social impact. At Sephora, we’re proud to champion brands that offer more than just great products; in fact, the biggest differentiator for any of our brands is they offer meaningful stories that connect with our customers. The brands that stand out are those that engage deeply with their community, are transparent, and fill a white space in the beauty landscape. R29: As someone with a front-row seat to everything new and innovative in beauty, I’m super curious: What are some brands and products you’ve recently discovered and are loving these days?AP: There’s a wave of innovation in beauty right now, and it’s thrilling to see brands pushing the envelope on performance and creativity. Lately, I’ve been drawn to brands that bring a fresh, bold approach to color and artistry, as well as those that are elevating skincare, fragrance, and hair with innovative formulations. I’m especially excited about the brands that have been part of our Sephora Accelerate program like Fara Homidi, Topicals, Brown Girl Jane, and Sienna Naturals. These brands introduce new perspectives and address needs that haven’t been met before. It’s inspiring to watch these brands evolve and gain traction with our community, bringing something truly unique to the table. R29: Do you have any career advice that you’d like to share with anyone aspiring to work in beauty? AP: Stay curious, and always be ready to learn. Beauty is an industry that moves fast and evolves constantly, so being adaptable is key. I also think it’s essential to have a strong point of view and to understand your values. Ask yourself, “Why do I want to work in beauty?” Whether it’s a passion for artistry, inclusivity, or innovation, having that clarity will help guide your decisions and keep you grounded. And finally, embrace collaboration. Beauty is a team effort, and every product or campaign we launch comes from a mix of different perspectives and expertise. R29: Why do you think Sephora has resonated with so many beauty lovers — hello, Sephora tweens! — and continues to do so?AP: “We belong to something beautiful” is more than just a mantra—it’s our commitment to making prestige beauty accessible to everyone. From our curated product selection to the diversity of our teams, everything we do reflects and celebrates the uniqueness of our customers. Beauty is a deeply personal journey, and we recognize that everyone expresses it in their own way. Whether someone visits us in-store or shops online, we want every experience to feel personal and supportive. It’s this commitment to inclusivity, authenticity, and empowerment that keeps people coming back. Sephora isn’t just a store or beauty destination; it’s a community that celebrates beauty in all its forms. Like what you see?
