With seven Grand Slam titles and four Olympic gold medals to her name, Venus Williams is a force to be reckoned with in competitive tennis. But we find her projects off the court — from launching activewear collabs for a good cause to championing women’s equality in sports — just as inspiring. Her latest move is a partnership with Dove for The Body Confident Sport, an initiative focused on building confidence in young female athletes (you might have spotted the ads at the Superbowl recently). For every Dove item purchased from today until February 28, the brand is donating to organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and Boys \u0026 Girls Clubs of America to help support girls in sports. As her first-name twin, I had the opportunity to catch up with Williams for a quickfire Q\u0026A, diving into everything from her beauty routine to her advice for the next generation of athletes. Read on to discover her favorite affordable body care products and how she keeps her makeup game as strong as her serve. DashDividers_1_500x100 I feel most powerful when…I’ve finished a workout; nothing feels better than that. Power to me means…Controlling my own mind and my own choices. What do you do when you feel powerless?I push myself even harder because this is the time I can learn the most, whether it’s about myself, life, or the situation at hand (more on that below). What’s your power anthem? I actually don’t have one! Who is your power icon?Definitely my mom; she taught me how to be strong and powerful. What do you wear when you want to feel powerful?Something short! Keep reading for the rest of our Q\u0026A with Williams. DashDividers_1_500x100 Refinery29: Tell us more about your collaboration with Dove and why this project means so much to you. Venus Williams: The Body Confident Sport initiative is the only program of its kind that focuses on the coaches and how they can help build confidence in girls — who are at this very impressionable age — and encourage them to stay in sports. [In addition to the donation mentioned above, Dove has also partnered with the Women’s National Football Conference to host football camps and clinics for girls, and is providing resources and webinars to coaches through the Women’s Sports Foundation]. I’m so excited about this because I can’t imagine my life without sports. When I was at that age I also looked up to these coaches. I know firsthand the impact [that] positive talking and negative talking had on your confidence. R29: What are some go-to beauty products you turn to when you need that boost of confidence? VW: I’m always moisturizing, so I bring rose water everywhere. Whether I’m on the plane or in the car, I’m always spraying it onto my skin. I love layering serums and moisturizers, too. My recent favorites have been the Dior Capture Le Sérum, $145, and the Dior Capture Creme, $145. When I’m on the court, I love to wear eyeliner and bold earrings to accessorize. My favorite eyeliner is Milani’s Stay Put 16HR Eyeliner, $9.99. It’s waterproof and you don’t have to worry about smudging. If it goes on, it stays on. I also wear this when I go out at night. R29: What are some of the best beauty lessons you’ve picked up from your loved ones? VW: I’ve learned to always wear sunscreen from Serena, and put on long sleeves and leggings when I’m out in the sun. One of my older sisters always said, “Update, don’t be late!” I’m inspired by her to always refresh my style and treat it as a fun project every few years. I learned from my makeup artists to always put on a layer of moisture (like a water-based serum) on my lips before sealing it with lip balm or makeup. R29: Let’s talk about body care. Do you have any affordable favorites? VW: I’ve been using the Dove Relaxing Body Wash Lavender Oil \u0026 Chamomile, $6.97, and I love the scent. I also love the Dove Exfoliating Body Wash, $9.97, which makes the skin tone more even [thanks to a formula designed for melanin-rich skin, packed with moisturizing ceramides and gentle exfoliants like salicylic acid]. I also recommend the Dove Glowing Long Lasting Gentle Body Wash, $6.97; I just love the mango scent. I’ve been using a body scrubber when I shower with these products. It’s really good for your lymphatic system. You can also use the scrubber to dry brush, which gives you softer skin. R29: Do you have any advice for young girls on overcoming self-doubt? VW: It’s okay to live with a little bit of self-doubt — it’s just a part of life. I always tell kids that there are ups and downs in life, but what’s important is the decisions that you make when you believe in yourself. When I’m on the court, if I feel good about what I’m wearing and how I style myself, then I can just focus on my tennis. When girls have the opportunity to play sports, they have a lot less time or concern about what other people are thinking, and instead, they are thinking about what they can achieve. Focusing on what I can achieve has made a great difference to me, and I spend less time thinking about how other people are judging me. I’d also say that every little thing adds up: Even going to the gym for 15 minutes is still a way to take care of yourself. You’d be surprised how much you can accomplish in 15 minutes if you don’t give up. Like what you see?

    "title": "Lawless’ Forget The Filler Foundation Is Here — \u0026 We Tried It",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lawless-forget-the-filler-foundation-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In a sea of light-as-air skin tints and weightless concealers, it would seem like full-coverage foundation has fallen out of favor these days. Well, not if Lawless Beauty has anything to say about it. You may know the brand from its beloved Forget The Filler products (which include a lip gloss, gloss balm, lip overnight mask, and face moisturizer), but Lawless also has a full range of makeup, too — the latest addition being the Forget The Filler Skin-Plumping Line-Smoothing Foundation. And if you can guess where this is going…yes, we put it to the test. If the lengthy name didn’t already fill you in, the Forget The Filler foundation is meant to be a filter in a bottle: Weightless yet full coverage, with a soft-matte, blurred finish that diffuses fine lines for a flawless finish. (By contrast, Lawless’ only other foundation, Conseal The Deal, is a serum-like texture with long-wear properties.) Below, read the honest reviews from five Refinery29 editors, and see how the product looks on real, unfiltered skin. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lawless Forget The Filler Foundation, $43 DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: 7LReview: “This foundation might not be everyone’s cup of tea, and here’s why: For something billed as “line-smoothing” and “skin-plumping,” it’s very matte. As an oily skin girlie, I actually love this, but if you read those words and expected a hydrating, dewy foundation, this is not that.  “Ever since testing a bunch of primers last month, I’m recently back on prepping and setting my makeup. I started with e.l.f.’s Power Grip Primer, then used a damp sponge to apply foundation where needed. (One pump mostly evened out my skin, and two were more than enough for a full-coverage look.) After applying, it dried down to an airbrushed matte finish, and I lightly dusted loose powder on my T-zone and misted my entire face with setting spray. (Depending on your skin type and where you live, you might not need to set this, but I live in South Florida and can use all the help I can get.)  “As someone who prefers a matte (but never cakey!) foundation, I have to say, Lawless really impressed me. Even before setting, my skin looked like a porcelain doll’s; luminous, blurred, and honestly, pretty close to flawless. My pores disappeared, and it was pretty transfer-resistant too, which is rare to find with a full coverage formula. 7L was a perfect shade match for me, but I would love to see more shades added to the lineup so everyone who wants to try this can do so.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: 24D, 23D, 22T Review: “I was eager to try Lawless’ new Forget the Filler foundation for several reasons. Years ago, I received a sample of one of their liquid foundations in a PR package. Though the shade was too dark for me, I loved the formula so much that I repurposed it as a contour—and to this day, it remains a staple in my routine (but let’s keep that between us). So, when the opportunity came to test their latest launch, I was ecstatic to finally experience a full-face application in my perfect shade. “True to its name, the Forget the Filler foundation is designed to create a smooth, filtered effect on the skin. From the moment I applied it, I was genuinely impressed. I prepped my skin with my usual routine: serum, sunscreen, and e.l.f. ‘s Power Grip Primer before blending in shade 24D, which to my surprise matched me flawlessly. The foundation glided on effortlessly, delivering an even, full-coverage finish. “One thing to note: this formula is highly mattifying. It’s more matte than any foundation I’ve ever used, which could be a drawback for those who prefer a dewier complexion. However, as someone with combination skin that tends to get oily, I appreciated the long-lasting shine control. I remained oil-free for most of the day with minimal touch-ups, making it a solid choice for those with similar skin concerns. “What impressed me most was the blurring effect. My pores—usually quite visible—were practically undetectable, and the foundation concealed my dark spots and blemishes with a single application. The result was a smooth, airbrushed finish that felt lightweight and natural, not cakey. “I’d recommend this foundation in a heartbeat, especially to those looking for a high-coverage, long-wearing matte formula. That said, I do wish Lawless had expanded the shade range to be more inclusive of deeper skin tones as I couldn’t spot huge differences between shades 19T and 24D. Hopefully, they’ll build on this already impressive launch to offer a wider selection in the future.” — Cortni Spearman, social director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: 7L, 9LReview: “To be completely honest, foundation is usually a no-go for me. I like to use my fingertips to apply base makeup, and most full-coverage foundation can look streaky and patchy if I’m not careful enough. I made the switch to tinted BB creams and skin tints many years ago, as they’re far more suitable for me and my tactile ways. Lawless’ Forget The Filler, however, has managed to break my almost decade-long streak of not liking any foundation. This is all thanks to an ultra-hydrating formula containing vitamin E and glycerin, a humectant that attracts and binds moisture to the skin. There’s also the brand’s proprietary bio-fermented biomimetic complex, Maxi-YouthTM, a type of hyaluronic acid that effectively plumps the skin and improves skin cell regeneration. “The foundation is only ever so slightly denser than your average skin tint, and glides on my skin like melted butter, casting a flattering filter over my dark spots and texture without settling into any creases. I enjoy that it’s a matte-effect foundation (I already have a sizable collection of dewy coverage products), and it was very easy to blend it in with my fingers. My skin stayed bouncy and moisturized for hours when I wore this foundation to a night out; 7L was a close match to my skin tone in the winter, while 9L is perfect for when I get more than in the summer. At the end of the night, a friend snapped a bunch of photos of me on her digital camera, and my skin looked absolutely flawless close-up — not a single trace of cakiness or shine in sight. You wouldn’t have believed that I was wearing a full face of foundation!” — Venus Wong, senior writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: 5L \u0026 7L (but I should’ve chosen 3L)Review: “I thought I’d left foundation behind in favor of skin tints, but Lawless’ Forget The Filler reminded me just how good my makeup looks with a hint more coverage. Breakouts where? Trust me, they’re well hidden. Just a single pump of Forget The Filler was enough to cover my entire face including a very large and painful pimple on my top lip and one on the bridge of my nose. Though the pigment packs a punch, it doesn’t feel chalky or mask-like. Instead, it melted into my skin, lending a soft finish that I like to call “cloud skin”, which occupies a cozy space between matte and dewy. In other words, it’s fresh, rather than overly luminous. Unlike other full coverage foundations, it wears comfortably throughout the day and doesn’t collect in fine lines or parched patches (something I often worry about being an on-off Differin user). If you’re after a foundation that feels like a second skin but tucks away pimples, dark circles, and hyperpigmentation in a flick of a wrist — all without compromising on skin-like radiance — then you’ll love this. My only gripe is that this shade — 5L — is just a tad too dark for me and didn’t match my much paler neck and chest. I have light olive skin and should’ve opted for 3L.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: 5L \u0026 7LReview: “I was surprised by how much I liked the new Lawless Forget the Filler foundation. I expected a dewy finish, but it’s definitely more matte — something I don’t usually go for. That said, it blends seamlessly into the skin, feels incredibly lightweight, and makes my pores virtually disappear — a major win. A little goes a long way, which I appreciate, but while it claims to have skin-plumping ingredients, I haven’t really noticed those effects. On my very dry skin, it does feel a bit drying, but overall, the formula is impressive. I’d say it’s best suited for those with oily skin looking for a smooth, matte, poreless finish.” — Sara Tan, global beauty director Like what you see?

    "description": "Shopping for beauty products can be fun, but it can also add up fast. No matter how good they make you feel (or look), no one looks forward to seeing the credit card bill post an Ulta or Sephora trip. However, you can save on your beauty routine by using your FSA (flexible spending account) and HSA (health savings account) on beauty products that are eligible. Enrolling in either of these programs allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars for certain medical expenses and conditions, like over-the-counter medications and even skin-care products. To help you make the most of your FSA or HSA benefits and shop strategically, we enlisted the help of board certified dermatologist Nithin Reddy, MD, to break down the benefits, what types of products qualify and why, and how to optimize your shopping list. We also included some of the best FSA and HSA-eligible skin-care products you can stock up on with your funds, including a few of our editor-backed picks. What is the difference between an FSA and an HSA? In order to fully take advantage of these benefits, it is helpful to understand what exactly FSA and HSA accounts are and the differences between them. Both FSA and HSA benefits let you set aside pre-tax money to spend on healthcare costs, but there's an annual contribution limit for an FSA that you can specify during your enrollment period, according to Dr. Reddy. He points out that employers usually offer FSAs, and HSAs are contingent on enrolling in a high-deductible health plan. \"One of the main advantages of an HSA is that it is portable, staying with the account holder through job transitions,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Other HSA advantages include higher contribution limits, rollovers, investment opportunities, and flexible withdrawals. It is crucial to thoroughly review the terms and conditions, contribution limits, and qualified expenses with both types of accounts to determine their suitability for your needs.\" How can beauty products qualify for the tax-free benefit? Dr. Reddy says that while beauty products alone may not qualify as FSA/HSA eligible, those containing ingredients proven to treat medical conditions - like acne, eczema, or in the prevention of skin cancer can be eligible for FSA/HSA coverage. \"For instance, over-the-counter retinol, a well-known antiaging ingredient in many beauty products, is in many acne treatments, making it eligible for FSA/HSA funds,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Similarly, blemish correctors that contain salicylic acid, another effective ingredient for treating acne, often qualify as FSA/HSA eligible.\" Along with acne treatments, sunscreen is also eligible since they help prevent skin cancer. He also notes that some moisturizers can qualify for the benefit if they help with eczema management. \"If there is any doubt about a specific product's eligibility, it is always advisable to first consult with your account administrator,\" he says. How can consumers take advantage of their FSA/HSA benefits for beauty products? \"Any products labeled as FSA/HSA eligible can be purchased using your FSA or HSA account, providing a convenient way to manage your healthcare expenses by offering tax savings,\" he says. Sites like Sephora, CVS, and Amazon have specific sections you can shop from that filter the products that are eligible for the benefit. \"I recommend carefully assessing your skin-care routine to identify which products may qualify for coverage. Consulting with your local dermatologist can help you develop a tailored skin-care routine that caters to your specific skin conditions,\" Dr. Reddy says. He recommends swapping products that aren't covered by the benefit with FSA/HSA-eligible items but warns not to overspend on non-essential items if you can help it. Ahead, we rounded up the best beauty products you can get using your FSA or HSA benefits. Expert Featured in This Article Nithin Reddy is a NYC-based board certified dermatologist.",

    "description": "Winnie Harlow has cemented herself as one of today's most sought-after talents in beauty. She even founded the successful skin-care brand Cay Skin, proving she's more than just \"the girl from America's Next Top Model.\" The latest title to be added to Harlow's résumé? Fiancée. On Feb. 13, the 30-year-old got engaged to NBA basketball star Kyle Kuzma during a romantic getaway in Turks \u0026 Caicos - complete with a jaw-dropping, 8.5-carat oval-cut engagement ring (with two baguette stones on the side). And of course, our eyes are on her nails. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ♔Winnie Harlow♔ (@winnieharlow) Harlow's nails - painted a gorgeous nude shade with soft creamy pink tones - matched the vibe of her classic ring perfectly. The manicure is a nod to the \"rich girl\" manicure trend that took over our social media feeds last summer. Originally coined by celebrity manicurist Tom Bachik, \"rich girl\" nails are \"a modern take on a sophisticated classic,\" as he puts it. Spotted on other stars like Jennifer Lopez, Ciara, and Bella Hadid, the trend is usually marked by a full-coverage set with greige (beige and gray) tones that are either one shade lighter or darker than a person's natural skin tone, creating a subtle, yet statement-making manicure. Harlow's nails are on the pinker side, but they feature greige undertones, proving the trend is here to stay. In case you've been looking for a minimal nail shade that feels luxurious or you want to stay prepared for your own engagement (you never know when it'll happen), consider picks like the Essie Salon-Quality Nail Polish in Wild Nude ($9, originally $10) or the Chanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour in Faussaire ($33) to help you nail the trend.
