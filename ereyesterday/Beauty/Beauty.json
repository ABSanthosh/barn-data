    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/beef-tallow-skin-care-49340290",
    "description": "If you're on #SkinTok, you may have seen a few beauty influencers raving about the benefits of using beef tallow on the skin. If you haven't, and you're not even quite sure what beef tallow is, let us assure you, you aren't alone. However, the trend has been blowing up on social media over the last few months, and it's certainly piqued our interest. Is this just another TikTok claim that we should ignore, or are there actual benefits to using beef tallow on your skin? Do a little Googling and you'll find a handful of different companies selling skin-care products made with beef tallow - everything from 100 percent grass-fed beef tallow skin cream to tallow eye cream. But just because it's worked for a few people on the internet doesn't mean it will work for your skin - or that it's even safe. To answer all of our burning questions about the trend, we tapped an expert. Ahead, they break down what beef tallow is, whether or not it's safe for use on the skin, and what the potential risks of using it are. What Is Beef Tallow? Let's get the biggest question out of the way: What exactly is beef tallow? \"Beef tallow is rendered fat from cattle,\" Peter Lee, MD, at Wave Plastic Surgery, tells PS. \"It's beef fat that has had all the non-fatty components and all of the moisture removed.\" Beef tallow is most commonly used to make candles and soap, but users on social media have recently claimed that applying it to the skin can provide dermatologic benefits, like improving acne, soothing rashes, treating eczema, and reducing wrinkles. Sounds like a miracle product, right? Unfortunately, Dr. Lee says it isn't all it's cracked up to be. \"To date, there are no accepted clinical studies that confirm the efficacy of application of beef tallow to human skin in achieving any of these benefits,\" he says. @thrivewithcandice Just water \u0026 beef tallow and my skin has never been better ü´∂üèº dry brush is from @Primally Pure and beef tallow from @ELA SKIN CO. #nontoxicskincareroutine #naturalskincare #naturalskincareproducts #nontoxicskincareproducts #beeftallowskincare #drybrushingskin #drybrushingbenefits ‚ô¨ original sound - Candice üåû Is Beef Tallow Safe For Skin? While beef tallow does technically have moisturizing properties and it also contains antioxidants, there are some downsides. The biggest one? \"Beef tallow is not approved for topical application on the skin by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\" Dr. Lee says. This likely means that whatever products you're purchasing are homemade, and the regulations surrounding them are nonexistent. Although it's ultra-moisturizing due to its emollient consistency, if you have sensitive skin, the thickness of beef tallow could cause acne and breakouts when applied directly to the skin. And that's not all - there are more serious health risks to consider. \"There is a theoretical possibility that people who do so may put themselves at risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as mad cow disease), although we are not aware of any patients who have suffered this complication at this time.\" OK, so, maybe skip the beef tallow for now. If your goal is to reduce wrinkles, Dr. Lee suggests embarking on a regimen using retinol under the supervision of a physician. Tretinoin is one of our favorite prescription-only retin-A products - we personally love Differin's Retinoid Treatment Gel ($16) and The Ordinary's High-Strength Retinol Serum ($15) - but you can also find a variety of great products formulated with the antiaging hero ingredient in the aisles of your local drugstore. \"If patients suffer from dry skin and wish to improve their skin's appearance and texture, I recommend using a pharmaceutical-grade moisturizer,\" Dr. Lee says. You can also add a hyaluronic acid serum into your routine or try a skin-care technique specifically meant to moisturize, like skin slugging. Just please put down the beef tallow.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-chemical-peels-49178402",
    "description": "Exfoliation is the key to smooth, glowing skin. As much as we love a good physical facial scrub, nothing does it quite like a classic chemical peel. But if the idea of chemical exfoliation scares you - for some people, even hearing the phrase evokes horrendous mental images - know there are varying degrees. Some chemical peels are in-office-only treatments, and they tend to be a bit more aggressive. Chemical peels at home, on the other hand, usually lean a bit gentler, allowing you to get some of the same benefits without half of the side effects. Make no mistake: even at-home treatments can pack a punch, and you should still exercise caution when using them - especially if your skin type is dry or sensitive. But if your skin can take a little heat, you'll find that oftentimes, the benefits of chemical exfoliation outweigh the slight discomfort they might cause while they're working their magic. The best at-home chemical peels can target a myriad of skin-care concerns, from dark spots and hyperpigmentation caused by sun exposure to congestion and breakouts in your T-zone and just an overall dullness of skin tone. If your complexion is looking a little lackluster, doing a peel may be all you need to reset and renew your skin. How often you're able to use it depends on the formulation and the skin-care ingredients included (as well as if you can take a little tingly sensation), but it varies from once a week to once a month for more powerful varieties. To help you find the right match for your skin, we rounded up the best chemical peels ahead. Keep scrolling to unlock your most radiant skin yet.",

    "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be seen on the city‚Äôs street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we‚Äôve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‚Äò90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles.¬†Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC‚Äôs bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù bob continues to be the hottest haircut of the season. Think bangs that occupy a cosy space between curtains and a fuller, more straight-across shape, and lengths that dust the top of the shoulders.Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.If you're brave enough to go shorter, consider the French bob, a cut that brushes the jawline, as seen on this guest outside Coach. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We glimpsed a handful of close-cropped afros, from the Thom Browne runway show to the city's streets. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.If you want to keep your hair long but you're keen to add some interest, consider what hairstylists are calling the ‚Äúlip length chunk‚Äù, essentially shorter front pieces that meet the lips. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Meet the ‚Äúboxie‚Äù, a cross between a bob and a pixie cut with a little extra shagginess. James Bickmore, art director at¬†Neil Moodie Studio previously told R29, ‚ÄúThe boxie is perfect for those who are growing out a pixie but don‚Äôt want a bob. It‚Äôs easy to manage and gets better as it grows out. It has a very ‚ÄòI woke up like this‚Äô vibe ‚Äî with a bit of an edge.‚ÄùPhotographed by Flordalis Espinal.This wavy, chunky-ended cut can only mean one thing: The Italian bob is back for 2025, and we're not at all mad about it. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.This sleek lob (aka long bob) and baroque bob (essentially a short bob with sculpted waves) certainly grabbed our attention outside Sandy Liang on Sunday. Could this photo be any more chic?Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Seen on a guest outside Sandy Liang, these braided bangs are the ultimate protective hairstyle for shorter front pieces. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.In-between haircuts are far from mediocre, and this is all the evidence you need. This guest's taupe cendr√© hair color elevates the shoulder-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Oval layers ‚Äî a more subtle iteration of flicky '90s layers ‚Äî are still going strong. This long cut spotted on a guest on Sunday is all the inspiration you need to give your long hair a little extra movement.Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Guests and models at shows like Sandy Liang are embracing big and bouncy curls this season. The russet red hair color here is just as stunning. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The ‚Äújellyfish‚Äù haircut merges the best of two popular styles: the sharpness of a bob and the swish of longer, layered lengths. The straight-across bangs complete this look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Full bangs are so back, and if you're into sleek updos like these seen on guests outside Sandy Liang, they add a little something extra. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Long layers will never go out of style. We love this cut seen on a street styler outside Sandy Liang. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The '70s-esque shaggy bangs, floaty long layers, and amber blonde color earn this hairstyle top marks. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year ‚Äî and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The ‚Äúkicked‚Äù bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle seen on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut ‚Äî seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano ‚Äî nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.
