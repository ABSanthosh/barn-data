    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-nail-file-growth-benefits?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "My nails have been through a lot over the past three decades. I was a compulsive nail biter throughout most of my childhood and teen years, and it wasn’t until college that I kicked the habit for good. From there, I’ve struggled with brittle, weak nails on and off depending on my anemia, stress levels, diet, and other factors. Even though I no longer instinctively chew my nails like I once did, I was still prone to picking if I noticed a scraggly edge or a hangnail. Until one day, I decided that I’d be a lot less likely to pick if I had a better alternative than taking matters into my own hands — literally.  I was first introduced to glass nail files a few years ago through Bare Hands’ Dry Gloss manicure kit, and ever since then, my natural nails have never looked better. Most manicurists have sworn by glass files for years, thanks to their ability to shape nails without snagging, but I had no idea that the right tool could actually prevent me from damaging my nails and help them grow. Recently, I was traveling and broke a nail; instead of picking at it, I ran to the closest beauty store and picked up a glass nail file to reshape and prevent further damage. The one I found? Ulta Beauty Collection’s version, which came in a travel-friendly sleeve perfect for keeping in a makeup bag or purse for on-the-go use. It also turned out to be the best impulsive buy for my natural nails. Read ahead for a deep dive into the benefits of glass files — and exactly why they’re worth the investment. DashDividers_1_500x100 Why are glass nail files better for your natural nails? You might not think twice about the kind of nail file you’re using, but there’s a good chance it could be causing more harm than good to your natural nails. “Traditional emery boards cause microscopic tears at the tip of the nail,” explains Dr. Dana Stern, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of nail care brand Dr. Dana. “Glass files create a perfectly smooth edge that seals keratin [which nails are made of] and prevents splitting, peeling, breakage, and even premature polish chipping,” she adds. How should you use a glass nail file? According to Dr. Stern, glass files are best suited for filing the free edge (aka the “top”) of the nail to shape and shorten. Unlike other types of files, glass versions can be safely used to file the nail in any direction. With other, more abrasive materials, you are usually instructed to only file nails one way to avoid creating a jagged edge. How often do you have to replace glass nail files? Happily, glass files are a sustainable, reusable alternative and can be cleaned between uses. “In salons, any porous item should be considered one-time-use as they can potentially harbor infectious material and cannot be sterilized,” Dr. Stern says. “Another advantage of glass tools is that they don’t dull and are therefore continuously reusable.” Keeping your glass file in a protective case will help shield it from chemicals and getting scratched (or scratching other things).  How do glass nails help natural nails grow? It may seem counterintuitive that a tool designed to shorten your nails can actually help them grow, but think of it as a long game strategy, like how regular hair trims can help avoid split ends. “Switching to a glass file is advantageous because the nail is less likely to peel, split, and break, so over time, you are more likely to achieve length with a glass file than a traditional emery board,” explains Dr. Stern.  For me, having neat, groomed nails — with or without polish or gel — discouraged me from picking at them, which would cause them to peel or break, and set my growth journey back to square one. I’ve been using the Ulta one several times a week since it lives in my bag and therefore accompanies me almost everywhere. I’ve found myself fixing my nails waiting in line at a coffee shop, or when I touch up my lipstick in the bathroom at happy hour. Despite the $9 price tag, it’s just as good as any other brand (including more expensive ones) I’ve tried; it’s lightweight but doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. Plus, the grain is on the finer side, making it quite gentle on my nails. Within a month, my nails looked visibly better and were breaking and splitting less often. In the past, I swore by builder gel to achieve any meaningful growth. It’s been months since my last gel manicure, but with my wedding coming up, I’ll likely get one in the books soon — especially now that I’m set up for success with healthier natural nails. Is there any recommended “aftercare” post-glass nail file use? It’s not required, but then again, pampering your nails is never really a bad thing. “Nothing needs to be done [after using a glass file] for the nail per se, but I always recommend keeping the cuticle well hydrated,” says Dr. Stern, adding that a healthy cuticle is foundational for a healthy nail. Her go-to? The Dr. Dana Nourishing Cuticle Oil, which contains indigo naturalis (an herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for reducing inflammation), plus sunflower and jojoba oils to moisturize (yes — your nails need that too!) and support nail growth. “When used regularly, cuticle oil will keep cuticles properly hydrated and allow nails to grow healthier and stronger,” Dr. Dana explains. I keep one on my nightstand as a reminder to use it at least nightly, but am trying to be better about using one a few times a day. I’m a fan of Olive \u0026 June’s Cuticle Serum pens, which absorb quicker than an oil for easier, grease-free use during the day. Which glass nail file is best for me? Not all glass files are created equal, and Dr. Stern specifically notes that the level of abrasiveness can vary among glass files. What’s more, not all of them are meant for natural nails. (Grittier ones may be used as a first step to remove gel polish, for example.) If you’re simply looking to replace your basic emery board, something like my new Ulta find or the Dr. Dana Glass Nail File will be a major upgrade and gentle enough for regular use.  Glass files also come in a variety of shapes, which can lend themselves to other purposes besides filing. Germanikure’s Moonfile has a slight arched shape (hence the name), which is ergonomically designed for a comfortable hold, but is also great for pushing back cuticles and gently exfoliating dead skin on the sides of the nail.  In addition to using a glass file, I also like to use a glass polisher tool — namely Bare Hands’ polisher — to gently buff the nail surface. It works by removing the superficial layer of keratin (which will look like mini clouds of whitish dust) on your nails, resulting in a naturally shiny appearance. According to the brand, the polisher lasts for around six months if you buff once a week for your nails. With less frequent use, it can last up to a year. Mind you, I’ve had mine for nearly two years and it’s still in pretty good shape. Using a glass buffer comes with a caveat, though: Dr. Stern is quick to note that a glass file is not the same as a buffer, which is safe for the nail plate. “Using a glass file at the surface can dislodge nail cells, creating an uneven surface that is more prone to peeling and breakage,” she says. “Also, filing or even over-buffing the nail surface can result in a nail that is too thin.”  Besides using a glass file on the free edge of my nails, I buff the surface once every other week at a maximum to avoid compromising their integrity, and I think it’s helped my nails not only look better (they have a natural luster, so sometimes I skip polish entirely), but grow in healthier. (Think of it as maintaining a healthy skin barrier — less is more!)  Ready to become a card-carrying member of the glass file club? Shop our favorites below. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-perfume-brands?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I write this story from one of countless cafes in Seongsu, a hip area that’s been referred to as “the Brooklyn of Seoul.” Lined with quaint boutiques and a revolving door of pop-ups for some of Korea’s hottest fashion and beauty brands, it’s become a top shopping destination for locals and tourists alike. As such, it’s also a great spot to see what’s currently trending. After spending many afternoons scanning the sea of shopping bags in people’s hands, it’s clear that one category of K-beauty is especially popular right now: fragrance.  Tamburins, Nonfiction, pesade, Borntostandout: They may not be household names—yet—but they are among the most beloved perfume brands in Korea right now. Below, let’s take a closer look at the world of Korean fragrance houses, including a few under-the-radar brands on the rise. DashDividers_1_500x100 FRA 422 View this post on Instagram A post shared by FRA422 프라포투투 (@fra422.official) As if on cue, on my way over to the cafe, a girl handed me a perfume blotter advertising a pop-up nearby. I had never heard of the brand before, but the sample smelled so good, I had to check it out.  FRA 422 is centered around sustainability and scent. (The “422” in the name is a reference to Earth Day, which is April 22.) As an employee explained to me, the brand only uses extracted essential oils from plants that aren’t endangered or at risk — or they formulate closely matched synthetic substitutes that are indistinguishable from the original scents. To that end, the line is tightly curated with just five core perfumes, including a leather and oud number called Won and a rose and oakmoss scent named Kim. My personal favorite is Hani, a fresh citrus that’s grounded in amber and musk and wears like a second skin. DashDividers_1_500x100 Tamburins View this post on Instagram A post shared by TAMBURINS 탬버린즈 (@tamburinsofficial) Tamburins is perhaps the most well-known K-fragrance brand of the bunch, thanks in part to its affiliation with luxury eyewear brand Gentle Monster, and global celebrity ambassadors like Jennie from BLACKPINK and actor Byeon Woo Seok.   With architecturally stunning retail spaces filled with objets d’art and packaging that elevates the experience of using one of their scented offerings, it’s easy to see why people are instantly drawn to the brand. Since debuting in 2017, Tamburins has expanded its extensive lineup to include perfumes housed in egg-shaped bottles, solid fragrances for on-the-go, scented hand creams, candles, lip balms, and even car diffusers in distinctive scents like Pumpkini, a sweet pumpkin and coconut milk fragrance cut with invigorating shiso leaf and ginger. DashDividers_1_500x100 Nonfiction View this post on Instagram A post shared by NONFICTION 논픽션 (@official.nonfiction) Nonfiction was the first perfume brand I purchased when I moved to Korea last fall. I walked into one of their bright, airy stores one afternoon and immediately fell in love with their Neroli Dream scent (a softer version of Tom Ford’s iconic Neroli Portofino IMO). The brand’s messaging is all about finding calm in your days through sensorial rituals that connect you to your inner self. This ethos is reflected throughout the minimalist packaging and the fragrances themselves, which are formulated using plant-derived ingredients that are never too overpowering.  In addition to the perfumes in its current lineup, Nonfiction also makes body and hair care products, as well as hand creams, lip balms, room sprays, and candles. DashDividers_1_500x100 Borntostandout View this post on Instagram A post shared by BORNTOSTANDOUT® (@borntostandout.official) If quiet minimalism isn’t your thing, give Borntostandout a try — honestly, the name says it all. Launched in 2022 by a former investment banker and lifelong fragrance fanatic Jun Lim, BTSO was created for those who “rebel against the standards” — but still want to smell really good.  The brand’s smooth white flacons nod to traditional Korean porcelain wares and have memorable names like DGAF and Fig Porn emblazoned across them in crimson typeface; the fragrances themselves are equally memorable, thanks to unconventional accords that range from basmati rice to banana bread.  Sure, some of the scents may throw you at first sniff, but they dry down into something softer and more familiar as they wear. This might explain BTSO’s rapidly growing fan base and L’Oréal’s recent funding, as the brand plans its expansion into the U.S. and European markets. DashDividers_1_500x100 pesade View this post on Instagram A post shared by pesade 페사드 (@pesade_official) Just a stone’s throw away from Borntostandout’s Itaewon store is pesade, where the ambiance is decidedly more relaxed. From the sleek interiors to the structural tables that showcase the brand’s timeless scents, everything about pesade feels refined and classic.  The brand’s unlikely source of inspiration comes from dressage, a discipline of equestrianism. A pesade refers to a dressage move where a horse balances on its hind legs at a 45-degree angle from the ground. Per the brand, “This particular movement symbolizes the harmony of power and balance, which is deeply connected to pesade’s philosophy.” The scents come in highly concentrated parfums ($210 for 100ml or roughly 3.4oz) and eau de parfums ($180) that last long after first spritz. With a diverse range of unisex fragrances to choose from, pesade is a place where one could easily find their 인생 향수 or “life perfume,” as the Koreans say.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Kinfolk Notes View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kinfolk Magazine (@kinfolk) Fans of Kinfolk will be delighted to know that the brand is still alive and well in 2025 — and has a physical store in Seongsu that has the same relaxed, yet dignified vibe of the indie lifestyle magazine. The flagship space includes a flower shop, café, and the full range of Kinfolk Notes fragrances exclusive to Korea.⁠ Initially launched in 2022 with hand soaps, lotions, and creams, Kinfolk Notes has since expanded to include eau de parfums, diffusers, and candles.  With dreamy names like Splendor in the Grass, inspired by William Wordsworth’s poem and movie of the same name, and Blue Velvet (a reference to David Lynch’s neo-noir mystery), all of the fragrances in Kinfolk Notes bring the brand’s artsy sensibilities to life.  DashDividers_1_500x100 W.Dressroom View this post on Instagram A post shared by 더블유드레스룸 (@w.dressroom) If you’re looking for more affordable K-fragrance options, I’d suggest W.Dressroom (which counts BTS’ Jungkook and Seventeen’s S.Coups among its wearers).  The brainchild of renowned designer Bum Suk Choi, W.Dressroom’s scents are uncomplicated in the best way. The straightforward names clearly indicate notes of the juice, and the comprehensive lineup includes everything from fruit-forward options to traditional florals and powdery musks. (Think: Bath and Body Works meets Grown Alchemist.) My favorite is 97 April Cotton, a fresh laundry scent that I regularly douse on my clothes after sweaty dance classes. BTW, the brand’s “dress perfumes” have deodorizing and antibacterial ingredients in them to neutralize unwanted odors from clothes and spaces, making them great for a post-workout spritz or a smoky K-BBQ dinner. DashDividers_1_500x100 Granhand View this post on Instagram A post shared by GRANHAND. (@granhand_official) For a scented souvenir to take back from Seoul, make a stop at one of Granhand’s eight stores scattered throughout the city (though their original outpost in Bukchon Hanok Village is still my favorite). Granhand’s perfumes are unique in name and composition. Take Susie Salmon, for example, a juicy blend described as smelling like “a midday nap after eating sweet fruits” or Lumberjack, a clove bud and cedarwood scent that smells like “a sip of whiskey in front of the fireplace.”  The brand also offers complimentary personalization for each purchase, so you can add your name or initials (or that of a loved one) for an extra sentimental touch.

Yes, even if I'm wearing a waterproof eyeliner or a mattifying, longwear foundation, I'm giving melted. Thankfully, as an avid user of social media, I came across a viral setting spray that I just had to get my hands on and it's my new secret weapon for surviving the heat. Introducing the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray ($32). This product boasts an impressive 16 hours of mattifying wear and offers waterproof and transfer-proof properties for makeup. Its lightweight formula also ensures comfort without any sticky residue, while its ingredients work to absorb excess oil and minimize pore visibility, leaving your skin feeling fresh and smooth. Not to mention, it has Beyoncé's seal of approval, having used it on her Renaissance Tour. For my full review of the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray, keep scrolling. About the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray This product provides up to 16 hours of mattifying wear. It's waterproof and transfer-proof. The formula contains botanical ingredients that assist in absorbing oil and shrinking visible pores. It feels super lightweight and is non-sticky on the skin. What I Like About the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray As an oily girl, it is super difficult to find a setting spray that actually delivers what it promises but the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray works like a charm. It feels super lightweight on the skin but somehow delivers the long-lasting protection that I would expect from a heavy-duty product. I find that its smell is pleasant, and its application is seamless. This setting spray feels like more of a light mist when sprayed on. This product is waterproof, and although I didn't dunk my head into a pool during my trials, it was raining heavily on the first night that I tested it. With it, my makeup stayed on easily-even the powder that I finished it with. When I layered my blush products, starting with a cream and then a powder, the color stayed just as pigmented for the next six hours as it did when it was first applied. I also tested this product on a more lightweight look - using a skin tint, bronzer, blush, and light powder - and even with less product on, I saw that it had the same effect. For the most part, I find that the makeup products that go viral on TikTok deserve their flowers, and that rings true for the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray. How to Use the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray To use this setting spray, start with a clean and moisturized face. Make sure your makeup, especially foundation and concealer, is applied and blended smoothly. Shake the bottle well and hold it about an arm's length away from your face (this distance ensures that the mist is dispersed evenly across your skin). After the setting spray has dried, continue with finishing steps like lipstick and mascara. Using the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray on Full-Face Makeup My Makeup After It Rained Using the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray What to Consider Before Trying the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray Even though the fragrance is light, this setting spray has a scent. So, if you dislike the smell of green tea, this may not be for you. Also, if you prefer a dewy look, it's worth noting this setting spray delivers a matte finish. Where Is the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray Available? The One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray is available at Sephora and at One/Size's website.

    "description": "My skin-care inspiration is that of a glazed doughnut. I dream of having hydrated, dewy, and near-reflective skin, and I'm happy to report that a recent purchase has brought me closer than ever to my goal: the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($20, originally $25). I'm by no means the first person to rave about this beauty product, which is on major sale right now at Soko Glam. In fact, the essence already has quite the cult following. (A facial essence, by the way, is a concentrated yet lightweight lotion applied after cleanser but before moisturizer.) This particular one by Cosrx claims to hydrate the skin and even out its texture, all the while minimizing fine lines and acne scars. So, yeah, it's promising a lot. The secret to the product's success is snail mucin, an ingredient that's been appearing in more widely available skin-care products in the last few years. It's believed that the mucin naturally possesses moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, to name a few. Some studies have also shown that it can reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, according to research published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-have for everyone. Keep reading to learn more about the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Key ingredients include snail secretion filtrate (a substance derived from snails and beloved for its hydrating benefits), soothing allantoin, and hydrating hyaluronic acid. It's highly rated on retailer sites like Amazon, with nearly 75,000 five-star ratings. It doesn't contain any fragrance, sulfates, or parabens. What I Like About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence I'll admit, I bought this essence before I knew anything about what it really was or snail mucin benefits. Instead, I simply kept seeing mentions of the product across the internet, recognized that it was fairly affordable and - since I'm gullible - that's really all it took. So off I went to oo35mm, a local beauty shop frequented by skin-care connoisseurs, in search of a bottle of the stuff. Because I am in my late 20s and own a smartphone, I posted a photo of my purchases on Instagram Stories. I kid you not, no selfie I have ever posted has received such engagement. (Frankly, I should have been offended.) Some people inquired about the whole snail situation, but most of the people who replied said they were longtime fans of the essence. There were a lot of flame emojis involved. It's been months since I started using the essence daily. I use it after cleansing and before applying moisturizer, and I am a complete convert. Though I was worried the additional skin-care step would clog my pores over time, leading to pimples and what have you, my skin's texture has actually improved, and it feels way more even now. The hydration payoff is also huge, and I feel like it actually helps my moisturizer work better, too. For a while, I had been feeling as though the cream would just sit atop my skin after application, and now I feel like it's actually penetrating through and sinking in. Best of all, I finally feel close to glazed doughnut status. Image Source: Amazon What to Consider Before Trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence One thing to consider before trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is that the texture isn't for everyone. To me, it feels sticky just for a few seconds before absorbing into my skin completely. This fleeting stickiness, though brief, has deterred some users. It's worth noting: the majority of shoppers agree that it ultimately doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky, and as far as I'm concerned, that shopper was being a tad dramatic. Nonetheless, if that initial texture will throw you for a loop, you might want to consider a different product. Where Is the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Available? The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is available at Soko Glam, Amazon, CVS, and the brand's website.
