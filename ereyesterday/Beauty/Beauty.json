    "description": "It’s natural to want a fresh start when January rolls around. Some years I say I’ll exercise more, other years I vow to spend less time on my phone. But without fail my perpetual New Year’s resolution is to show my skin a little more TLC. While we may stumble over — or completely give up on — some New Year’s resolutions, your skincare routine shouldn’t feel like an insurmountable hurdle in 2025. Tiny tweaks can often make a world of difference and there’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. Ahead, we asked three dermatologists for their straightforward skincare resolutions to aim for in 2025. Trust us, these are goals you’ll actually want to stick to. DashDividers_1_500x100 Try retinal over retinol If your current retinol serum isn’t doing it for you, then it might be time to add retinal into the mix, according to Dr. Marisa Garshick, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology. Retinal or retinaldehyde — a skincare ingredient derived from vitamin A — is considered more potent than retinol and less irritating than a prescription retinoid (e.g. tretinoin), Dr. Garshick explains. Here’s how it works: For vitamin A derivatives to have an impact on the skin, they need to be converted to retinoic acid. “Retinaldehyde is considered more potent than retinol because it requires fewer steps to be converted to retinoic acid,” Dr. Garshick says. In other words, it works much faster. “[Retinal] is a great option for someone who has been able to tolerate retinol but isn’t seeing their desired results,” Dr. Garshick continues. If you have dry or sensitive skin which doesn’t do well with strong prescription retinoids, then retinal may also be your answer — and you can get it over the counter. Medik8’s Crystal Retinal, $54, is available in various strengths for retinal beginners and established retinal users alike. Also try Maelove Moonlight Retinal Serum, $39.95, with moisturizing squalane and ceramides, and R29-favorite Glow Recipe BlackBerry Retinol Blemish Serum, $48. If you want to spend less, try The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, $14.90. Skincare is much more than just your face  The experts are in agreement: All skincare routines should extend beyond your face. The neck, upper chest and hands are often forgotten about in skincare regimes, explains Dr. Mary Sommerlad, but these areas require just as much attention as your face does. She adds that the skin on the décolletage can be pretty vulnerable to the effects of excess sun and other elements like cold weather. This doesn’t mean you need to buy a specific décolletage cream, though. Bringing your usual moisturizer down to the neck and chest area is just as beneficial. But there are rules. “[The skin here is] incredibly delicate and may not tolerate high-strength acids in the same way as the face may,” Dr. Sommerlad says. Put simply, the 7% glycolic acid that works wonders on your blackheads could irritate the skin further down. Instead, Dr. Garshick recommends gentle yet effective creams with strengthening peptides, hydrating hyaluronic acid and, of course, sunscreen in the daytime. Her favorite multitasking face products that can also be used on the neck and chest include Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Face and Neck Cream, $76, and Peter Thomas Roth Ultimate Solution 5 Multitasking Moisturizer, $65. Also try Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer, $20, if you’d rather spend less. Look for moisturizers with these special ingredients  From hydrating niacinamide to moisturizing ceramides, 2024 saw a host of buzzy skincare ingredients. In the new year, growth factors (also known as GF) and peptides are two ingredients which are really going to be worth the hype, hints Dr. Garshick. Growth factors are types of proteins which increase skin hydration and stimulate skin cell generation. They are also notable in boosting and supporting collagen production, the key to supple skin, says Dr. Garshick. Then there are peptides. These, too, are proteins which strengthen the skin’s barrier — the outermost layer of skin that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). They’re excellent for smoothing skin that’s on the dry side. If you’re keen to give growth factors a go, Dr. Garshick recommends trying The Inkey List 15% Vitamin C + EGF Serum, $16. If peptides sound right for you, try Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream, $69. Understand how LED masks actually work  LED face masks are being hailed as the simple (though pricy) solution to tighter, smoother skin. In 2025, it’s important to understand how LED masks work if you want to reap the benefits. LED masks combine red, infrared and blue light at different wavelengths to rejuvenate skin. Red light, for example, has been shown to improve acne by reducing inflammation, neutralizing acne-causing bacteria and targeting overactive oil glands. It also activates the skin cells that produce collagen and elastin, promoting skin strength and elasticity.  Though LED masks are arguably the must-have tools of the moment, they are not a quick fix. Dr. Sommerlad explains, “Only invest in an LED light if you are prepared to be extremely consistent with use,” noting that some manufacturers recommend daily use (or at least multiple times per week) for several months. It pays to follow the instructions of your chosen tool. A well-made LED mask will feature various settings to target different skin concerns. If you’re ready to commit, try the Solawave Light Therapy Face Mask, $349, or the CurrentBody LED Light Therapy Face Mask, $469. Suncreen all year round If you’ve given up sunscreen this winter, you’re probably not the only one. But there are benefits to wearing SPF all year round, not least because 80% of UV rays can penetrate cloud cover, while UVA — responsible for premature aging and skin cancer — can also make its way through glass windows. NHS dermatology registrar Dr. Sonia Sharma suggests it’s a good idea to get into the routine of wearing sunscreen on a daily basis, even if it is cold and gloomy — and regardless of your skin tone. Dr. Sommerlad recommends choosing a lightweight, hydrating sunscreen with an SPF of 30 to 50, plus UVA protection. Try Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Lotion, SPF70, $9.88, which absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave behind a residue, or Garnier Pure Active BHA+Niacinamide Daily UV SPF50+, $26, which is equally easy to use. If hyperpigmentation is a skin gripe of yours, Dr. Sommerlad suggests trying a tinted sunscreen which also blocks visible light. Try Avène Mineral Multi-Defense Tinted SPF, $36, or La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Sunscreen, $38.99. Consider mole mapping Besides being diligent with sunscreen, people with a family history of skin cancer, or those with a history of tanning bed use, might also want to consider mole mapping or mole scanning services. Available in various towns and cities across the UK, such services use imaging technology to assess each and every mole on your body, ruling out suspicious and potentially cancerous lesions, as well as tracking any changes to your moles over time. “This is especially useful if you have a lot of moles,” says Dr. Sharma, adding, “If you are concerned about new or changing moles, it is important to seek medical attention to have these reviewed.” Mole mapping is available in various clinics across the US. Don’t overdo it While TikTok’s 10+ step skincare routines are captivating, skinimalism is the ultimate skincare mantra for 2025. Dr. Sharma advises against simultaneously using multiple skincare products with many different active ingredients, such as glycolic acid and retinoids. “Using lots of different skincare products can actually weaken the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] and cause more problems,” she explains, manifesting in dryness, sensitivity and inflammation. Dr Sommerlad advises prioritizing a healthy skin barrier. Her advice is to use gentle cleansers and moisturizers that contain humectants — ingredients that attract moisture into the skin. Hyaluronic acid and glycerin are some of the best known examples of such ingredients. Besides these, ceramides and peptides can also help to nourish, restore and maintain a healthy skin barrier, allowing you to get closer to your skincare goals. “Working consistently with effective yet gentle ingredients leads to longer term, sustainable results,” Dr. Sommerlad says. Cautious exfoliation Lastly, Dr. Garshick says that over-exfoliation needs to be left behind in 2024. “While it may be tempting [seeing as it leaves] the skin [feeling] softer and smoother, exfoliating too often — or too aggressively [using physical scrubs] — can actually create micro-tears in the skin which can lead to skin irritation and redness,” she explains. If alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic or lactic acid are a little too harsh for your skin type, look out for products containing poly hydroxy acids (PHAs) instead. These are made up of larger molecules and therefore don’t penetrate the skin as deeply but still have the power to smooth skin and unclog pores over time. Like what you see?

    "description": "It doesn’t happen often, but once in a blue moon, a beauty brand will come across our radar (and desks) that manages to convert us savvy beauty editors into full-on fangirls. I could probably count on one hand the number of companies that have unanimously impressed the team of Refinery29 beauty editors, so much so that we can’t help but gush about them in our morning meetings. And if the title of this article wasn’t a dead giveaway, today we’re here to review one of those rare shining stars: Victoria Beckham Beauty. It might seem like an unlikely choice, but it really shouldn’t be; although the brand is relatively new and doesn’t even have a dedicated account on TikTok (that said, VB herself regularly posts GRWMs featuring her products), there is a simple key to the success of the company: The products are just really, really good. Despite the cards being somewhat stacked against each other — naysayers would be quick to write Victoria Beckham Beauty off as yet another celebrity makeup brand — I maintain that I would be just as impressed by the products even if they weren’t backed by a famous face. My colleagues and I regularly quip about the fact that we didn’t want to love it as much as we do partially owing to how expensive the brand is, but we simply can’t help it. The products are phenomenal, and there’s not much else like it on the market these days. Ahead, the team has a go testing out some of the brand’s most iconic beauty products, from her signature kajal liners to Posh lippies, and more. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Concealer Pen with TFC8, $68 “I was especially excited to try this after my colleagues overwhelmingly waxed poetic on it, but I truthfully wasn’t obsessed with Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Concealer Pen. (I know, and I’m sorry!) I don’t doubt that it’s genuinely good for your skin — it has a decadent, serum-like texture that feels divine — but this just wasn’t it in terms of coverage. For the price (this was the most expensive product from the brand I tried), I expect this to conceal — and it offered the amount of coverage you’d get from a lightweight skin tint.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Cheeky Posh, $42 “I really love this blush stick. It’s creamy, blendable, and pigmented. One swipe on each cheek added a flush of color, and you can definitely build this up as much as you want to get a bold pop of color. However, I’ll be honest — and not just because David told us to — it’s a bit expensive. There are comparable formulas (this one feels similar to Ami Colé’s Desert Date Cream Multistick) that perform just as well. That said, if you are all about the posh life and are happy to pay a markup for it, then by all means, go on.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Satin Kajal Liner, $34 “Holy smokes. That’s what I have to say about this eyeliner. Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Satin Kajal is incredibly creamy and glides on beautifully. It’s got a smudger tip on one end to create a lived-in, sultry smoke, but the product is blendable enough that you can also use a brush to buff it out. I felt like the sexiest, most badass version of myself with this eyeliner on, and it was so easy to apply. The pigment is there, and it didn’t irritate my sensitive eyes, even when applied to the waterline. I hoard eyeliners like it’s my job, and this is easily one of the best ones I’ve tried. I tested out two shades — Olive, a deep green, and one of the Jewel formulas, Night Flash, which was a glitter-infused black. Both performed incredibly well in terms of longevity and I’d definitely recommend them for anyone who’s looking for a product to achieve a five-minute smoky eye.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Smoky Eye Brick, $60 “Eyeshadow palettes have sort of fallen out of fashion these days, but I still think there’s a place for them in our glam routines. In addition to being travel-friendly, they offer endless combinations and looks using just one product — and that’s what I really like about Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Smoky Eye Brick. I got the shade Signature, which replicates Victoria’s iconic smoky eye. Matte shadows can be dry and chalky, but not these. They’re silky and blendable, and there’s a surprisingly ample amount of product in the pan. I used the beige shade all over the lid, and added some of the chocolate shade in the crease. I lined with the darkest shade and added a tiny bit of pink in the center for a bit of warmth. The result was a subtle yet defined lid look that could easily be turned up for a date by adding more of the darker shades. Also, the vintage-inspired tortoise compact is absolutely gorgeous and feels so chic.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer FeatherFix, $32 “Don’t let the size fool you. I’ve been using this brow gel every single day for a couple of months and there’s still so much left inside. And thank goodness because it really is excellent. On initial application, the formula feels quite wet, but combined with the teeny tiny plastic teeth, it makes light work of combing each and every hair into place. What’s more, it dries nice and quickly without a trace of residue. No white flakes here! It does make my wiry hairs feel a little hard to the touch, but you wouldn’t guess by looking at them, and my brows don’t budge an inch. No, really. It’s like brow lamination in a tube.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director“I have a lot of brow, so I tend to be quite picky when it comes to tinted gels; too much pigment takes me from zero to Groucho Marx very quickly, and not enough doesn’t lend the definition I’m looking for. The right gel also has to provide moderate yet flexible (read: not crunchy) hold, and keep my bushy arches in place. I’m pleased to report that Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Featherfix is nearly perfect, and I’m convinced that the comb-like applicator is the secret to its performance. I’ve never seen one like it (many brow gel applicators are a teeny, tapered version of a mascara wand, basically), and was really impressed at how it was able to evenly distribute product and allow me to shape my brows to my liking. My lone complaint is that I wish it had a bit more pigment in it — I got the medium brunette shade and feel like I’d still want to fill in gaps with pencil. That said, I still love the feathery, laminated-like look it bestows, and think it’s a really innovative addition to my brow routine.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Future Lash Mascara, $34 “This is one of my favorite mascaras. It lengthens, defines, and creates the prettiest Disney princess lashes. I have naturally dark, long lashes so I don’t love thickening, volumizing formulas as they weigh my eyes down instead of adding a lifting, eye-opening effect. The brand calls Future Lash as “the LBD of mascara,” and it’s a perfect description of the tubing formula. I live in Miami, so I need my mascara to avoid smudges and flaking, and this one does the job — but easily comes off with warm water. When I have this on, it doesn’t look like I’m wearing mascara; it just looks like I have naturally perfect lashes.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Lid Lustre, $36 “These are, without a doubt, my favorite product I’ve tried from Victoria Beckham Beauty. Allow me to explain: These solo shadows are so pigmented and shimmery, I wouldn’t be surprised if you told me that Victoria herself crushed some of her own diamonds to add to these. They are ethereal, dazzling things of beauty, and best of all: You can apply them with clean fingers and go. IMO, they are perfect alone (or with a dusting of mascara) and come in a variety of beautiful shades ranging from emerald green to smoky taupe. I will say, the formula is definitely on the softer side, and a little goes a long way; if you’re worried about fallout, I’d recommend doing your eye makeup first before complexion in case you need to do some cleanup after application. If you love glittery eyeshadow, these are definitely worth the investment — you won’t be disappointed.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Bitten Lip Tint, $38 “IMO, this is one of the more underrated products in the Victoria Beckham Beauty oeuvre. I have the shade Amour (a warm rosy nude) and it leaves the prettiest stain of color. The finish is not glossy, but also not matte, and has a diffused, soft focus finish that makes your lips look like you’ve just had a cheeky snog. The gel-like texture absorbs instantly and offers light hydration to the lips without a greasy, heavy texture. For $38, it’s quite pricey, but I’ve truly not tried anything else like it. (Charlotte Tilbury’s Tinted Love is similar in texture and price point, but sadly lacks color payoff.)” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Posh Lipstick, $38 “I love that Victoria is really playing to her strengths with her brand — sultry eyes, nude lips, flawless skin — and Posh Lipstick is a perfect example. The shade assortment heavily favors neutral tones of beige, pale pinks, and browns, with a few pops of red for good measure. (It’s giving elevated, it’s giving curated.) These feel honestly similar to the Posh Balm, but with the payoff you’d want from a true lipstick. The texture is buttery and hydrating, and the colors are really beautiful, vibrant, and wearable. I also love the smaller bullet since it allows you to be precise with your application and it’s compact enough to fit in a small purse for touch-ups. Again, she is pricey (a running theme), but these truly do feel like a high-end lipstick, on par with any luxury house.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Posh Balm, $32 “I tell everyone who’ll listen about how excellent this lip balm is: I’ve been through all four shades this year, it’s that good. My favorite of the bunch, though, has to be Cassis, which bathes lips in a subtle blackberry glaze. Thanks to nourishing murumuru seed butter, it moisturizes on a deeper level than most tinted lip balms I’ve tried, and somehow, it makes my lips look three times as plump. I can just slick this on, brush my brows up a little and head out the door. It makes me look — and feel — put together.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director “This might be the most luxurious lip balm I’ve ever tried. I know packaging isn’t everything, but this tube is simply, stunning. (Or shall we say, posh?) It’s got a bit of weight to it, and the balm itself is silky and moisturizing. It’s not too heavy and doesn’t have too much of a glossy sheen, which I actually like. My hack is to use this to “prep” my lips before using lipstick or a lip pencil since it absorbs quickly and layers well under other lip products. I can’t wait to try some of the tinted options.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Lip Definer, $30 “I applied this right over a thin layer of clear Posh Balm, and it went on like a dream: Creamy, pigmented, and weightless. I got the shade No. 2, which has become a strong contender for my wedding day lip pencil: It’s very transfer (i.e. kiss!) resistant and long-wear, and the shade itself is a beautiful, luminous rosy nude. It’s expensive for a lip pencil, but for the color payoff and even application, I’d say it’s worth every penny.” – Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer 21:50 Rêverie Eau de Parfum, $200 “The minute I smelled Rêverie, I knew it would become a staple in my fragrance rotation. Considering the current obsession with gourmand — scents that are slightly sweet and moreish — this is bang on trend. It’s rich and treacly (that’ll be the vanilla and tonka bean) but never overly saccharine thanks to a handful of earthy tobacco and a squeeze of tart plum. This is what I wear when I want to feel quietly powerful, especially because the staying power is second to none. It really is beautiful and arguably my favorite among Beckham’s four fragrances. That said, San Isidro Drive (with warm saffron, lush rose and all-encompassing amber) is a close second. My partner wears this, too, and it smells incredible on him, always earning him countless compliments.” — Jacqueline kilikita, Beauty Director Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer with TFC8®, $65 “On days when my skin looks a little lackluster but I don’t have the patience for makeup, I reach for the Golden version of this moisturizer. Skincare genius Augustinus Bader is the mastermind behind the star ingredient, TFC8, which is made up of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins, which repair and strengthen skin damaged by things like sun exposure and pollution. That explains why my skin looks so much smoother and more radiant when I use it consistently. I love that it lends a subtle glint and it warms up my light olive skin in a way that looks natural, not obviously bronzed. So much so, I just pop on a little brow gel, curl my lashes and go. I can’t get over the luxe packaging, either.” — Jacqueline kilikita, Beauty Director Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/igk-antisocial-dry-hair-mask-review-49296456",
    "description": "When it comes to beauty routines, I give the most attention to my hair. My hair type is fine and frizzy, and ever since I got highlights, it's been a bit of a dry, tangled mess. In an effort to get it back to where it was prior to being color treated (soft and impossibly shiny), I've been testing out different shampoo and conditioner combinations. I'm in the process of swapping my apartment's shower head to something filtered, and I also rotate through different hair masks weekly. When I heard about the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask ($36), I was confused. A dry hair mask? The only masks I had ever tried before were . . . well, wet, and they needed to be washed out after application. This one said it didn't need a rinse, and the before-and-after photos looked great, but I was skeptical and thought the whole thing sounded too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it wasn't. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the IGK Leave-In Dry Hair Mask and find out why I can no longer live without it. About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask This product is a dry overnight hair treatment mask, so you don't need to wash or restyle your hair after use. It's safe for all hair types, as well as color and chemically treated hair. It's made with bond-building technology to repair hair, as well as vegan silk proteins to soften and smooth hair. It comes in a 5oz bottle as well as a 1.7oz travel size. It's free of sulfates, parabens, and phthalates. It's vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free. The packaging is also recyclable. What I Like About the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The first time I tested it out, I had no idea what to expect. I had never tried a \"dry\" hair mask before, so I wasn't sure if it would work or if I would notice a difference. I followed the instructions exactly and applied it on dry hair right before bed. I'm used to waking up with tons of tangles and knots (even when I sleep on a silk pillowcase), but I woke up the next morning with hair that felt soft, silky, and smooth to the touch. Since then, I've been using it twice a week in between washes. I have a lot of frizz, especially at my roots, and whenever I use this product, I notice fewer flyaways and more shine. It doesn't weigh my hair down, and if I weren't physically watching myself spraying it onto my hair (and then seeing the results later), I wouldn't believe there was any product on my hair at all. Although I have a few masks I typically keep in heavy rotation, I have to wash them out, and I can't go about my day when wearing them unless I opt for a slicked-back bun. This product makes doing a hair mask so much easier and more convenient because I don't have to wash it out; it makes my hair more manageable with just a few sprays, and it also smells amazing. How to Use the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask The brand recommends shaking the can and then applying the product to dry hair in sections before going to bed. They suggest spraying as evenly as possible while holding the can 10 to 12 inches away from your hair. Then, brush everything through. When you wake up in the morning, comb through your hair again - but no need to wash it. I use this mask in two ways. I either follow those directions exactly - using it before bed - or I spray it on my hair during the day, when it's looking a little dry and is in obvious need of some TLC. I've found that when I section my hair out prior to application, I get the best results. But occasionally, if I'm in a rush or feeling lazy, I spritz it all over my hair while it's down and brush it through, then continue on with my day, and I genuinely notice a difference just minutes after applying. What to Consider Before Trying the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this product; it's become a staple in my weekly routine. It even comes in a travel size - which I need to purchase ASAP - so you can make sure you bring soft and silky hair with you wherever you go. Where the IGK Antisocial Leave-In Dry Hair Mask Is Available The IGK Antisocial Bond-Building Leave-In Dry Hair Mask is available directly on IGK as well as Sephora, Ulta, and Amazon. Rating:",
