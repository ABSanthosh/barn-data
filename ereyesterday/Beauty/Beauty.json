If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Do you remember what you were doing on December 6, 2022? I do. I was frantically filling my virtual shopping cart with The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation following the brand’s announcement that it would discontinue the product a few months later. The Serum Foundation may have disappeared, but it left a lasting legacy: Makeup artists, beauty enthusiasts, and TikTok content creators have mourned its discontinuation as recently as last month, and there are even entire Reddit threads dedicated to finding a replacement for it. That’s why I’m pleased — actually, beyond excited — to announce that on February 21, the Serum Foundation will return. Why was The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation discontinued? While the Serum Foundation amassed a 25,000-strong waiting list when it launched in 2017, it was shelved just a few years later. In a social media post from 2022, The Ordinary explained that although it had set the price at an accessible level, this approach wasn’t sustainable in the long run, especially because sales weren’t high enough. But you never miss a good thing until it’s gone, and ever since then, fans of Serum Foundation have flooded The Ordinary’s Instagram posts demanding its swift return.  Is The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation returning for good? Like all good things, though, there is a catch. While the brand has been working hard to bring back all 36 shades, this will be a limited release. For now, the brand has no plans to make the foundation a permanent fixture — but that could change. When asked on Instagram whether the foundation would be brown girl friendly, The Ordinary responded by highlighting their 36 original shades and said that if the product was well-received, it would work with its lab to expand the range further. Is The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation any good? Happily for diehard fans, the formula is the same — and it’s just as affordable. At just $7.50, Serum Foundation is a snip of the price of most foundations on the market, and if you ask me, it’s even on par with some high-end offerings thanks to its ability to provide impressive coverage and substantial hydration — all without the heavy, mask-like feel of other foundations. That’s all down to the clever formulation. Unlike The Ordinary’s extensive skincare dynasty, there are no hi-tech ingredients. Rather, Serum Foundation consists of a water and silicone base and makeup pigments. Once applied, both the water and silicones evaporate from the skin, leaving behind a delicate veil of coverage that doesn’t budge until you see fit to remove it.  Shades 2.0N and 2.0P were staples in my makeup routine depending on the season, and until it disappeared from the shelves, it was a foundation that I recommended to friends, family, and R29 readers who were after a light to medium coverage with a featherlight feel. Let’s be honest: Serum Foundation walked so that skin tints could run. Is The Ordinary bringing back its concealer? At this point, The Ordinary isn’t resurrecting its concealer, which was also part of the Colours makeup range. The Serum Foundation will exist alone until it sells out.  Where can I buy The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation? While The Ordinary is stocked by retailers including Sephora and Ulta, the Serum Foundation will only be available through the brand’s official website and four freestanding stores from February 21: Distillery Lane in Toronto, 5th Avenue in New York City, Commercial Street in London, and Gertrude Street in Melbourne. Like all products The Ordinary launches, I predict a sell-out — and I’ll be first in line to stock up. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-lip-shape-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In some ways, lip pencils are the new lip oil — in other words, they’re everywhere right now — and one need only look to your nearest group chat where girlies are dropping the lip combos left, right, and center. And while it seems every brand has its version of a humble lip pencil, if one brand can manage to break through the crowded landscape, it’s Rhode.  The Hailey Bieber-founded brand was founded with a core system of skincare products, but has gradually branched into makeup in their own unique, Rhode way with the arrival of Peptide Lip Tint (tinted versions of the brand’s bestselling Peptide Lip Treatment) as well as Pocket Blush, a creamy stick blush that picked up a 2024 MVP Award from yours truly. Point is, I for one have yet to try a product from the brand that I didn’t genuinely love, and as such, the team and I had lofty expectations for Peptide Lip Shape. Peptide Lip Shape delivers soft-focus pigment in a creamy, hydrating formula with a satiny matte finish. It comes in 10 shades ranging from baby pink to caramel beige to chocolate brown. And as the name suggests, peptides are a hero ingredient and work wonders to help hydrate and soften lips – which many of us can certainly appreciate during this arid time of year. Secondly, there’s fenugreek extract, derived from leafy sprouts of the same name, which has a natural lip-plumping effect sans tingling or burning. You can shop Peptide Lip Shape for $24 each, or create a quartet of your four favorite shades for $92. Below, keep reading for our beauty editors’ unfiltered thoughts on the buzzy new drop. DashDividers_1_500x100 Rhode Peptide Lip Shape, $24 DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Press, Lunge, Balance, Twist  Review: Fans of Rhode and Hailey Bieber have been eagerly anticipating this launch ever since Hailey teased a version of it on Instagram over a year ago. It’s the product most closely associated with her—second only to her beloved Peptide Lip Tint. So when she finally introduced Peptide Lip Shape, a lip liner-meets-lipstick hybrid, expectations were sky-high—including mine. And it did not disappoint. Peptide Lip Shape checks every box for the perfect lip liner: pigmented, creamy, and hydrating. It glides effortlessly across my typically dry lips, blending seamlessly to create an effortless, natural-looking pout—the kind that makes you wonder, Is that her real lip color? While I appreciate the silicone smudger tip on the other end, I find it easier to just use my finger for blending. As for shades, I’m partial to Press and Lunge since I love mauves and rose tones, but Balance and Twist deliver that quintessential ‘90s mocha mousse lip that I can’t resist. Top it with your favorite lip gloss and prepare for the compliments to roll in.” — Sara Tan, Global Beauty Director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Lunge, balance, twist, lean Review: Hailey’s love of another viral lip pencil (Make Up For Ever’s Artist Color Pencil in Anywhere Caffeine and Wherever Walnut) is well documented, but Rhode’s version is no copycat; unlike a traditional liner formula, Peptide Lip Shape is creamy and glides on like a crayon, with a blurred, diffused finish. It’s not super opaque, and that’s the point. I tried a variety of brownish-nude shades that suited my olive skin tone, ranging from slightly rosy to mocha. The finish is truly a “my lips but better” effect, and feels very Rhode – effortlessly chic and natural. The product itself is soft enough that I honestly could take or leave the silicone smudger end; it’s meant to blend and blur the product onto lips but I found that it ended up rubbing some of it off instead. I love wearing it alone or layered under a glossy lip balm (which Rhode also has mastered, clever them!) for extra shine.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Lunge, Press  Review: I’ve tried hundreds of lip liners as a beauty director but I’ve never been more excited to try Peptide Lip Shape. Perhaps it’s the clever marketing, or that Hailey has an incredible Cupid’s bow. Either way, I got my hands on them fast. I reached straight for Bend, which Rhode describes as a “soft peachy beige”, but as soon as I opened the lid, the stick of liner fell out. I had the same issue with Refy’s Blur Liner, which boasts similar plastic packaging. Thankfully, this wasn’t an issue with Press and Lunge, which I’m wearing here. The texture is silky smooth and glided over my dry lips with ease. Because it’s so creamy, though, the staying power isn’t as great as I’d hoped, but it’s very easy to apply. So much so I rarely enlist a mirror when I’m topping up on the go! While I appreciate the addition of a smudger on the end, I found that it just removed the product from my lips. Fingers are a much better tool for achieving that blurred lip effect. Seeing as the formula is so moisturising, it has earned a place in my makeup bag for winter, but during spring and summer, when I want my lip liner to last — like really last — I’ll go back to Glossier’s Lip Line Enhancing Pen.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Press, Lean “Lip Shape has turned me into a Rhode convert. I’m a relative latecomer when it comes to the brand — I’ve found the social media hype quite intense at times — but after testing out this new launch, in the shades Press and Lean, I can see why the brand nabbed home a R29 Beauty Innovator Award last year. I’m normally quite intimidated by lip liners, as I find the art of overlining difficult to master. Lip Shape’s creamy formula and wide, rounded tip make it oh-so-easy, though. There’s zero dragging or skipping; just silky-smooth application that makes outlining your lips feel like applying a layer of lip balm. The skin-conditioning ingredients, namely peptides and fenugreek extract, keeps my lips supple and firm all day without creating any dry lines (although it’s worth noting that some people with nut allergies can react to fenugreek, just FYI). The brand recommends using the silicone tip to blend inwards for a more natural, diffused effect, but I personally found that easier to achieve with my finger tips. What really had me hooked was its staying power: my lip liner stayed put throughout my lunch break and coffee run, and five-course dinner, with little need to reapply. I’ve been gravitating towards Lean, a medium brown, with a thin layer of the Rhode Peptide Lip Tint in Espresso for a ‘90s-inspired look. I also love Press, which gives my lips a head-turning rosy glow.” – Venus Wong, Senior Writer DashDividers_1_500x100 Shade(s) tested: Stretch, Spin, Flex, and Move “I’ve been experiencing a bit of beauty burnout lately, finding excitement in only a handful of launches. However, something about Rhode’s Peptide Lip Shape particularly intrigued me. “Each shade is incredibly pigmented, creamy and effortlessly glides along the natural lip line. I’ve found that many beauty products often look completely different from how they appear on a brand’s website or even on the packaging, but this range looks exactly the same IRL. As for the silicone smudger, I was initially certain I’d barely use it, but it has been a dream for tidying up unruly smudges. It won’t completely replace blending with my fingertips, but for on-the-go application, it’s exactly what I need. I found each shade to be long-lasting, with a good few hours of wear. “As a Black woman, finding a good variety of brown lip liners isn’t as easy as people think. Often, you have to resort to an eyeliner to get a brown that actually shows up on your lips or doesn’t look ashy. It’s great to see Rhode paving the way for inclusive and fun lip liner shades. I’ve become particularly obsessed with Stretch (a neutral mocha brown), Spin (a rich plum brown) and Flex (a rich neutral brown), as they complement my lips beautifully. Each one is a distinct shade of brown and looks effortlessly cool. Move (a deep cool brown) was the only shade I didn’t particularly warm to as it was just a bit darker than I prefer, but it’s still nice to have variety.” — Vanese Maddix, Freelance Writer Like what you see?

    "title": "5 Little-Known Tips For Eczema That Actually Work, According to Derms",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/eczema-hacks-49428472",
    "description": "Does eczema have your skin feeling itchy and looking red and scaly no matter what you try, making you wonder if there will ever be relief ahead? Don't worry, you're not alone – according to the National Eczema Association, nearly 32 million Americans (more than 10 percent of all people in the United States) have some form of eczema. Eczema, aka atopic dermatitis, is a \"chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, scaly, and itchy skin due to an impaired skin barrier,\" says board-certified dermatologist Supriya Rastogi, MD. But what causes eczema in the first place? Though everyone has different triggers, factors like dry, cold weather, emotional or physical stress, or environmental allergens and irritants can cause eczema flare-ups, says double board-certified dermatologist Karan Lal, DO, MS. It can also develop from a genetic predisposition, Dr. Rastogi adds. To help you learn how to effectively treat your eczema when you feel like you've already tried it all, we chatted with both of these dermatologists to get their best out-of-the-box tricks and tips. Ahead, find five hacks that'll actually help your eczema, as recommended by dermatologists. Experts Featured in This Article Karan Lal, DO, MS, is a double board-certified adult, pediatric, and cosmetic dermatologist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Supriya Rastogi, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group - Park Ave in New York City. 1. Diluted Bleach Baths If you've been trying to treat your eczema with topical products to no avail, it may be time to get in the bath. More specifically, get in a diluted bleach bath (yes, you read that correctly – bleach can help). It can help suppress bacteria on the skin that can contribute to flare-ups and inflammation, and it's also cost-effective, says Dr. Rastogi. \"To prepare, add ¼ cup of household bleach to a half-full bathtub (or ½ cup for a full tub) and soak for 10 minutes,\" she says. She recommends doing this two to three times a week. 2. Layering Products Effectively \u0026 Strategically Turns out, there is a right way and a wrong way to layer your skin-care products, including your prescriptions. If you use eczema medication such as a topical steroid, apply the medication first and follow with a moisturizer, says Dr. Lal. Wait five to 10 minutes before adding the moisturizer to help increase effectiveness, adds Dr. Rastogi. If you don't use any topical eczema medications, simply make sure you're strategically layering skin-care products. For eczema, Dr. Rastogi recommends the popular TikTok trend of slugging. \"Apply a fast-absorbing humectant like hyaluronic acid serum first, followed by a rich ceramide cream, and then seal with an occlusive such as petrolatum to enhance hydration retention,\" she says. 3. Wet Wraps Maximum moisturization is key to any successful eczema treatment. Both Dr. Lal and Dr. Rastogi recommend this wet wrap method for an extra boost of moisturization: Apply a thick layer of moisturizer (an occlusive can work well), and then place damp soft cotton or gauze (or socks or gloves if your hands and feet are affected) at night. \"The water and moist environment will help lock in moisture,\" says Dr. Lal. It's especially effective for severe dryness or scaling as it can also enhance absorption, reduce inflammation, and soothe itching, Dr. Rastogi adds. 4. Hydrotherapy Continuing the aquatic theme, this hydrotherapy technique helps \"increase product absorption, enhance the skin barrier, and maximize hydration,\" says Dr. Rastogi. Rather than moisturizing followed by wet cloth as you would with wet wraps, you can try flipping the order: \"For example, for hand eczema, soak hands in lukewarm water for five to 10 minutes, then apply a thick moisturizer,\" Dr. Rastogi advises. 5. Consciously Clean Hands Though it can be tempting to constantly wash your hands (especially during flu season), if you have eczema on your hands, take note of what you're using to wash. Overusing hand soaps or hand sanitizers can dry out the skin and exacerbate flare-ups. Instead, \"use a gentle face cleanser in place of soap to wash your hands,\" Dr. Lal says. \"You should only use soap if your hands are visibly soiled.\" Catharine Malzahn is a beauty writer and editor with nearly half a decade of experience covering everything from skin care and makeup to spas and injectables.",

    "description": "There's a little dance I've learned to master with my eczema-prone skin after spending most of my adolescence with thick, scaly, and red patches atop my knee and on many of the other bendy parts of my body. And that dance has mostly involved my keeping my skin moisturized day in and day out with creams rather than lotions, as well as avoiding the heavily fragranced body-care products that were crucial to my generation's Victoria's Secret body lotion craze. Still, I've got lingering itchy patches along my forearms and ankles, so I thought it'd be the perfect time to put the very viral \"body slugging\" trend to the test. Basically, the trend consists of reinforcing that do-good layer of moisture with a slab of petroleum-based jelly. After all, the internet has deemed slugging a skin-care, body-care, and even hair-care hack - so why not try it as an eczema fix? Experts Featured in This Article Kseniya Kobets, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care Westchester in NY. Board-certified dermatologist Kseniya Kobets, MD, says that \"slugging creates an extra occlusive layer of protection with Vaseline or petroleum jelly to prevent that transepidermal water loss temporarily and provides a barrier [for the skin] from the outside world - to allergens, irritants, as well as pathogens.\" In more understandable terms, transepidermal water loss happens because of barrier dysfunction, when skin can no longer protect itself as it should and becomes dehydrated rather quickly when compared to those who don't have atopic dermatitis, according to Dr. Kobets. That extra Vaseline layer is supposed to help lock in moisture and protect the skin. So, for the past week, I've been drenching my eczema patches in a thick moisturizer followed by a glean of Vaseline. My shiny legs have got nowhere to go this winter, but aside from the glistening effect body slugging has given my skin, was it actually effective? I tried it out for a week to give you the scoop. Here are a few things I learned while testing the trend. First things first: I usually don't wait more than five minutes after stepping out of the shower to moisturize my skin every day, and that held especially true throughout this experiment. As I've gotten control over my eczema throughout the years, I've found that the best method to retain as much moisture as possible post-shower is to moisturize my entire body in cream while my skin is still slightly damp. And friends, if you're still in search of a body cream that doesn't exacerbate your eczema or feel that the one you're currently relying on isn't doing much, I suggest always looking for a body cream with the National Eczema Association stamp of approval for starters. For this experiment, I alternated between Loto del Sur's Mimosa \u0026 Tangerina's Moisturizing Cream and Lendava's Body Care ($62) right after the shower and then coated those itchy and sensitive areas in a slick of the Vaseline Healing Jelly ($6) morning and night. Slugging my skin in Vaseline after a deep moisturizing session has helped fade the scabs and cracks on the eczema patches that I started the week with, but I noticed something else: it also made the area increasingly itchy right after every slugging session and didn't provide long-lasting relief. I asked Dr. Kobets on our phone call: \"Am I crazy for feeling like body slugging is making me even itchier?\" Dr. Kobets confirms that while slugging Vaseline is great for an immediate soothing effect and helps keep the hydration in, \"it's missing an essential component for long-term treatment of eczema and preventing eczema flares: humectants.\" Humectants, she explains, are ingredients \"that hold onto water in the skin, such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides, which are [ingredients] essential for the skin barrier.\" To make the most out of body-slugging eczema-prone skin, Dr. Kobets recommends applying a body-care product that has one or some of the above ingredients and then adding that extra layer of Vaseline to lock in the moisture. Plus, it doesn't help to fall asleep with slugged skin in a hot room; not the best combo. All in all, if I slug my skin moving forward, it will be to soothe irritated eczema patches that have become scaly along the way. And my choice of product, instead of plain petroleum jelly, will be an ointment with some type of humectant or ceramide, such as Honest's Head-to-Toe Healing Ointment ($10) or ClarityRX Healing Fine Barrier Ointment ($42), which has both Vitamin E and A. True to the hype, body slugging my eczema–prone skin this past week has helped to soothe dryness and dissolve my cracked and sad little scaly patches. But I'm hoping that by upping my product game, I'll be able to truly rely on this viral hack for long-lasting eczema relief.
