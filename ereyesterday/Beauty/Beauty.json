If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. There are so many beauty brands these days that it’s hard to keep track. The sentiment is echoed by makeup artist, entrepreneur, and industry legend Bobbi Brown, whose second act beauty brand, Jones Road, was founded on the belief that the world needs fewer but better beauty products — not just more items to fill shelves. Enter a tightly edited range of chic, uncomplicated products that don’t require you to be a makeup master like Brown herself. The mogul first made waves in the early ’90s with her eponymous cosmetics line, which “revolutionized the beauty industry by glamorizing natural tones in makeup,” according to the entrepreneur. After stepping away from that brand in 2016, she launched Jones Road with the same less-is-more ethos, updated for the 2020s. Another core tenet of Jones Road is its extensive no-no list of ingredients that will never be found in products. (These include, but are not limited to: phthalates, sulfates, petrolatum, PEGs, cyclic silicones, EDTA, or BPA.) As a lifelong beauty lover, I was intrigued by the prospect of low-key but high-quality makeup. I embarked on a journey to test several of Jones Road’s most popular products to see if they were worth the hype. Keep reading for my honest take on nine bestsellers ranging from the Miracle Balm to its shimmery Just A Sec cream eyeshadow. DashDividers_1_500x100 Miracle Balm, $40 My favorite product from my Jones Road test-o-rama is unquestionably the Miracle Balm. I now own several shades ranging from  Tawny ( a warm, bronze terracotta) to Pinky Bronze, a previously limited-edition shade that was added to the permanent lineup last year. The pigmentation is very sheer but can be built up if desired. I’m a big fan of multipurpose lip and cheek cream tints since they give the prettiest, natural-looking flush. I’ve been using this non-stop, and it earned full MVP status during a recent ski trip in Sun Valley. When I’m in the mountains, my normally oily skin becomes insanely dry and flaky. The balm’s emollient and gentle texture is perfect for adding much-needed moisture to my cheeks, which typically get the driest. It’s also great for adding a barely-there tint to chapped lips and prepping them for lipstick while I do the rest of my makeup. The balm needs to be warmed up before applying, which is perfect for people like me who love applying makeup with (clean!) fingers. At $40, it’s among the more expensive items in the Jones Road range, but the amount of product more than makes up for it. The packaging is about the size of a petri dish — a lot for a balm! I don’t see myself finishing it anytime soon. Fragrance – Shower, $46 Jones Road’s first (and for now, only) fragrance is the equivalent of the perfect white T-shirt. It’s light, airy and features citrusy notes of neroli and orange blossom, with a hint of fresh sea spray. I don’t normally care for aquatic scents, but this one is balanced with subtle floral undertones, too. The result is a clean, just-showered skin scent that’s never overpowering, just delightfully crisp. The price point is smart, too; $46 for a full-size bottle (or $18 for a rollerball) makes it an affordable everyday luxury. What The Foundation, $46 This product went viral a couple of years ago, partially thanks to influencer Meredith Duxbury’s TikTok video, where she applied a concerningly large amount to her face (shudders). However, when applied properly, it’s actually really nice, providing a dewy, luminous finish that looks like real skin. While I generally liked it, I think there are better options for my skin type (I’m 31 with very few lines and wrinkles). Although WRF isn’t heavy by any means, it was creamier than what I typically prefer. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though — I could it being amazing for dry or mature skin due to its hydrating properties. For me, it won’t replace my everyday foundation. Also worth noting: The generously sized jar could easily last for months.  Gel Liner, $32 My go-to gel liner for years was Bobbi Brown’s, but she’s officially dethroned, well, herself with Jones Road’s version. It’s creamy, insanely pigmented, and lasts all day. Gel liner can seem intimidating, but this product makes it easy with the matching brush, whose small, precise bristles get close to the lash line while still allowing easy blending. I have it in both black and violet, and it’s also available in brown and navy. In the world of gel liners, this is the new one to beat.  Eye Cream, $36 I don’t wear eye cream every day, but Jones Road’s just might become my new go-to. Often, eye creams can be too buttery and rich, but this one is light with a whipped, gel-like texture. It works well even without under-eye concealer, instantly hydrating and brightening my eye area without slipping under makeup. Just A Sec Eyeshadow, $28 This eyeshadow is capital P pretty and quickly became one of my favorites. I tried the shade Golden Peach _ a shimmery, warm, light gold. The texture is cushiony and soft, making it really easy to apply and blend. Although it comes in a tiny pot, you don’t need much to achieve an impressive payoff. I even used it to add a subtle highlight to my cheekbones. I like to think Bobbi would be proud of the artistry. The Best Eyeshadow, $26 My first thought: This stuff is seriously pigmented. I tried the matte shade Dark Brown, an espresso hue. (There are also plenty of neutral mattes and shimmer shades available.) For a more natural effect, you can use it alone to define the lash line or layer it over eyeliner for extra impact. For a recent dinner date, I created a smoky eye with Bobbi Brown’s Ultra Fine Eye Liner Brush (which is amazing for detail), starting at the lash line and carefully blending upward to avoid a muddy result. You can add lighter shadows on the lid and inner corner for extra dimension, but I loved how the Jones Road shadow delivered an effortless, one-and-done feel all on its own. Though the product is minimal, its pigmentation ensures you won’t run out anytime soon — a good problem to have! The Best Pencil, $24 Eyeliner is one of my favorite products to use, whether I’m doing a cat-eye, tight-lining my upper waterline for a smudged, smoky effect, or adding a pop of color with a bright blue or bright white. A black pencil is a staple, so I wanted to see how Jones Road’s stacked up. It’s challenging — borderline impossible — to achieve an intense, inky black with a “clean” product due to the absence of carbon pigments typically found in conventional black eyeliners. Thus, I wasn’t surprised that Jones Road’s pencil came out as soft black. Using small strokes, I lined the outer corner of my eyes and blended it out to create the littlest wing. (I almost never line my entire lash line since it can make my eyes look smaller.) For subtle definition, this pencil gets the job done, and I appreciate that it’s a clean formula safe for the delicate eye area. However, if you’re after a dramatic, long-wear, or waterproof formula, this might not be the best choice. Cool Gloss, $24 This quickly became another favorite, especially as someone who came of age in the 2000s — aka *the* era of glossy lips. The squeezy tube reminds me of the many glosses I toted around in my Dooney \u0026 Bourke purse back in middle school. But unlike the sticky, mirror-like pouts of the aughts, Jones Road’s take is soft and comfortable to wear. It has a tingly, minty sensation that I love, and the clear shade works perfectly as a shiny topcoat, whether worn alone or over another lip color. The tinted shades range from shimmery beige to juicy pink, ensuring there’s something for everyone. DashDividers_1_500x100 Final Thoughts After using Jones Road products for a few years now, I’m still as impressed as when I first discovered the brand. The products are easy to use and deliver an effortless level of glam. While there isn’t a bad product in the bunch, the brand, in general, is a bit expensive. I was kindly gifted products to review, but I can confidently say that I’d gladly spend money on my top faves — namely, the  Miracle Balm and the gel liner. I may have missed out on Bobbi Brown the first time around, but I’m definitely a Jones Road girl through and through. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

While I had been reaching for more milky tones through the winter months, now that sunnier days are here, I want something a bit brighter. Essie's Sugar Daddy ticks all the boxes. While it's sheer, the tone is a bright pink, which adds a pretty brightness to my nails after a couple of coats. It's like a sheer liquid blush for your hands.” — Eleanor Vousden, beauty editor, Who What Wear UKEssie Nail Polish in Sugar Daddy, $, available at UltaManucurist Active Glow in Raspberry“Please don’t take away my beauty editor card, but something about — gulp — bare nails feels particularly fresh right now. That’s not to say I’ve been going polish-free: I’ve been swiping on Manicurist Active Glow, a pearly shade that imparts the perfect amount of natural-looking sheen. Thanks to its reparative and antioxidant ingredients, I swear my nails are stronger after wearing it.” — Dianna Singh, features director, AllureManicurist Active Glow in Raspberry, $, available at AnthropologieOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing“My favorite nail polish color for spring is undoubtedly milky lavender. It’s a bit of a contrast to my go-to pillarbox red, but I love how fresh and clean this color looks on nails — especially short ones like mine. Typically, I don’t gravitate towards really minimalist, clean-girl manicures, but this lilac purple means that I still get to enjoy a wash of color. The grow-out is so much less obvious compared to something more bold.” — Mica Ricketts, freelance beauty journalistOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing, $, available at UltaNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha“I love everything matcha-related, so I was already sold when I spotted the name of this shade from Nailberry. Once on, the creamy khaki green actually reminds me more of a perfectly manicured greenhouse, thriving with plant life in the spring. The low saturation means that it looks lovely with the neutrals and denim in my wardrobe, but I also love how it imparts a jade-green luster to my fingertips under the sun. Nailberry’s nail polish line gets a lot of love from me; so much pigment comes from just one coat, and the moisture-permeable formula is gentle on the nails.” — Venus Wong, Refinery29 senior writerNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha, $, available at AmazonDior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma“I absolutely love Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma. It’s a beautiful russet red that looks just as gorgeous on my fingernails as it does on my toes. What makes it even better is how versatile it is. It pairs perfectly with any outfit, no matter the color. There’s something about the shade that has a retro ‘70s vibe to it, and it’s hands down my most complimented nail color. In fact, Dior nail polish is criminally underrated. It’s exceptionally durable and lasts for weeks on my toes, which means it’s worth the higher price tag. Even better, the brush is flatter than most and ever so slightly rounded, which makes light work of DIY manicures. I never make mistakes when I use this; it’s foolproof.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director, Refinery29Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma, $, available at DiorOlive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan“I love all pastel polishes, but if I had to choose one color to wear for spring, it would be this one. Corrigan is the prettiest pistachio green and is fully opaque in two coats. A lot of pale green polishes tend to skew more minty or blue-toned, but this one is unique with its warmer undertones. I’m a big fan of Olive \u0026 June’s longwear and chip-resistant polishes, and I swear by the mani system’s prep and gel-like top coat for salon-quality nails at home. To me, this pale green is a spring neutral; fresh, unique, and subtly seasonal.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Olive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan, $, available at Olive \u0026 JuneORLY Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues“ORLY has released a fleet of ‘70s-inspired nail varnishes to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and Bell Bottom Blues is my absolute favorite from the collection. Thanks to a shimmery, green undertone, the icy blue hue has a crystal-like sparkle that makes it mesmerizing to watch under the sunlight. I’ve been impressed by how well my ORLY nail colors have held up, especially when layered with the Bonder Rubberized Base Coat, which helps the color firmly grip onto my nails. I’ll be reaching for this color time and again to pair with my favorite white and blue linen shirts this spring.” — Venus Wong, senior writer, Refinery29 Orly Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues, $, available at OrlyOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!“I’m a nude-toned loyalist. A sheer layer of milky pink is forever my go-to, thanks to its ability to make me feel that bit more put-together. Imagine my horror, then, when I left the nail salon after settling on the wrong shade. Thanks to some very misleading salon lighting, the manicure I thought was a barely-there rose turned out to be a very-much-there shade of pink. And yet, the compliments have come rolling in. The shade responsible? The aptly named OPI It’s A Girl!, which has taught me that change can actually be a good thing. It’s a pretty, sugary pink polish that feels more playful than my usual, sensible nails. Will I be swapping out my beloved neutrals for candy-floss hues from now on? Unlikely. But if there was ever a time to flirt with a new shade (accidentally or not), then spring is the perfect excuse.” — Rachael Martin, beauty editor, Grazia UKOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!, $, available at UltaEssie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment“My lineup of spring nail polish shades often changes, but a recent contender that has secured a top spot is Essie’s To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment. The shade has a natural, barely-there pink hue that looks great on all nails. But it’s far more than a pretty color: it can improve visible signs of UV gel damage in just five days, thanks to a formula that contains a strengthening 3-protein complex, methylsulfonylmethane aka MSM [said to promote nail growth], and ceramides. As someone trying to restore my nails to a healthier state while still wanting a hint of color, this polish has been a game-changer. It also dries down quickly without the need for a top coat.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer, Refinery29Essie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment, $, available at UltaDazzle Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate“I have a serious color crush on pastel blue (in fact, I’m known to wear it year round), and Checkmate is among my favorites. I’m a bit picky when it comes to baby blues; too pale, and it reads as a dull, powdery grey, and too vivid gets into sky blue territory. Checkmate is a true pastel blue with cool undertones that feel as fresh as the first spring day. It’s bright without being loud and feels airy and light. Plus, I love the Dazzle Dry system for quick, DIY manicures that dry to the touch in literally five minutes.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Dazzle Dry Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate, $, available at Dazzle DryLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose“Spring instantly makes me want to lean into pastels, and Lily Rose is the perfect baby pink hue that reminds me of cherry blossoms. While Le Mini Macaron is known for its easy at-home gel manicure kits, I'm equally impressed by the air-dry polishes. This formula is super long-lasting; mine remained chip-free for over a week. It also doubles as a treatment thanks to nail-fortifying biotin.” — Kristina Rodulfo, content creator and beauty editorLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose, $, available at Le Mini MacaronLike what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/f1-chloe-chong-beauty-interview-49436585",
    "description": "At just 17 years old, F1 Academy driver Chloe Chong has more drive than most people twice her age - literally and spiritually. Now, the precocious teen has her sights set on a championship, having already made a serious mark on motorsports in her first two seasons, and she's fueling her race for victory with a winning mindset and a bit of a boost from the beauty industry. Chong, who is from the U.K., is the latest racing prodigy to drive under beauty brand Charlotte Tilbury's sponsorship, and she's ready to use that role to not only speed her way towards an F1 Academy championship but to incite some major change in the sport. \"A lot of what I have done growing up in motorsports has been very tomboy-ish, you know? You get to hang out with the guys, and you kind of get forced into doing that because it's the social norm,\" she says. \"I've always talked about makeup with my friends, but I've never been one to go and give myself a makeover, and being able to be with Charlotte Tilbury and have them show me these different things and passions that I can have, it's been very eye-opening. After that makeover, I have been looking forward to every bit of beauty knowledge that I can get.\" Though Chong's beauty education is in its early stages, she has proven herself to be a quick learner, revealing that her own skin-care routine has undergone a dramatic transformation with a little help from Team Tilbury. \"One thing that I use every day is the Magic Cream ($100). There's something about it; it blends right into your skin,\" she says. \"Recently, I've also been using the Magic Hydrator Mist ($47) and the SPF 50 ($55) at the track. It's been really important for me, especially being in hot temperatures during testing, but also with the wear and tear that putting on a helmet several times a day does to your face.\" The talented race car driver is the first to admit that most people wouldn't mix makeup and motorsports, noting that her sport has long been seen as a male-dominated field, where beauty routines and skin-care regimens are oft-ignored. Until now. Despite conceding that she has never been a makeup aficionado, Chong has thrown herself into her new role as a \"Team Charlotte Tilbury\" driver with gusto, embracing all that it has to offer - from the financial backing that is keeping her racing career alive to the beauty tips that she has learned every time she's worked with the brand's beauty experts. \"It's still a dream to me, being in the office, being on set, and getting a feel for the whole beauty world,\" she says. \"I've never done this sort of thing before but it's always been in the back of my head, especially with my friends who are quite into makeup. I couldn't be prouder to be part of the brand and to be representing their car in F1 Academy.\" While beauty is a new passion, racing has been a part of Chong's life since she was three years old, when she first started watching Formula 1 races alongside her dad. \"By the time I was four or five, I was already begging my dad to let me have a go at it, to give me the chance to reach Formula 1,\" she says. \"He had to explain to me that it was a bit more of a process than just getting into a car and racing, but by the time I was six years old, he took me to a go kart track. He said, 'This is how you start off, let's see how good you are and see what we can do to make you move up from there.'\" Just nine years later, Chong made her debut in F1 Academy at age 15, becoming the youngest woman to ever race in the program. During her first two seasons, she says she focused on simply doing \"the best she could,\" but this year has marked a major change in her mindset - one that has prepped her to aim for the top of the podium. \"A very useful piece of advice that I got last year is that if you don't start the race expecting that you can win the race from that place, there's no point in you being there,\" she says. \"So my expectations have changed quite a lot this year, and with the team around me, I've put myself in a winning mindset. I'd honestly say for 2025, the aim is to compete for the championship and know that I can be there, that I do have the power and talent to win.\" As for the stereotypes that surround her sport, Chong refuses to pay them any mind, noting that she is determined to continue pushing to be the best - whether that's in F1 Academy or in Formula 1, which has yet to feature a female driver. \"For sure there's barriers facing women in Formula 1,\" she says. \"The stereotype of what motorsport is 'meant' to be in terms of a man's sport, a very physical sport… [But] what we've done to get to the places we've gotten to is to ignore all of those setbacks. We're all there to do the same job. When it gets down to it, if we're racing in Formula 1, we're going to have the exact same job to do [as the men], so there shouldn't be anything holding us back.\" Charlie Lankston is a freelance beauty, fashion, and lifestyle writer and media strategist based in New York City, having relocated to the US in 2014 from her home in London.

    "title": "\"Euphoria\" Makeup Artist Donni Davy Shares 10 Favorites From Her Kit",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/makeup-artist-donni-davy-favorite-products-49436608",
    "description": "The Expert Edit features interviews with specialists about the products they swear by in their chosen field. For the latest installment, we spoke to Emmy-winning celebrity makeup artist Donni Davy, the visionary behind \"Euphoria\"'s trendsetting beauty looks. From her must-have complexion products to the eye-catching pigments she reaches for on set and in everyday life, Davy shares the beauty staples she can't live without. The bold, shimmering makeup of \"Euphoria\" is just as iconic as the show itself. But for Donni Davy, the makeup artist behind HBO's hit series, creating viral-worthy makeup moments wasn't always part of her plan. \"I never thought I would be a makeup artist,\" she says. \"I was never really a makeup girly growing up. I was more of a shy art kid.\" Davy's artistic roots run deep - she studied photography at Pratt Institute, initially envisioning a career behind the camera. But after a conversation with a family friend, she realized makeup artistry could merge her love for painting, drawing, and storytelling. That revelation set her on a path that would change her life. Her breakthrough came when HBO tapped her for \"Euphoria\", drawn to the dreamy, avant-garde aesthetic she crafted for the 2018 film \"Under the Silver Lake.\" On set, Davy particularly loves working with Hunter Schafer, whose looks are often the most unpredictable. \"Sometimes, when you have that much freedom, you almost have no idea what to do,\" she says. But that creative challenge is what keeps her inspired. Davy's work has become legendary, earning her a second Emmy in 2022 for Outstanding Contemporary Makeup. As production for season three is officially underway, she continues to treat each character's look as an emotional extension of their journey, meticulously considering lighting, wardrobe, and script cues. \"Makeup communicates so much to the audience,\" she says. \"It's extra info; a storytelling tool.\" Beyond her work in television, Davy is making her mark in the beauty industry. In 2022, she co-founded Half Magic Beauty with A24, bringing a bold, boundary-pushing aesthetic to everyday beauty lovers. With her signature blend of art, emotion, and self-expression, Davy continues to redefine what makeup can be - one shimmering, rhinestone-studded look at a time. Here, Davy shares her must-have beauty picks, the essentials in her makeup bag, and the go-to products that help her power through the day.",
