    "description": "It’s not a lip oil (thank god), nor a gloss, nor a tint — my latest can’t-live-without-it lip product is none other than Violette_FR’s latest and greatest: A lip nectar.  As the juicy, succulent name suggests, Violette_FR (the same brand behind viral hits like Bisou Balm and Petal Bouche), designed Lip Nectar to hydrate and deliver a just-bitten stain of color. As Violette,  the founder and makeup artist behind the brand,  shares, the inspiration came from her constant search for a lip stain that felt grown-up and elevated. And because she was in the unique position to create her dream product, Lip Nectar was born. As someone who rarely wears lipstick (the effort!), this sounded right up my alley. It’s available in four shades inspired by nature, ranging from warm terracotta to petal pink. At first glance, Lip Nectar doesn’t look like the game-changer it is — it comes in a tube with a doe-foot applicator and has a texture that resembles liquid lipstick. But the genius lies in how the color develops once it hits your lips.  Violette_FR Lip Nectar, $29 My favorite shade is Rose de Moab, a desert-inspired rosy shade that’s giving “my-lips-but-better.” It applies as a pale iced latte, then deepens into a warm, caramelly nude. Another standout for me is Dahlia Noir, the deepest of the bunch. I usually steer clear of darker lip shades — they tend to look more severe than sexy — but this one is like Clinique Black Honey turned up a notch. It’s surprisingly wearable and one of those universal hues that looks incredible on everyone, with a plummy, cherry-like tone I ended up loving for date night. Thanks to squalane, shea butter, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid, Lip Nectar feels  as good as it looks. It’s not technically a plumper, but I found it replaced both my lip balm and gloss — the moisturizing formula naturally gives my lips a fuller look. Goals, amiright? Like many of her products, Violette has distilled her makeup artistry into something user-friendly and foolproof. Layer it over lip liner or top it with Lil Nectar for shine, and you’ve got a whole look. Nectar has never tasted so sweet. Like what you see?

    "description": "Megan Thee Stallion was on a mission as she scanned a room full of fans at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston: to find the best cosplaying hottie during the opening night of Dream Con. Dozens of attendees rushed to the front of the stage hoping that the costumes they spent hours—weeks and in some cases even months—putting together would catch her attention. The three-time Grammy-winning rapper hyped up a woman with an epic green wig who was dressed as Broly, a character from Dragon Ball Z. And she ran with open arms toward two other women dressed as characters from her favorite anime, My Hero Academia. Meg herself donned a purple wig and dressed as Yoruichi Shihouin from Bleach, one of the many times we’ve seen her cosplay. This time, she was greeted by thousands also in cosplay, cheering and chanting her name. “The hotties are making me feel so good! I feel right at home, babe,” she told host Storymode Bae after admitting she’d been nervous. And by “home,” she didn’t mean that solely because the convention and sold-out panel were in her hometown. After the fandom convention hosted by the popular streaming group RDCWorld announced Meg as the headliner, controversy followed. Social media users called out the organizers for engaging with posts in support of Tory Lanez. Some speculated that Meg would pull out of the convention altogether, even despite her tequila brand, Chicas Divertidas, being a sponsor. Others said the incident highlighted a broader issue: a hostile environment for Black women overall at Dream Con, where about 28,000 attendees were expected. Organizers issued an apology to the rapper on X: “We recognize that our actions contributed to a negative online environment, and we take full responsibility as we work toward fostering a more positive and respectful space.” Black women leading up to and at Friday’s panel held organizers’ feet to the fire and made sure that Meg felt celebrated and seen.  The misogynoir Meg faced isn’t unique. Black women and femmes in anime and gaming communities often face disrespect and criticism just for existing in the space. And like Meg, their balm for this hasn’t been to retreat from the hobbies they love, but rather to show up and show out. And they did just that at Dream Con 2025. Personifying their favorite heroes, villains, memes and more, Black women practiced boundless imagination and whimsical escapism. The convention also hosted numerous women-led panels. “I feel like being here is us contributing to a better culture so we can see other women that are like us like, ‘Hey girl, we see you, You don’t have to worry about the femcels and the incels and all those people who are trying to make you to be who you aren’t.’” said Bernette Fondong, a 28-year-old visiting from Atlanta. Fondong, who has been cosplaying for eight years, came dressed as Marvel’s Scarlet Witch. She attended with her friend Trisha Pilgrim, 28, from Maryland. As a nod to her queer identity, Pilgrim cosplayed as Emporio Ivankov, a gender-bending character in One Piece.  “I just really appreciate that Black women are creating that space and we’re coming out and we’re cosplaying and we’re just creating that space in spite of it all,” Pilgrim said. “We really know how to stand against adversity. I feel like we’re just making it a more accepting culture for women to feel more free in their cosplay and to show up and be here.” Even outside of the cosplay community, it’s long been considered taboo for Black people to lean into nerd culture. And though there’s been more visibility and acceptance in recent years, there are still few official spaces for Black nerds to gather en masse. For attendees experiencing their first anime convention, like Chantel Green, spaces like Dream Con attract a special energy. “My first animecon ends up being a Black anime con and it makes me really excited because Black nerds, we just weren’t seen,” said the 31-year-old from Detroit. She dressed as Persephone from Lore Olympus. “For me to come here, I feel truly blessed and I feel happy here.” Cosplay for Black women has also become an outlet for them to express their creativity with special makeup effects, stitching techniques and hairstyling. And it’s a steadily growing community. Alex Box, 28, was inspired to cosplay by her mother, a costume designer who worked on prom dresses and Princess Tiana gowns. The Houston native valued the bonding time she got to spend with her as she got guidance in making her Elphelt Valentine costume, which took four months to make.  Lanihya Duncan, a 27-year-old from Chicago who studied special effects makeup in college, got into cosplaying after her friend suggested it to her. Now at her second Dream Con, she took pride in her handmade Lulu from Final Fantasy costume, which took her two months to create. For Duncan, spaces like Dream Con allow Black weebs to not have to hide who they are. “Being Black, it can be hard for people to really show that because [of pressure to] fit in,” she said. “ But Dream Con is like no, you can be both. It’s amazing to embrace because Black cosplayers have that little umph that you can’t see. Who else is gonna be rocking braids, cornrows and afros with a Killua costume?” Gabrielle Kanu, a 35-year-old Houston native, said cosplaying feels “freeing.” Since 2016, she’s dressed as Sailor Moon, Storm and Sophie Hatter. This year, she’s Dorothy, giving a mix of The Wiz and The Wizard of Oz. “There’s no trying to codeswitch for anybody. We can be us all the time, every time. You can see the beauty and shapes of everybody around here. I’m a little plump and I’m glad I am and you see everyone else who’s glad of who they are,” she said “It’s kind of like being at an HBCU. It’s literally like a homecoming.” @_tarynitup Meg teased a new anime she’s making at #DreamCon ♬ original sound – Taryn Finley During Friday’s event, Meg also announced that she’s making an anime with Prime Video. Though she didn’t go into the details, she revealed that she collaborated with Boondocks producer and voice actor Carl Jones to create it. This marks a major stride for Black women behind the scenes in anime and opens up the genre for newcomers to dip their toe in. While it’s not on Black women to fix the sexism, homophobia and transphobia they encounter in alternative spaces — or in any spaces for that matter — there’s an intrinsic power we possess in showing up as we are in these types of spaces. For Meg, the public has witnessed her do that time and time again. “My proudest achievement is staying strong through adversity. I feel like a lot of people in my shoes would have gave up,” she said during the Q\u0026A. “The Hotties have my back.” Like what you see?

    "description": "In a sea of beauty influencers, Jackie Aina stands out as truly one of a kind. Whether you're obsessed with all things makeup or not, you've probably come across her content at least once (unless, of course, you've been living under a rock). The California-born creator is widely known for her New York Fashion Week vlogs, makeup tutorials, and GRWMs layered with candid commentary. While Aina's skillset is undoubtedly one of the best in her field, her platform's success is set on this value: the power of speaking your mind unapologetically. From pushing for shade inclusivity in beauty to diving into the \"hard\" conversations, authenticity has always been at the core of her brand. That fearless approach has opened major doors, from collaborations with cosmetic giants like Anastasia Beverly Hills to starting a fragrance brand, Forvr Mood, with her husband, Denis Asamoah. The couple launched the brand in 2020, born out of Aina's deep love of scent - well documented in her YouTube videos - and her personal experience with hyperhidrosis growing up. \"What initially started as a way to mask the fact that I sweat abnormally turned into a confidence booster and a connection to how beautiful scent can make me feel,\" she says. Her most recent move? A partnership with Mielle Organics, which Aina calls \"an easy yes.\" She fronted the brand's Kalahari Melon and Aloe Vera collection that includes a shampoo, conditioner, gel, and oil; all delivering up to five days of hydration for textured hair. The 37-year-old has long been passionate about amplifying brands that prioritize the Black community, so the collab felt like a natural fit. \"Mielle doesn't just make products for textured hair - they honor it. As a brand, they've always put Black women first, not as an afterthought. . . the natural ingredients, the intention, the education; it's all there,\" she says. \"I'm also a long-time user of the products.\" Outside of championing diversity in beauty and keep \"creating content that the gworls love,\" Aina is wholeheartedly committed to fragrance for both body and home, which can be seen in her list of must-have products. Keep scrolling to find out Aina's favorite beauty items, including her signature scent and the Mielle gel behind her juicy wash-and-gos.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/alycia-parks-beauty-interview-49443406",
    "description": "Succeeding as a professional tennis player is no mean feat - but it's one that Alycia Parks already has well in hand. So much so that she's now balancing her Grand Slam dreams with one other major life goal: achieving the perfect face of makeup. Parks admits that her introduction to the world of beauty came \"a little late\" in life because she was banned from wearing makeup for much of her younger years, particularly while she was training. But from the first moment she laid her hands on an eyebrow pencil, she says it was love at first sight - and it's a passion that she's pursuing with aplomb, both on and off the court. \"[Beauty] was definitely a later in life thing for me, because I wasn't allowed to wear makeup when I was younger,\" she says. \"But I'm trying to become a makeup girlie and really learn how to do makeup. Now I do everything. From prepping the face to foundation, concealer, eyebrows, contour. Now, I'm [all about] full-on beauty.\" Parks's beauty journey has come a long way since she was a 19-year-old experimenting with eyeliner for the first time, leading her to another defining moment in her career: a major beauty campaign. The tennis pro has now joined the likes of pop star Jennifer Lopez and Olympic gold medalist Lydia Jacoby by becoming a spokesperson for Gillette Venus, a role that she says has been years in the making. \"I have always used the razors, so it was a fun surprise for me to start working with them,\" she says. Through her work with Venus, Parks is helping to amplify her own personal ethos about self-love and care, particularly when it comes to embracing the most important thing about beauty: how it makes you feel. \"Love yourself first and don't pay attention to what other people think or feel about you,\" she says of her own mindset when it comes to experimenting. \"It doesn't matter what other people think or so, because they can never be you.\" Indeed, far from being just a playful hobby, Parks' love of makeup has helped to serve up a major confidence boost on the court - but not because she wants to look a certain way to appease any naysayers. Instead, Parks says her love of beauty and her focus on her appearance are motivated by one thing: \"If you look good, you play good.\" \"I like to look a certain way on the court,\" she says. \"But I'm not really worried about other people judging me, I just do it for myself.\" Beauty also provides Parks with a fun distraction from the rigamarole of her intensive training schedule, which she readily concedes \"gets kind of boring.\" She is quick to list off the top products she has on-hand anytime she heads to a game or training session in order to ensure she looks and feels her best: Vaseline Lip Therapy ($4), Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 59 Delícia Drench Body Mist ($38), and her Venus MoistureGlide Razor ($18). But it's off the court where she likes to shake things up and experiment with her products and looks. \"I feel like you can do more off the court,\" she says. \"Especially when there are events away from tennis, where you can dress up. I like [going to those] because it means I can attempt to do my makeup again, it gives me a reason to do it.\" Charlie Lankston is a freelance beauty, fashion, and lifestyle writer and media strategist based in New York City, having relocated to the US in 2014 from her home in London.
