    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Rixo x Billie BhatiaGet ready to discover your new go-to summer dress in the Rixo x Billie Bhatia capsule collection. The British writer and Spill podcast co-host has brought her cool and vibrant sense of style to the print-forward fashion brand with a 16-piece line full of breezy dresses that will look just as at home at a vacation resort as they will running errands in your hometown. Think little black dresses with embroidered floral details, tiered maxi dresses with pretty frills, and long-sleeve halter-neck gowns in hand-painted prints inspired by Ibiza. “Creating a collection of pieces that I know every woman in my life would look and feel their absolute best in is more than I could have imagined,” Bhatia said in a press release. “This collection is sartorial serotonin, it is freeing and fun and created to enable good vibes only.” Shop now at RixoRixo x Billie Bhatia Alina Midi Dress, $, available at RixoPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available at PradaPrada Lip Balm Prada Frosting Care in Banana Yellow, $, available at PradaUniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available now at UniqloUniqlo x Studio Ghibli Sweatshirt | Kiki's Delivery Service, $, available at UniqloCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available now at Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil, $, available at Charlotte TilburyDior x Louis Hamilton Superstar Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has teamed up with heritage fashion house Dior for another capsule collection (their first debuted last fall), inspired by Afrofuturism. Pieces showcase tailored jackets (including a short silhouette inspired by the 1968 Miss Dior line), slouchy knitwear, and the sporty B44 Blade sneakers in new colorways. “I [was] inspired to imagine the future of Black culture. The way we tell stories through art, science and philosophy is really special. Seeing these ideas brought to life through color and movement inspired me,” he said in a press release. “For me, fashion has always been about self-expression and embracing all the different parts of yourself. Being authentic to your style and communicating yourself through clothing is such a powerful feeling.” Shop now at DiorDior x Lewis Hamilton Necklace, $, available at DiorCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaCecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPleats Please Issey Miyake to Launch Brand New DayIssey Miyake’s Pleats Please Brand has launched a new series called Brand New Day in collaboration with illustrator Hikaru Ichijo.

If you’re in NYC, you can also see an interactive installation that brings the Brand New Day illustrations to life from July 10 TO 24. Huda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula. Our favorites are Cinnamon, a rosy taupe shade, and Soft Nude for a \"your lips but better\" look. Available to shop now at Huda BeautyHuda Beauty Lip Contour Stain, $, available at Huda BeautyLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the (now sold out!) shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available at Levi'sDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x™ The Dyson Airwrap did to hair tools what TikTok did to the internet: it took over. The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonDyson Airwrap Co-anda2x, $, available at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes. Comprised of 18 apparel pieces, our favorite from the collection is the cream Firebird track jacket with burgundy piping and floral prints — a perfect layering piece for summer nights in the city.Available to shop July 15 at AsosLike what you see?

    "description": "Europa Press via Getty Images/Ricardo Rubio Jennifer Lopez kicked off her return to touring by embracing \"castlecore\" nails - a maximalist, medieval-inspired manicure trend that's been gaining traction all year. The look, created by her longtime nail artist Tom Bachik for the opening night of her summer European tour Up All Night: Live in 2025, debuted on July 8 in Pontevedra, Spain. A few days later, Bachik shared close-up photos of the design on Instagram, calling them \"Hot Girl Nails for a #HotGirlSummer\" and listing the exact tools, charms, polish brands, and gel shades used to bring the set to life. Image Source: Instagram user tombachik The ornate manicure features burgundy and champagne tones with 3D crosses, sacred heart charms, synthetic ruby gemstones, an interlocking \"C\" detail (likely a nod to Chanel), and a New York Yankees logo in tribute to Lopez's home borough of the Bronx. \"One last look,\" Bachik wrote in a follow-up Instagram story, teasing the style just before Lopez took the stage. The design aligns with the growing castlecore-nail trend, which was named one of the top aesthetic movements in the Pinterest Predicts 2025 report. Interest in \"medieval core\" has risen by 110 percent, with gothic-inspired beauty looks - including nail art - gaining momentum across platforms like Instagram and TikTok. \"Castlecore nails are a new nail aesthetic inspired by one of Pinterest's biggest trends for 2025,\" nail technician Lyssa Moss previously said. The style often includes \"gothic motifs, antique designs, and regal gemstones.\" Olivia Aguirre, lead nail artist at Côte Beauty, emphasized the romantic aesthetic of the trend. \"Think muted, dreamy shades reminiscent of stone walls, antique tapestries, and candlelit halls,\" she said. \"These nails often feature delicate detailing, such as soft shimmer, matte finishes, or even subtle gold accents.\" Lopez joins a growing list of celebrities putting their own spin on the trend. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙠 Nails (@tombachik) In May, Megan Fox wore a pink chrome set with cherub decals, designed by her longtime manicurist Brittney Boyce to celebrate the birth of her daughter. Cynthia Erivo has also been spotted in castlecore-inspired looks. From Instagram to center stage, castlecore nails are clearly having a moment, and Lopez's latest set makes a strong case for keeping them on your summer mood board.
