    "description": "Call it the Labubu-fication of beauty, but it seems like the most covetable bag charm might already be sitting at the bottom of your purse. Lip balms-turned-keychains are everywhere right now  — and show no signs of trending down. From clever add-ons that transform your favorite tube into an accessory to teeny-tiny charms made just for your go-to products, we’re collectively living quite the charmed life these days.  But it’s not just about squeezy tubes. Logo keychains — including the “bootleg” kind found on Amazon and Etsy — for brands like Bubble, Dior, and Glossier have become modern-day collectibles. Repping your favorite sports team or designer label? That’s cute. But we’ll take a plush Tatcha fob, thank you very much. With everyone from drugstore to prestige brands getting in on the beauty charm game, scroll on to see which ones R29 editors are adding to their purses, keychains, belt loops, and beyond. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Ordinary The Lip \u0026 Lash Set, $17 “When The Ordinary announced it was entering the lip category with the Squalane + Amino Acids Lip Balm, I was positively giddy. I knew whatever they launched would have that signature The Ordinary focus on ingredients and innovation. Sure enough, this has become one of my favorite balms — especially now that she lives on my keys! The texture is lighter than some of the others I use, which I actually prefer for daytime. (My husband also loves it.) It’s teeny enough to fit in the palm of my hand, and the little tear drop shape pops in a sea of squeezy tubes.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Bubble Tell All Lip Balm, $9 “This adorable pill-shaped balm is so cute I almost didn’t want to use it. It lives on my work backpack, so whether I’m at the office or a coffee shop, I know I’ve got a balm on hand. I’m partial to the mint flavor —  it’s refreshing and cooling, especially on a hot day. Unlike some of the other lippies in this bunch, it’s not tinted and doesn’t have a glossy finish; it’s just a lip balm — but a really good one.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Dior Addict Lip Glow Butter, $42 “Whenever I pull this balm out of my bag, people flock — and I think the dainty Dior charm has something to do with it. A friend of mine even attached hers to her car keys, and I’m obsessed. But it’s not just about looks. The formula is packed with skin-strengthening peptides and moisturizing ceramides, plus cherry oil for a glossy, non-sticky finish. My favorite shade is Black Cherry — a muted merlot that looks amazing with a darker lip liner. It’s replaced my Rhode Peptide Lip Tint in Raspberry Jelly (which says a lot).” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Glossier Balm Dot Com Keychain, $18  “I’ve never had Magnolia Bakery’s famous banana pudding, but do I need to? This is the tastiest lip balm I own — I can’t get enough. Dry lips? Don’t know them (that’s the magic of castor oil, beeswax, and lanolin). The keychain, complete with a bunch of bananas and a screw-on metal cap, makes it even better. It’s cutesy, kitsch, and exactly the kind of fun my bag was missing.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Fenty Beauty Smurfette Effect Gloss Bomb + Keychain, $22 “This gloss is giving major nostalgia in the cutest way. The formula is everything you’d expect from Fenty—juicy, non-sticky, and super flattering—but it’s the Smurfette keychain charm that sealed the deal for me. It’s playful, collectible, and perfect for tossing on your bag or keys so you’re never without a little gloss (and a lot of cuteness).” — Sara Tan, Global Beauty Director tarte x Dunkin’ Maracuja Juicy Shimmer Glass Lip Plump + Free Charm, $27 “I love Dunkin’, and I love Tarte — so this collab felt like it was made just for me. (It wasn’t.) Like the rest of TikTok, I count the Maracuja Lip Plump as one of my most-used lip products for its hydrating, glossy, and subtle plumping properties. This rosy mauve looks great on everyone —  alone for a hint of tint or layered over liner for a lip combo moment. I didn’t think the formula could be improved… and then they added a tiny golden Dunkin’ cup charm. Now it’s a collector’s item. ” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer  Cocokind Ceramide Lip Blur Balm Hydrating \u0026 Smoothing Lip Treatment, $11.99 “I recently wrote a story about “blurred” makeup, which led me to try this balm. The tint payoff is spot on, the shades are universally pretty, and it feels plush and hydrating — there’s truly not a meh one in the bunch. It’s also one of the more affordable ones I’ve tried. I clip it onto a carabiner or my jumbo Baggu key chain.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/night-time-beauty-skincare-routine-products?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I’m a naturally nosy person. I enjoy eavesdropping on conversations in restaurants, stealing glances at WhatsApp messages on the Tube and eyeing up other people’s lunches in the office. But as R29’s deputy beauty director, I’m most intrigued by everyone’s beauty routines, specifically those that take place in the private moments before bed.  Lately, I’ve been drawn to “get unready with me” videos over GRWM. Dermatologists have recently extolled the virtues of evening showers over morning ones, while beauty enthusiasts have popularized the concept of the “morning shed”: removing the skin, hair and other beauty products that they slept in the night before. (Heatless curls need to be unravelled, lip tints peeled off and fake tan rinsed away.) Whether you consider yourself a minimalist or a maximalist, the self-care advantages of a bedtime beauty routine aren’t to be sniffed at. With that in mind, I asked R29 staffers to share theirs with me. From the benefits of an unctuous lip mask to the underrated appeal of a water flosser, here’s everything the team uses before bed.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer My nighttime beauty routine starts in the shower. After washing my hair and body, I like to anoint myself with a few drops of Aromatherapy Associates’ De-Stress Muscle Bath \u0026 Shower Oil and breathe in the relaxing notes of lavender, rosemary, and ginger. My skincare routine comes afterwards: I remove my makeup with a cleansing oil — right now I’m using SON\u0026PARK’s Beauty Water Cleansing Oil — then use the Dr. Barbara Sturm Enzyme Cleanser to gently exfoliate. Then, I use Tatcha’s Texture Tonic and Lenox \u0026 Sixteenth’s Laser Serum, which has been my hero serum ever since I interviewed the founder, Amy Peterson. I moisturize with Sofie Pavitt Face’s Omega Rich Moisturizer — another incredible launch from earlier this year that I’m utterly obsessed with. Depending on the time of the year, my skin will get a bit dry even after applying skincare, so I keep a bottle of Nocturnal’s Polar Night Renewal Serum, which helps my skin rejuvenate while I catch some beauty sleep. This is also when I apply lip balm to help hydrate my lips overnight — my favorite is Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm in Sweet Mint. I absolutely swear by silk pillowcases, which make my bed feel like a sanctuary. I recently got married, so right now my husband and I are snoozing on monogrammed ones by Slip. I also got a sleep mask from Drowsy, a British brand, and it’s like a little pillow for your eyes. Bliss. My last sleep essential is my Oura ring, which has really helped me home in on my biometric stressors and encourage better sleep hygiene. The first thing I do every morning is check my Sleep Score, and nothing starts my day better than getting a crown (Oura-speak for above-average performance). What can I say? I’m just a Virgo who loves the satisfaction of a job well done! DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director I can’t get into bed without washing the day off. In a bid to be more eco-friendly, I shelved my plastic body puff (which should be changed frequently and only ends up in landfill) for a silicone loofah, which can be cleaned and reused time and time again. It’s also replaced my physical exfoliating scrub. When it comes to shower gel, nothing beats Dove Pamper Body Wash With Shea Butter \u0026 Vanilla. The lather is rich and creamy and the smell is so comforting, I’m convinced it helps me fall asleep. When I’m dry, I slather my legs in Vaseline’s Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Serum In Lotion, which absorbs in seconds, and apply foot cream. If I’m washing my hair, I reach for Typebea’s Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo and Strength \u0026 Length Conditioner, which I’m convinced have significantly boosted my slow hair growth, followed by what is the best hair oil of all time: Kérastase Elixir Ultime. Nothing makes my hair as soft and shiny. For my hair, all I need to do is rough-dry it for a few minutes with the Shark FlexStyle, and it’s smooth and frizz-free. I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s changed both my hair and my life. Gone are the days of painstakingly blow-drying or straightening it before bed. I always double cleanse to remove every single scrap of makeup and sunscreen; I love Dr. Idriss’ Soft Wash Complete Daily Cleanser, which is gentle on my reactive skin but cuts through even waterproof foundation and mascara. The evening is when I ramp up my skincare with retinoids to keep my hormonal skin in check. (I always floss and brush before applying my skincare so as not to rinse it away accidentally.) I’ve been using The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion but recently I’ve graduated to tretinoin (a stronger prescription retinoid), recommended by consultant dermatologist Dr Alia Ahmed through Get Harley, an online dermatology service. I practice the sandwich method using a substantial moisturizer (currently Aestura Atobarrier365 Cream), putting one layer of face cream, followed by the retinoid and then another layer of face cream. Lastly, I apply a little cuticle oil to encourage stronger nails (L’Occitane Shea Nail and Cuticle Nourishing Oil) and turn out the light! DashDividers_1_500x100 Venus Wong, senior writer I can only fall asleep knowing that my skin and hair are sparkling clean, pillowy soft, and smell amazing — and I entrust a suite of products, primarily from Japanese and Korean brands, to help me achieve this goal. First, I double cleanse, starting with the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Moisture Cleansing Oil, which is great at melting off my SPF and makeup without stripping my skin barrier, followed by Innisfree Cherry Blossom Glow Jam Cleanser. The latter leaves my face fresh but not too dry and I love the fruity-floral scent and rich lather. I’m all about heavily perfumed body washes and LUSH’s Sleepy Shower Gel never fails to help me unwind; the rich tonka and lavender scent is so soothing. My hair routine is pretty basic: I gravitate towards products that maintain hydration without weighing my hair down, and Living Proof’s Perfect hair Day (PhD) Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner is my favorite combo lately. The proprietary ingredient mimics the benefits of silicone (without the buildup on the scalp), leaving my hair bouncy and squeaky clean without weighing it down. The rest of my routine has been drastically pared down lately, as it’s been so hot, and I really can’t be bothered. When I get out of the shower, I spray Curél’s Deep Moisture Spray all over my body. Curél is a Japanese drugstore brand I’ve relied on since my teens and I’m really happy to see it become available everywhere now. Its products are rich in ceramides, which help repair the skin barrier and keep it supple and hydrated. I also like that this product can be sprayed upside down, which helps me reach the dry patches on my back. For the face, I do a “mini mask” by placing Mediheal’s Teatree Facial Toner Pads on my cheeks for several minutes. This was a skincare discovery I wrote about after a trip to Seoul last year; it’s a popular K-beauty hack for calming redness and acne, thanks to the tea tree essence. I follow with a sleeping mask so I can wake up with supple skin without doing tons of work. My nightly staple is Erno Lazlo’s Hydra-Therapy Memory Gel Sleep Mask, which has a fun, jello-like texture and plumps the skin with moisturizing vitamin E and prickly pear extract. On the weekends, I pamper myself with Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Everything Eye Patches as a treat for my under eyes, or use Dr.Jart+ Ceramidin Skin Barrier Moisturizing Mask if my skin has been particularly dry. For fragrance, I love the clean and feminine scent of Elizabeth Arden’s White Tea Eau Florale Eau de Toilette and douse myself in it before climbing into bed. I also spray Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Perfume onto my ends, which provides me with sweet, comforting whiffs of honey when I toss and turn at night. DashDividers_1_500x100 L’Oréal Blackett, Unbothered editor My evening routine is all about relaxing before bed, scrubbing away the grime of the world, and plucking rogue hairs out of my chin. It’s not pretty, but a very functional routine to help me maintain my zen. I always start by getting my hair out of my face; the method varies depending on whether I have a sew-in or I’m wearing a half-wig or clip-ins. I usually take out my clips and hairpins, then put my hair into messy chunky twists to help prevent tangling, tie them back in a bobble, wrap with a silk scarf and cover with an extra-large bonnet I got at my local Afro beauty store. If my scalp needs it, I will add a hair serum (currently Cécred’s Nourishing Hair Oil) to tide me over until my next wash day or weave takedown. Next up, I double cleanse to remove my makeup. I prefer a balm cleanser, such as Elemis’ Pro Collagen Cleansing Balm, then I go in with my trusty Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash. It’s non-drying, helps remove any lingering makeup and is affordable. I’ve used it since I was 12 — that’s my definition of a holy-grail product! I floss with dental picks, scrub my teeth with an electric brush and gargle with mouthwash — you know the drill. In the shower, I also double cleanse my body; I just don’t feel right without a good, long soak. First, I use a bar of antibacterial soap by Dettol. My grandma introduced me to Dettol baths as a kid, helping to keep acne on my chest and back clean, and it’s still a step I refuse to skip. For a good lather, I go in with Dove’s Deeply Nourishing Body Wash with an African net sponge made from nylon — they are really easy to keep clean and sanitary in your shower. If I’m in the mood, I shave my legs, pits and bits to save me from doing it in the morning. A shower oil comes next. I’ve recently run out of the popular almond shower oil by L’Occitane, so I switched to ESPA’s Restorative Bath and Body Oil and it is perfect for before bed. You either add it directly to your bath or directly to your skin while wet, and the scent mix of essential oils makes me so sleepy. After hopping out of the shower, I speed through my skincare routine. Depending on the last time I dermaplaned, I will go in with my Venus dermaplaner to get rid of some of my peach fuzz (be careful, I’ve sliced my finger open with this thing multiple times). DashDividers_1_500x100 Irina Grechko, senior content director, fashion I often work out at night, so the first step in my nighttime routine is to shower. If I am washing my hair, I use the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Dream Lengths Shampoo and Conditioner, made for those with long, fine hair. I follow it with a nourishing amika Soulfood Nourishing Mask, applied with a detangling wet brush. I leave the mask on as I wash my body with Nivea’s Basil \u0026 White Tea Shower Gel and “floss” my teeth with a waterproof Waterpik because I still haven’t figured out how to use it without getting water all over the floor. After a shower, I use a microfiber-towel turban to let my hair slightly dry, before using a Yves Durif Vented Brush (my hairstylist Olya Iudina got me hooked on it; you can use it on both wet and dry hair). I will then moisturize my body while it’s still damp. I’m in love with the body oil from Officine Universelle Buly, the French brand that has gone viral for its personalized lip balm. It smells divine and is the best body oil I have ever used. It nourishes the skin without leaving it oily. I alternate my skincare routine. Every other day, I start my nighttime prep by washing my face with a Dieux Baptism Gel Cleanser. It foams beautifully, leaves my skin feeling clean, and smells so good. I use the Glossier Milky Oil Makeup Remover to get rid of any eye makeup that may have lingered. The biggest issue that my skin faces is dehydration, so I don’t apply any serums or creams without spraying my face with Mario Badescu’s Facial Spray first to create a base layer of moisture. I will then follow it with Sunday Riley’s A+ High-Dose Retinoid Serum. Because my skin is on the drier side, face oils work best for me at night. Since it’s summer, though, I currently use a lighter Révive Moisturizing Renewal Oil, which leaves my skin plump without feeling too heavy or greasy in the heat. Once a week, I will switch the face oil for the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask and leave it on overnight. Less is more when it comes to keeping my skin looking clear, so on alternate days I will strip my skincare routine down to three steps with Vintner’s Daughter’s The Ultimate Set: a gentle cleanser, an essence (which replaces my face spray) and a botanical serum (which I use as a face oil). While not cheap, Vintner’s Daughter is the GOAT; over the years, I’ve come back to its cult serum again and again for the way it makes my skin glow unlike anything else on the market. I also use a red light therapy mask from Solawave three times a week to even out my skin texture and calm any hormonal breakouts or irritation. DashDividers_1_500x100 Esther Newman, affiliate writer I love a good routine, especially when I’m preparing for bed. I like to shower at night so I can wash away the day and flush any unwanted energy down the drain. I like to make this a self-care ritual, so I’ll light a candle and add some soothing essential oils to the bottom of the shower. You can’t beat Neal’s Yard Remedies’ Women’s Balance, which is an intoxicating blend of patchouli, geranium, rose, and frankincense. It instantly soothes my mind and grounds me. I’m typically pretty low-key when it comes to beauty and body care. If I’m wearing makeup, I’ll first cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water on a reusable cotton pad. Once in the shower, I’ll double up with La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser, which is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. For my body, I also like a gentle and moisturizing body wash, and my latest favorite is the Naturium The Booster Hyaluronic Acid Body Wash. My skin doesn’t feel tight or itchy afterwards, and the hydration really lasts. I don’t even feel like I need to double up with a body cream, so that cuts out an extra step. If I’m washing my hair, I like the MONDAY Haircare Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner; my go-to since reviewing them back in 2021. I love the easy-to-use packaging (a must as a glasses wearer who struggles to see in the shower) and the hydrating, lightweight formula that doesn’t weigh my fine hair down. It leaves it bouncy and glossy. Once out of the shower, I’ll throw my hair up in a microfiber towel to minimize frizz. In terms of skincare, I try to keep it simple, too. My hero product is the Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray, which has transformed my skin, reducing bacteria and eradicating the stubborn texture along my chin and white spots around my nose. Once this dries down, I’ll follow with a hydrating serum (the Medik8 Liquid Peptides), and then slather on my favorite moisturizer, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, and a LANEIGE lip mask. Finally, it’s time to brush my teeth. After being told by my dentist that my usual electric toothbrush is adding too much pressure to my teeth, I’ve switched to a SURI Toothbrush, which is powerful but a lot more gentle — and quieter than other models. DashDividers_1_500x100 Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer No matter what time I go to bed — whether it’s 10 p.m. after an evening at home or 4 a.m. after going to a club — I will always wash my face and body. There’s nothing better than climbing into a clean bed, also feeling clean. I go to the bathroom and brush my teeth, cleanse my face, then shower. I use Emma Hardie Moringa Cleansing Balm or Naturium Purple Ginseng Cleansing Balm to remove my makeup. The Emma Hardie one is perfect for my dry skin as it cleanses without stripping moisture or irritating my eyes, but it is definitely a treat due to the price point. The Naturium one is a cheaper option that also works well with my skin. I’m not a double cleanser; I feel if a product can’t do it in one, it’s not a very good cleanser (controversial, I know).  If it’s a Sunday, I’ll apply a mask while in the shower. The two I currently have in rotation are The Outset Purifying Blue Clay Mask if my skin needs a deep cleanse and Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask for something a bit more gentle. Weekdays I skip the mask and go straight in with Nécessaire Eucalyptus The Body Wash, which has a relaxing scent and is gentle on skin. I go in with facial skincare immediately after drying off. First, it’ll be a serum of some kind, like The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% if I want gentle exfoliation, or a high-strength vitamin C. Sometimes I skip this step and go straight to moisturizer. My favorite nourishing one is Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream in the winter, and The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA for warmer weather. Both give my skin what it needs without feeling heavy, oily or clogging. I’m not an oil fan. Post-shower, I need to moisturize my body, which I thoroughly hate doing as it’s so boring but it’s good for reducing my seasonal eczema flare-ups. Aveeno Daily Moisturising Lotion does the job. Then I slather my lips in Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Gloss Balm. Finally, it’s time for bed with a silk pillowcase, which is a recent investment I’ve made as it’s better for skin and hair! DashDividers_1_500x100 Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writer My nighttime routine always starts with a shower and while none of the steps is particularly out of the norm, I do like to occasionally throw in a lavender shower steamer tablet to help unwind from stressful days. Afterwards, I spray It’s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Lite onto my hair and comb it through with my fingers to serve as a heat protectant before I dry it. But first, while my skin is still moist, I spray Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Tanning Water all over my body! I’ve just started using Jergen’s Natural Glow Face Moisturizer on my face at night and in the morning, too, so I’m not two completely different shades. Next, I move on to drying my bob-length hair, which actually takes longer than you may think since I section it off for a nice blowdry (or else my hair will be super flat and get oilier quicker).  For my skincare routine, I typically keep it very minimal (a face mist and lip mask), but when I’m going all out, I’ll use Futurewise’s Slugging System (a three-step routine consisting of a hydrating face mist, barrier repair moisturizer, and moisture-locking slug balm). I just keep the slugging balm below my bangs so I don’t make them greasy. I finish off my routine with Laneige’s original Lip Sleeping Mask and Bouncy \u0026 Firm Sleeping Mask, which I use on my neck for some extra hydration. (And on the occasion that I have a stubborn breakout, I like using e.l.f’s Blemish Breakthrough Stick It to Zits Pimple Patches overnight, which is always super pleasing to remove the next morning.) All that’s left to do is turn down for bed. I’ve been sleeping on satin pillowcases for years and I simply can’t turn back. They’re so silky smooth and cooling, and I find that I don’t wake up with crazy creases on my face, like you sometimes do with standard cotton pillowcases. To sweeten the deal, I spray ThisWorks Sleep Plus Pillow Spray onto my pillows, which makes them smell like lavender and chamomile and helps relax me even more for a good night’s rest.

    "description": "Image Source: Getty Lindsay Lohan just gave the cat-eye manicure a dreamy, pastel twist. On July 22, she stepped out for the Los Angeles premiere of Disney's \"Freakier Friday,\" the highly anticipated sequel to her 2003 cult classic \"Freaky Friday,\" and channeled full Disney princess energy. Every detail of Lohan's look worked in harmony, down to the nails. Her frosty pink cat-eye manicure matched her blush-toned makeup and soft blond waves, creating a monochromatic moment that felt polished, feminine, and tied together from head to toe. Lohan's nail artist, Eri Ishizu, said, \"Lindsay's been really into cat-eye nails lately, so we wanted to match the sparkly vibe of her pink crystal dress while keeping the look subtle and classic.\" She started with Après Nail's Base Gelcoat X ($13) and cured it as directed, then applied one coat of Astral Gel Couleur in The Lovers ($15), a cotton-candy pink magnetic gel polish with a dreamy shimmer. Before curing, Ishizu used a magnet stick to manipulate the metallic sparkles into a soft dimensional wave across the nail. \"Hold a magnet close to the nails for about five seconds to guide the metallic particles into your desired pattern,\" says Après Nail educator Priscilla Nguyen. \"Flash cure immediately to lock in the look before moving on to the next nail.\" Ishizu then finished the look with a non-wipe gel top coat to lock in the shine and give it a glassy, long-lasting finish. Curious how this special polish works? \"Cat-eye polish contains magnetic shimmer particles that can be manipulated using a magnet,\" says Nguyen. \"The movement and placement of the magnet determine the final design, allowing for customizable effects like sharp lines, waves, or galaxy swirls. The possibilities are endless.\" Image Source: Instagram user eriishizu Cat-eye nails, first popular in the early 2010s, are officially back in 2025 for a subtler, more luminous refresh. Celebrities like Jenna Dewan, Sydney Sweeney, and Ashley Tisdale have all been spotted wearing the magnetic manicure, each adding her own spin to the trend. Most recently, Lizzo wore a shimmering silver version, proving just how versatile (and camera-ready) the look can be. And it's fitting for the moment. \"Freakier Friday,\" which hits theaters Aug. 8, reunites Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis as they reprise their iconic mother-daughter roles. This time, it's not just Anna and Tess swapping bodies, but Anna's daughter and her soon-to-be stepsister as two families attempt to merge. A little retro, a little fun, and fully grown-up - just like the mani. Olivia Tauber is a freelance writer based in New York, pursuing her Master's in Journalism at NYU.

    "title": "It's About Time Beauty Brands Recognize the Influence of OnlyFans Stars",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/urban-decay-ari-kytsya-partnership-opinion-49452773",
    "description": "The viral yet polarizing \"clean girl\" era is over - it's time for beauty to get a little dirty again, and Urban Decay tapped OnlyFans star and content creator Ari Kytsya to make it happen. On Thursday, July 17, the makeup brand launched \"Battle the Bland,\" a campaign fronted by the 24-year-old model. Known on social media for her comedic GRWMs, candid takes on plastic surgery, and overt sexuality, Kytsya's casting disrupts traditional ideas of who gets to be a beauty ambassador in 2025 - and it's about time. While often reduced to its adult content, OnlyFans has become a major force in creator culture, giving women, in particular, a direct line to visibility, income, and independence. Kytsya is one of the platform's biggest stars, but her influence extends far beyond it. On TikTok, she's racked up 4.6 million followers, many of them women drawn to her blunt transparency. In GRWMs, she talks openly about the cosmetic procedures she's undergone. \"That's why I try to be real open about the surgeries and everything that I've had done,\" she says in one video. \"Because I don't want anyone to look at me and be like, 'Oh, I wish I looked like that,' because I don't even look like that.\" She's equally honest about the realities of sex work - calling herself a \"bop\" or \"mattress actress\" - and explains how the industry affects her self-image. She doesn't glamorize it, but she doesn't hide it either. That kind of candid energy resonates deeply with her audience, and it's exactly what Urban Decay is tapping into. The brand's rollout began with a series of faux-censored Instagram teasers stamped with mock warnings like \"may contain boring or bland content.\" The following day came the reveal: a series of social videos where Kytsya, clad in a leather bustier, declares, \"Breaking news: we are in a blandemic,\" before asking, \"Wasn't makeup meant to perform on stage, on camera, and yes, on mattresses?\" The message was loud and clear - and so was the reception. Comments poured in: \"First brand to work with a SW model, such a disruptive move,\" one wrote. \"This is honestly groundbreaking.\" It's a return to form for Urban Decay, a brand that built its identity on provocation, with product names like \"Naked,\" \"Get Baked,\" \"Druggie,\" and \"Vice.\" With \"Battle the Bland,\" the brand reclaims its spot as beauty's rebellious older sister, this time choosing a lead not in spite of her sex work, but because of how unapologetically she owns it. \"In a space that often plays it safe - especially when it comes to who gets a seat at the table - this moment feels not only bold, but historic,\" the brand said in a press release. \"While most beauty brands shy away from creators who are 'too much' for mainstream standards, Urban Decay is leaning all the way in - embracing Ari's uncensored main character energy.\" That embrace marks a turning point. Until recently, being a sex worker came with a huge stigma. But the cultural tides are shifting. Platforms like OnlyFans have given sex workers visibility and reach society can no longer ignore. What was once deemed \"too explicit\" is now seen as culturally fluent and commercially valuable. And in many ways, Kytsya's role brings beauty full circle. For centuries, makeup wasn't considered glamorous, but rather taboo. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was associated with sex work and deception, only later becoming mainstream through actresses and celebrities. Kytsya represents a lineage of women who've always shaped how we see beauty, even when they weren't invited into the room. Now, she's not just in the room, she's the face of the entire campaign. It's not Urban Decay's first time partnering with someone whose background subverts the industry's expectations. In 2022, the brand tapped \"Euphoria\" breakout Chloe Cherry - a former porn actress turned mainstream star - to lead its Vice Lip Bond campaigns. Like Kytsya, Cherry's casting marked another example of Urban Decay recognizing the power of provocative creators who defy traditional industry standards. With Battle the Bland, Urban Decay sets the tone for a new era of beauty marketing; one where creators like Kytsya aren't sidelined but centered. It's a bold campaign, yes, but it's also a long-overdue acknowledgment of sex work's impact on mainstream culture, and of the women who've been shaping beauty all along. And that's something we feel really good about. Olivia Tauber is a freelance writer based in New York, passionate about crafting authentic stories through personal essays and profiles.
