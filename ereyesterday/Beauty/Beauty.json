    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-uv-filters-spf-45-sunscreen?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Something’s been brewing at The Ordinary — and I’m not talking about the brand’s excellent GF 15% Solution, which has replaced my Botox obsession, or even the new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, which outperforms every vitamin C in my routine. The real news is a product we’ve all been patiently waiting for, and it’s one that no skincare routine is complete without. Enter The Ordinary’s new sunscreen: UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19. Longtime fans of The Ordinary will know this isn’t the brand’s first attempt at sunscreen. Some may remember the Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants, packaged in its signature silver tube. But the thick texture and white cast, typical of many mineral formulas, left much to be desired. True to form, The Ordinary listened to customer feedback and discontinued the product, returning to the drawing board.  It took a few years to get right, but The Ordinary doesn’t do things by halves — and today, the new UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19, is finally here. Luckily, I was one of the first beauty directors to try a sample — and trust me, you’ll actually want to wear this one every day. The Ordinary UV Filters SPF 45 Serum, $19 Is The Ordinary’s new SPF mineral or chemical? Whether you’re a sunscreen devotee or only remember to apply it occasionally, the question on everyone’s lips is whether the new SPF is anything like its predecessor. Unlike the Mineral UV Filters, this formula is much thinner in texture. While The Ordinary calls it a “serum”, it’s more like a lightweight lotion — easy to apply and absorbed in moments, with no excessive rubbing or blotting required. The lighter texture is down to the type of UV filters used. The Ordinary has shelved its original mineral filters, opting instead for “chemical” filters — approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Chemical filters absorb harmful UV rays and convert them into less damaging heat that is then released from the skin before it can cause any adverse effects, like sunburn and eventually sun damage.   You’re probably wondering why the brand decided to pivot from its original mineral filters. In a press release, The Ordinary explained that it’s “harder to formulate a truly transparent, lightweight and accessibly priced sunscreen with mineral filters alone.” Using chemical filters, for example, octocrylene and homosalate, means that the product doesn’t leave behind the same white cast as the original. Even better, it’s a dream to apply (more on that later) and affordable at $19. Is there a difference between SPF 45 and SPF 50? The Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 45 is a broad-spectrum sunscreen, meaning it protects your skin from both UVA (which can cause skin cancer and premature aging) and UVB (responsible for sunburn and skin cancer). Most sunscreens have an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or 50, which indicates how well they protect against UVB. For example, if you burn after 10 minutes in the sun without sunscreen, SPF 30 lets you stay in the sun about 30 times longer, assuming you’ve applied enough. So why did the brand settle on SPF 45 specifically?  “Contrary to popular belief, the UV filter number is not decided by the brand that formulates the sun-protectant but rather by the formula itself,” says the brand, adding, “When The Ordinary’s product underwent testing, the SPF value that it achieved was SPF 45, which is estimated to absorb only 0.2% less UVB radiation than SPF 50.” The difference between SPF 45 and 50 is only about 1%, so the most important thing is that you’re applying enough. Most dermatologists recommend two finger lengths’ worth of sunscreen for your face and neck.  Is The Ordinary’s SPF 45 any good? I apply sunscreen every morning, whether I’m leaving the house or not, so it’s fair to say that I have high expectations. Besides being broad-spectrum (UVA can pass through glass, and I work by a large window), my sunscreen has to work with, not against, my combination skin. I want it to be moisturising enough for my dry cheeks but not greasy, so it doesn’t exacerbate my oily T-zone. Happily, this one is just right. The texture is light yet hydrating, giving my skin a juicy, dewy finish similar to some Korean sunscreens I’ve tried — but at a fraction of the price. Even when I apply two finger lengths’ worth, it doesn’t feel like a chore. It absorbs quickly without feeling uncomfortable or sticky, nor does it sting my eyes. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, which means it’s less likely to clog pores and cause zits. Most skincare breaks me out, but I’ve been using this for weeks without any issues whatsoever.  The Ordinary also claims it’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. I actually gave away the mineral sunscreen I was using before because it made my delicate eyelids burn. Thankfully, UV Filters SPF 45 is gentle on my reactive skin; I don’t feel a thing.  While sun protection is the main goal, I love that it makes an excellent anchor for makeup. My foundation and concealer blend seamlessly over the top, and with my skin perfectly quenched, I’m convinced that the final result looks more flawless than before. I attribute this to the ultra-moisturising glycerin and phospholipids, which keep moisture under lock and key, and maintain the skin’s barrier.  A dermatologist once told me that the best sunscreen is the one you want to wear every day. For me, it has to be UV Filters SPF 45, and since it’s cheaper than the others in my bathroom currently, I can stock up.  The Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 45, $19, is available at theordinary.com This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/maybelline-face-the-difference-campaign?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I remember the first time I went shopping for concealer at the drugstore. I was probably 14, and was so excited to start trying makeup looks inspired by my favorite YouTube beauty gurus. I’m mixed-race Japanese-American, with olive skin that usually falls into the light-medium range. I looked at the darker shade options of a popular mass brand’s concealer, already bummed that the overwhelmingly peachy, cooler undertones made my olive skin look grey. I left the store with a serviceable option, but didn’t feel great about it.  In 2025, Maybelline is making sure no one has that experience again — and for Global Brand President of Maybelline New York Trisha Ayyagari, it’s a mission that hits home. “Growing up, I’ve always loved beauty,” she tells Refinery29. “I will never forget how I was unable to find a shade that matched my skin and how disappointing that was.” To celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, Maybelline (in partnership with Bustle Digital Group and Gold House) has unveiled a history-making campaign called Face the Difference, spotlighting its bestselling Fit Me foundation (which comes in 40 shades and has a 97% match success rate).  “From the start, the notion of Fit Me was to make people feel represented both in the shades and the products, but also in all of the campaigns and activations that we do,” Ayyagari says. Featuring 40 AAPIH creatives, athletes, business owners, and more, Face The Difference is spotlighting the diversity that exists in the Asian community. The impressive cast of Maybelline’s campaign includes Jenn Tran, the first-ever Asian-American Bachelorette, Jing Gao, founder and CEO of the popular (and delicious) Fly By Jing, Olympic figure skater Maia Shibutani, content creator Cynthia Victor, and Svetha Nallapaneni, professional dancer and Radio City Rockette.  “Maybelline has long championed the idea that beauty is for everyone,” said Alex Wang, Brand Marketing Director of Maybelline, who helped bring the campaign to life. “This campaign is a powerful extension of that legacy, celebrating the strength and richness of the Asian Pacific community through a modern, comprehensive lens with our wonderful partners at Bustle Digital Group and Gold House.” Teaming up with Gold House, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to amplifying and investing in Asian Pacific leadership and voices, Maybelline is making sure this initiative is much more than just another beauty campaign with pretty faces. In addition to the cast of talent, Maybelline enlisted a team of creatives (including makeup artists, hairstylists, photographers, and more) to ensure representation behind-the-scenes in addition to in front of the camera. “It was just an incredible day to celebrate our heritage,” says Ayyagari of bringing the campaign to life on set. “It’s not just the products matching, but it’s also being able to see yourself represented,” she says. “Confidence is often based on being able to identify with other people. And so ensuring that our campaigns represent as many different skin tones, backgrounds, genders as possible has been a big priority of mine, and is truly aligned with the values of the brand.” Like what you see?
