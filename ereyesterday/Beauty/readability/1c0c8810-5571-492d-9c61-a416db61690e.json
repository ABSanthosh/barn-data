  "description": "Image Source: Getty/ Chris DELMAS / AFP If you're dying to know what happens between Mook and Gaitok after the season finale of \"The White Lotus,\" we can't exactly help you. . . But if you want to know all of the details on Lalisa Manobal's (aka Lisa) brand-new hair color change, we absolutely have you covered. During night one of Coachella, the Blackpink singer completely changed her look with \"mushroom blond\" hair. According to Lisa's colorist, Jacob Schwartz the \"Fxck Up the World\" singer went from a warm chestnut brown (the same shade she rocked for \"The White Lotus\" premiere) to a soft mink bronde hue. Schwartz used a combo of the Schwarzkopf Professional Igora Vibrance Demi-Permanent Tone on Tone Hair Color ($12) and the Schwarzkopf Professional Igora Vario Blond ($30) to achieve the look. The mushroom-blond hair color trend mixes shades of blond, beige, and light brown for a unique, cool-toned look. The blend of dark and light colors comes together to create a subtler variety of blond sans all of the harsh bleaching that you get with brighter hues. What's really great about this trend is that you can go longer between salon sessions without experiencing the brassiness that so often comes with bright blond colors. Lisa, along with bandmate Jennie, both had solo performances at Coachella bill this year, marking a new era for the band. Lisa was dressed for the occasion from head to toe, as makeup artist Haemin Commune created the perfect matte-grey smoky eye to complement the new hair color, along with subtle glitter eyeliner in the corners of Lisa's eyes. Nail artist Juan Alvear crafted extra sharp claw nails using Aprés Nail products for a sci-fi futuristic look. If Lisa has taught us anything from her beauty choices so far, it's that she's ahead of the curve, so expect to see tons of mushroom-blond shades popping up for the summer of 2025.
