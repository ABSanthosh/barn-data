If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. One of the biggest misconceptions about beauty products is that they have to cost a small fortune to be effective. Brands like The Ordinary and The Inkey List have proven that to be incorrect where skincare is concerned, and we’d argue that the same goes for makeup. (Find us a beauty enthusiast who doesn’t have high praise for the affordable e.l.f.) Haircare seems to be a different story, though. If your FYP is anything like ours, you might’ve come across so-called hair experts warning against the supposed effects of cheap hair products like shampoo, for example, citing hard-to-remove buildup and even hair loss as potential ramifications. More often than not, these videos come with recommendations for expensive alternatives.  Luxury products certainly have their place in haircare but the professionals are working overtime to dispel the aforementioned myths. Take certified trichologist Abbey Yung, whose TikTok account is something of a re-education in affordable haircare. The common consensus? Regardless of your hair length or texture, it doesn’t matter how much you spend on a hair product provided it’s formulated well, works for you and is within your budget.  @abbeyyung Should I do this for another drugstore brand next?

Hairbrushes “There’s a luxury market for excessively expensive hairbrushes and combs but in reality, a well-made, affordable option can do the job just as effectively,” says Dr. Bessam Farjo, hair transplant surgeon at Farjo Hair Institute. “A wide-tooth comb or a brush with flexible bristles is all you need to detangle hair gently without causing breakage,” Dr. Farjo adds. The key, he says, is to use the right technique, especially if you have longer hair: “Start from the ends and work your way upwards — and I’m not talking about the price tag.” This will reduce pulling and snagging, which can lead to breakage and split ends. Essentially, whether you’re dealing with fragile hair or just daily maintenance, Dr. Farjo says that a cheaper brush or comb can still keep your hair healthy and tangle-free.  For hair that tangles easily, R29 rates Wet Brush Original Detangler, $9.99. If you’re looking for an everyday hairbrush, try Eco Tools Shine Activating Hairbrush, $13.99. The brand boasts a range of combs and brushes for a variety of different hair types. Anti-Dandruff Treatments If you have dandruff, you’d be forgiven for spending more on a product, hoping that it’ll get rid of your flakes in one fell swoop. But cheaper products are just as effective. Trichologist Stephanie Sey recommends Nizoral’s Anti-Dandruff Treatment Shampoo, $14.99. “This starts working from the first wash to help treat the underlying cause of dandruff,” which is malassezia — an overgrowth of yeast (a type of fungus) on the scalp. This product boasts ketoconazole, which Sey explains is a powerful antifungal ingredient. It also boasts all-important sulphates (foaming agents that create a lather) to cleanse on a deeper level. When formulated properly, neither products with sulphates nor anti-dandruff shampoos should strip your scalp or hair. Smoothing Serums There are countless expensive balms, serums and creams for curls and coils, says Neil Moodie, editorial hairstylist and founder of Neil Moodie Studio. But one affordable alternative has become his favurite: “One of the best products [under $13] is the Mixed Chicks Straightening Serum,” he says. “We now also stock it in the Neil Moodie Studio. It has thermal protection, is humidity-resistant and cuts drying time in half.” Even better, Moodie says that this affordable serum works on both natural and relaxed hair, and reduces flyaways immediately. “This is all thanks to hydrolyzed keratin, silk amino acids, chamomile and rosemary extract,” he says. Styling Mousse Freelance beauty journalist and editor Ata-Owaji Victor thinks you can get away with spending less on styling mousse. Her go-to is Creme of Nature Argan Oil Style \u0026 Shine Foaming Mousse, $7.71. “This […] lasts forever and leaves my hair feeling nourished and shiny,” says Victor. “Black and coily hair doesn’t generally reflect light in the same way [as other hair textures] so I love that this adds some shine and gloss.” Victor says that it’s especially great for braids: “When you’ve got braids it’s hard to get nourishment into your hair in a way that doesn’t weigh it down or add buildup on the scalp. This is light yet keeps natural hair underneath fairly nourished. I put it on at the end of a braided style or cornrows.”  Hairspray Hair trend forecaster and stylist Tom Smith suggests spending less on hairspray — provided that you wash it out properly. “Even though hairspray can make hair feel stiff, it won’t actually dry the hair out,” he says. “This is because hairspray typically has a very high molecular weight, which means it simply sits on the surface of the hair and can’t get in.” Smith’s top tip? “Just don’t use direct heat — like curling or straightening irons — on top of cheaper hairspray, because that could cause residue, buildup and yellowing of the hair,” he says. One hair category Smith would never skimp on is hair treatments like bond-builders. “You’ll want the best quality ingredients to keep your hair healthy,” says Smith, an ambassador for Olaplex. If you have more to spend, try the new Olaplex No.5 Leave-In Moisturize \u0026 Mend Leave-In Conditioner, $32, which minimizes the appearance of split ends and further protects hair from damage as a result of brushing, heat-styling and environmental aggressors.   Dry Shampoo Award-winning beauty and wellness journalist Twiggy Jalloh says you can’t go wrong with Batiste dry shampoo. It’s particularly excellent for long hair and on wigs, she says. “I’ve tried almost every dry shampoo on the market and Batiste is still one of, if not the, best out of all of them,” praises Jalloh. “I love it for my straight hair; it blends in easily, absorbs oil really quickly, doesn’t leave behind a white powder and is very affordable. That’s important because when I have straight hair, I tend to go through dry shampoo quite quickly, so I don’t want to spend a huge amount.” Scalp Serums Alicia Lartey, esthetician, beauty writer and cosmetic chemist in-training says that scalp conditions such as excessive dryness and dandruff are pretty common. “I know that plenty of hairdressers will advise people to go for more expensive ‘professional’ treatments, but nowadays, there are more players in the game, and they’re formulating products at affordable price points,” she says. Lartey recommends looking out for the ingredient urea, an emollient (often found in moisturizers) that also softens and smooths the skin on the scalp. R29 rates The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum, $14.70. Hair Oils Luxury and premium oils certainly have their place in haircare. (We’ve spoken highly of Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil, $62, for imparting shine, and love Olaplex No.7 Bonding Oil, $30, for minimizing the appearance of dry, split ends.) But having less to spend doesn’t mean forgoing quality. Stuart Marsh, a hairstylist in Taylor Taylor London‘s Liberty salon swears by Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Growth Oil, $10.99. He has a smart tip for making the most of its moisturizing ingredients: “Take a small, dry towel, dampen it down with water and add a few drops of the oil,” he advises. “Pop the towel in the microwave for about 30 seconds and while it’s warming up, run your favorite conditioner through your hair. Remove the towel and wrap it around the hair. Leave it on and there you have yourself an indulgent, super-intensive hair mask.” Shampoo “I recently tested a £43 luxury shampoo against a much cheaper version [L’Oréal Paris Elvive Hyaluron Plump Hydrating Squeeze Shampoo] and the cheaper one came out on top,” says Refinery29’s deputy beauty director, Jacqueline Kilikita. “Actually, in my experience, my hair has never felt cleaner — or looked better — when I’ve used drugstore brands like Elvive, Pantene, OGX and Hask. I want moisturizing ingredients like argan oil and hyaluronic acid, and a non-negotiable is a gentle sulphate to lift away all remnants of oil, hair product and daily dirt. While I’m very kindly sent lots of buzzy new shampoos, I always go back to Hydra Hyaluronic, and it’s often on sale at half the price.” Like what you see?

I put it on at the end of a braided style or cornrows.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHairspray\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eHair trend forecaster and stylist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTom Smith\u003c/a\u003e suggests spending less on hairspray — provided that you wash it out properly. “Even though hairspray can make hair feel stiff, it won’t actually dry the hair out,” he says. “This is because hairspray typically has a very high molecular weight, which means it simply sits on the surface of the hair and can’t get in.” Smith’s top tip? “Just don’t use direct heat — like curling or straightening irons — on top of cheaper hairspray, because that could cause residue, buildup and yellowing of the hair,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne hair category Smith would never skimp on is hair treatments like \u003ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11183570/epres-hair-bond-repair-treatment-review\"\u003ebond-builders\u003c/a\u003e. “You’ll want the best quality ingredients to keep your hair healthy,” says Smith, an ambassador for Olaplex.
