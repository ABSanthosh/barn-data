  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Kevin Sabitus/Kevin Mazur Aside from a monumental win for the Philadelphia Eagles (sorry, Chiefs fans), the Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 brought many awe-inspiring moments, namely Kendrick Lamar's highly anticipated halftime performance. While the genius of Lamar's artistry left us speechless, the show featured beauty looks that were just as captivating. He featured frequent collaborator SZA, who effortlessly dominated the stage during their hit song \"Luther,\" and Serena Williams, who did the iconic C-Walk during \"Not Like Us,\" much to our surprise and amazement. But what had us even more glued to our TVs? SZA's and Williams's curls. It's no secret the halftime show was a celebration of Black culture, from the all-Black dancers making up the American flag that reflected Lamar's thought-provoking lyrics to the ambiguity of Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal as Uncle Sam. And of course, Williams's and SZA's hair followed suit. Both stars sported long, voluminous curls (SZA's fiery red and the tennis champion's long blond) on the biggest night in football, which is highly significant given the current state of Blackness in America. Our identities are constantly being challenged - beauty companies recently eliminated DEI initiatives, for example - and yet figures like SZA and Williams continuously prove that the color of our skin and other aspects of our culture are not a threat - nor are they going away. Black people will continue being unapologetically ourselves and wearing our hair in all its textured glory on such distinguished platforms (during Black History Month, no less), and it further shows the power of Black beauty. If SZA and Williams's curls inspired you to embrace yours, both of their hairstylists shared the exact products they used to achieve their stunning looks. Keep reading for the full breakdown. SZA's Red Curls at the Super Bowl Image Source: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images Celebrity hairstylist Devante Turnbull achieved SZA's red curls using products from K18 Professional and GHD. \"We wanted to stay true to her signature big-hair look while elevating it with extra length and some color to spice things up,\" he said in a press release. He did just that, starting with the K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Leave-In Molecular Repair Mask ($75) to strengthen and protect her hair for heat styling. Then, he used the GHD Curve Wand ($167, originally $209) and Thin Wand ($209) to add more texture to her curls. He then blended them with his fingers and the All-Rounder Paddle Brush ($35). Lastly, Turnbull topped off the style with K18's Molecular Repair Hair Oil ($65) to add shine and reduce frizz. Serena Williams's Curls at the Super Bowl Image Source: Emilee Chinn/Getty Images Wella Professionals partnered with hairstylist Angela Meadows to style Williams's blond curls. \"We wanted a statement style that would be a showstopper for Serena's surprise dance moment with Kendrick Lamar but also hold up against the wind and possible humidity of New Orleans for the big game,\" Meadows said in a press release.Meadows towel-dried the hair and applied the Wella Professionals Ultimate Repair Protective Leave-In ($35) before blow-drying and curling it with the Gold 'N Hot Professional Spring-Grip Curling Iron 1/2 Inch ($24). She finished the look with what she calls the game-changing Ultimate Smooth Miracle Oil Serum ($50) to combat frizz, create a smooth texture, and bring shine and health to Williams's hair.
