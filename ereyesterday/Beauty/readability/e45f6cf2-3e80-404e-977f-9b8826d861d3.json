  "description": "Image Source: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Nudity may be banned from this year's Cannes Film Festival, but there are still plenty of ways to shock on the red carpet. Take Bella Hadid, for example, who decided the iconic event was the perfect time to debut a totally new hair color. We can't blame her. We are fresh off the heels of Aries season, which means we're all looking for a bit of healthy attention. Hadid's blond is soft, subtle, and perfect for summer. The shade is giving \"syrup blond\"- a trend we first reported on in October 2024. Essentially, syrup blond is a darker version of blond that incorporates honey and golden undertones. It's rich like syrup and is all about dimension. Instead of going bright or platinum blond, syrup blond is warmer. Since Hadid has been sporting an edgy-meets-western look as of late, this hair color makes sense for her. Plus, it's the perfect color to rock when you're transitioning from brunette to a brighter color, which is evidenced by her best friend, Kendall Jenner, who went with a similar hue last year. Image Source: Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images Hadid's color was created by Jacob Schwartz, a celebrity hairstylist and Schwarzkopf Professional U.S. Hair Color Trend Ambassador, who says the blond is more of a return to Hadid's natural hue from childhood. \"Bella and I wanted to do something that felt fresh, elevated, and unexpected,\" says Schwartz. \"The blond we landed on is soft, luxurious, and ultra-feminine and was inspired by her natural hair color as a baby. We looked at some old photos of her and used that as our guide throughout the process.\" Schwartz took Hadid from brunette to blond of the course of two days. \"We took a very methodical approach to maintain the health of her hair and to ensure we got the tone exactly right-creamy, not brassy, with a luxe, natural finish,\" he says, and he used Schwarzkopf Professional's products for the blond shade. To achieve this look, Schwartz began by highlighting ultra thin sections of Hadid's hair with the Igora Vario Blond Super Plus ($31). This allowed Schwartz to lift the darker color with minimal breakage. After washing and drying the hair post-lifting, Schwartz went in with the Schwarzkopf Igora Royal Vibrance Tone ($13) and let it sit for 20 minutes before starting the low-light process a second time. From there, he detailed the roots and hairline with more Igora vibrance tone. To finish out the look, he hand-painted strands with the Igora Vario Blond Super Plus. If you want to try this look for yourself, Schwartz has a few tips. \"Ask your colorist for a dimensional blond that's customized to your skin tone and starting color. Bella's blond has depth and softness - it's not one-dimensional,\" he says. \"It's also important to make sure your colorist uses the best product .\" And of course, inspiration pictures always help the process go a little bit smoother.
