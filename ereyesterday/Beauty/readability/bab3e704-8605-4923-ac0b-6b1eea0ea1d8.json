  "description": "At first glance, Dakota Johnson may not strike you as someone with tattoos, but you'd be surprised to learn she has over 16 designs. Yes, you read that correctly. Though if you ask her, she's not yet a \"tattoo fiend,\" according to an interview with James Corden. Most of her small tattoos are minimalistic and scattered across her arms, with a few others located on her feet and back. And if they are not as easily noticeable, it's due to their dainty fine-line style. Thanks to their delicate appearance, they appear as a homogenous unit despite being a mix of script and illustrative designs. Her biggest tattoo is situated on her upper back and consists of three beautiful birds mid-flight, a beautiful tribute to her grandmother. The 34-year-old star started building her tattoo collection years before her breakout acting roles. In fact, not all of her tattoos are known to this date. For her \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" character, the casting team had to hire a \"butt double\" due to Johnson's undisclosed butt tattoo, as cinematographer Seamus McGarvey told The New York Times. Johnson's love for tattoos extends beyond getting them. The \"Madame Web\" actor gave her \"The Lost Daughter\" costar Olivia Colman a personalized tattoo depicting the initials of the Oscar-winning star's family. Johnson's ink collection is filled with meaningful pieces, from a matching tattoo with fiancé Chris Martin to the one she got at home during the 2020 pandemic lockdown. Read to learn all about them ahead.",
