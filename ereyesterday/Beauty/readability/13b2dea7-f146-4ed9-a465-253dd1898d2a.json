  "description": "Shiny, lustrous nails have dominated the beauty world in recent years, largely due to Hailey Bieber's iconic glazed-doughnut era and the expertise of her go-to nail artist, Zola Ganzorigt. That signature glossy sheen sparked a wave of nail trends like chrome finishes, jelly-glaze effects, and pearlescent polishes. This season, however, glitter nail polish is taking center stage - and it's more versatile than ever. The catch? Not all glitter formulations are created equal. The best options go beyond just sparkle, offering smooth application, quick-drying formulas, and chip-resistant, long-lasting wear. With a range of choices, from traditional lacquers that you can find at the drugstore to gel-based formulas that deliver a salon-quality finish, there's a glitter polish for everyone. To narrow it down, professionals and beauty editors carefully evaluated and reviewed the most popular options on the market. Standout features like texture, durability, and vibrant glitter payoff were looked at, ensuring these picks deliver on both style and staying power. Whether it's a subtle shimmer layered over an opaque base color or a bold, full-coverage glitter moment, ahead, check out the best glitter nail polishes available. According to the professionals, these polishes are worth your money and will elevate any manicure this season.",
