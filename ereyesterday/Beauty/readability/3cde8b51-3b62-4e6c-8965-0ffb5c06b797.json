  "description": "We are living in a time when just leaving the house can feel like you're burning money, but have you ever thought about the added costs for those living with skin conditions? They can have a debilitating impact on those who experience them, but on top of the emotional toll are hidden costs that are rarely shared. The 2020 All-Party Parliamentary Group on Skin Report put out by the British Skin Foundation revealed that a staggering 98 percent of people with a skin condition said it affected their emotional and psychological well-being. Sadly, we know it can influence self-esteem, relationships, and work life, but the financial cost can be just as draining. The financial burden that comes with skin flare-ups and chronic conditions is one that's often not openly discussed and something many who haven't experienced it struggle to understand. To highlight this, we spoke to someone who has experienced it firsthand as well as an expert who treats patients daily and who understands (and empathizes with) the topic deeply. Keep reading for more. Experts Featured in This Article Elise Loubatieres is a content creator with eczema. Alia Ahmed, MD, is a consultant dermatologist and psychodermatologist. The Economic Burden of Skin Conditions \"At the height of my eczema flare-up, I was spending an absolute fortune on products to help manage my condition,\" content creator Elise Loubatieres says. And she's not alone. One look at hashtags for \"eczema\" and \"rosacea\" on TikTok produces thousands of videos of people sharing their tips, struggles, and stories. A big part of that conversation, particularly among Loubatieres's followers, is how difficult the additional cost can be. \"Having a skin condition is very expensive, but your sanity is priceless,\" Loubatieres says. \"I can see how people go broke trying to fix their skin.\" The first economic factor is the sheer number of products people with conditions like eczema need to manage it. \"As well as paying for prescriptions, I would be purchasing additional products, often spending anything between $50-$100 a month on skin care,\" Loubatieres says. \"I can easily go through two shower gels and two body creams in a week - I wash and moisturize my skin that much. When in a full flare-up, I actually apply emollient before showering, as even water can make my skin sting, so I need that extra protective layer.\" @littlemissplumful This is completely normal behaviour for an #eczemasufferer ðŸ˜… Smothering my #eczema in #emollient #ointment like #hydromol not only helps to make my dry #eczemaskin feel more comfortable but also prevents #transepidermalwaterloss \u0026 protects my skinbarrier. You gotta do what you gotta do! #onthisday #emollients #eczemawarriors #eczemaawareness #eczemacommunity #eczemawarrior #eczemaface #eczemahealing #eczemaointment #eczemaemollient #eczematreatment â™¬ original sound - littlemissplumful Although general practitioners (GP) are able to write prescriptions for a lot of creams, it can be a bit of a lottery when it comes to healthcare professionals understanding the true extent of certain skin conditions and actually prescribing what is needed. Loubatieres says this is where advocating for yourself really comes into play. Alia Ahmed, MD, a consultant dermatologist and psychodermatologist (where psychological well-being and the skin are interconnected), notes that nutrition and supplements are something a lot of her patients have to consider, too. Some with skin conditions respond particularly well (or badly) to certain foods, adding an expense to already very high food bills. Similarly, supplements can be a fantastic addition to a daily routine for those with skin conditions, but they don't always come cheap. In the same vein, Dr. Ahmed explains that many of her patients have to consider things like clothing, bedding, air purifiers, and water softeners. \"I don't think many people realize that all of this is a financial cost,\" she says. Loubatieres explains that even wearing creams to bed can stain sheets, meaning these need replacing more often in some cases. These are things many people take for granted and don't consider, especially in the cost-of-living crisis we're currently facing. \"Having a skin condition is very expensive, but your sanity is priceless. I can see how people go broke trying to fix their skin.\" Loubatieres says that she feels lucky to live so close to her local GP and hospital so that she's able to walk to her appointments and not have any added travel costs. When people do have to travel, many are understandably reluctant to use public transportation. \"When my eczema was at its worst, I wouldn't take public transport partly because of how self-conscious I was of my red, raw, flaking skin,\" Loubatieres says, noting that this was also in an effort to avoid getting infections, as her skin would often be broken and exposed. Then there's the difficulty of working when you have a chronic, debilitating skin condition. If you've never experienced this or known a loved one who has, it's common to dismiss the idea of not working due to your skin, but we're not talking about a small blemish here and there. Chronic, full-body skin conditions can be incredibly painful and life-limiting. \"Living with a chronic condition is a constant consideration not only when it comes to covering costs but also balancing it out with the possible loss of work due to the condition,\" Loubatieres says. Dr. Amhed notes the cost of time is also a factor to consider. Time is money, and when you're spending hours over the course of the week applying products, organizing appointments, picking up prescriptions, and so on, it really adds up. The Emotional Cost of Skin Conditions Not only is the financial cost of a skin condition difficult to deal with, but the emotional cost must be taken into account. This is something that Dr. Ahmed champions: taking patients' mental health seriously. \"People think that no one dies in dermatology, but they do, and they die by suicide,\" Dr. Ahmed says. \"It might seem like a small statistic, but five percent of people with skin conditions feel like they don't want to continue their life,\" she says. \"It's our job to support these people, not only medically for their skin, but also psychologically for how their skin has made them feel.\" Loubatieres notes that people affected by skin conditions can also be seen as \"anti-social and unwilling to go out when in a flare-up, making everyone else change their plans in order to accommodate the person living with a skin condition,\" which can be emotionally challenging. How to Cut Costs With a Skin Condition If you're finding yourself struggling financially due to the cost of your skin condition, the first step is to tell your family and friends that you're having a difficult time. Book an appointment with your GP and have a loved one come with you to help advocate for you. To keep product costs down, Dr. Ahmed says you don't need to go for big-name brands. You can ask your GP or dermatologist for specific advice when it comes to your skin condition, but most products with similar ingredient lists will get the job done fine, regardless of the brand. Loubatieres advises that tubs of hydromol are a firm favorite in the eczema community, as they're cost-effective and can be used as a soap alternative and moisturizer. Dr. Ahmed emphasizes the importance of using your products effectively to keep costs down, like keeping cream in the fridge if you find relief from burning and itching with cold compression. It's important not to get sucked into clever marketing claims, too. \"People who are chronically suffering with a skin condition are absolutely desperate for a cure or a quick fix, that one product to fix all their problems,\" Loubatieres says. \"Desperation can lead to people trying anything no matter the cost in the hope that this may finally be the product to fix it all. Brands know this and absolutely exploit those in need.\" Dr. Amhed also recommends making use of retailer offers. Similarly, you can use subscribe-and-save with repeated, regular purchases. Finally, Loubatieres notes that it's important to consider all elements of your life and how they relate to your condition in order to manage it holistically. \"Evaluating your lifestyle, diet, allergies, stress levels, sleep, and how these correlate to flare-ups is so important.\" Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor.",
