  "description": "I've been doing my makeup for a long time, but it's never occurred to me to venture into SPF products. After all, I'm a routine type of girl, so once I find a product that works well for me, I stick to it. Being that beauty's entered the era of hybrid and multiuse products, there's one item that's successfully found its way into my arsenal (and quickly becoming one of my favorites) - the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick ($28). This new offering is the beauty world's first blush-meets-bronzer infused with SPF 50. And since the brand's previous blush/bronzer sold out seven times, trying this iteration in stick form was a no-brainer. While all the girls have raved about blush in recent trend cycles (think Hailey Bieber's \"strawberry girl\" blush or TikTok's jelly doughnut blush trend), I've stuck to my barely-there powder blush. I've always been more comfortable with my bronzing skills to achieve the warm makeup look. Regardless, I hadn't tried a blush and bronzer balm until now, and I can confidently say that I won't be going back to powder products anytime soon. Keep reading for my full review of the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick and find out why it's become a staple in my makeup routine. About the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick Its vegan, cruelty-free, and non-comedogenic. It comes in three shades: Pink Pop, Dusty Pink, and Bronze. The stick is made with ingredients like peptides, antioxidant-rich Vitamin E, and avocado seed extract to stimulate collagen production, strengthen the skin's barrier, and repair damage caused by stressors like UV radiation and pollution. You can wear it as a finishing step in your skin-care routine or combine it with other makeup products. What I Like About the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick As someone who doesn't rely on applying too much blush, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed using this hybrid balm stick from Naked Sundays. After completing my go-to complexion routine, I proceeded to swipe the stick onto my face, and the formula felt super lightweight. I'm usually cautious when it comes to layering products since I have normal-to-oily skin, but once I swiped it a few times, it brought about a naturally glowy dimension. I always aim to do warm-looking glam, so it was pleasing to find that this bronzer-meets-blush did just that in one fell swoop (I used the shades Dusty Pink and Bronze). I also loved that this product nourished my skin while making me shine, as makeup products can be harsh on bare skin at times. And though it's a sunscreen, it didn't leave that dreaded white cast - only a dewy, matte finish. After applying, I went in with my usual setting products and was ready for my night out. How to Use the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick The Naked Sundays SPF 50 Peptide Stick comes in a handy, easy-to-use cylindrical tube where you can turn the stick so that the product comes up. Whether you're using it on a full face of makeup or your bare skin, you can swipe the stick directly onto the cheekbones. Then, tap the product into your skin with your fingertips or even a fluffy brush, blending it upwards, toward your temples (I found the brush to work best). Feel free to blend or reapply until you get your desired finish. If you're using the stick as a bronzer, you can follow the same process along the length of your nose. What to Consider Before Trying the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick In case you're looking for a blush that has more pigment, I highly suggest going with the brightest shade - Pink Pop. If you choose a shade that's relatively close to your skin tone, the color may not show upon immediate application. I used Dusty Pink as my blush, and it took a few swipes to build some noticeable pigment. This balm should only be applied as an added layer of SPF and makeup, not as a replacement, so be sure to still use your trusted face sunscreen before using it. Where Is the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick Available? The Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick is available on the brand's website.

I used Dusty Pink as my blush, and it took a few swipes to build some noticeable pigment.
