  "description": "Staying current on social media trends is no easy feat. Every day, a new concept or technique seems to make waves on the internet. The latest? The \"blue nail theory.\" If you're curious about this, you're not the only one; it was one of the top 10 trending searches on Google in 2024. As it turns out, the blue nail theory isn't too dissimilar from the viral \"red nail theory.\" It has to do with your nail polish color and what it signifies. To learn more about this phenomenon, keep reading. Experts Featured in This Article Mi Nguyen is a nail artist and licensed master nail educator based in Charlotte, North Carolina. What Is the Blue Nail Theory? According to blue nail theory, if you ask your partner what color you should paint your nails, there's a strong chance their answer will be blue if they're a man. Many people recorded videos asking their significant others this very question to test it. Sabrina Smith was told \"light blue\" in the video she posted, while Hollie Thompson shared a similar experience with her partner in a different video. Some people say that blue nails are a code to signify your relationship status, letting others know you're off the market with just a glance at your fingertips. Though it may have started as a coincidence, it has evolved into the trend that we see on social media. To tap into the blue nail theory, whether you're in a relationship or not, nail artist Mi Nguyen recommends opting for soft blues and pastels. \"It can symbolize that you're calm and settled,\" she says. In general, blue nails have increasingly grown in popularity recently. Nguyen believes the interest in the shade is due, in part, to Sofia Richie and other celebrities who spearheaded the \"blueberry-milk\" nail trend. \"Blues used to be a color people thought was a bit wild, but on the contrary, it actually can be very chic and classy.\" Sydney Wingfield has been a freelance writer in the beauty and wellness space for six years.
