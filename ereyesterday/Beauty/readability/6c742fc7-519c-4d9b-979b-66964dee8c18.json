  "text": "It’s starting to feel like the holiday season is here! Especially as the weather has shifted. We just put up our Christmas tree last night and are going to decorate it soon! With cooler dry temperatures my skin has definitely needed some adjustments in my routine. This is the first year I feel like my skin has been extra sensitive and dry. Here are a few things I’ve been loving lately. A number of these I’ve shared on Instagram but since there are several of you who aren’t on social I didn’t want you to miss out so I’m sharing them here too. I feel like my body has experienced the most change with dry weather. Andrew has been feeling it too, so we’ve been using Shower Oils again. Right now we love the L’occitane Almond Shower Oil. I just discovered it comes in a value size and immediately ordered it. We’ve been using the standard option and go through it so fast and I love that the value size also has a pump. We’ve also used and loved the Shea Butter version but the formula is not the same and I’m actually not a huge fan of the scent. I also think some of the Shea line has been reformulated and it’s just not quite the same as it used to be. I also recently tried a new line called Cyklar and am obsessed. As a citrus lover I am head over heels in love with their Bergamot Bond and Naked Neroli Sensorial Body Washes. I received a press package with a few things and put one in my bathroom, the other in Andrew’s. We both love the gel oil-infused formula as it doesn’t dry out the skin and both smell INCREDIBLE. The line looks like it’s new and just starting, but I hope they expand these to perfumes or home scents. Osea has been another line I’ve been loving for body care. I am obsessed with the Undaria Algae Body Oil and Body Lotion. These are quite a splurge but they do have quite a few good value sets. I finally bought the full-sizes in this Undaria Body Bestsellers Duo after going through several minis. I also love the travel sizes, they’re great for travel or your purse. The Bestsellers Body Care Set went with me on my October trips. I love the thick oil for extra hydration and the lotion absorbs well into the skin. I’ve started using a new LED light mask and it is INCREDIBLE. I have been a fan of LED treatments for a while now and the Foreo FAQ 202 LED Mask is the most comfortable lightweight LED mask I have ever tried. I partnered with them to share a look at how I use it (see it in action and my favorite treatment here). I love that it’s cord-free and curved to mold to the shape of your face. It has 8 wavelengths and you can customize the intensity, pick your own light treatment or use their pre-programmed treatments via their app. I have been using it consistently 3-4 times per week and after a recent skin freak out, I can’t tell you how much I love this mask. It has been a game changer and really worked to calm it down with the Cyan LED, Blue LED and Yellow LED. It’s quite a splurge but they’ve given me a promo code to use for the Foreo website, use code SABRINAS10 to save an extra 10% off all items. They have some great Black Friday deals and bundles going on right now. The code also works on top of the sale items (discount will be shown at checkout). I’m contemplating one of the LEDs for hair. My hair stylist said one of her clients splurged on the big ones that go on the entire top of the head and it really worked for her. I might try one of the smaller ones as Foreo has two that look really interesting. Hair and scalp also need some changes for me, but luckily I don’t need to completely overhaul my routine. I started using the Kerastase Nutritive line again. It’s great for dry hair but doesn’t weight it down. I love the Split Ends Serum and Hydrating Scalp Serum. I’ve tried nearly every Kerastase scalp treatment and there are so many great one, but I really love the Nutritive one right now. They’re having a friends and family sale for 20% off sitewide with code FRIENDS24 (sets are excluded). They will most likely have some more promos for Black Friday and Cyber week as well. For perfume I am loving all the discovery sets for the holiday season. I’ll have a few roundups soon (plus some giveaways). Guerlain makes some of the most exquisite scents but finding a nearby counter isn’t always easy. I love their discovery sets and they have their classic 8-Piece L’Art and La Matiere Perfumer’s Set in Iconic Harmony and Floral Harmony. They also added two new variations with a 3-piece Iconic Eaux de Parfum Set and 6-piece Les Extraits Signature Set. More on these soon, but I wanted to put them on your radar. I have purchased a few full-sized Guerlain perfumes in the past year but never realized you can customize and personalize the bottles! The Guerlain team gifted a Musc Outreblanc bottle with my name engraved on the back and a custom plated cap + ribbon/cord seal. As someone who has almost never ever been able to find my name available on any personalized items, anytime I have “Sabrina” on something it’s extra special. The second I opened the bottle I gasped. It’s something I will treasure! I’ve gone down a rabbit hole with perfumes and another line I recently started exploring is The Harmonist. I’ve tried two scents so far (more on these soon) and I am in love with Moon Glory which is a beautiful honey scent. I can’t wait to try more. For skincare I’ve been relying on my usual go-to’s but can’t rave enough about the La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream. I know it is quite the splurge but I’ve been keeping this on my nightstand to apply at night and love it. It’s really made a huge difference and I am one who really doesn’t like to wear anything on my face at night. This one has the perfect consistency to hydrate without making me feel like a grease ball. Currently sold out at Sephora but in stock at Nordstrom. A few makeup loves. I actually have a lot of recent favorites, but a couple shout outs. I am so happy to hear that many of you have also loved the new Tom Ford Lip Color reformulation and found some new loves. My go-to lip for the past week has been the Lip Color in Spanish Pink combined with the Lip Pencil in 101 Close Up (both reviewed + swatched here). The eyeshadow palette that has been getting me the most compliments is the Urban Decay Moondust Quad. It’s still available at Kohl’s x Sephora if you have been thinking about it I recommend acting fast. (More gift ideas under $50 from Kohl’s here). I’m still thinking about the one that’s exclusive to Ulta Beauty too. That wraps up some things I’ve been loving lately! Will be sharing some gift guides soon but wanted to quickly mention the Holiday Monogram Bistro Mugs are back. I think they’re so cute and make a great gift under $15. The red and green letters are so festive for the holidays. I also have the standard black tile ones. I ordered the holiday ones last year for a number of friends. Andrew loves his. Stay tuned for some holiday gift guides, a few holiday makeup collection reviews and some fun giveaways!",
