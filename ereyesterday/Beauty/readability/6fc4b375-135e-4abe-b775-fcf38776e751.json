  "description": "Fall has only just arrived, but that doesn’t mean we’re not already looking ahead to what this year’s holiday season will have to offer. (That is, if you’ve been good this year.) And while it may feel early — after all, Halloween is two months away — that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
