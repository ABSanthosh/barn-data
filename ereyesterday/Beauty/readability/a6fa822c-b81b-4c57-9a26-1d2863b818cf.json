  "description": "Viral skin-care hacks and products are so plentiful that it's almost impossible to discern which ones are actually worth your time, energy, and money (thank you, TikTok). However, occasionally, a product breaks through the noise and actually lives up to the hype. Case in point: the viral Qure Micro Infusion System ($119), which yields glowy, even-toned skin and supercharges your entire skin-care routine. Plus, you can opt for a month supply option: a Qure Micro Infusion System 3 Month Supply ($149, originally $357), which is nearly 60 percent off. Celebrity aesthetician Shani Darden swears by Qure's Micro-Infusion System so much that it has become a staple in her personal routine. It's also endorsed by top dermatologists Dr. Dendy Engelman and Dr. Muneeb Shah. As a beauty editor who tries products and treatments for a living, I'm sometimes cautious about at-home treatments that mimic in-office procedures. But since this one has earned the seal of approval from numerous pros, I was game to test it out. Before I get into the specifics of Qure's Micro-Infusion System and what happened when I tried it, it's important to note that needles are involved in this at-home treatment. Contrary to what you may think, it's extremely different from using a derma roller or at-home microneedling, which has earned mixed reviews. While both help skin-care ingredients penetrate deeper and spur collagen production by creating little microtears in the skin, the improper use of derma rollers (rolling needles) can damage skin, while micro-infusion uses a stamping method with sterile, delicate needles. This method prevents skin damage caused by blunt needles and inadequate technique. Even if you've never used an at-home micro-infusion system, there's no need to worry about damaging your skin or doing it incorrectly. With this system, you can safely transform your complexion at home. About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Customizable to your skin needs – there's a system to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, and another one for fine lines and wrinkles. A safe, at-home microneedling-like product that \"stamps\" your skin with 24K gold 0.5mm needles that are thinner than human hair. Virtually painless and with minimal-to-no downtime. Infuses the skin with active ingredients through microchannels. Helps to boost hydration for a plump and dewy appearance. Reduces the appearance of fine lines, pores, and dark spots. What I Like About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Even though it sounds complicated, Qure's Micro-Infusion System is easy to use: The instructions are clear and the system comes with disposable microneedles to ensure your tools are new and sterile with each use. Additionally, in-office microneedling and Aquagold (an in-office micro-infusion treatment) can run you hundreds of dollars a visit, while the Qure Micro-Infusion System is cost-effective and provides comparable results. I like to use the system before bed and love that it takes less than 10 minutes - perfect for a busy schedule, especially if you can't spare the time (let alone the money) to go for an in-office treatment. How to Use the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System The system consists of four easy steps and comes with six serum concentrates and replaceable needle heads. Step one involves filling the chamber of the device (where the serum is housed) with the serum concentrate that will be micro-infused into your skin. For the second step, turn the chamber upside down for one to two minutes to allow the serum to seep into the needles. I advise washing your face at this time so that it's nice and clean. Next, remove the lid from the microneedles and begin infusing the serum into your skin with a stamping motion. Start at the center of your face and work your way around, exhibiting care to cover all areas of your face. Though it's best to start off with one pass, if you feel that your skin can handle it (and if you're gentle enough), you can pass twice over areas that you may have missed or want to treat again. If you choose to use the needles around your eyes, be extra cautious and gentle. Finally, place the lid back on the needle head, twist it off, and dispose of it. You will use a new needle head for your next treatment. If you have any leftover serum, which you probably will, gently pat it on your face and neck and allow it to absorb overnight. Follow with your favorite gentle moisturizer and then clean out the chamber and discard any remaining serum. Darden recommends stamping with 50 percent overlap to ensure that you cover every area of your face. Qure recommends harnessing the treatment every two weeks, with full results shown after three uses. However, I noticed significant results a day or two after a single treatment. As with any skin care, the more consistent you are, the more benefits you'll accrue from the system over time. What to Consider Before Trying the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System It's important to consider if you'll actually be consistent with the treatment in order to see the best results possible. Additionally, since there are needles involved (granted, they are thinner than human hair), there's an element of discomfort with the treatment: It's minimal but still present. When you first start using it, you'll feel a slight pricking feeling as the device goes into your skin. If needles on any level make you feel uncomfortable, micro-infusion may not be for you. You may also experience some slight redness afterward. Steer clear of using the system if your skin is currently irritated or sensitized, and avoid using it on active acne. You also don't want to apply chemical exfoliants or other harsh topical products immediately after using it. Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Worth the Splurge? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is absolutely worth the splurge, whether you want to maximize your existing skin-care routine or prepare for a special occasion. The results are blatant - my glow after using the treatment speaks for itself. You'll notice hydrated, radiant, and healthy-looking skin. Where Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Available? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is available at QureSkincare.com.

Additionally, in-office microneedling and Aquagold (an in-office micro-infusion treatment) can run you hundreds of dollars a visit, while the Qure Micro-Infusion System is cost-effective and provides comparable results. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eI like to use the system before bed and love that it takes less than 10 minutes — perfect for a busy schedule, especially if you can\u0026#39;t spare the time (let alone the money) to go for an in-office treatment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to Use the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eThe system consists of four easy steps and comes with six serum concentrates and replaceable needle heads. Step one involves filling the chamber of the device (where the serum is housed) with the serum concentrate that will be micro-infused into your skin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eFor the second step, turn the chamber upside down for one to two minutes to allow the serum to seep into the needles. I advise washing your face at this time so that it\u0026#39;s nice and clean. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eNext, remove the lid from the microneedles and begin infusing the serum into your skin with a stamping motion. Start at the center of your face and work your way around, exhibiting care to cover all areas of your face. Though it\u0026#39;s best to start off with one pass, if you feel that your skin can handle it (and if you\u0026#39;re gentle enough), you can pass twice over areas that you may have missed or want to treat again. If you choose to use the needles around your eyes, be extra cautious and gentle. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\"\u003eFinally, place the lid back on the needle head, twist it off, and dispose of it. You will use a new needle head for your next treatment. If you have any leftover serum, which you probably will, gently pat it on your face and neck and allow it to absorb overnight. Follow with your favorite gentle \u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/skinmedica-tns-ceramide-treatment-cream-review-49388078\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emoisturizer\u003c/a\u003e and then clean out the chamber and discard any remaining serum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003eDarden recommends stamping with 50 percent overlap to ensure that you cover every area of your face. Qure recommends harnessing the treatment every two weeks, with full results shown after three uses. However, I noticed significant results a day or two after a single treatment. As with any skin care, the more consistent you are, the more benefits you\u0026#39;ll accrue from the system over time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wOc8_Y03OpqEBp6tejdSHpEdtLI=/fit-in/792x1006/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/27/779/n/1922153/tmp_M9or4g_5e4959dcce9a382d_image1_2_.jpeg\" alt=\"qure skincare review\" width=\"792\" height=\"1006\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wOc8_Y03OpqEBp6tejdSHpEdtLI=/fit-in/792x1006/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/27/779/n/1922153/tmp_M9or4g_5e4959dcce9a382d_image1_2_.jpeg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mjYUAyb9S2HA5yVFA-wtR8s8OjU=/fit-in/1584x2012/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/27/779/n/1922153/tmp_M9or4g_5e4959dcce9a382d_image1_2_.jpeg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Taryn Brooke\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Trying the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eIt\u0026#39;s important to consider if you\u0026#39;ll actually be consistent with the treatment in order to see the best results possible. Additionally, since there are needles involved (granted, they are thinner than human hair), there\u0026#39;s an element of discomfort with the treatment: It\u0026#39;s minimal but still present. When you first start using it, you\u0026#39;ll feel a slight pricking feeling as the device goes into your skin. If needles on any level make you feel uncomfortable, micro-infusion may not be for you. You may also experience some slight redness afterward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eSteer clear of using the system if your skin is currently irritated or \u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-skin-care-routine-sensitive-skin-48449799\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esensitized\u003c/a\u003e, and avoid using it on active acne.
