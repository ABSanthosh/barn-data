  "text": "You may be a fan of drinking French wine, but have you ever considered the potential benefits of putting it on your face? Wine byproducts have been used in skin care for decades, from wine-powered masks and peels to lines like Caudalie’s Vinopur, a favorite of French girls everywhere. But like any sommelier will tell you, not all wines are created equal, and neither are wine-infused skin care lines. Enter Dior L’Or de Vie, which is the luxury house’s latest (and most expensive) skin care line. It’s formulated using byproducts from Dior’s private Sauternes vineyard, Château d’Yquem, where the grapes benefit from a special kind of fungus known as “noble rot.” This fungus helps give Sauternes wines their signature sweet taste, but it’s also a key ingredient in Dior’s L’Or de Vie skin care line, which has been reformulated for the first time since its creation in 2006.Dior L’Or de Vie la CrèmeL’Or de Vie features a serum, an eye and lip contour cream, a lotion, a day cream, and a night cream, all with exceptional anti-aging properties thanks in part to the formulation’s new Golden Drop Longevity Technology. This technology promises some pretty incredible immediate results, including 30 percent increased collagen production, and a boost of radiance, softness, and firmness with just one application. According to Dior, “After 30 years of research, Dior’s most exclusive line bestows on the skin the gift of longevity, helping to correct the signs of time. An extraordinary power is rooted in the quest for Reverse Aging. By moving beyond simply correcting the signs of age, L’Or de Vie seems to reverse the signs of aging and rejuvenate skin. Refreshed and revitalized by the key ingredients of the Golden Drop Longevity Technology, skin youth markers return to a state of that of a 25-year-old skin.” Sign us up.If the $1,700 L’Or de Vie La Creme isn’t luxurious enough for you, there’s also the 2003 L’Or de Vie Le Ceremonial Vintage pack, a limited-edition, annually released serum ritual derived from Yquem grapes that will run you $3,200, but promises to “activate, rebuild and restore the visible youthfulness of the skin.” The month-long intensive treatment protocol will give your face a crash-course in Sauternes skin care.Dior L’Or de Vie Le Cérémonial Millésime 2023And if that’s still not enough to sway you, you could be one of five people to nab the extra limited edition L’Or de Vie La Creme jar, made of hand-blown Murano glass by the French artist Aristide Najean. Price available upon request, of course. Otherwise, the normal gold and glass jar will just have to do.Jessica Roy is the former Digital Director of ELLE.com.
