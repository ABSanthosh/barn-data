  "description": "Anyone who uses TikTok is most likely aware that the platform is home to some pretty wild claims. Whether it's users saying that showering with the toilet open causes acne or people recommending hemorrhoid cream to get rid of under-eye bags, out-of-the-box ideas are never hard to come by. I've made it my personal mission to mythbust as many of them as I possibly can, which usually involves chatting with dermatologists and other beauty experts in the industry. Last year, when I saw a few videos going viral on the platform claiming that Vaseline works better than mascara - with some pretty convincing video evidence to go with it - my first question was whether or not it was safe. After speaking with a handful of ophthalmologists who confirmed that using occlusives like Vaseline, Aquaphor, and petroleum jelly near the eyes was safe as long as they weren't getting directly in the eye, I decided I needed to try it out. Plus, \"ghost lashes\" are currently trending right now, which is a fancy way of saying eyelashes without mascara, and I figured this would be a great way to test out the pared down look all while using a fuck hack. @mar.hacks Invisible mascara hack!! #makeup #makeuptutorial #beauty #beautyhack #hacksbymar #makeupartist #makeuphacks #makeuplook #mascara #mascarahacks #eyelashes #beautytips #beautytok #AmazonMusicProudHeroes #MakeNightsEpic #CatchChobaniOatmilk #vaseline #vaselinehacks #beautytutorial ♬ Aesthetic - Tollan Kim I have short, stubby lashes. If you're staring at me head-on, chances are you won't even know my eyelashes exist. When I'm putting on makeup, I typically curl them and layer on mascara like my life depends on it. No matter what kind of product I use - I've even tried waterproof formulas - my lashes fall flat by the end of the day. Not to mention, I'm constantly dealing with fallout, flakes, and clumps from the thick coating I have on. When I first decided to try this hack for myself, I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure if the Aquaphor would be too heavy on my lashes, and to be honest, despite getting approval from a doctor, I was still a little freaked out that I was going to get an eye infection. Luckily, neither of those things happened. I've been using this hack for the last few months and it's completely changed the game for me. The only time I wear mascara is if I'm going out for the night, but otherwise, it's completely replaced my need for the product - especially in my day-to-day life. Doing the hack is easy. I start by taking my tube of Aquaphor ($6) and squeezing a tiny bit onto the back of my hand. (I always make sure to wash my hands first.) Then, I curl the eyelashes on both of my eyes with the Kevyn Aucoin Eyelash Curler ($26). From there, I take a clean spoolie (I use one from an eyebrow product that I've never used), dip it in the Aquaphor, and gently coat my lashes with a tiny bit of the formula. Then, I take a different spoolie to make sure everything is spread out evenly, and I go over my eyelashes with the curler one more time. Not only does this hack curl my lashes better than any other mascara or trick I've tried, but the curl actually lasts all day long - even when I rub my eyes. Honestly, the only thing that gets the curl to fall is when I use a cleanser to wash my face at the end of the night. This is hands down the best hack I've ever learned from TikTok because it's made my life so much easier. I can look put together in a minute flat just by doing this to my eyelashes, and I constantly have people asking me if I got a lash lift. Now, if only Aquaphor would make a version of this product with eyelash-conditioning ingredients, I'd be set for life.

Honestly, the only thing that gets the curl to fall is when I use a cleanser to wash my face at the end of the night. This is hands down the best hack I\u0026#39;ve ever learned from TikTok because it\u0026#39;s made my life so much easier. I can look put together in a minute flat just by doing this to my eyelashes, and I constantly have people asking me if I got a lash lift. Now, if only Aquaphor would make a version of this product with eyelash-conditioning ingredients, I\u0026#39;d be set for life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Lashes at 5:24 PM\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"10\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/5aWfxT0S32iDkt3fJGIxFxdNdDw=/fit-in/792x370/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/08/907/n/1922153/tmp_RRhAVo_efe48a4ba76f96f2_Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_12.46.23_PM.png\" alt=\"TikTok Invisible Mascara Hack Editor Experiment\" width=\"792\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/5aWfxT0S32iDkt3fJGIxFxdNdDw=/fit-in/792x370/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/08/907/n/1922153/tmp_RRhAVo_efe48a4ba76f96f2_Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_12.46.23_PM.png 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ZoLr_PfGO4797IhIdx5B794eF5E=/fit-in/1584x740/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/11/08/907/n/1922153/tmp_RRhAVo_efe48a4ba76f96f2_Screenshot_2024-11-08_at_12.46.23_PM.png 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePOPSUGAR Photography | Renee Rodriguez\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"11\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/renee-rodriguez\"\u003eRenee Rodriguez\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
