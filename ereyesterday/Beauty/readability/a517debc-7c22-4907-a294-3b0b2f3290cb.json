  "description": "Anyone who knows me knows that I am a Dyson stan, through and through. I've been obsessed with my Dyson Airwrap ever since I first got it, and it's helped me style my hair in all of my different eras. The short bob, the awkward medium length, and even ultra-long (the style I'm currently trying to get back to). I love my Dyson flat iron (yeah, the one Hailey Bieber uses), and I'm also equally obsessed with my Dyson blow dryer. So, when I heard the brand was coming out with a consumer version of their professional hair dryer, the Dyson Supersonic R, I knew I wanted to test it out. It has different attachments made for all hair types, and its design was created with ergonomics in mind - it's made with an \"r\" curve that makes it easier to hold. Plus, there are RFID sensors in each attachment that communicate directly with the hair dryer so the motor and heater adjust based on how you're looking to style your hair (like the Nural). Talk about futuristic. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer ($570, launching on March 6) and find out if it's worth the hefty price tag. About the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer It comes with five different attachments: a wide tooth comb, an air attachment, a flyaway attachment, a concentrator, and a diffuser. The curved \"r\" shape makes it easier to hold. The attachments contain RFID sensors to adjust the heat and speed settings. It's made to be used on all hair types. What I Like About the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer I've been using my Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer for years now - I have a very old version that I bought refurbished back in 2017, and it's been my trusty sidekick ever since. I haven't had any issues with it; however, it is a bit bulky and a little large to travel with. The new Supersonic R is much lighter than the older Supersonic I've been using. The design looks completely different, and to be honest, I was a little taken aback when I tested it for the first time. It almost looks as though you're about to pour water over your head with a garden hose, but it's genuinely so functional and easy to use, I was blown away. (Pun kind of intended.) Already did your arm workout for the day? Don't worry, this is so light you'll barely notice you're holding it. Need to get somewhere quick? The airflow is fast AF and will get the job done in a snap. Plus, the five attachments make styling my hair extremely easy no matter what look I'm going for, from my natural waves to my bouncy blowout. How to Use the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer The Supersonic R is extremely easy to use. It has a power on button, temperature and airflow control settings, and a cold shot button. It comes with five different attachments for all of your styling needs. The concentrator can be used in conjunction with a tool like a round brush to get precise airflow wherever you need it; the air attachment will give you regular air for rough drying; the diffuser is perfect for anyone with curls, waves, or coils; the wide-tooth comb attachment can be used to detangle hair while you dry it; and lastly, there's a flyaway attachment, which can be used to smooth down hair. I typically start off by using the regular air attachment to rough dry, then switch over to the concentrator, which I use with a round brush. From there, I finish things off with the flyaway attachment to make sure my roots are smooth. What to Consider Before Trying the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer One thing to note is that the brand recommends you clean the filter on the blow dryer regularly to maintain your dryer's functionality. I've never cleaned my old dryer's filter, but I'm planning on monthly filter maintenance moving forward because I want this product to last as long as possible. Where the Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer Is Available The Dyson Supersonic R Hair Dryer is available directly on the brand's website as of March 7, 2025.
