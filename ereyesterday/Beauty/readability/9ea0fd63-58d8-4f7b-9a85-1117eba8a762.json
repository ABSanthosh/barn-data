  "description": "Here to offer a welcome reprieve from the less-than-best days of late: ColourPop is launching a \"Tangled\" collection, and it's as cute as it is functional. This drop is the latest in a long list of Disney x ColourPop mashups - most recently, the brand revealed a \"Toy Story\" collection, a \"Haunted Mansion\" collab, and even a \"Winnie the Pooh\" set. Each line pays true homage to beloved characters and movie moments. And this month, on April 24, \"Tangled\" fans finally get their fix. \"Tangled,\" which came out in 2010, has long been a Disney fan favorite, and there have even been talks of turning it into a live-action movie, though nothing is officially in the works yet. To hold you over, ColourPop is launching a nine-piece collection that features liquid highlighters, eyeshadow palettes, lip glosses, and more. Plus, it even includes some fun hair accessories since \"Tangled\" is a movie about magic hair, after all. The full collection launches on April 24 on ColourPop.com and will expand into Ulta stores and Ulta.com on April 27. Lucky for you we have an exclusive sneak preview of everything that's dropping - plus swatches of what each one looks like in real life - so you can start planning your purchases now ahead of the launch date.",
