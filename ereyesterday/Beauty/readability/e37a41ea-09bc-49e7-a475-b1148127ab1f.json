  "description": "Megan Fox's tattoo collection has been in the works since she was 18 years old, but over the last few years, she's really given it a major update. In general, Fox has undergone quite a metamorphosis recently. After taking a break from the spotlight, she's back and making a big, big splash - from her engagement to Machine Gun Kelly back in January 2022 (and their many subsequent shocking red carpet moments) to countless major beauty transformations. It's no secret that Fox is a big fan of body art. Her current collection includes over 15 known pieces spanning her arms, back, ribs, and neck. This total includes one matching tattoo with MGK and another couple tattoo for ex-husband Brian Austin Green, which she recently covered. She has spoken openly about going through the process of removing a few of her older designs. This includes her first-ever - and arguably most iconic - design: Marilyn Monroe's portrait on her forearm. Fox's ink is primarily done in one cohesive traditional tattoo style using all-black ink, but she does have a couple of small colorful designs. She has a few quote tattoos in gothic lettering, as well as an original poem etched on her side in a similar fashion. The actor also has a design of the phrase \"the darkest fairytale\" scribbled on her inner forearm, which was done by Kelly himself; he has a matching design on his hip. And as if that wasn't enough, Fox's most recent design is a full sleeve, which she debuted at the 2024 Grammys. Before that, she had a tattoo session in July 2023 that yielded 19 new finger tattoos, proving she's not finished building her portfolio. Each design has a special meaning behind it, so to learn all about Megan Fox's tattoos, keep reading.",
