If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. There are so many beauty brands these days that it’s hard to keep track. The sentiment is echoed by makeup artist, entrepreneur, and industry legend Bobbi Brown, whose second act beauty brand, Jones Road, was founded on the belief that the world needs fewer but better beauty products — not just more items to fill shelves. Enter a tightly edited range of chic, uncomplicated products that don’t require you to be a makeup master like Brown herself. The mogul first made waves in the early ’90s with her eponymous cosmetics line, which “revolutionized the beauty industry by glamorizing natural tones in makeup,” according to the entrepreneur. After stepping away from that brand in 2016, she launched Jones Road with the same less-is-more ethos, updated for the 2020s. Another core tenet of Jones Road is its extensive no-no list of ingredients that will never be found in products. (These include, but are not limited to: phthalates, sulfates, petrolatum, PEGs, cyclic silicones, EDTA, or BPA.) As a lifelong beauty lover, I was intrigued by the prospect of low-key but high-quality makeup. I embarked on a journey to test several of Jones Road’s most popular products to see if they were worth the hype. Keep reading for my honest take on nine bestsellers ranging from the Miracle Balm to its shimmery Just A Sec cream eyeshadow. DashDividers_1_500x100 Miracle Balm, $40 My favorite product from my Jones Road test-o-rama is unquestionably the Miracle Balm. I now own several shades ranging from  Tawny ( a warm, bronze terracotta) to Pinky Bronze, a previously limited-edition shade that was added to the permanent lineup last year. The pigmentation is very sheer but can be built up if desired. I’m a big fan of multipurpose lip and cheek cream tints since they give the prettiest, natural-looking flush. I’ve been using this non-stop, and it earned full MVP status during a recent ski trip in Sun Valley. When I’m in the mountains, my normally oily skin becomes insanely dry and flaky. The balm’s emollient and gentle texture is perfect for adding much-needed moisture to my cheeks, which typically get the driest. It’s also great for adding a barely-there tint to chapped lips and prepping them for lipstick while I do the rest of my makeup. The balm needs to be warmed up before applying, which is perfect for people like me who love applying makeup with (clean!) fingers. At $40, it’s among the more expensive items in the Jones Road range, but the amount of product more than makes up for it. The packaging is about the size of a petri dish — a lot for a balm! I don’t see myself finishing it anytime soon. Fragrance – Shower, $46 Jones Road’s first (and for now, only) fragrance is the equivalent of the perfect white T-shirt. It’s light, airy and features citrusy notes of neroli and orange blossom, with a hint of fresh sea spray. I don’t normally care for aquatic scents, but this one is balanced with subtle floral undertones, too. The result is a clean, just-showered skin scent that’s never overpowering, just delightfully crisp. The price point is smart, too; $46 for a full-size bottle (or $18 for a rollerball) makes it an affordable everyday luxury. What The Foundation, $46 This product went viral a couple of years ago, partially thanks to influencer Meredith Duxbury’s TikTok video, where she applied a concerningly large amount to her face (shudders). However, when applied properly, it’s actually really nice, providing a dewy, luminous finish that looks like real skin. While I generally liked it, I think there are better options for my skin type (I’m 31 with very few lines and wrinkles). Although WRF isn’t heavy by any means, it was creamier than what I typically prefer. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though — I could it being amazing for dry or mature skin due to its hydrating properties. For me, it won’t replace my everyday foundation. Also worth noting: The generously sized jar could easily last for months.  Gel Liner, $32 My go-to gel liner for years was Bobbi Brown’s, but she’s officially dethroned, well, herself with Jones Road’s version. It’s creamy, insanely pigmented, and lasts all day. Gel liner can seem intimidating, but this product makes it easy with the matching brush, whose small, precise bristles get close to the lash line while still allowing easy blending. I have it in both black and violet, and it’s also available in brown and navy. In the world of gel liners, this is the new one to beat.  Eye Cream, $36 I don’t wear eye cream every day, but Jones Road’s just might become my new go-to. Often, eye creams can be too buttery and rich, but this one is light with a whipped, gel-like texture. It works well even without under-eye concealer, instantly hydrating and brightening my eye area without slipping under makeup. Just A Sec Eyeshadow, $28 This eyeshadow is capital P pretty and quickly became one of my favorites. I tried the shade Golden Peach _ a shimmery, warm, light gold. The texture is cushiony and soft, making it really easy to apply and blend. Although it comes in a tiny pot, you don’t need much to achieve an impressive payoff. I even used it to add a subtle highlight to my cheekbones. I like to think Bobbi would be proud of the artistry. The Best Eyeshadow, $26 My first thought: This stuff is seriously pigmented. I tried the matte shade Dark Brown, an espresso hue. (There are also plenty of neutral mattes and shimmer shades available.) For a more natural effect, you can use it alone to define the lash line or layer it over eyeliner for extra impact. For a recent dinner date, I created a smoky eye with Bobbi Brown’s Ultra Fine Eye Liner Brush (which is amazing for detail), starting at the lash line and carefully blending upward to avoid a muddy result. You can add lighter shadows on the lid and inner corner for extra dimension, but I loved how the Jones Road shadow delivered an effortless, one-and-done feel all on its own. Though the product is minimal, its pigmentation ensures you won’t run out anytime soon — a good problem to have! The Best Pencil, $24 Eyeliner is one of my favorite products to use, whether I’m doing a cat-eye, tight-lining my upper waterline for a smudged, smoky effect, or adding a pop of color with a bright blue or bright white. A black pencil is a staple, so I wanted to see how Jones Road’s stacked up. It’s challenging — borderline impossible — to achieve an intense, inky black with a “clean” product due to the absence of carbon pigments typically found in conventional black eyeliners. Thus, I wasn’t surprised that Jones Road’s pencil came out as soft black. Using small strokes, I lined the outer corner of my eyes and blended it out to create the littlest wing. (I almost never line my entire lash line since it can make my eyes look smaller.) For subtle definition, this pencil gets the job done, and I appreciate that it’s a clean formula safe for the delicate eye area. However, if you’re after a dramatic, long-wear, or waterproof formula, this might not be the best choice. Cool Gloss, $24 This quickly became another favorite, especially as someone who came of age in the 2000s — aka *the* era of glossy lips. The squeezy tube reminds me of the many glosses I toted around in my Dooney \u0026 Bourke purse back in middle school. But unlike the sticky, mirror-like pouts of the aughts, Jones Road’s take is soft and comfortable to wear. It has a tingly, minty sensation that I love, and the clear shade works perfectly as a shiny topcoat, whether worn alone or over another lip color. The tinted shades range from shimmery beige to juicy pink, ensuring there’s something for everyone. DashDividers_1_500x100 Final Thoughts After using Jones Road products for a few years now, I’m still as impressed as when I first discovered the brand. The products are easy to use and deliver an effortless level of glam. While there isn’t a bad product in the bunch, the brand, in general, is a bit expensive. I was kindly gifted products to review, but I can confidently say that I’d gladly spend money on my top faves — namely, the  Miracle Balm and the gel liner. I may have missed out on Bobbi Brown the first time around, but I’m definitely a Jones Road girl through and through. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

Though the product is minimal, its pigmentation ensures you won’t run out anytime soon — a good problem to have!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEyeliner is one of my favorite products to use, whether I\u0026#39;m doing a cat-eye, tight-lining my upper waterline for a smudged, smoky effect, or adding a pop of color with a bright blue or bright white. A black pencil is a staple, so I wanted to see how Jones Road\u0026#39;s stacked up. It’s challenging — borderline impossible — to achieve an intense, inky black with a “clean” product due to the absence of \u003ca href=\"https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/carbon-black/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecarbon pigments\u003c/a\u003e typically found in conventional black eyeliners. Thus, I wasn\u0026#39;t surprised that Jones Road\u0026#39;s pencil came out as soft black. Using small strokes, I lined the outer corner of my eyes and blended it out to create the littlest wing. (I almost never line my entire lash line since it can make my eyes look smaller.) For subtle definition, this pencil gets the job done, and I appreciate that it\u0026#39;s a clean formula safe for the delicate eye area. However, if you’re after a dramatic, long-wear, or waterproof formula, this might not be the best choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis quickly became another favorite, especially as someone who came of age in the 2000s — aka *the* era of glossy lips. The squeezy tube reminds me of the many glosses I toted around in my Dooney \u0026amp; Bourke purse back in middle school. But unlike the sticky, mirror-like pouts of the aughts, Jones Road\u0026#39;s take is soft and comfortable to wear. It has a tingly, minty sensation that I love, and the clear shade works perfectly as a shiny topcoat, whether worn alone or over another lip color. The tinted shades range from shimmery beige to juicy pink, ensuring there\u0026#39;s something for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter using Jones Road products for a few years now, I\u0026#39;m still as impressed as when I first discovered the brand. The products are easy to use and deliver an effortless level of glam. While there isn\u0026#39;t a bad product in the bunch, the brand, in general, is a bit expensive. I was kindly gifted products to review, but I can confidently say that I\u0026#39;d gladly spend money on my top faves — namely, the  Miracle Balm and the gel liner. I may have missed out on Bobbi Brown the first time around, but I\u0026#39;m definitely a Jones Road girl through and through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
