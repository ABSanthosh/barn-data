  "description": "In a sea of beauty influencers, Jackie Aina stands out as truly one of a kind. Whether you're obsessed with all things makeup or not, you've probably come across her content at least once (unless, of course, you've been living under a rock). The California-born creator is widely known for her New York Fashion Week vlogs, makeup tutorials, and GRWMs layered with candid commentary. While Aina's skillset is undoubtedly one of the best in her field, her platform's success is set on this value: the power of speaking your mind unapologetically. From pushing for shade inclusivity in beauty to diving into the \"hard\" conversations, authenticity has always been at the core of her brand. That fearless approach has opened major doors, from collaborations with cosmetic giants like Anastasia Beverly Hills to starting a fragrance brand, Forvr Mood, with her husband, Denis Asamoah. The couple launched the brand in 2020, born out of Aina's deep love of scent - well documented in her YouTube videos - and her personal experience with hyperhidrosis growing up. \"What initially started as a way to mask the fact that I sweat abnormally turned into a confidence booster and a connection to how beautiful scent can make me feel,\" she says. Her most recent move? A partnership with Mielle Organics, which Aina calls \"an easy yes.\" She fronted the brand's Kalahari Melon and Aloe Vera collection that includes a shampoo, conditioner, gel, and oil; all delivering up to five days of hydration for textured hair. The 37-year-old has long been passionate about amplifying brands that prioritize the Black community, so the collab felt like a natural fit. \"Mielle doesn't just make products for textured hair - they honor it. As a brand, they've always put Black women first, not as an afterthought. . . the natural ingredients, the intention, the education; it's all there,\" she says. \"I'm also a long-time user of the products.\" Outside of championing diversity in beauty and keep \"creating content that the gworls love,\" Aina is wholeheartedly committed to fragrance for both body and home, which can be seen in her list of must-have products. Keep scrolling to find out Aina's favorite beauty items, including her signature scent and the Mielle gel behind her juicy wash-and-gos.",
