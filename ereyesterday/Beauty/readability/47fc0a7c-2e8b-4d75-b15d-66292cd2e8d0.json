  "description": "Some people prepare for Halloween by putting out decorations. For beauty enthusiasts, Halloween is basically the Olympics, and finding the best costumes involves more than just an outfit. There's the hair to consider, the makeup, and, of course, Halloween nails. All of this can make it feel like a pretty strenuous sport. There are plenty of different routes you can take when it comes to your manicure. Whether it's something that just involves the holiday's typical orange and black color scheme or something a little more gory, the world is your oyster. Thankfully, celebrities like Megan Thee Stallion have been known to put in triple overtime this time of year, with the rapper and her go-to manicurist, Coca Michelle creating jaw-dropping looks like animated brains and bejeweled spiders in the past. Others went the opposite direction, like Vanessa Hudgens, who opted for dripping molten nail art on a black polish base. And Megan Fox took her version of the classic red manicure up a notch thanks to the addition of Halloween-inspired chrome decals. With Halloween parties well underway, there's plenty of celebrity Halloween nail inspiration to come, so we rounded up the best designs on the internet this year to get your creative juices flowing. Keep reading to see all the best celebrity Halloween manicures so far.",
