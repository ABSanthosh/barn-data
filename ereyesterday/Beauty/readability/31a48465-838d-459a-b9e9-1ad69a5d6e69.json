  "description": "It's reported that approximately 1 in 10 Americans will deal with eczema in their lifetimes, according to the National Eczema Association. So it's safe to say there are plenty of people out there who may be wondering what's causing these pesky rashes - and looking for tips to treat them. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is \"characterized as an uncomfortably itchy rash that may affect virtually any – and often multiple – parts of the skin,\" says board-certified dermatologist Serena Mraz, MD. Eczema occurs \"when the skin barrier is weakened, making it more prone to moisture loss and irritation from environmental triggers,\" says board-certified dermatologist Asmi Berry, DO, FAAD. Dr. Mraz notes that the itching can be so intense that it even interferes with sleep and daily functioning in some individuals, making it all the more important to find what could be triggering eczema. Did you know that taking overly hot showers or using fragranced products may be the culprits? \"While genetics play a major role, factors like immune system dysfunction, allergens, irritants, and stress can all contribute to flare-ups,\" Dr. Berry adds. Ahead, six sneaky eczema triggers you may not realize are causing your itchy rashes – plus, how to avoid all of them (it's easier than you might think!). Experts Featured in This Article Serena Mraz, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Solano Dermatology Associates in Northern California, with locations in Vallejo, St. Helena, and Fairfield, CA. Asmi Berry, DO, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles. Janiene Luke, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and clinical professor at the Loma Linda University Department of Dermatology in Loma Linda, CA. Taking Hot Showers Though it may seem surprising, hot showers and overwashing can actually be triggering your eczema flare-ups. \"Hot water strips the skin of its natural oils, making it drier and more prone to irritation,\" says Dr. Berry. \"Frequent washing also disrupts the skin barrier.\" How to avoid it: As tempting as it may be to hop into a steaming-hot shower or bath, stick to lukewarm showers that are 10 to 15 minutes max, says Dr. Berry. When in the shower, \"Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers, and apply moisturizer immediately after patting the skin dry.\" Using Scented Laundry Detergents, Soaps, and Fabric Softeners Though fragranced laundry products and soaps smell fresh and clean, these enticing scents can actually be secretly aggravating your skin. \"Many detergents contain fragrances, dyes, and harsh surfactants that leave residue on clothes and irritate sensitive skin,\" says Dr. Berry. It's not just detergents, though: Fragrance is a \"common trigger\" that's found in many beauty products, including perfumes, lotions, creams, hair and body products, and more, Dr. Luke adds. The chemicals in these types of products \"can lead to irritation, dryness, and flares of eczema.\" How to avoid it: Switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic detergent, and avoid fabric softeners, Dr. Berry recommends. If that's still not helping, \"you can also double-rinse clothes to remove any leftover residue,\" she says. When shopping for lotions, moisturizers, and other skin and hair products, look at the labels of the products to make sure they are fragrance-free, says Dr. Luke. She recommends formulas specifically created for sensitive skin and that are free of fragrance, dyes, and other chemicals. \"When cleaning, use cotton-lined gloves to protect skin,\" she adds. Skipping Moisturizer Not moisturizing enough or using the wrong moisturizer can be your worst enemy in the fight against eczema. Without proper hydration, \"the skin barrier becomes compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to trigger inflammation,\" says Dr. Berry. How to avoid it: \"Use a thick, fragrance-free moisturizer with ceramides and hyaluronic acid twice a day, especially after bathing,\" says Dr. Berry. For extra dry skin, she recommends adding another layer of protection by applying an ointment like petrolatum over your moisturizer at night. This is referred to as body slugging for eczema, which can be very effective. Cold, Dry Weather Ever feel like your eczema is spiraling out of control in the winter? You're not the only one. \"Eczema can flare in colder, dry temperatures due to decreased moisture and humidity in the air,\" says Dr. Luke. \"In addition, using indoor heaters in colder weather can also strip moisture from the skin.\" How to avoid it: Escaping to a humid, tropical destination sounds divine - you don't have to tell us twice that we should escape to Hawaii to minimize eczema breakouts - but unfortunately, that's not the most realistic solution. Instead, counteract the cold, dry weather by staying extra moisturized. \"During the winter, look for thicker creams or ointments,\" recommends Dr. Luke. \"Moisturizers are classified by the amount of oil and water they contain. Ointments have the highest oil content, followed by creams, followed by lotions.\" You can also increase the moisture in the air within your space using a humidifier. High Stress Levels \"Stress increases cortisol levels, which can disrupt immune function and trigger inflammation,\" says Dr. Berry both of which can lead to eczema flares. A side effect of stress is insomnia or poor sleep patterns. \"Poor sleep also weakens the skin barrier and reduces healing,\" she says. How to avoid it: When possible, prioritize stress management techniques like deep breathing, exercise, or meditation, Dr. Berry advises. Plus, \"create a consistent bedtime routine and keep your bedroom cool and humidified to support skin hydration,\" she says. Eating Certain Foods First, let's get this clear: Dr. Luke notes that foods do not cause eczema - this is a common misconception. However, \"certain foods like milk, eggs, soy, nuts, and wheat can trigger eczema flares,\" she says. How to avoid it: If you notice you have a flare-up when consuming a particular food, try removing it from your diet and seeking an alternative, Dr. Luke recommends. Additionally, doing your best to \"avoid highly processed foods, include fermented foods in the diet, and focus on a plant-forward, whole food-based diet will help keep inflammation down and maintain general skin health,\" says Dr. Mraz. She advises incorporating foods rich in omega-3s, such as ground flax seeds, chia seeds, salmon, sardines, walnuts, seaweed, spirulina, and chlorella.
