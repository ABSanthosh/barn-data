  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring CapsuleDesigned with transitional dressing and warmer days in mind, H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring Capsule collection features tailored wardrobe essentials with flowing fabrics and voluminous silhouettes — think a long collarless coat, an oversized leather jacket, a sleek black trench made with a windbreaker-type fabric, a wrap-around miniskirt and more. Pieces are available in a black and midnight blue color palette, while a yellow and purple crocus — one of the first blooms of spring — print is also available on a pair of leggings and handkerchief-hem maxi dress. Shop at hm.com on January 30Marine Serre x RepettoBalletcore is lingering for a little bit longer, thanks to the  Marine Serre x Repetto collaboration. The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition. Leaning into Y2K nostalgia in all the right ways (Paris and Britney were both OG fans), the assortment includes the iconic bright monogrammed Speedy Bandoulière 25 bag, slingback mules, patterned silk scarves, and even a skateboard complete with the Superflat Panda — because why not? Shop at Louis Vuitton nowLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy Bandoulière 25, $, available at Louis VuittonConverse Valentine’s Day Collection + Alex Cosani CampaignConverse is celebrating the season of love with Alex Consani.

Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in. They carry a quiet confidence, the kind of ease that makes them as much a gift to yourself as anyone else.” Shop now at J.Crew Araks x J.Crew Midi Slip Dress, $, available at J.CrewAraks x J.Crew Beatrice Bralette, $, available at J.CrewPHLUR Golden Rule EDPPHLUR, the brand behind the viral Missing Person fragrance, is back with a new hypnotic scent.

The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them. Pieces are available in US sizes 2 to 22, and made with 95-percent biodegradable fabric.  Shop at Rixo and Stripe \u0026 Stare on January 16 Fenty Skin Cherry Dub CleanserWhile we start yet another year screaming “Where is the album?!” to the sky, Rihanna remains booked and busy, launching a new lightweight gel cleanser.

The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather.

The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide.
