  "description": "Lately, my nails have been reflecting the wear and tear of 2024. Traditionally, they are long, strong, shiny, and don't show any discoloration. My nails used to be able to handle anything: the occasional Gel-X manicure, press-ons, intricate 3D designs, playful nail trends, and endless color sans breaks - without showing any damage. But in the last six weeks, my nail beds have developed ridges, decreased in size, continuously break, and chip easily when polished. I started taking Biotin three weeks ago, the protein that aids in nail health. And although it's been helping, in an attempt to speed up the process, I've been investing in nail strengtheners. Formulated with keratin, nail strengtheners are known to rebuild nails that are prone to breaking by creating a protective barrier on the surface. This prevents damage from daily activities, chemicals, and water. I've been testing different nail strengtheners for three weeks now and am convinced this is the hero product for flimsy, peeling, breaking and damaged nails. The result: a curated list of eight nail strengtheners to help bring life back into your nails.",
