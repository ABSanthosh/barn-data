  "description": "Image Source: Getty Images / Film Magic / Savion Washington Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles hit the 2025 ESPYs red carpet with a manicure that was nothing short of intergalactic. The gymnast - part of the gold medal–winning Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris - wore long, coffin-shaped acrylics with a glossy pink base and soft blue accents. Each nail was embellished with crystal studs and 3D rhinestones, mimicking a star-filled sky. On both ring fingers, she added metallic appliqués shaped like Saturn, complete with delicate orbiting rings. In a summer filled with standout nail trends, celestrial nail art is the latest to land. Image Source: Getty Images / Amy Sussman Chiles is no stranger to making a statement with her nails. She's been wearing long acrylics since she was 15, even during Olympic and NCAA competitions - a choice she says actually improves her technique. \"It makes me think of the right technique because I'm not trying to fall or break a nail,\" she explained on Vogue's \"The Run-Through\" podcast in 2024. \"My nails are too precious and too good looking to be breaking.\" Whether she's on the mat or the red carpet, Chiles's commitment to unique nail art proves that elite performance and elite beauty can coexist, and that great nails truly have gravity.
