  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Gareth Cattermole/TAS24 When the cat-eye is sharp enough to kill a man, you better believe we're going to wonder what eyeliner was used to create it. Taylor Swift's makeup choices have long been the topic of fan conversation, and it's easy to see why. The \"Vigilante\" singer performs her epic stadium shows rain or shine, and even in the worst weather, her makeup never bleeds. Is she specifically anointed by the beauty gods so that she never has to deal with a streak or smudge? Maybe, but it also may have something to do with the products she relies on. We already tracked down Swift's red lipstick, which is a well-known signature of hers, but what about her go-to eyeliner? It turns out she keeps a few in her rotation. Let's start with the most notable eyeliner she's worn: Pat McGrath's Perma Precision Liquid Eyeliner ($36) in Xtreme Black. Why is this notable, you ask? Well, Swift actually starred in the brand's campaign for the product back in 2022. Image Source: Robyn BECK / AFP Since McGrath and Swift have had a long-standing relationship, it's fair to say this is still one of her favorite picks. It's known for having the perfect velvet-matte finish, staying put (through hours of Eras tours) for up to 12 hours, and being both waterproof and smudge proof. Whether you're performing for tens of thousands of people or just heading out for drinks on a Friday night, an eyeliner that stays on is an absolute necessity. In addition to the McGrath liner, Swift appears to have another favorite in her makeup bag. In the \"Miss Americana\" documentary that came out on Netflix in 2020, there's a scene where the singer is applying her own eyeliner. Eagle-eyed fan and beauty expert Kristina Rodulfo identified it as the Tom Ford Eye Defining Liquid Liner Pen ($65). While this one is on the pricier side, you can't beat the fact that it's Swift-approved. Both the Pat McGrath and Tom Ford picks are great options to replicate Swift's \"sharp enough\" cat-eye.
