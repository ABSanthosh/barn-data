Cherry perfumes and tobacco notes also tend to get a boost in popularity around the fall.Lucky for us (and you), a fresh collection of fall-inspired perfumes has just hit the shelves, many of them doing a fabulous job at bottling up the perfect autumn day, a steamy mug of apple cider optional. Our editors have spritzed their way through all these new releases to present you with a list of perfumes that will instantly get you in the mood for fall, no matter your budget. Whether you’re into spicy, warm scents that evoke long naps by the fireplace or a classic vanilla perfume that will linger on your scarf for days, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be updating this story with more tried-and-tested feedback as more new scents are dropped, so make sure to keep this one bookmarked.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Thanks to the earthy palo santo, herby frankincense and warm amber, it has a very similar, woody quality but it isn’t too masculine. Instead, it has a sweeter, softer, skinlike edge, which I’d expect from a Glossier You fragrance; they’re meant to be close and cosy. Like the OG Glossier You, the first spritz is intense but it dries down to something really comforting and nostalgic. I predict this will be the most popular of the bunch, especially when you consider that it’s a snip of the price of Santal 33. I share mine with my boyfriend; it’s genderless.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraGlossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraGlossier You Rêve Eau de Parfum“This is probably really niche but if you remember the Baby All Gone doll that was popular in the ‘90s, you’ll know that she came with a little jar of magnetic cherries, which you’d feed her. Those cherries smelled amazing — like maraschino and marshmallows — and I’ve spent my entire life looking for a fragrance that smells similar. I think I might’ve found it in Glossier Rêve. Toasted almond, plum butter and creamy sandalwood make this equal parts sweet and smoky. It’s a grown-up version of that nostalgic smell and I love it.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraGlossier You Rêve Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraLes Essences de Diptyque Eaux de Parfum“Let’s not beat around the bush: This is an extravagantly priced collection. But for true-blue fragrance nerds or diehard Diptyque fans, this set is a special collector’s item. Les Essences de Diptyque features five scents inspired by beautiful treasures found in nature: coral (Corail Oscuro), mother of pearl (Lunamaris), tree bark (Bois Corsé), water lily (Lilyphéa) and desert rose (Rose Roche). You can get a set of minis for $200 and the individual, full-size bottles are $330 each. They all smell elegant, fresh and well rounded but there are two standouts in my book.“If you like coffee and caramel perfumes, you’ll be enchanted by Bois Corsé, a grounding, woodsy scent mixed with tonka bean and black coffee. As for Lilyphéa, let’s just say that I wish this came out last year when I got married, as it would have been my wedding scent. I’ve been looking for a perfume inspired by water lilies — my favorite flower — for years and years. No other perfume has bottled it as accurately as Lilyphéa alongside notes of violet leaf, ginger, vanilla and cardamom. This green, aquatic scent is so uniquely uplifting and I’ve been carrying the mini bottle with me everywhere as a good luck talisman.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop DiptyqueDiptyque Les Essences de Diptyque Eaux de Parfum, $, available at DiptyqueOakcha Silent Melody Eau De Parfum“Most vanilla perfumes are not my cup of tea but I absolutely adored Burberry Goddess, when I tried it in duty-free. So I was very excited when this affordable alternative landed on my radar. For those unfamiliar with Oakcha perfumes, they are spot-on replicas of some of the most popular high-end fragrances on the market, at a snip of the price. In the case of Silent Melody, the vanilla notes are delicately balanced by hints of lavender, ginger and cacao. The end result is a sensual and powdery, floral-vanilla combo that smells so comforting — but with none of the cloying, cupcakey sweetness I normally associate with vanilla scents. Compared to Burberry Goddess, the Oakcha dupe has slightly weaker projection (how easily you can smell it in the air around you) and staying power. But considering that it’s so much cheaper than the OG, that’s a very minor thing to overlook.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop OakchaOakcha Silent Melody Eau De Parfum, $, available at OakchaCreed Delphinus Eau de Parfum“There’s a reason why amber perfumes are trending ahead of winter. Like a cashmere jumper, they’re warm and cosseting on the skin. But here’s the thing: They often wear off quickly. Not Delphinus, though. At first spritz, this packs a serious punch thanks to pink pepper and patchouli, but it dries down to something so cosy and comforting thanks to the vanilla-like tonka bean and incense. It’s spicy, slightly smoky and lasts forever. I sprayed it onto a jacket last month and I can still smell it. I find myself reaching for it more and more now that the nights are drawing in.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromCreed Delphinus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromParfums de Marly Palatine Eau de Parfum“To my nose, Parfums de Marly’s latest launch is giving all kinds of demure and mindful. Palatine’s top notes — pear, bergamot and mandarin — are crisp and invigorating, reminding me of a comforting pot of fruit-infused tea. The next thing that hits you are violet petals in the heart notes (which echo the boudoir-style purple glass bottle and tassel design). This combo really speaks to me. It smells so clean and powdery but never like a cleaning product. The scent gets more intimate and warm as it dries down thanks to base notes of sandalwood, vanilla and patchouli. It’s so intricately layered and exactly what I would imagine a vintage luxury bath soap would smell like.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop Saks Fifth AvenueParfums de Marly Palatine Eau de Parfum, $, available at Saks Fifth AvenuePHLUR Soft Spot Eau de Parfum“Floral, musky and a little bit woody, a sniff of Soft Spot is like walking through a flower-peppered wood after rainfall. This isn’t a floral perfume as you know it. Rather, it’s light and spring-like thanks to its initial, fresh hit of mandarin and freesia. It’s creamy, too, but not cloying. This won’t give you a headache, but it will hug your skin for hours with the scent of jasmine petals, amber and musk lingering on your clothes in the best way. It’s bright and comforting at the same time; nuanced and layered in a way that makes it easy to reach for all year round.” — Humeara Mohamed, SEO writerShop NordstromPhlur Soft Spot Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLush Chelsea Morning Perfume“I’ve been seeing so many viral TikToks about the Lush Sticky Dates Shower Gel and the new Body Spray. People can’t seem to get enough of the mood-lifting sugariness of dates and carob resinoid, a Lush flavoring that resembles baked goods and chocolate. But if you were to ask me, they’re sleeping on Chelsea Morning, another new fragrance from the brand. I’d describe it as the more sophisticated neighbor of Sticky Dates, with a far less overpowering first impression (if you’re not a fan of gourmands, the Sticky Dates Body Spray is going to be too potent for your nose).\"The sweetness in Chelsea Morning comes from the tonka and vanilla, with notes of toffee biscuits thrown in for that warm and inviting feeling. You catch whiffs of butterscotch but it’s never too much, and the lemon myrtle adds a zingy twist. The smell is like sipping an iced lemon tea on the sunny terrace of a five-star resort — and that’s a vibe I’m desperate to hold onto as the weather starts to get chilly.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop LushLush Chelsea Morning Perfume, $, available at LushAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum“I have one of the most sensitive noses of anyone I know: I can instantly tell if the stove hasn’t been turned off from a floor level away, and bath products in the mall give me migraines. It’s a challenge to find perfumes and candles that don’t make me feel ill, so I’m constantly on the hunt for warm, woodsy scents that aren’t too pungent. I was eager (and nervous) to try Ariana Grande’s Lovenotes Pink Woods — and I’m in love.“The perfume smells bright and sparkly at first spray, thanks to the Italian bergamot and lotus flower, but it turns warmer and muskier as it sits on my skin (that would be the vetiver and cashmere woods talking). The fragrance reminds me more of a cologne, which I tend to prefer, but there are hints of sweet candy, which makes sense, as there are notes of cotton candy in it. This one feels more mature and luxurious than Grande’s earlier fruity and floral fragrances. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my sense of smell or give me a headache.” — Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writerShop UltaAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum“Barénia is the first chypre scent (think a citrus-mossy-woody hybrid) by Hermès. This new perfume takes inspiration from its namesake, a type of high-quality leather used in the most iconic bags from the luxury fashion house. I haven’t liked a single leather-inspired perfume in the past, so I wasn’t 100% sure I’d enjoy this. However, just one sniff is enough to change my mind: The patchouli tickles my nose and harmonizes with the oaky base note to create a soft leather-like aroma. It conjures memories of my vintage leather bomber jacket, one of my prized possessions.“The leathery notes fade away quite quickly, and you’re left with a cloud of tart berries and sweet butterfly lilies that drifts around you for the rest of the day. If you’re looking for a cozy signature fragrance for the winter, you can’t go wrong with Barénia. The striking bottle design, created to resemble an Hermès calfskin stuffed bracelet, makes this a certified collector’s item.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist“Often super sweet, fruity, and playful, most Sol de Janeiro fragrances skew much younger to me, as someone in her early thirties. But consider Cheriosa 76 the fragrance family’s chic older sister. She’s still fun and full of energy (that’ll be the zingy blackcurrant), but she’s also sophisticated and put-together (the creamy jasmine, heady freesia, and skin-like amber woods make sure of that.) Starting at $24 for a mini bottle, it’s considerably cheaper than the fragrances on this list, but it boasts brilliant staying power. It gets warmer and more comforting as you wear it in, making it the perfect autumn perfume if you’re on a budget.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist, $, available at SephoraMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum“I normally don’t associate fruity perfumes with autumn, but Marc Jacobs’ latest addition to the Perfect Eau de Parfum lineup has managed to surprise me. Perfect Elixir greets you with the sweet and tart aroma of plums, which happen to be in season during the early months of fall. The scent then warms up with cozy amber and vanilla bean accords, while rhubarb and patchouli add a dash of crispness. It reminds me of a plum and almond tart — the perfect autumnal dessert — but it doesn’t smell overly saccharine on the skin, thanks to delicate orange blossoms in the middle notes. It’s a very grown-up but still flirty version of a vanilla scent that has impressive staying power, but you’ll be tempted to reapply even way before it fades.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop UltaMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense“This new scent is my absolute favorite out of Givenchy’s ever-growing L’Interdit perfume range. The jasmine in the other variations is quite pungent, which can be polarizing to some people. Givenchy L’interdit Absolu presents you with a white floral bouquet that is much softer, creamier (thanks to the combo of neroli, lavender, and cardamom) — and a little bit boozy, due to the addition of rum. It’s also enriched with tobacco absolute that warms up the scent and lends a soft smokiness, making the wearer feel more sexy and enticing. Compared to the OG version, L'Interdit Absolu sits closer to the skin, creating a more intimate experience overall.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at UltaDedCool Aura Eau de Parfum“Fuelled by top notes of pear and lemon, DedCool Aura is layered with middle notes of jasmine and patchouli, which dry down to bottom notes of musk, caramel, and vanilla. The resulting cocktail is bright and juicy, sparkly but mature, and thick and luxurious — but never headache-inducing. It’s an exquisite, nostalgic balance between sweet and herby, and it’ll wrap you with warmth on cold, rainy days. It has all the makings of a ‘signature’ perfume that all of your friends and acquaintances will associate you with from here on out.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop DedCool DedCool Aura Eau de Parfum, $, available at DedcoolJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense“I was recommended this scent because I don’t like sweet, gourmand perfumes, and this is basically the opposite. It’s true: Hand me a cherry perfume, and my nose will instantly wrinkle. This, then, sounds perfect on paper. Inspired by the Japanese ritual of ‘forest bathing,’ it’s studded with tree-like notes, including Japanese hinoki cypress (which smells a bit like eucalyptus) and cedarwood. As someone who spends 99% of their time in lakes and green spaces, it sounds right up my street, and, at first spritz, it really is.“The initial smell is super fresh, but elevated, like a posh laundry detergent, in the best way. You begin to notice the woody elements a little more as it dries down, and this is where things get complicated. The clash of fresh and woody notes makes it smell a little too home spray-like. It’s a lovely scent, but perhaps a little too piney for my skin. I’d love this in a candle; I prefer something softer and more suggestive in a fragrance. However, if your preference is strong and heady fragrances that last all day, this will be a winner.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop NordstromJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense, $, available at NordstromINITIO Parfums Privés Atomic Rose Hair Perfume“I’ve been on the lookout for a signature hair scent for years. As a petite girlie, I’m convinced that lovely-smelling hair is a great way to make an impactful first impression since most people tower over me and can only see the top of my head. With these new hair mists by INITIO, I’ve landed on the hair fragrance of my dreams. These perfumes are alcohol-free, which means they won’t dry out your ends, while panthenol (vitamin B5) moisturizes the hair and makes it shinier without weighing it down.“Atomic Rose is my favorite out of the range: it casts a veil of jasmine, rose, bergamot, and vanilla that stays on my hair, and I’m hooked on the luxurious floral scent. I keep holding the ends of my hair for a sniff throughout the day, and every person who has hugged me has complimented my smell. It’s still an investment at $91, but the price point is significantly lower than the eau de parfum version, which starts at $240.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromINITIO Atomic Rose Hair Perfume, $, available at NordstromVictoria’s Secret Daring Eau De Parfum“I have a soft spot for Victoria’s Secret perfumes. I think they are quite good across the board and definitely hold their own against fancy designer ones. The latest launch is named Daring, and even before I smelled it, I knew it would be right up my alley. It’s a crisp, woody scent (two words not usually paired together), and features a unique blend of bergamot, amber, and oakmoss for a complex result — bright and verdant at the beginning, but then dries down to reveal sensual earthy notes. I’ve been loving it for fall, since it feels very feminine and elegant (but not in a granny way), but also a little masculine with its oakiness and hint of edge. It also doesn’t hurt that the bottle is the prettiest pale green hue, which is my favorite color.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop Victoria's SecretVictoria's Secret Daring Eau De Parfum, $, available at Victoria's SecretPenhaligon’s The Dandy Eau de Parfum“I only just received The Dandy and I’m already a quarter of the way through the bottle. In fact, I’m calling it: it’s my new signature scent. I’m obsessed with the 1920s (the haircuts, brooding speakeasies, the infamous parties) and The Dandy is what I imagine every stylish flapper girl smelt like. It opens with a splash of whisky (rich and earthy) then makes way for raspberry (tart and floral) but it’s the notes that remain — creamy, musky, skin-like ambrox, rich oak, spicy cedarwood and intoxicating smoke — that make this so special.“On the dry down, the cocktail-esque notes dissipate, and it transforms into something really soothing. Throughout the day, I catch delicious, delicate plumes of it, like the fragrance is simply an extension of me — like clean, powdery skin. The other day, someone chased me off the train (bear in mind it wasn’t their stop) to ask me which perfume I was wearing. It’s really that memorable.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromPenhaligon's The Dandy Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?
