  "description": "If you're looking for a little glow this summer, but you don't want to spend countless hours in the sun, your best bet is trying a self-tanner. Whether you're looking for the best self tanning lotion or the best self tanner for face, there are tons of products to shop from brands like Isle of Paradise, Jergens, Coco \u0026 Eve, and Bali Body, but it's hard to know which one is right for you. Before you start searching for the best self-tanners online, it's important to keep a few tips in mind. First, be aware of your body's pH level and anything that could affect it, such as showering right before a tan or certain body washes. DHA, the ingredient in tanning solutions that creates the bronze color, interacts with your skin's pH, which means things like your period and when you shower can affect how well your skin accepts the tan. \"I can tell within two seconds, within that first spray, if you've showered right before, which is not good,\" Brittney Bennett, a spray tanner at Be Bronze Tanning Studio in Los Angeles, tells PS. \"If you shower, I like a good 12 hours but a minimum of four hours prior - shower, shave, exfoliate - because if you do it right before, your tan will be 20 to 30 percent less dark. Same thing with your period. The pH balance of your skin is what the tan is working with.\" Ahead, we've curated expert advice, bestselling formulas, and customer favorites to make shopping for your next self-tanner a little easier. When to Get a Spray Tan After getting a spray tan, you might notice that distinct tan smell, but avoid spritzing a fragrance to mask it. \"A patchy neck can be caused by perfumes and products left on the skin before application,\" says Sophie Evans, St. Tropez's skin finishing expert. She suggests the St. Tropez Tan Remover Mousse if the patchiness is too noticeable to cover with makeup. \"You can also apply a little loose translucent powder after your tan application to avoid any dark neck creases.\" When it comes to big events, Evans suggests giving your tan 24 hours to develop and settle before the event. \"If an event is Saturday, I recommend getting a tan on Thursday night,\" she says. \"Sometimes, a self-tan instant bronzer can take two showers to remove fully. You could also opt for a clear water mousse or gel, like St. Tropez's Purity Water collection. This range contains no bronzers, so there is nothing to transfer. Plus, you can wear it all day without feeling sticky or the need to shower.\" Now that you've read a few facts about spray tans, it's time to answer the one question we're all thinking: what is the best self-tanner? We've rounded up the best picks, and whether you're looking for the best self tanning lotion, a mousse, or a mist, there's no shortage of good finds ahead. And keep scrolling to the end for more expert advice. Experts Featured in This Article Brittney Bennett is a spray tanner at Be Bronze Tanning Studio in Los Angeles.
