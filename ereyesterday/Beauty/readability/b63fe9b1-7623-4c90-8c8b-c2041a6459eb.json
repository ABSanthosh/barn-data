  "description": "There are a couple of things we know for certain about Harry Styles's tattoos: he has a lot of them (probably more than we know about) and he rarely opens up about what each design means to him. The \"Don't Worry Darling\" actor, \"Harry's House\" singer, and beauty brand owner got his very first ink - a tiny star etched on his left bicep - in 2012 on his 18th birthday. And things have only snowballed from there. Styles doesn't speak about his body art often, yet he keeps doodling all over himself. He's acquired some of the tattoos on a whim (like \"big\" on his big toe), while others carry more sentimental value, like the designs that honor loved ones. For example, he has a tattoo on his thigh that says \"Olivia,\" presumably for his ex-girlfriend, Olivia Wilde. Fans first spotted the ink in July 2023 while the singer was boating in Bolsena, Italy. Some of the designs have even been done by Styles himself. Recently, we learned that one of his tattoos might feature some incorrect lyrics, but you'll have to keep scrolling to learn all of the details. How Many Tattoos Does Harry Styles Have? While the exact number of tattoos etched on Styles's body is unconfirmed, we can say for sure he has somewhere north of 60+ tattoos . . . so far. Who knows what - or how many more - he'll get in the future? As for what we do know, we're sharing the information we've collected on Styles's tattoos ahead. And for the rest of them, we'll just have to admire them and their mystery the same way we admire the rest of Harry: from afar. Disclaimer: while we did our best to be comprehensive, don't be mad if we missed one or three - like we said, we're sure he has many more where these came from.",

  "text": "\"Late Late\" Tattoo The story behind this tattoo is a great one: One Direction played a game of Tattoo Roulette on \"The Late Late Show With James Corden\" in 2015, and when Styles lost the game, he had to get \"Late Late\" tattooed on his arm live on the show. Ship Tattoo Styles's ship on his left bicep has always been a fan favorite. The tattoo artist who did it said Styles wanted an English ship to remind him \"that he's homeward bound.\" Green Bay Packers Tattoo Styles has long been a fan of the NFL team and got a tattoo of the Green Bay Packers logo on his upper left arm on a bet several years ago. \"Won't Stop 'Til We Surrender\" Tattoo Under his Green Bay Packers tattoo, Styles has a script tattoo on his inner arm that reads, \"Won't stop 'til we surrender,\" which fans have guessed comes from the song \"Sweet Disposition\" by the Australian group The Temper Trap. The group recently posted a video on TikTok saying that the lyrics are actually incorrect. \"Harry, we still love you even though you got the wrong lyrics to 'Sweet Disposition' tattooed,\" the caption of the video reads. Apparently, the correct lyrics are, \"And won't stop 'til it's over, won't stop to surrender.\" Who knows? Maybe Styles just wanted to put his own twist on the song. Iced Gem Cookie Tattoo He has an iced gem cookie in this area of his left arm as well, presumably for his sister, Gemma. Gemma in Hebrew Tattoo The Hebrew letters on the top of Styles's left arm mean Gemma, again for his sister. Pingu Tattoo This small tattoo on Styles's left arm matches the Pingu character that Ed Sheeran has tattooed on himself. They got them after drinking one night and discussing how much they loved the cartoon. \"Hi\" Tattoo He has the word \"Hi\" tattooed on his inner left arm, and while fans have plenty of theories about its meaning, Styles hasn't actually shared anything about it. Star Tattoo The star is included among the tiny tattoos on his left upper arm. Clothing Hanger Tattoo A clothing hanger is up in the same mess as Styles's other small tattoos on his left arm. \"Can I Stay\" Tattoo \"Can I Stay\" is at the top of his left arm. Arlo and Jackson Tattoos Styles has Arlo and Jackson tattoos on his left arm, supposedly for his godchildren. Fly Tattoo There's a large flying insect on the inside of Styles's left arm. He has not confirmed its meaning. Pink Floyd Tattoo Styles's upper left arm has a small Pink Floyd \"Dark Side of the Moon\" logo. Guitar Tattoo There's a small guitar at the top of Styles's left arm, almost on his back. 3 Nails Tattoo These are on his upper left arm. LA + NY + LON Tattoos The three city abbreviations are on his upper left arm, and I can only assume they're three of his favorite places. Black Heart Tattoo Both Zayn Malik and former One Direction hairstylist Lou Teasdale also have this tattoo, and whether or not that makes it a friendship tattoo is up to you to decide, but I'm saying it is. You can find Styles's on his upper left arm. R Tattoo The \"R\" near the mermaid on his left arm is most assuredly for his stepdad, Robin Twist.",
