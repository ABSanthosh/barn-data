  "text": "I can’t believe another month has flown by. January felt like the longest month ever but February went by so quickly. I have a roundup of favorites for February! Here are some things I really loved this month. Chanel Spring Summer 2025 Chanel Beauty’s spring collection has been in heavy rotation (full review here). I still really love every single shade of the Rouge Coco Baume Shines, in particular Tender Peach and Honey Bliss. I still really love the Jeux de Lumieres highlighter palette. It has been a versatile one for me I can use on the eyes and cheeks. I’ve been using the Chanel Brush 107 or 106 with the palette. I am still 100% obsessed with the eyeshadow singles, especially the Peche Glace. Byredo Mojave Ghost Absolu I splurged on the Byredo Mojave Ghost Absolu as a gift to myself for Christmas and I really love it. The Mojave Ghost Absolu smells very similar to the original version, but the Absolu has better and longer lasting power. I also find the Absolu variation to be richer and creamier with more depth. I am 100% happy with the splurge. If you already own the original I do think the absolu is too similar to justify both. Tom Ford Peach Glamour Tom Ford launched two new eyeshadow palettes in the crème formula and I picked up the lighter/neutral option Peach Glamour. A few of you told me this is actually the powder formula in a new formulation, but quite a few places, including Tom Ford’s website have it listed under the crème formula page. It does have a creamy feel but it’s softer and not as dry as the other cremes making it a lot easier to blend. The colors are light and shimmery but not over the top. Peach Glamour is what I wanted Nude Dip to be on me. I think Nude Dip is a classic, but on someone with my skin tone it almost pulls cool-toned while Peach Glamour is warmer but more neutral. By popular request I also pulled comparisons to Tiger Eye (crème formula reviewed here) and Suspicion (powder, reviewed here discontinued). Complexion Favorites Two complexion products I’ve been loving are from Dior and Saie. I still cannot get enough of the Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick (3N in action demo in action here). Right now I wear 2.5N for my winter color and this is hands down the easiest foundation to apply and travel with. I also love the finish and coverage. It blurs, blends easily, isn’t too heavy, has impressive coverage but looks natural. It has become my most-reached-for foundation this year. I also really love the Saie Glowy Super Gel in Roseglow. It’s so good mixed in with foundation or as a base. I have another demo of it in action here. Neutral Honey Beige Lips As a neutral lip lover I am always looking for more honey tones to try. There are four I really loved this month. The Milani Keep it Full Glossy Plumping Balm is a really good budget-friendly formula. It’s comfortable on the lips, hydrating and plumping without any stinging and I think it rivals the ones from Tarte and Hourglass. The Milani ones are not as thick in texture, but are still balmy and glossy. I shared an application here of Puff (beige) and Bisou (red) in partnership with Target and I truly stand by these. I ended up buying a few more colors and really love them. The new Hourglass Phantom Glossy Balm shades for spring are so good, I’ve been loving Wander which is a lighter peachy beige shimmer but all of the new shimmers are beautiful. Spring shades swatched here. MAC added quite a few neutrals in their lipstick and lip liner formulas. I really wanted to love the shades like Cool Spice and Cool Teddy, but they ended up being too cool-toned for me. I did pick up the Lip Pencil in Beige Turner and it’s a perfect beige neutral for me. Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Shine in Honey Bliss is such a good everyday neutral. It has a bit of gold shimmer but it’s not frosty. This is my perfect swipe and go polished nude lip look. One shout out for the Glossier Sharpener. I know it’s not the most exciting thing and it’s kinda spendy for a sharpener, but it is GENIUS with the cover to hold all the pencil shavings so you can travel with it or keep it in your makeup bag without having to worry about making a mess. Skincare Favorites My favorite cleanser I keep going back to is the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser I do like to try new ones every now and then. I picked up the Laneige Water Bank Gentle Gel Cleanser and it’s 10/10 love. It’s gentle but effective and I love the creamy gel texture. I find it hydrating and great for this time of year. This year is the driest my skin has been. I started using the Hydrating Infused Emulsion underneath my regular moisturizer and it was exactly what my skin needed this dry season. It has made a HUGE difference in restoring moisture to my skin. A little goes a long way and I only use one pump to try and maximize every last bit of this product. I mentioned a month ago that for some reason almost all of my deodorants started causing a rash and allergic reaction for me. I’ve used Native, L’Occitane and Salt and Stone for a while and for some reason I am not able to use them anymore. I gave the Phlur Deodorants a try and they’re a winner for me. Long lasting, no reaction and I love the scents. Vanilla Skin (vanilla) and Father Figure (fig) are both really good. I really hope they consider launching it in Missing Person or Phloria or even Solar Power. For sunscreen I’ve been really loving the Chanel UV Essentiel. It has worked well with other moisturizers and also makeup on top. I love the texture and finish. Another shout of for Cyklar body washes is necessary as by this point Andrew and I have used up both the Naked Neroli and Bergamot Bond. This is still the best body wash we have tried in a long time and the texture feels really nice on the skin. Andrew liked it so much he asked me to restock this and I ordered more. By the time of this post we are almost through our second bottle of the Bergamot one. I also tried the Crescent one which is more of an amber blend. It’s also a good one but we love the Bergamot Bond the most. What did you love this month?",

I picked up the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4h5hWUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eLaneige Water Bank Gentle Gel Cleanser\u003c/a\u003e and it’s 10/10 love. It’s gentle but effective and I love the creamy gel texture. I find it hydrating and great for this time of year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year is the driest my skin has been. I started using the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3F2kEwD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHydrating Infused Emulsion\u003c/a\u003e underneath my regular moisturizer and it was exactly what my skin needed this dry season. It has made a HUGE difference in restoring moisture to my skin. A little goes a long way and I only use one pump to try and maximize every last bit of this product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned a month ago that for some reason almost all of my deodorants started causing a rash and allergic reaction for me. I’ve used Native, L’Occitane and Salt and Stone for a while and for some reason I am not able to use them anymore. I gave the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3QHktJW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ePhlur Deodorants\u003c/a\u003e a try and they’re a winner for me. Long lasting, no reaction and I love the scents. \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3R1vh5P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eVanilla Skin\u003c/a\u003e (vanilla) and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3QHktJW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eFather Figure\u003c/a\u003e (fig) are both really good. I really hope they consider launching it in Missing Person or Phloria or even Solar Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor sunscreen I’ve been really loving the \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MeQoh28EORo\u0026amp;mid=39938\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanel.com%2Fus%2Fskincare%2Fp%2F141886%2Fuv-essentiel-complete-uv-protection-sunscreen-antioxidant-anti-pollution-broad-spectrum-spf-50%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eChanel UV Essentiel\u003c/a\u003e.

This is still the best body wash we have tried in a long time and the texture feels really nice on the skin. Andrew liked it so much he asked me to restock this and I ordered more. By the time of this post we are almost through our second bottle of the Bergamot one. I also tried the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4i1p99g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eCrescent\u003c/a\u003e one which is more of an amber blend.
