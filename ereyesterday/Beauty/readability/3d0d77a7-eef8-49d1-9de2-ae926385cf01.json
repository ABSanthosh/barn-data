  "description": "Body and facial hair have been a source of self-consciousness for me for way too long, probably thanks to some unimportant boy in middle school making a comment about my arm hair. In my teens, I tried electrolysis on my upper lip (spoiler: not for the pain-averse), but as an adult - and as someone who writes about beauty for a living - I've discovered a slew of tools that remove unwanted hair easily, sans pain, and from the comfort of my own home. Among my favorites is the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool ($199). And because my job doesn't make it possible to gatekeep, I'm about to break it down in excruciating detail (sorry, but also, you're welcome) so you can decide if it's worth adding to your beauty routine, too. About Dermaflash Luxe+ Sonic Dermaplaning + Peach Fuzz Removal Tool It's the newest version of the dermaplaning device. It uses sonic vibration technology to gently remove peach fuzz, flakes, and dead skin cells. Built-in safety features help prevent nicks and cuts (which, unfortunately, isn't always the case with dermaplaning tools). It comes in multiple color options, so you can choose the one that brings you the most joy. What I Like About the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool Before I get into why this device is so good, let's start with what dermaplaning is. Simply put, dermaplaning is an exfoliation treatment that removes dead skin cells and peach fuzz using a scalpel-like tool or, in this case, a vibrating one. The result is, most famously, baby-soft skin but also better skin-care product absorption and a base so smooth that foundation glides on like butter. What it's not is your standard razor job. Shaving only removes hair, while dermaplaning goes deeper, sloughing off the top layer of dull, dead skin. Which brings me to this device in particular: While I've tried and enjoyed manual dermaplaners that rely solely on a scalpel for exfoliation, I had a hard time avoiding tiny nicks on my face. But with this one, I've never had a single cut or scrape, just smooth and radiant skin. That's likely thanks to its built-in safety features, including a protective guard around the blade and a microfine-edge blade that's gentler than scalpel-style dermaplaning tools. Plus, the easy-to-hold design makes it feel intuitive and effective, even if you're a beginner. One underrated perk is that the Dermaflash Luxe+ comes with a charging stand that doubles as a storage solution, which I love. And when it's not charging, it can stand upright on its own. Most manual dermaplaners I've used don't offer a good storage option, or can't stand upright, meaning they end up tossed in my makeup bag, collecting who-knows-what. But because this one has a designated (and aesthetically pleasing) home, combined with how glowy and smooth it leaves my skin, has earned a permanent spot on my vanity among my other ride-or-die beauty staples. How to Use the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool The process of using the Dermaflash Luxe+ is similar to other dermaplaning tools, except that it's electrically powered. For best results, the brand recommends washing your face with its Preflash Cleanser to remove surface oil, patting it dry, then holding the device at a 45-degree angle, pressing the power button, and gliding it over your face in short, feathery strokes. If you haven't dermaplaned before (or it's been a while), you'll see peach fuzz collecting on the edge of the device as you go. Personally, I like to flick the fuzz into the sink mid-session and keep going. Once you're done, I always apply a fragrance-free moisturizer which tends to calm down redness on my dry and somewhat sensitive skin, before tossing the razor blade. The eject button on the device makes this part weirdly fun; just point it at the trash, press, and it'll quite literally send it flying straight in. According to the brand, you can use it as often as once a week, but I've found that bi-weekly is more than enough to keep my peach fuzz (and the random smattering of dark hairs that have popped up) in check so my skin's as smooth as possible. What to Consider About the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool One thing to keep in mind about the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool is that some users have reported issues with charging or the device unexpectedly shutting off. Personally, I haven't run into this problem after countless uses, but I'd be remiss not to mention that it's happened to some. Another factor to consider is that the brand discourages reusing blades, meaning you'll need to replace them regularly. While Dermaflash offers a subscription service for refills, it's an added cost that might not be ideal for everyone. Where Is the Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool Available to Shop? The Dermaflash Luxe+ Peach Fuzz Removal Sonic Dermaplaning Tool is available on Amazon, as well as directly from Dermaflash's website and major retailers like Ulta Beauty, Sephora, and Nordstrom, among others.
