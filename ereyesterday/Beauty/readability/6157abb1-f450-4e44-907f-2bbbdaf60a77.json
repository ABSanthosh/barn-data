  "description": "I got super invested in oral health during the pandemic. Blame it on constant video calls displaying my not-so-pearly whites or the desire to have some control of something, but I started accruing toothbrushes, waterpiks, flossers, and high-priced mouthwash. Now, a couple years in, I have my routine down, but lately, I've been on the hunt for sustainable, environmentally-friendly dental care products to appease my eco-conscious values. That's why I was elated to discover the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush ($95). Composed of recyclable, plant-based heads and bristles and a slim aluminum body, the design is impressive, but I was eager to see if the performance is up to par (spoiler: it is). According to Suri, which is short for sustainable rituals, every year over four billion toothbrushes end up in landfills. Not only has purchasing this toothbrush minimized my carbon footprint, I've been testing it for three weeks now and am impressed by the results. Keep reading for more details about the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush and find out how the plant-based product quickly became part of my routine. About the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush Plant-based design 33,000 sonic vibrations 40-day battery life Available in five different colors Includes UV-C travel and cleaning case What I Like About the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush Over the years I've tested several electric toothbrushes: Oral-B, Burst, Phillips, Quip, and more. And although they do a phenomenal job at cutting through plaque, none of the designs have ever sparked joy. Suri is the first electric toothbrush I've ever used that actually looks pretty on my bathroom vanity. I have the winter fern (green) colorway, and paired with the magnetic wall mount, it visually upgrades my space. I travel a lot for work and have found a lot of use for the included UV-C case. Not only does it make it easy to transport (so long to my toothbrush moving around in my wash bag) but the built-in UV-C light kills 99.9 percent of bacteria on the brush head, so I never have to worry about manual cleaning. As for sustainability, Suri has a program where you can send back used brush heads to be properly recycled. The heads are made of cornstarch and castor oil so they break down without leaving microplastics behind. Another perk? I've been using my Suri for three weeks now and it hasn't needed a charge yet. In the past with competitor brands, I've forgotten to charge my toothbrush at night and have been forced to manually brush in the mornings, forgoing all the benefits of the sonic vibrations. But with Suri, the 40-day battery life really does make for a seamless oral routine. How to Use the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush Great news: if you've used an electric toothbrush before, you'll have no trouble navigating Suri. Setup-wise, you just need to charge it for four hours, then add toothpaste and start brushing. For best results, the brand recommends brushing at a 45-degree angle towards the gum line, constantly moving in small circles. There are two brush settings: everyday clean and polish. To switch in-between, you just need to press the main button once. In my short time, I haven't found much difference in the two settings, but like to use polish on days I have in-person meetings for extra brightness. Like other popular electric toothbrushes, the brush will buzz every 30 seconds, indicating to move to a different quadrant of your mouth. It turns off automatically after two minutes of use, which is the dentist-recommended time for brushing your teeth. What to Consider Before Trying the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush Although I love the magnetic wall mount that comes with the Suri toothbrush, make sure you secure the adhesive to a wall or mirror very tightly. Mine fell off twice while taking a steamy shower, so be sure it's fixed in place before moving about your day. Where Is the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush Available? You can get the Suri Sustainable Electric Toothbrush on the brand's website and at Amazon. Rating: Natasha Marsh (she/her) is a freelance writer who writes about fashion, beauty, and lifestyle.
