  "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month.

Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available to shop on July 10 at Levi'sCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available to shop on July 10 at Charlotte Tilbury Uniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available to shop on July 10 at UniqloCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaHuda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula. Our favorites are Cinnamon, a rosy taupe shade, and Soft Nude for a \"your lips but better\" look.

The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes. Comprised of 18 apparel pieces, our favorite from the collection is the cream Firebird track jacket with burgundy piping and floral prints — a perfect layering piece for summer nights in the city.Available to shop July 15 at AsosLike what you see?
