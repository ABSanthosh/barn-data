  "description": "Experiencing hair loss can feel frustrating, but thankfully, you are not alone. In fact, it's even normal. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, hair loss affects an estimated 80 million Americans, and the average person loses 50 to 100 strands a day. Whether you've experienced changes in your diet, stress levels, or a poor reaction to a chemical treatment, there could be several reasons your hair is thinning or shedding. But here's the good news: hair growth shampoos can make a real difference. Packed with ingredients like biotin, keratin, collagen, and rosemary oil - all known to nourish, strengthen, and lengthen strands - hair growth shampoos promise to help stimulate the hair follicle and promote growth at the root. The right shampoo will help nourish and unclog the hair follicle, while preventing damage. So, if you're experiencing breakage, or your hair simply can't get past the same, stagnant length - the list curated ahead is for you. It's important to remember that Rapunzel-length strands don't happen overnight. Healthy hair grows half an inch a month, so make sure you give the shampoo three to four months to produce noticeable results. Ahead, discover 11 shampoos to aid in your hair growth goals.",
