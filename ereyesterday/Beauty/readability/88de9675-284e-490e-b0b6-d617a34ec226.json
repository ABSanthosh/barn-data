  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Both awards season and Fashion Month have ended, which means leaving red carpet glam, eye-catching street style, and show-stopping runway looks in the rearview mirror. But, as the old cliché goes, when one door closes, another must open — and that’s certainly true in the world of fashion and beauty. As spring weather approaches, nudging us out of our winter cocoons, a new crop of trends, buzzy campaigns, and launches are also emerging in the sunlight. Sabrina Carpenter is helping debut new Prada Beauty products, Refinery29-favorite brand Aligne is making its foray into bridal, and Glow Recipe is furthering its stronghold on the skincare-meets-makeup category with its latest cheek tints — and that’s just the start.

Designed to be versatile, bold, and tradition-skewing, the line is made up of four pieces that can be worn during or beyond wedding celebrations: a satin mini dress with bows on the shoulders, a peplum top with ribbon detailing, a satin mini dress with puff sleeves, and, of course, a tailored satin blazer that ties at the front. Prices start at $165. Shop now at Aligne Aligne Ivy Puff Sleeve Satin Mini Dress, $, available at AligneNew Fenty x Puma Collection Rihanna’s latest Fenty x Puma collection is here — and it’s impossible to miss.

Also on offer is the lime green mini Fenty x Puma Pocket Bag that can double as a crossbody, making it perfect for running errands or low-effort, essentials-only beach days.

Now, it’s looking beyond spot treatments and expanding into skincare. The line boasts two salicylic acid-forward, acne-fighting products: a gentle foaming cleanser formulated for sensitive and breakout-prone skin and a lightweight, soothing, oil-free moisturizer that also contains shine-minimizing niacinamide and hydrating hyaluronic acid. Both are available now for $15.99 each.Shop now at Starface Starface Sal Acid Skincare Duo, $, available at StarfaceNordstrom Launches New Shoes With Reformation Reformation just dropped its spring shoe collection, and some of the It Girl-coveted styles are available exclusively at Nordstrom. Part of Nordstrom’s monthly “Make Room for Shoes” campaign — which pairs the retailer with popular shoe names like Birkenstock, Larroudé, and Sperry — the collection includes an array of ballet flats (including a covetable sheer pair with delicate floral embroidery), flat sandals, and versatile heels. Shop now at NordstromReformation Bethany Ballet Flat, $, available at NordstromRebecca Vallance Launches Denim CollectionRebecca Vallance is taking her ultra-glam occasionwear aesthetic and eye for sharp tailoring to a brand-new category. The Australian designer’s eponymous brand has just dropped its first-ever collection of denim, and it includes 15 pieces for a range of occasions — think high-waisted straight-leg jeans, cinched dresses, oversized jackets with cocoon sleeves, and a denim blazer. “Denim has always been a staple in everyday wardrobes, and I wanted to create pieces that can be seamlessly integrated into our customers’ existing collections while still offering the signature sophistication and elevated style that they expect from the brand,” Vallance said in a press release. Prices range from $285 to $570. Shop now at Rebecca Vallance Rebecca Vallance Dylan Mini Dress, $, available at Rebecca VallanceRebecca Vallance Gisele Flare Jean, $, available at Rebecca VallanceGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy FlushThe skincare-meets-makeup trend continues to grow strong thanks to Glow Recipe’s latest twist on its bestselling Dew Drops. Enter: Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush. The tinted cheek serum combines the rosiness of a soft blush with skin-boosting ingredients, like brightening and smoothing niacinamide and calming centella asiatica to hydrate skin, refine the appearance of pores, and impart a natural flush. Available in two shades — peachy Watermelon Flush and warmer Berry Flush — the formula is also buildable, so you can opt for a dewy and sheer look or a more pigmented finish. Shop now at Glow RecipeGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dewy Flush, $, available at SephoraJ.Crew’s Spring Catalog After relaunching it last year, J.Crew is back with the latest edition of its beloved catalog. This time around, the focus is on all things spring style and the American brand’s latest additions to its signature preppy, timeless offerings. Other than new pieces, inside you’ll find model Liya Kebede — 16 years after Kebede first appeared in a J.Crew catalog — and her daughter Raee, intimate snapshots of New York families, and so much more.

The line’s first drop features playful takes on GU’s wardrobe staples — think relaxed trousers and blazers and T-shirts with signature Undercover motifs illustrated by Takahashi, like the “Noise Burger” character. GU x Undercover collection is available now, with prices ranging from $5.99 to $69.99; a second drop is expected next month. Shop now at GUGU x Undercover Broadcloth Shirt, $, available at GUGU x Undercover Deck Shoes, $, available at GUK18 AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray Fed up with using multiple products in your hair care routine? Try K18’s AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray, which promises to amp up volume, hold curls and waves in place (without making your hair crunchy), and repair and reverse damage on your strands. Simply spray through wet, dry, or towel-dried lengths for bouncier, thicker, fuller-looking hair that lasts. Shop now at K18 K18 AstroLift Reparative Volume Spray, $, available at K18Cuyana’s New Paloma Tote Cuyana’s dove-shaped Paloma bag has long been a fan favorite: it has sold out twice and has even been spotted on the shoulder of Meghan Markle. Now the minimalist brand is expanding the collection with the Paloma Tote. The new bag is inspired by the silhouette of the OG, and is made with the same Italian double-faced leather that softens as it ages — but now comes with more room, plus extra exterior and interior zip pockets. Shop now at Cuyana Cuyana Paloma Tote, $, available at CuyanaZara x Style Not Com When Beka Gvishiani, founder of the mega-popular fashion Instagram account Style Not Com, was approached by Zara, he started the conversation by saying: “Let’s talk about fashion.” That phrase is now at the heart of the resulting Zara x Style Not Com collection, which takes the account’s signature cobalt blue hue and bold white text and splashes them across a variety of apparel. Get meta with pieces like a baseball cap with the text “No, I’m not selling my hat,” a reference to Gvishiani’s signature hat; a hoodie emblazoned with “This is a hoodie without an idea;” or a T-shirt that says, “Life is a fashion week with some normal days in between.” Prices range from $10.90 to $69.90. Shop now at Zara Zara x Style Not Com T-Shirt, $, available at ZaraPrada Beauty Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara How do you launch a new product in a way that will make a splash? Well, if you’re Prada Beauty, you tap Sabrina Carpenter for the campaign. That’s how the Pradascope Lash Extending Volume Mascara was introduced to the world. Inspired by the brand’s durable Re-Nylon material, the buildable, clump-free product instantly and noticeably lifts and lengthens lashes for up to 24 hours. The mascara is also formulated with a hyaluronic acid complex to nourish lashes, while the 180° brush features nylon fiber bristles for easy application and definition. Shop this month at Prada Prada Pradascope Lash Lengthening Eye Mascara, $, available at PradaNew Hoops at Jenny Bird A new season approaching is the perfect time to refresh your jewelry collection, if you ask us. It seems like the team at the popular jewelry brand Jenny Bird agrees — they spent the last month dropping new hoop earring styles. Highlights include the Mega Faye Knocker hybrids, the high-shine Mini Tomes, miniature versions of the brand’s bestselling Florence stacked hoops, and the chunky — yet still lightweight! — Gemma Hoops, all of which are available in gold and silver finishes.Shop now at Jenny Bird Jenny Bird Gemma Hoop Earrings, $, available at Jenny BirdMother x La DoubleJ  California cool and Italian flair are coming together in the just-dropped Mother x La DoubleJ capsule collection. The 30-piece line brings La DoubeJ’s maximalist, ’70s-style prints to Mother’s effortless denim pieces, such as the Half-Pipe Ankle barrel jeans that are covered in illustrated dragonflies, a denim jacket with an embroidered tapestry of a goddess on the back, and a pair of flares with wave details at the hems. The collection isn’t all about denim either; also discover graphic tees, boho blouses, and flowy kaftans.
