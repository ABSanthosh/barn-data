  "text": "Rounding up my favorites from May today. I usually focus on makeup favorites but so many of you have asked for more skincare and haircare loves so today’s post is all about hair, body and skin. My hair and skin has been going through some changes since around November with an extended dry season this past winter/spring. We also had some big life changes with our recent move and while both Tampa Bay and Miami Beach are both very sunny and hot, Miami is significantly hotter and I think the excess heat has dehydrated my skin. I’ve been switching things up for skin and hair. Here is what I’ve been loving. Skincare Loves My top two cleansers are still the Chanel L’Huile Anti-Pollution Cleansing Oil and the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser. I tried several other brands but these are the best for effectively removing sunscreen + makeup without stripping the skin. I also really like the new Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Barrier-Hydrating Cleanser too (just as good as the original but more hydrating). FYI Kiehl’s is offering 25% off for their Friends and Family Sale (Members get 30% off). Andrew also uses both Kiehl’s Cleansers. Out of all the new moisturizers I tried, the InnBeauty Project line at Sephora has been the best for me. The products I tried are richer and more hydrating than I typically use but I really love that they weren’t heavy and they feel so good on the skin. I started with the travel sizes (also love this value trial set here). I ended up travel sizes of the Extreme Cream but purchased full sizes of the Extreme Cream Eye and the Elastic Skin Firming Plumping Serum. The serum has a really nice light texture and absorbs really well into the skin. I love layering all three together and can happily report they didn’t irritate or clog my pores. 10/10 recommend. I’ve also experienced texture issues and the clogged pores have been mainly due to lack of exfoliation. I had an amazing facial at one of the local skin clinics here in Miami Beach (included hydrafacial, radio frequency, LED treatment and a few other things). They really helped give my skin a kickstart to clear it up. For exfoliation, two things I’ve found to be game changers are from U Beauty and Dr. Dennis Gross. I started using the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel Pads again and it has been a game changer. I also love the peel pads/resurfacing options from First Aid Beauty and Elemis but I needed something stronger and the ones from Dr. Dennis Gross are perfect. I’m using them 2-3x per week in the evenings. They also have other options in Extra Gentle or Extra Strength and also come in smaller trial sizes in case you’re new to them and are unsure of what kind to try. A number of you recommended the U Beauty Resurfacing Compound and I finally decided to try it – it’s also a gamechanger. I bought a mini set and am 100% going to buy the full size. The Resurfacing Compound is a serum with Vitamin C, Retinol, Multi-Hydroxy Acids, Vitamin E and antioxidants. I have been really impressed with how it’s improving texture. Since I don’t want to overdo the acids (especially with the peel pads) I only use this 2x per week as a serum under moisturizer. Another shout out for the Bliss Clear Genius Acne Spot Treatment because this is holy grail material. It’s hands down the best acne spot treatment with 2% salicylic acid. I can apply it on spots (and reapply 2-3x throughout the day on bigger pimples) and it helps reduce the inflammation and really target the acne. Andrew swears by this too. Sun Care Loves I’ve been trying virtually every new sunscreen formula possible since moving to Miami. The sun is so much stronger here and since we are out everyday with Ollie’s walks we’ve been more diligent with sunscreen. I still really love the Chanel UV Essentiel because of the texture. It’s not too thick or heavy and wears well under makeup. For a mineral option I love the one from Caudalie and tinted one from ISDIN. You do have to be more diligent with double cleansing if you use a mineral as they tend to adhere more to the skin. I’ve been a long-time devotee of the Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protector SPF 60 but decided to give the new Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion Mineral version a try. I like it a lot! It has a very slight white cast but when you blend it you can’t really see it. It has a better dry down while the other version is a bit more emollient. I’ve been using the mineral version on my body all month. It does take extra work to remove though. The best combo for mineral body sunscreen removal includes the EcoTools Shower Gloves and Jack Black Turbo Wash. Body Care My all-time favorite body oil from Chanel is back! I am so thrilled they restocked it. Chanel body oils are quite the splurge but they are packaged in a beautiful glass bottle and are the most luxurious ones on the skin. Love that they now have a little stopper at the top to control how much oil comes out. The Chanel Huile Douce is a lighter body oil and it smells so fresh and clean. I love how it’s not sticky and it makes the skin soft unlike any other oil I’ve tried. For hand care my favorite cuticle oils are the Chanel L’Huile Camelia and Hermes Nourishing Oil. Both are spendy but I’ve repurchased both and I think they are 100% worth the splurge. I mentioned a while back having some challenges finding a deodorant that didn’t irritate my skin. I had a major skin flareup from bug spray last year that resulted in hives. It took about 3 months to fully recover. Ever since then my skin has experienced sensitivities to deodorant, even the ones I had been using for years (such as Native, Salt and Stone, L’occitane). So far Saltair and Phlur formulas have been the only ones I can use without irritation. I’ve been reaching for the Saltair one more as the Santal scent doesn’t interfere with my perfumes as much as a vanilla option. Back on the exfoliation topic, while I won’t use a physical scrub on my face I can definitely still use it on the body. We started using the First Aid Beauty KP Bump Eraser and we love it. It’s cleared up all of Andrew’s body breakouts and I like using this on my legs. I have just ordered the KP options from Saltair and Naturium to try too. Will keep you posted! Also been really loving Osea Malibu. I also started using this line with minis a while ago and fell in love. I just restocked all my favorites including travel sizes. I love the Undaria Algae Body Oil, Lotion and Body Serum. 10/10 recommend trying one of their travel kits if you’re new to the line. Hair Care Last I have some hair care loves for the month. My hair has been feeling dry on the ends so I switched things up. My favorite line has been the Shu Uemura Art of Hair Urban Moisture Deep Hydration Shampoo, Conditioner and Mask. I loved this line so much I repurchased everything after using it up. It’s a great hydrating line that doesn’t weigh down my hair and I love the way it smells. After still experiencing dry ends, I started using the Kerastase Nutritive 8H Magic Night Serum again. I had forgotten about this and can’t rave about it enough! If your hair doesn’t seem to be improving with leave-in conditioners, masks or oils, I highly recommend trying this serum. You apply it at night and I can’t tell you how big a difference it makes. The R\u0026Co Dart Stick gets another shout out. This is something I cannot live without for my flyaways at the roots. I’ve still been getting regrowth and my thick hair will not stay put with hair spray. This is the best option I’ve found to keep them in place. While it won’t make your hair super greasy, if you sweat you will find you need to wash it out at the end of the day. I love a good purse sized brush but most of them end up getting smashed in my bag. I love the ghd mini brush for a hard one that won’t bend easily in your bag. The Hair Rituel by Sisley Brush comes in a mini Pocket Brush size and I love it. I do wish I had a mini case for it to protect it better, but it’s still very sturdy and durable. I love that it’s mini but still big enough to be effective. That wraps up my May favorites! If you had any loves please let me know! I always love reading about the things you’ve discovered and have fallen in love with.",

I had a major skin flareup from bug spray last year that resulted in hives. It took about 3 months to fully recover.

My hair has been feeling dry on the ends so I switched things up. My favorite line has been the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4jxbHtJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eShu Uemura Art of Hair Urban Moisture Deep Hydration Shampoo\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3T9gYNm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eConditioner\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7bxOT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eMask\u003c/a\u003e. I loved this line so much I repurchased everything after using it up. It’s a great hydrating line that doesn’t weigh down my hair and I love the way it smells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter still experiencing dry ends, I started using the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3FA8jk0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eKerastase Nutritive 8H Magic Night Serum\u003c/a\u003e again. I had forgotten about this and can’t rave about it enough! If your hair doesn’t seem to be improving with leave-in conditioners, masks or oils, I highly recommend trying this serum. You apply it at night and I can’t tell you how big a difference it makes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4lsUMLe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eR\u0026amp;Co Dart Stick\u003c/a\u003e gets another shout out. This is something I cannot live without for my flyaways at the roots. I’ve still been getting regrowth and my thick hair will not stay put with hair spray. This is the best option I’ve found to keep them in place. While it won’t make your hair super greasy, if you sweat you will find you need to wash it out at the end of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love a good purse sized brush but most of them end up getting smashed in my bag. I love the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4mC2Ud0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eghd mini brush\u003c/a\u003e for a hard one that won’t bend easily in your bag.
