  "description": "As someone who spends a lot of time on TikTok (and I mean a lot), I've found myself more than a little susceptible to testing out products and hacks that come across my FYP. For the most part, the things I've decided to try have been winners (like almost every single hair hack), but there have been a few questionable trends I've had to forgo (like using hemorrhoid cream for undereye bags). Recently, I've been seeing an overnight collagen face mask, the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask ($62, originally $76) for 16, all over my social media feeds - both TikTok and Instagram alike. People trying it out would go to bed with what looked like a regular sheet mask on their face, but they'd wake up with what looked like a clear snakeskin on that they needed to peel it off. I really wasn't sure if the mask was legit, and I especially wasn't sure if the results were real because everyone woke up with perfect glass skin. Of course, I had to try it, and I won't lie - the results are just as good as everyone says they are. And if you're one of those people that isn't swayed in the slightest by TikTok, know that the mask has over 2,500 five-star reviews on Amazon as well (and is currently on sale). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask and find out why it's an automatic re-purchase for me. About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask This product is a sheet mask that is meant to be worn overnight. It's formulated for all skin types. The key ingredients include low molecular weight fish collagen, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. It's available in two different packaging sizes: a four-count or a 16-count. What I Like About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Although I've seen this mask used tons of times on social media, I still wasn't entirely sure how it worked. It starts out as an opaque mask that has almost a silicone-like feel to it, but when you wake up in the morning, it's transparent and needs to be peeled off. The first time I tried it, I put it on before bed, popped a melatonin, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I was shocked to see that the mask had, in fact, completely changed. It looked like I was wearing a clear mask instead. I've used it three times since I initially purchased a pack of four. Once when my skin was fairly normal, once when I was experiencing some annoying breakouts, and once when I had a massive sunburn on my face. I'm genuinely not sure how, but the mask seemed to help with all of my skin issues. I find it to be ultra-hydrating, and it hasn't bothered my acne-prone skin or exacerbated any breakouts. I fully plan on continuing to purchase this mask and use it once a week, especially the night before a date or a special event. Just a heads up, however, this collagen face mask won't actually stimulate collagen production because the molecular weight of collagen is too high to be absorbed by the skin. It will, however, help with hydration. How to Use the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask You can use this mask two different ways. The first is as an overnight mask. For that, the brand recommends applying the mask at the end of your skin-care routine, leaving it on overnight, then removing it in the morning. It comes in two pieces - a top half and a bottom half - but it doesn't matter which piece you put on first. If you want to use it during the day, prep your skin with a toner or serum, apply the mask, and leave it on for at least three to four hours - once it becomes transparent, you can remove it. Personally, I've only used the mask overnight. I use a gentle cleanser to wash my face, and then I apply it directly to clean dry skin. In the morning, I peel it off and wash my face with lukewarm water. From there, I apply my moisturizer. What to Consider Before Trying the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Since this mask is most typically applied overnight, it does take a little getting used to. I've been training myself to sleep on my back as of late, so going to bed with a slippery sheet mask on my face wasn't too hard. However, if you put it on and try to do other things - like bend over - just know that the mask could very well come sliding off. If you're a side or a stomach sleeper, I'd recommend trying this mask out during the day because it will probably be too difficult to keep it on your face while you're in bed. Where Is the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Available? You can purchase the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask from Amazon.
