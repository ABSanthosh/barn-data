If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s been a comeback year for hair accessories — but forget your trusty claw clip and shelve the chunky Alice band for a moment. It’s the humble bow that is currently taking over Instagram feeds and flooding TikTok hair tutorials. Of course, bows and ribbons are nothing new; they’ve adorned our hair for centuries. From the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette, whose hairdresser is said to have spent 20,000 francs on ribbons, to young women in the Victorian era, coquettish hair bows have proven enduringly popular. You know what they say, though: All beauty trends come full circle. Samantha Cusick, hairstylist, podcast host and owner of her eponymous London salon chain, puts this 21st century resurgence down to Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf, not to mention the rise of the ‘quiet luxury’ aesthetic. “Using bows is the easiest way to look like you tried, without actually trying,” she says. It’s effortless. If you’re keen to try the trend but don’t know where to start, let TikTok’s beauty enthusiasts guide you. Here’s how to style the playful bow on all hair. How to style a bow on long hair @kylei.ann gaslighting myself into loving styling my hair #airwrap #hairbow #easyhairstyles #finehair #thinhairhairstyle ♬ original sound – kylei halbakken If your hair is on the straight side, make like TikToker Kylei Halbakken and give it a little texture and movement with a curling iron or hot tool. Halbakken uses the Dyson Airwrap, $599, to create tousles, but if you’d rather spend less, try the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling \u0026 Drying System, $249.99, or BaByliss Air Style 1000 Hot Air Multi Styler, $88. Run a brush through your lengths to loosen the curls into soft waves and pull a little hair oil through the mid-lengths and ends to add shine. Halbakken enlists Gisou Honey Infused Hair Oil, $46, but you can also try OGX Renewing+ Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil, $10.69. A half-up, half-down style is the easiest way to wear a bow on long lengths. Starting at your temples, use the tail end of a comb to gather half of your hair into a ponytail and fix in place with a small hair elastic, which will make tying your bow less of a chore. Halbakken ties a long piece of ribbon around the elastic, but you could fasten a bow-adorned barrette through the top section of your hair, just above the hair elastic.  If this style looks too princessy for you, then hair stylist Chlöe Swift Bow recommends teasing your roots to create a long and voluminous Brigitte Bardot-inspired pony, finishing with a ribbon or bow scrunchie tied around the base. How to style a bow on layered hair  @sanjureddyyyy bow hairstyles🎀 #bowhairstyles #easyhairstyletutorials #bowhairtutorial #mediumlengthhairstyles #hairstyleideasforyou #grwmhair #hairstyles ♬ original sound – EX7STENCE™ Take inspiration from TikToker Sanjana and section off the front of your hair on either side, so that it frames your face. Moving further inwards, Sanjana fashions a delicate braid on both sides, leaving around two inches of hair free at the end. Secure your plait with a hair elastic, like Kitsch No-Snag Clear Elastics, $3. Now for the ribbon, which you can find on Etsy or at your local craft store. The key is making sure it’s long enough to tie easily. Cut off a piece that is around seven inches long to begin with — you can always trim the ends to suit your preferences. Simply tie the ribbon around each hair elastic and pull tight so that it doesn’t unravel. A veil of strong-hold hairspray over the bow will keep it in place for longer.  How to style a bow on short hair @kylaleelee day 8 of the 10 days of short hairstyles series 💝 super easy \u0026 cutesy! #shorthairstyles #shorthair #easyhairstyles #bowhairstyles #shorthairstyleideas #hairinspo #shorthairinspo #shorthaircut #quickhairstyles #10daysofhairstyles #shorthaircut ♬ som original – chica TikToker Kyla Lee is proof that a hair bow looks just as good on a bob haircut. If you have face-framing bangs like Lee, give it some bounce with a roller, like Drybar High Tops Self-Grip Rollers, $12. Lee gathers small sections of their hair from either side, twists them and then ties them together at the back using a hair elastic. Finally, you’ll need a bow clip with a barrette fastening. Lee passes the open barrette clip just underneath the hair elastic and pins it into place. A chunky bow will complement a shorter cut like this.

Enlist both a hair tie and bobby pins to keep it tight. You could tie a ribbon around the low bun, but a bow with a barrette clip or scrunchie requires less effort. Fasten yours just above the bun so that the bow tails tumble down over it.  How to style a bow on curly hair @curlyhairstylesandtips #curls #curlytiktok #curlyhairstyles #bowhairstyle #curlmagic #naturalcurls #curlyhairtutorial #curlyhairstyle #bowhairclips #cutehairstyles #easyhairstyles ♬ original sound – Curlswithlove “It’s all about letting the texture do its thing,” says Cusick. Look to TikToker @curlswithlove for inspiration, who makes a case for letting her natural curls shine in a half-up-half-down style. Use your thumbs to gather approximately half of your hair up, so that it resembles a ponytail. You can tie this up using a hair tie or hold this section in place with one hand and pass your barrette clip bow underneath with the other. Pull out some curly tendrils to frame your face and dial up the coquette effect.  @itsmikaylanicolee Hair Inspo 01| Pigtails with Ribbons🎀🫶🏽 #hairinspo #hairbowtutorial #fallhairstyles #curls ♬ Last Christmas (Pudding Mix) – Wham! If your hair is long, take cue from TikToker Mikayla Nicole: Part your hair in the middle, section the front into two ponytails, fix with a hair tie and grace with a bow on each side.  How to style a bow on medium-length hair @adelialaughs The bows 🎀🎀 #mediumhairstyles #slickbackhairstyle #bowhairstyle ♬ original sound – 𝑵𝑨𝑻𝑪𝑺𝑳𝑼𝑽𝑹❦ Mid-length haircuts are far from boring — but they’re even better with a bow. After a generous helping of hair cream (try Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream, $36, or Lee Stafford Grow Strong \u0026 Long Protein Treatment Styling Cream, $14.59), TikToker Adelia whips their hair up into a high ponytail, fashions a chunky braid and ties a short, black ribbon around the base and end for a look that’s sophisticated and playful in equal measure. If you think you might struggle to knot the perfect bow, use a bow-adorned hair tie to make this style easier to recreate at home. How to style a bow on thick hair @_yaliah Adding a bow to every hairstyle \u003e\u003e\u003e #curlyhair #curlyhairstyles #hairstyle #hairstyleideas #hairstyleinspo #hairinspo #fallhairstyles #fall #fallhairinspo #easyhairstyles ♬ family affair – JÆ The slicked-back ponytail shows no sign of letting up, but a bow gives the otherwise utilitarian style an endearing edge. “For thick hair, go bold,” says Cusick. “Oversized bows in textured fabrics like linen or velvet add balance and drama without getting lost.” Use a bristle brush like Cantu Up Do Brush with Natural Bristles, $3.99, and a gentle hair gel like Eco Style Olive Oil Styling Gel, $2.49, to slick your hair back seamlessly, then secure with a hair tie. Passing that big, bold barrette bow clip through your hair just above the base of the ponytail is the cherry on top.  How to style a bow on fine hair @alyssarayelee Step by step for this viral bow hairstyle!! #shorthairstyles #finehairstyles #hairstyleinspo #hairhack #hairtrends ♬ Maria Maria (feat. The Product G\u0026B) (sped up) – Santana \u0026 sped up + slowed TikToker Alyssa has a hack for styling fine hair. Using a fine tooth comb like Maison Pearson Tail Comb, $34, take a section of hair from the front and rake it back, then fasten in the middle with a clear hair elastic. Using your fingers, hollow out a section at the base, just above the elastic and loop the ends through the space. Repeat on the other side. This should create the illusion of four sections of hair. All you need now is a long ribbon to pass through the gaps and tie into a bow. If you find your hair is too fine and slippery to hold a bow, Chlöe suggests adding texture and grip with a dry shampoo or texture spray, like ARKIVE Headcare The Reset Dry Shampoo, $13.50, or Living Proof Full Dry Volume \u0026 Texture Spray, $24.61.   Like what you see?

A chunky bow will complement a shorter cut like this.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to style a bow on natural hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/49SCBt5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAunt Jackie’s Don’t Shrink Flaxseed Curling Gel, $8.99\u003c/a\u003e, hair and lifestyle \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mochasburner/video/7307355327068966175\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTikToker, Mocha\u003c/a\u003e, creates two small braids on either side and plaits the remainder of their hair at the back, then secures this into a low bun. Enlist both a hair tie and bobby pins to keep it tight. You could tie a ribbon around the low bun, but a bow with a barrette clip or scrunchie requires less effort. Fasten yours just above the bun so that the bow tails tumble down over it. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to style a bow on curly hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s all about letting the texture do its thing,” says Cusick.

Use your thumbs to gather approximately half of your hair up, so that it resembles a ponytail. You can tie this up using a hair tie or hold this section in place with one hand and pass your barrette clip bow underneath with the other. Pull out some curly tendrils to frame your face and dial up the coquette effect. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your hair is long, take cue from TikToker \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmikaylanicolee/video/7307758561449348394\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMikayla Nicole\u003c/a\u003e: Part your hair in the middle, section the front into two ponytails, fix with a hair tie and grace with a bow on each side. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to style a bow on medium-length hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to style a bow on thick hair\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe slicked-back ponytail shows no sign of letting up, but a bow gives the otherwise utilitarian style an endearing edge. “For thick hair, go bold,” says Cusick. “Oversized bows in textured fabrics like linen or velvet add balance and drama without getting lost.” Use a bristle brush like \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/3P8lA4f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCantu Up Do Brush with Natural Bristles, $3.99\u003c/a\u003e, and a gentle hair gel like \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/49O5XbX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEco Style Olive Oil Styling Gel, $2.49\u003c/a\u003e, to slick your hair back seamlessly, then secure with a hair tie.

Using a fine tooth comb like \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/3VQXLBQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaison Pearson Tail Comb, $34\u003c/a\u003e, take a section of hair from the front and rake it back, then fasten in the middle with a clear hair elastic. Using your fingers, hollow out a section at the base, just above the elastic and loop the ends through the space. Repeat on the other side. This should create the illusion of four sections of hair. All you need now is a long ribbon to pass through the gaps and tie into a bow. If you find your hair is too fine and slippery to hold a bow, Chlöe suggests adding texture and grip with a dry shampoo or texture spray, like \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/4guS8Sc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eARKIVE Headcare The Reset Dry Shampoo, $13.50\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/4grnDfL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiving Proof Full Dry Volume \u0026amp; Texture Spray, $24.61\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eADVERTISEMENT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
