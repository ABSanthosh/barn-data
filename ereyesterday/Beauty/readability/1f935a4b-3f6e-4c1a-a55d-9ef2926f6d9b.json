  "text": "My calendar is currently jam-packed—for instance, this winter, I’m flying to the West Coast for a wedding, and immediately after that I’m jetting off to Paris. Before I travel, I like my skin to be in tip-top shape, so there’s one less thing for me to worry about when I’m on the move. One of my key go-to treatments to accomplish this is dermaplaning. The technique uses a flat blade to exfoliate the face by removing dead skin cells and peach fuzz. Not only does it leave my face feeling incredibly smooth and looking glowy, but it makes my makeup go on like a dream. And while I’ve always associated dermaplaning with high-end spas and dermatologists’ offices, I was pleasantly surprised to learn recently that it’s conveniently offered at participating Massage Envy franchise locations. Read on for my experience and results.What to Expect From a Dermaplaning TreatmentI was pleasantly surprised that the dermaplaning treatment at Massage Envy is complemented by PCA SKIN products, which are high quality and luxurious. After I slid under a fuzzy blanket in the Massage Envy treatment room, my esthetician, Diego, prepped my skin with the PCA SKIN Facial Wash Oily/Problem, which preps the skin by removing excess oil, environmental impurities, and makeup. Then he went in with the dermaplaning tool, carefully sweeping it over my chin, cheeks, and forehead. Once my face was as smooth as butter, he applied a face serum, an eye gel, and the PCA SKIN Enzymatic Treatment that uses enzymes and alpha hydroxy acids to exfoliate, which made my skin feel even smoother. Then, he applied the PCA SKIN ReBalance moisturizer, which is lightweight but still highly moisturizing, so I left with my skin looking glowy and hydrated. Overall, the 60-minute treatment was super-relaxing and easy. My ResultsImmediately after my treatment my skin looked great—unlike with other exfoliating treatments, I didn’t need to endure any recovery time. It gave me an instant “filter” and provided the smoothest base for my makeup. The next day, I saw a group of friends, and they all complimented my complexion—entirely unprompted. So if you’re prepping for an event for which you want your skin to look flawless and your makeup to go on as easily as possible, I can’t recommend dermaplaning at Massage Envy enough.",
