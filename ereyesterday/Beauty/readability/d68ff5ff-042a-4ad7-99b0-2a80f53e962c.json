  "description": "Image Source: Taylor Hill/Getty Images Despite the fact that most 2025 Met Gala attendees decided to go the less-is-more route with their nails (save for some french manicures with a twist), a few stars celebrated the \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" theme through to their fingers. SNL's Ego Nwodim was one of them, with her unique but eye-catching button nails. The comedian, who was one of the red carpet hosts for the night, made her Met Gala debut in a Christopher John Rogers three-piece suit. The pristine tailoring was on full display, as the back of the suit featured a peplum-ruffled detail that brought the jacket to life. Her manicure pulled directly from the outfit itself, mirroring the eight rainbow fasteners on each of Nwodim's sleeves with the 3D buttons on her fingers. Believe it or not, this isn't the first time that buttons made their way onto a celebrity's nails. Pulling inspiration from fashion is quite common in the world of nails. Earlier this year, \"denim manicures\" began trending, with nail art made to mimic the look of the popular jean fabric. In April 2025, Doechii wore button nails that spun to a performance in California. This begs the question: are buttons this summer's hottest nail trend? Image Source: Michael Buckner/Penske Media via Getty Images If we have anything to say about it, the answer is yes. According to celebrity manicurist Betina Goldstein, who did Nwodim's manicure for the Met Gala, real buttons were glued directly onto each extension for this look. If that doesn't scream DIY nail party, we don't know what does. If you want to try it for yourself, we have the breakdown of exactly how Goldstein used, ahead.\"Christopher John Rodgers is known for his vibrant prints and colorful buttons, so I wanted Ego's nails to be an extension of her incredible peplum suit,\" Goldstein says in a press release. \"I really wanted to bring in this element of work and for it to pop.\" The base color is the CND Shellac Polish in Black Pool ($17) with the No-Wipe+ Top Coat ($17). To make the buttons stay secured all night, Goldstein sealed them in place with the CND Plexigel Builder ($27). Of course, if you're recreating a gel look at home, you'll need a gel curing light. Goldstein used the CND LED Lamp ($192). If you want a shortcut to this look without having to buy all the supplies, Goldstein recommends using stickers instead of actual buttons, but if you have a trusted nail tech up for the challenge, trying out this look will put you ahead of the curve for summer nail art. Maybe just BYOB (bring your own buttons) to the salon.",
