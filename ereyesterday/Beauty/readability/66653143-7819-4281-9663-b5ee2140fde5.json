  "description": "Rising pop star Chappell Roan has been turning heads since 2015, not just with her infectious music but with her show-stopping makeup looks that are as much a part of her artistry as her songs. The \"Midwest Princess\" has built a passionate following by keeping it real while serving up feel-good anthems that resonate deeply with the LGBTQIA+ community and beyond. Though she's widely celebrated for her 2024 queer anthem \"Good Luck, Babe,\" there's a unique story behind the signature makeup that's become part of her magnetic stage presence. \"I am in love with makeup, and I've done it for myself my whole life and career,\" Roan says on Hulu's \"Face Of Music\" series. The star takes viewers through the process of re-creating her album cover look, breaking down the meaning behind her white face paint and its connection to her work and lived experiences. \"The white face is very important. There's a reason why I do the white face,\" Roan says. \"I grew up in a place where there wasn't a lot of gay people that were out, proud and safe. There were a few people, mostly boys at my high school, that would call gay people clowns.\" She goes on to explain that the boys at her school would say that gay people are \"loud\" and \"obnoxious,\" further prompting an iconic idea within her: to paint herself as a clown. Instead of letting it hurt her, she decided to take ownership of her identity. In her journey of self-expression and artistic evolution, Roan has transformed potential ridicule into a powerful statement of authenticity and pride. Her makeup choices aren't just aesthetic decisions – they're declarations of identity and resistance against societal constraints. Later in the episode, Roan discusses the inspiration behind her campy pop star persona, drawing from the artistry of iconic performers. She looked to the stunning glamour of drag queens, the avant-garde Lady Gaga, the fierce Nicki Minaj, and the incomparable Dolly Parton - each having an unforgettable presence in their own unique way. What's even more captivating is how Roan connects with Dolly Parton. They share one signature beauty element that still catches everyone's eye: that bold blue eyeshadow. \"Blue eyeshadow is so stigmatized with sex workers, drag makeup, [and] promiscuous behavior. And it's all connected to why I picked it,\" she says. \"Everything I do is a f*ck you to the blocks I was so pressured to be put in.\" What truly sets Roan apart is her incorporation of pop culture references, drawing parallels between her signature white face paint and VMA performance with iconic moments like Madonna's MTV white-face moment. Her artistic choices perfectly embody her broader vision: creating a cultural ecosystem founded on authentic self-expression, queer representation, accessibility, and genuine community building. Through her bold makeup choices and fearless self-expression, Roan has created more than just a stage persona – she's curated a narrative that speaks to the hearts of anyone who has ever felt marginalized or misunderstood. Her artistry serves as both a mirror and a beacon, reflecting the experiences of her audience while lighting the way forward for greater acceptance and celebration of individuality in pop culture.
