Use it to easily dermaplane your face, eliminating peach fuzz and dead skin cells, which can help your skin look brighter, products absorb more quickly, and makeup to sit on the face better.Best for: Peach fuzzStacked Skincare rating: 4.8/5starsAn ELLE editor says: “I’m a big fan of dermaplaning because I like how it creates such a smooth surface for makeup. This is my favorite dermaplane tool—it’s sharp, has a good weight to it, and never causes any irritation.” —Katie Berohn, ELLE beauty editor2Best for BrowsTinkle Eyebrow RazorProsStays sharp for a long timeConsNeeds to be used with careThese razors are excellent for their original purpose—shaping brows—but Dr. Lin says they can also be used as an alternative to more expensive dermaplaning devices. “There is a safety cover attached to each blade to protect the skin, but finesse is still required in order to avoid cutting or injuring the skin,” she warns. Best for: Peach fuzz, browAmazon rating: 4.6/5 starsAn ELLE editor says: “I’ve been using these razors to shape my eyebrows for years. The horror stories from generations past scared me straight—I will never tweeze my brows again, no matter how gorgeous I think ’90s brows look. Instead, I choose to shave any hairs I don’t want, and I can always rely on these to get the job done.” —Carol Lee, ELLE.com associate beauty e-commerce writerAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below3Best TweezersTweezerman Stainless Steel Slant TweezerProsExtremely preciseSturdyConsCan be difficult to grip extremely fine hairsWith a 25 degree slanted tip, tough chin hairs stand no chance with this tweezer. Beauty expert, Danielle James, loves this tool. “Recently, I have started to get fine hairs on my chin and neck (sexy, right?). This is the only tweezer that will grab the hair and pull it from the bulb, no matter how short or fine,” she says. Best for: Brow, chinAmazon rating: 4.6/5 starsAn ELLE editor says: “After reading countless online reviews and watching many YouTube videos, I landed on Tweezerman when I decided to buy my very first pair of tweezers in high school. Although I no longer tweeze my brows, these were so precise and painless when I used to shape them with that method. I also use them to pluck hair and extricate ingrown hairs all over my body. I’ve tried tweezers from other brands but have always ended up frustrated and disappointed.” —Carol Lee4Best Hair Removal CreamFlamingo Facial Hair Removal Cream (Pack of Two)ConsMay not be suitable for very sensitive skinWith its precise applicator and dermatologist-approved formula, it’s no wonder that this cream from Flamingo is a winner. The kit also comes with a Calming Serum, which should be applied after the cream has been removed to help soothe the area. Best for: Upper lip, chin, sideburnsAmazon rating: 3.4/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I was looking for a home hair remover and found this product. It works great. I have very sensitive skin. I used it to remove hair on my lip. I used the applicator tip to apply the cream, waited 10 minutes, and wiped it off. All of the hair was gone, and I used the soothing cream afterwards. It’s been four weeks, and the hair hasn’t returned, and there was no irritation.”Advertisement - Continue Reading Below5Best for TravelFinishing Touch Flawless Women's Painless Hair RemoverConsMay not be suitable for very sensitive skinNeed an option for your next getaway? Slip this into your carry-on so you can stay prepared for a hair emergency that might come your way—the device works for hair both thick and thin. “There is a built-in LED light that helps to pinpoint the hairs for removal. By holding the device on the skin and pressing down in circular motions, it can be helpful to remove hair in the area,” says Dr. Lin. Best for: Entire faceAmazon rating: 4.4/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve used this device daily since I received it five days ago, and I am amazed. I have had a hair growth problem along my upper lip, under my lower lip, and on my chin for at least 10 years. I have tried almost every hair removal method available and found waxing works best, but I have to wax my upper lip, especially almost every other day. I immediately put my new Finishing Touch device to work, and it removed the hair at once, removed it painlessly, and left my skin smooth and clean-looking. It took less than a minute! This is the first product I’ve used that accomplishes complete hair removal with no pain and no stubble.”6Best for Peach FuzzBraun Face Epilator Facespa Pro 911ConsMay sting in more sensitive areasNot only is this device a pro at removing facial hair, but it also wears three other handy hats. The included attachments serve to massage the face and help the skin absorb products, deeply cleanse the skin, and precisely target smaller areas of the face as well as impossible-to-see peach fuzz. Best for: Entire faceAmazon rating: 3.9/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “This product is all that it claims to be. Removes all my peach fuzz (I’m 65) painlessly! All that you feel is a slight rubbing sensation on the skin when done correctly. Great that the tweezers roll in two directions, depending on which side of your face you are applying it on, against the growth of the hairs. My face has not been so smooth and clear in years.”Advertisement - Continue Reading Below7Best for a Super Close ShavePhilips Beauty Facial Hair Remover 5000 SeriesProsDoes not cause sensitivity CordlessConsDoes not work without a batteryIf you’re on the go and find an errant hair or two, you don’t have to worry about finding a mirror or extra lighting to use this shaver. This cordless device comes with a mirror in the cap and an LED light built into its body and ensures that you can actually see what you’re doing and won’t nick yourself, wherever you are.Best for: Entire faceAmazon rating: 4.2/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve gone through a few of these types of trimmers. They’re either too small and weak, or they fall apart or quit working within a few months. This Philips shaver is different. It’s solid, powerful and works great. I’m so, so happy that I found this on Amazon and took a chance on it. I usually don’t write reviews, but I’m so happy with this shaver—I just had to let everyone know.”8Best Portable Electric ShaverGillette Venus Mini Facial Hair Remover for WomenProsCordlessFeatures a built-in lightConsNeeds to be cleaned after each useOne of the perks of using a device like this to remove facial hair and peach fuzz is that your skin care will have an easier time sinking in, and your makeup will look smoother, even in the harshest lighting. Gillette Venus’s Mini Facial Hair Remover is another one that you can slip into your purse for hair-related emergencies so that you’re always prepared.Best for: Entire faceAmazon rating: 4.2/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “The best part? You can use it on the go. It’s discreet, so now, I can take care of my rogue ‘stache in the car before a meeting, and no one will ever know. Plus, it doesn’t hurt at all. I was bracing myself for some medieval torture vibes, but honestly, it’s more like a tug of war.”Advertisement - Continue Reading Below9Best InvestmentDermaflash Luxe+ProsBlades must be replaced after every useConsMay not be suitable for very sensitive skinThis rechargeable device is so intuitive that it’s virtually impossible to nick yourself. After one use, you’ll watch your peach fuzz disappear, and your skin will appear glowier and let your skin care really sink in. After a few more sessions, you may even see your fine lines and wrinkles appear less defined. Best for: Peach fuzzAmazon rating: 4.1/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I splurged on this device after nicking myself several times with the manual dermaplaner. I love the way it feels in your hand. I’m still perfecting how to stretch my skin and use it on both sides of my face. (The left side feels fine, I’m a bit awkward on the right side of my face). It holds a charge for multiple uses. It does state that you should change the blade after every use. This makes it a bit pricey to use weekly, but the convenience and safety of this device makes it well worth it!”10Best Budget DermaplanerKitsch Dermaplaning ToolProsGreat value for the priceConsCan have a learning curveDermaplaning can feel intimidating for beginners, and you may not want to invest in a high-priced tool if you’re just getting started. That’s where these razors from Kitsch come in; the kit contains a pack of 12 razors and are just as effective at getting rid of pesky peach fuzz, stray eyebrow hairs, and layers of dead skin. Best for: Brow, peach fuzzAmazon rating: 4.3/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have 48 years worth of peach fuzz on my face and have oily skin. I like a matte finish foundation, but my makeup tends to melt off my face over the course of the day. I also notice that I am getting discoloration and fine lines faster than before. My daughter recommended dermaplaning to help my facial care and makeup adhere to my skin better. She recommended this product based on her continuous use of this item. This is my first purchase of a dermaplaner. The tool was comfortable to hold and easily adjusted in my hand to maneuver to get my intended areas. In a matter of minutes, I had completely dermaplaned my face and was pleased to see how much fuzz it had removed. I am pleased to say that I do feel my face products are adhering to my skin better now, and my makeup stays on longer over time.”Advertisement - Continue Reading Below11Best Gentle CreamNair Face Cream Hair RemoverConsMay take a few tries to get every single hairThis product from hair removal product giant Nair has racked up over 9,000 five-star reviews on Amazon and “contains almond oil for soothing and has a great price point,” says Dr. Morgan Rabach, a board-certified dermatologist at LM Medical NYC. The formula is gentle on the skin, so you don’t have to worry about the burning sensation that often accompanies hair removal creams in the past.Best for: Upper lip, chin, sideburnsAmazon rating: 4/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I was a little skeptical at first because of the almond oil in it, as well as it being able to remove my fine- medium thick hair (mustache), but it worked great! I tested the corner after five minutes, and after seeing a tiny bit of hair left, I put the product back on the corner and left it on for another minute. I only tweezed three to four hairs that were right on my lip. I feel so much better now.”12Best Cream for Sensitive SkinGiGi Facial Hair Removal CreamConsSome may dislike scentThose with extremely sensitive skin may hesitate to try a hair removal cream, but we’re here to gently suggest that you try this one before giving up on them for good. GiGi’s Hair Removal Cream has a formula infused with aloe vera, cucumber extracts, and honey to soothe and hydrate the skin while it works to eliminate facial hair. Also, the accompanying Slow Grow Cream contains papaya enzymes, which help slow the growth of new hair.Best for: Cheeks, upper lip, chin, foreheadAmazon rating: 4/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have been using this product for over 10 years–highly recommend this for facial hair and the bikini area. No burning sensation or brown spots. Love it.”Advertisement - Continue Reading Below13Best TrimmerPanasonic Women’s Facial Hair Remover and Eyebrow TrimmerConsHair may grow back quicklyWant to shave, but disposable one-blade razors aren’t cutting it? This trimmer cuts hair as close to the skin as possible and includes multiple attachments designed for precise eyebrow grooming.Best for: All over the face and neckAmazon rating: 4.4/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “Wish I knew about this product sooner. I use it for minor upper lip hair removal. When I was younger, I bleached, and it was nasty/stinky and burned. I never had enough lip hair to thread or wax, and didn’t want to spend the money, quite honestly. Now that I’m older, my hair is a bit darker, and so I got this to do a two-second hair removal. It’s fast, easy, safe, effective, affordable, and I recommend it.”14Best for Touch UpsSchick Hydro Silk Touch-Up Exfoliating Dermaplaning ToolProsComes with blade coverConsCannot replace bladesThis is an ideal option for “quick touch-ups, shaping eyebrows, and removing peach fuzz,” says Dr. Lolis. Each tool boasts micro-guards that help prevent accidental nicks, and the ergonomic handles are easy to grip.Best for: Peach fuzz, browAmazon rating: 4.6/5 starsAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have been using Schick Hydro Silk Touch Up for a few years now. I started after multiple of my students commented on my “mustache!” 😅After a friend suggested trying them out, I never went back. They are part of my subscribe and save every three months. I use one for about one month and then replace it. Never hurts, quick, and effective.”Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowMeet the ExpertsDr. Gloria Lin is a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in NYC.Dr. Margarita Lolis is a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in NYC.Dr. Morgan Rabach is a board-certified dermatologist at LM Medical NYC.Is facial hair removal safe?According to our experts, yes. However, you need to take the proper precautions and use the method best suited for your skin type to prevent irritation, burns, or ingrown hairs, especially because the skin on your face is usually more delicate and sensitive.”In addition, the type of hair that grows may require a different technique to see optimal results. Certain medications like isotretinoin or topical retinoids can increase cell turnover, which may lead to increased risk of irritation, discoloration, and scarring and may need to be avoided depending on the procedure being done,” says Dr. Lin.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow should you prepare when removing facial hair?Dr. Rabach recommends washing your face before and following up with a soothing product after the procedure. Additionally, Dr. Lolis says that “washing after can help soothe the skin and prevent infections.”Why Trust ELLE Beauty?
