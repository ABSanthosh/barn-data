  "description": "I'm a firm believer that having a staple shower routine can make or break your day-to-day regimen, which is why I've curated (at least what I believe to be) one of the best. Sure, I've got all the usual essentials like a great shampoo-conditioner duo, a smoothing body scrub, and loofas galore, but it's my Native Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash, 3 oz ($3) that I'd argue is the real game changer in my regimen. After years of diligently using the brand's deodorant, I was inspired to give one of Native's popular body washes a try and, let's just say my skin has been transformed for the better. Ahead, I break down what makes Native's Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash so great, from its sweet scent and lightweight feel to its abundance of clean ingredients and so much more. About the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash This Native body wash is vegan, cruelty-free, and free of sulfates. The formula features skin-care ingredients like salt, citric acid, and sodium cocoyl isethionate, which is a cleanser derived from coconut oil. Beyond coconut and vanilla, the body wash is also available to shop in other scents like cucumber and mint or lavender and rose, as well as seasonal variations like candy cane and sugar cookie. What I Like About the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash The better question is, what's not to like? First and foremost, I appreciate that the body wash has a sweet aroma that's not too overwhelming, yet it still manages to leave a lasting and clean scent long after I've stepped out of the shower. The formula feels similar to a bubble bath soap because of how much it foams (even with only a little bit of product) and how easily it glides onto my skin when wet. A little goes a long way, and I usually only have to restock it once every few months because of how large the bottle is, which is definitely a win for my monthly shopping budget. Best of all, I've seen a noticeable difference in the softness of my skin. Not only does it look less dull, but the skin on my arms and legs, in particular, feels more hydrated. Historically, I've always felt like I had to pick between a product that smelled good and one that actually worked to nourish and maintain the health of my skin, but this Native body wash has proven to be the exception. It's officially become a staple within my daily shower routine. How to Use the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash As I said, a little bit of this body wash goes a long way. As far as shower routines go, I typically prefer to wash my body toward the end of the whole process. That way, I can ensure any shampoo, conditioner, or even face wash residue that's leftover is cleansed off of my body entirely. Once I'm at that point in my routine, I simply squirt a small amount of the body wash onto my shower pouf, quickly run it under the water until the sponge is lightly wetted, scrunch it together a few times to develop a foam, and then lather my body with it until every inch of my skin (besides my face) is covered. From there, I'll then rinse the body wash off with hot water. Unlike other products I've tried, this Native body wash doesn't leave a sticky or heavy coating on the skin, yet it still manages to thoroughly clean my skin. What to Consider Before Trying the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash While I prefer scented body washes and appreciate the sweet aroma that this particular formula boasts, if you're someone who prefers fragrance-free products, this might not be the best body wash for you. While the infused notes of coconut and vanilla are certainly more subtle and muted than some of the other products I've tried from the brand, they're still incredibly sweet-smelling nonetheless. Where Is the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash Available? This body wash is available to shop at Amazon and CVS.
