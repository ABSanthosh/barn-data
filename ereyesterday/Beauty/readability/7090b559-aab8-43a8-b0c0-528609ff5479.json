  "description": "Bella Hadid is officially bringing back the \"rich girl\" manicure. OK, to be fair - it never really left, but the subtle, pared-down manicure has taken a back seat as of late in favor of more maximalist options. If you're ready for a break from looks like fruit nails and aura nails, you're going to want to pay attention. Hadid showcased her glossy new manicure in a recent Instagram carousel, giving followers a behind-the-scenes look at a photoshoot for her fragrance brand, 'Ôrebella, in collaboration with Wildflower phone cases. Hadid's nails were filed into a mid-length square shape and painted with a nude, cool-toned polish - the ultimate rich girl shade. The manicure was first coined by celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik, who works with some of the biggest celebrity names in the game, like Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, and Hailee Steinfeld. \"'Rich girl' nails are a modern take on a sophisticated classic,\" Bachik previously told us about the trend. \"[The] color is a creamy, full-coverage nude paying homage to the greige inspiration originally seen with Chanel.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by sydney lynn (@sydneylynncarlson) Bachik first created the look for Jennifer Lopez with a beige shade on a square, tapered nail. Hadid's newest manicure follows the rich girl formula to a T, and it has us picking up our phones and scheduling our next nail appointment. We're ready to go back to basics, baby. If you're as excited as we are but wondering what shade to pick for the perfect rich girl manicure of your own, don't worry - we've got you covered. \"I like to choose a tone one shade lighter or one shade darker than your natural skin tone, so nails are subtle yet deliberate,\" Bachik says. Our current favorite shades for the trend are the Chanel Le Vernis Longer Nail Color in shade Particulière ($33) and the OPI Nail Lacquer in Do You Take Lei Away ($12). And of course, don't forget a glossy topcoat to finish everything off. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
