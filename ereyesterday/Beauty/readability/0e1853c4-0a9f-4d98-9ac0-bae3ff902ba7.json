Here is everything I picked up starting with my favorite buy. Every year I love looking at the sunglasses because they have exceptionally good markdowns and it’s something I can wear year round. They tend to sell out quickly but I was able to find the Tom Ford Penny 55 mm Polarized Geometric Sunglasses ($344.99 on sale, regular price $515) in Havana/Polar Green. They have a cat shape with a flattened base. I still wear the ones I bought from past years all the time. I love looking at all the fall fashion but cannot pull off 90% of it because of where I live. Even when I lived in San Diego most of the fashion was too warm to wear and after living in Central and Southern Florida for the past 8 years, San Diego weather almost seems a little chilly! I did find some cute activewear from Zella including the Racerback Seamless Sports Bra ($27.99 on sale in MEDIUM) and Sunburst High Waist Pleated Tennis Skort ($49.99 on sale, regular price $79 in a SMALL). I really loved the Open Edit Luxe Sculpt Rib Sweater Tank ($38.99 on sale, wearing a SMALL) because it’s stretchy and very soft. Based on how SOFT this is I think I might pick up one of the other styles called the Luxe Sculpt Rib Tank (not part of the sale) but I think the cut looks flattering! I also picked up the Pleated Miniskirt ($45.99 on sale, regular price $69.50, wearing an XS) which I think is cute for the fall to winter season, at least in Florida. I skipped the shoes because the sandals I had on my radar were not in store. The sneakers I had my eye on were tempting but I decided I already own enough right now. For my beauty finds I found everything I had my eye on in store before anything sold out. The Hourglass Brush Set Trio ($136 on sale) sold out so quickly. My SA told me instore she predicted this would sell out the first and it really surprised me but she was 100% right! The brush quality is excellent – just as good as the individual ones although the concealer brush isn’t quite as dense as the individual ones. The Prada Beauty Lipsticks ($37.50 each) in the Soft Matte Formula Limited-edition brown packaging also sold out in the blink of an eye. All the colors are permanent, so if you have your eye on them, don’t fret – you can still buy the shades. I still think the Prada lipsticks are 100% worth the splurge but if you can wait, I would recommend waiting until holiday when retailers have their friends and family sales. Westman Atelier had a few sets for the sale and they kindly sent them over for review! The Lip Edition Set ($79 on sale, $122 value) has three full sized permanent shades in the Lip Shape Liner in Petal, Lip Suede in Petal and Squeaky Clean Lip Balm in Chou Chou. I’ve really been enjoying the lipstick lip suede more than I thought I would. I did want to note a few of you mentioned yours went rancid with an off smell. I smelled every single one I own and luckily nothing has turned yet. I think the Lip Shape Lip Pencil is an exceptionally good formula. I picked up a few other shades and will review soon. She also launched a Mini Baby Cheeks Duo ($35 on sale, $52 value) with existing Shades in Chou Chou and Petal which surprisingly sold out quickly too. If you missed out I wouldn’t be too upset, I actually think her seasonal holiday launches are much more exciting. I can’t wait to see what she launches this year. A few MAC items caught my eye. I decided to try the Nightmode Lipglass Air Lip Gloss Duo ($35) which has an ultra lightweight smooth formula. It’s not as thick or sticky as the original lipglass and I think the colors are really beautiful. Nordstrom also launched a few lipstick shades for the sale and I thought Cafe Mocha was a really pretty neutral to try. For bodycare I picked up the L’Occitane Showered in Almond Jumbo Set ($52 sale price, value is $91) for Andrew. He loves the shower oil although he misses the Shower Shake they discontinued years ago. Also picked up the Osea Cleanse and Glow Body Set ($62 on sale, $104 value) as I really love the shower gel and body oil and I do not mind having a backup. For skincare I picked up the La Mer Travel Essentials Set ($98) with the Moisturizing Soft Cream for a friend. The minis are REALLY tiny but I still think it’s a nice way to try the items without splurging on the full sizes. Fragrance sets and hair tools have some of the BEST deals this year, although I will say I suspect the holiday season will also bring us some really good deals too. Byredo has some exceptionally good sets and if I didn’t already have the full sizes I would have bought all three. I picked up the Eau de Parfum Travel Essentials ($198 on sale, value $294) has three minis in scents each (0.4 oz) and I really love with a leather atomizer case. They also have some great sets with a Mojave Ghost Trio ($250 on sale) and a Blanche Absolu Trio ($290 on sale). I am finally the owner of Parfums de Marly Delina and Delina Exclusif with the Signature Fragrance Trio ($485 on sale, value is $720). I am already well stocked on Valaya so I’m trying to decide who I should give it away to, but I could not resist getting the set for the other two. Diptyque has a few sets for the sale. I picked up the Iconic Candle Gift Set ($92 on sale) which has 3 small sizes in Baies, Figuier and Tubereuse. I think these make great hostess gifts so I try to have one on hand. I didn’t pick up any hair tools since I own a lot that are part of the sale but I wanted to give a mention to T3 since the Aire IQ is on sale. I was gifted T3 Aire IQ last summer and I love it. The Blush Pink is currently on sale for $100 off at $299.99 (regular price is $399.99). I think you can find lots of great deals on T3 throughout the year but if this is on your radar I can confirm after using this for nearly a year I really love the design and the features. You pick your hair type in the initial setting and it will generate the ideal heat and strength setting for your hair type depending on what attachment you use. I don’t use the diffuser, but I do use the others on a regular basis. You can also switch to manual mode for both settings and there is a forced cool-shot option. I’ve actually been using this more than the Dyson to blow dry. The T3 has more options for heat and strength. I also love the design and the stand that comes with this is beautiful! I feel like all dryers should come with a stand like this. That wraps up my Nordstrom sale haul! I hope you found some great finds this year! If you want to share anything you picked up please let me know in the comments!",

I was gifted \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/433tjsN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eT3 Aire IQ\u003c/a\u003e last summer and I love it. The Blush Pink is currently on sale for $100 off at $299.99 (regular price is $399.99). I think you can find lots of great deals on T3 throughout the year but if this is on your radar I can confirm after using this for nearly a year I really love the design and the features. You pick your hair type in the initial setting and it will generate the ideal heat and strength setting for your hair type depending on what attachment you use. I don’t use the diffuser, but I do use the others on a regular basis. You can also switch to manual mode for both settings and there is a forced cool-shot option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/T3-Aire-IQ-Dryer.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/T3-Aire-IQ-Dryer-1440x2159.jpg\" alt=\"T3 Aire IQ\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1619\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Everything I Bought From the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2025.
