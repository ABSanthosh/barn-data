They’ve also added some new shades of the Loveshine Lip Oil Stick ($45 each) and Candy Glaze Lip Gloss Stick ($42). After putting to these to the test I have some hits and misses. I received four of the new YSL Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil Gloss as press samples. The gloss is smooth and non-sticky with stunning colors. These have beautiful packaging with a plush applicator. Pigment is 10/10 on point with perfect coverage and a nice glossy finish. These have Spicy Ginger and Pepper Oils and they have a noticeable spicy gingery scent. Plumping effect is very strong and noticeable within minutes. On me there’s a medium level for a plumping sting but the tingle is INTENSE on my lips with a slight numbing heated sensation. They’re not as painful as the Fenty Gloss Bomb Heat, Charlotte Tilbury Plumpgasm Gloss or Maybelline Lifter Plump Gloss, but the tingle is still very strong and I found them too strong for my sensitive lips. On a tingle scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the most painful) I’d rate the YSL tingle level 8.5. 02 Lucky Moonstone is a sheer glossy light pink 44 Nude Lavalliere is a pretty neutral pink 1 Thunder Stealer is a stunning lilac with gold shimmer 8 Purple Dream is a pretty reddish plum If your lips can handle the tingle, I do think the colors and finish are exceptionally beautiful. For me I have tried these on a few different days and I’ve decided these unfortunately are too strong for me. These launch at Sephora on 3/28 (on the app) and 3/29 online. New Shades Loveshine Lip Oil Stick + Candy Glaze I’m always excited for new shades of the YSL tinted balms. There are two new shades of the Candy Glaze which is my favorite formula from YSL. It’s on the thicker side but in a good way so the colors adhere well to the lips and they stay put longer than other tinted balms. They added 44 Nude Lavalliere to the lineup which is a pretty cool toned pink and 16 Watermelon High which is a warm rose. I love the colors and finish. YSL also added new shades of the Loveshine Lip Oil Stick in 213 Pink Trip and 214 Wet Guava. Both are beautiful soft pink neutrals but since they are sheer they both look very similar on my pigmented lips. I pulled a few other pinkish neutrals I have in the same formula. While they look different swatched on the arm, on my lips they look so similar. I think I have a slight preference for Wet Guava if I had to pick just one. Both formulas/shades are all out now at Sephora. Overall love the new Candy Glaze shades. I think the new Loveshines are pretty and will probably show up better on most of you. My natural lips are on the darker side so sheer shades don’t always show up on my lips. As much as I love the colors and finish, I think the new Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil Glosses are a pass for me mainly because I can’t handle the tingle. Available at Sephora. Press samples sent for the oils and the others were purchased by me.",

For me I have tried these on a few different days and I’ve decided these unfortunately are too strong for me. These launch at Sephora on 3/28 (on the app) and 3/29 online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNew Shades Loveshine Lip Oil Stick + Candy Glaze\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/YSL-New-Candy-Glaze-Loveshine-shades-ss.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/YSL-New-Candy-Glaze-Loveshine-shades-ss-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"New Shades YSL Candy Glaze and Loveshine\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"New YSL Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil, Loveshine + Candy Glaze Shades.

There are two new shades of the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4ihA3bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eCandy Glaze\u003c/a\u003e which is my favorite formula from YSL. It’s on the thicker side but in a good way so the colors adhere well to the lips and they stay put longer than other tinted balms. They added \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4iBA6yn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e44 Nude Lavalliere\u003c/a\u003e to the lineup which is a pretty cool toned pink and \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/4ihA3bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e16 Watermelon High\u003c/a\u003e which is a warm rose.

Both are beautiful soft pink neutrals but since they are sheer they both look very similar on my pigmented lips. I pulled a few other pinkish neutrals I have in the same formula. While they look different swatched on the arm, on my lips they look so similar. I think I have a slight preference for Wet Guava if I had to pick just one. Both formulas/shades are all out now at Sephora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/YSL-New-Candy-Glaze-Loveshine-shades-SABRINA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/YSL-New-Candy-Glaze-Loveshine-shades-SABRINA-1440x2150.jpg\" alt=\"New Shades YSL Candy Glaze and Loveshine\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1613\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"New YSL Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil, Loveshine + Candy Glaze Shades.

I think the new Loveshines are pretty and will probably show up better on most of you. My natural lips are on the darker side so sheer shades don’t always show up on my lips. As much as I love the colors and finish, I think the new Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil Glosses are a pass for me mainly because I can’t handle the tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable at \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/42gOxT1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eSephora\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePress samples sent for the oils and the others were purchased by me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\u003c/article\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
