Alongside fashion's ever-shifting trend culture, beauty industry experts and tastemakers are also eagerly anticipating 2025's hottest makeup, skin-care and hair-care trends.Back in 2024, Gen Alpha burst onto the skin-care scene as the generation's oldest members entered their tween years; savory tomato-scented fragrances had a moment; and cherry-red hues dominated every corner of our routines (see: cherry-cola hair, black cherry lips and burgundy blushes). We also saw a rise in beauty brands reaching across the aisle to collaborate with indie fashion labels, major celebrities expanding their beauty empires (Fenty Hair, Cécred and Orebella, to name a few) and the skin-care industry embracing of-the-moment ingredients like exosomes, ectoin and hypochlorous acid.To prepare for this year, we consulted the most plugged-in beauty experts for their predictions on 2025's buzziest trends, from growing interest in scalp care to a new self-care trend evolving out of the \"anti-wellness\" phenomenon.Skin-first CosmeticsPhoto: Courtesy of KosasThough two-in-one products may conjure images of shampoo-and-conditioner fusions, makeup and skin-care hybrids are the elevated overachievers poised to dominate beauty lovers' routines in 2025.Nyakio Grieco, co-founder of inclusive beauty retailer Thirteen Lune and founder of beauty brand Relevant, singles out skin-first cosmetics (aka \"cosmetics that are infused with skin-care benefits\") as one of this year's defining beauty trends. Grieco tells Fashionista that she foresees the continued rise of \"clean cosmetics that are long-wearing and buildable, but really speak to the idea that everything has to come from a great canvas of skin.\"Embodying the best of both the makeup and skin-care worlds, these buzzy multitaskers take many different forms, including serum-infused color correctors (Kosas' Revealer Extra Bright Serum Powered Color Corrector, above), SPF-spiked skin tints (Ciele's Tint \u0026 Protect SPF 50+ Tinted Serum), exfoliating lip balms (Eadem's Le Chouchou Lip Softening Balm) and niacinamide-packed blushes (Caliray's Blurry Blush).Therapeutic LazinessAs Gen Zers pare down their skin-care routines from the once-trendy 10-steps to a simplified, necessities-only ritual, self-care is also entering its easygoing era with \"Therapeutic Laziness\" on the horizon. We've got some good news for fans of \"bed rotting\" (i.e. lounging in bed for extended periods of time): Self-care is taking the \"Sleeping Beauty\" route in 2025 as resting and remaining delightfully unproductive edges into the mainstream.\"The antidote to rising levels of burnout and anxiety, 'Therapeutic Laziness' offers a guilt-free retreat where therapeutic rest meets beauty,\" Clare Varga, director of beauty at trend forecasting agency WGSN, says. \"Our beds will become wellness zones and self-care sanctuaries. Think 'treat-while-you-laze' products that enhance skin and hair health while you unwind, or sensorial bedding imbued with nourishing ingredients and scents that bridge the gap between skin care and sleep.\"Varga also predicts a growing interest in \"sleep tourism,\" with hotels and retreats offering \"sleep-enhancing amenities\" like AI smart beds. Equinox Hotel in New York City offers \"The Art + Science of Sleep\" program, which includes a two-night stay in a room optimized for sleep and a lineup of restorative sleep-boosting amenities such as a Spa Wave Table, cryotherapy as well as hot and cold plunges. Los Angeles' Hotel Figueroa — better known as The Fig — also provides a \"Slumber in Style\" package, equipped with an Osea Malibu Sleep kit including vagus nerve oil, bath oil and pillow mist for a relaxing experience. Needless to say, we'll keep our eye masks and white-noise machines close by this year.A Continued Obsession With BlushPhoto: Courtesy of ColourpopOn the heels of 2024's many blush trends — boyfriend blush, beige blush and sunset blush, for example — the beauty pendulum may seem primed to swing the other way (flashes of rouge-less beats circa 2010s come to mind), but we're not giving up our beloved rosy cheeks for 2025.As Launchmetrics' Chief Marketing Officer Alison Bringé notes, blush was \"the hero product of 2024\" and the data and insights company saw an 8% average media impact value (MIV) growth for blush product mentions last year, thus laying the groundwork for another blush-centric makeup year. Beautyblender founder and CEO Rea Ann Silva concurs: \"I don't think blush is going anywhere,\" she says. \"I think blush is a part of the color story. I think application, placement of blush might become more focused.\"Silva's trendy application prediction? She's anticipating higher blush placement under the eye — think: \"you just ran three miles and you're blushing.\" Far more chill than actually running three miles.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesSkin-Care-Level Body CarePhoto: Courtesy of NécessaireSo often we leave all the high-quality ingredients on our face while neglecting the rest of our body. That's about to change for 2025: Body-care products formulated with skin-care-level ingredients are delivering the head-to-toe hydration and attention our bodies deserve.Grieco agrees that the growing revelation that body care is skin care is here to stay. \"[Body care is] not an afterthought, and I think that's why we're still seeing this uptick of amazing brands,\" Grieco says. \"I'm obsessed right now with Desi Perkins. It's called [Dezi Skin] Body Gloss, we carry it in-store, [it's] super hydrating, but also gives you that glass skin look for the body, not just the face. I think there's going to be a huge uptick in body care, and it makes me really excited because I started my career in body care, and I'm looking forward to innovating more, not only for Relevant but bringing more premium body care into the Thirteen Lune platform.\"Along with Dezi Skin's Body Gloss, other brands embracing leveled-up body care include Nécessaire (a vitamin C and enzyme-packed body wash), Soft Services (an exfoliating body bar with mineral microcrystals, glycerin and shea butter) and Goldfaden MD (a retinol-boosted hand cream).The Season of Scalp CarePhoto: Launchmetrics SpotlightJust as body care is finally getting the skin-care treatment in 2025, another underrepresented market is also entering the spotlight: scalp care. Sure, it's hard to ignore pesky dandruff or perpetually oily roots, but many of us treat scalp-related issues as hair problems, not skin ones.GlossGenius, a software and technology company for salons and spas, crowned scalp treatments as its top 2025 trend prediction in its 2024 Glossed end-of-the-year report on the biggest beauty and wellness trends. \"A really interesting insight I find, and has piqued my interest personally, is scalp care, treating the scalp like your face or your hair with that same level of attention to health and wellness,\" GlossGenius Director of Brand Marketing Amanda Giddon says. \"I think we often overlook the scalp as skin and skin care.\"From its survey of thousands of beauty and wellness professionals, GlossGenius found that scalp detox increased 88% year-over-year and scalp facials increased 67% in 2024. Grieco also anticipates scalp care will have a moment in 2025, thanks to rising interest in \"total skin care from head to toe\" that emerged post-Covid where many people had to become their own estheticians and hair stylists. Within the burgeoning scalp-care space, there's plenty of products quelling irritation, including The Rootist's Pre-Shampoo Scalp Clarifying Rinse, Jupiter's Renewing Scalp Moisturizer, Seen's Restore Scalp Serum and Act + Acre's Daily Hydro Scalp Serum.AI Skin-Care InnovationsLast year, Gen Zers increasingly enlisted artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT to generate personalized skin-care routines, rather than booking dermatologist appointments, which signaled a unique opportunity for beauty brands looking to utilize the new technology. Some major players in the skin-care space such as Cetaphil, La Roche-Posay and Clinique already use AI for skin analysis and product recommendations, but Grieco sees AI-backed skin care only expanding as it offers opportunities for growth and greater product efficacy.\"Understanding the microbiome and the skin barrier and the technology and research that can happen through AI and be generated through AI, that can then inform innovation, is a game changer from a clinical standpoint and an efficacy standpoint,\" Grieco says. \"I find it really, really interesting as long as these brands are coming to market with a true, authentic reason for being, I think it can only enhance a lot of the efficacy of the products on the marketplace.\"Vibrant, Ethereal Eye MakeupPhoto: Launchmetrics SpotlightAlthough Pantone declared Mocha Mousse 2025's official shade, the soft chocolate-y brown hue won't be the only color dominating our makeup looks. \"Especially for spring and summer, we're going to see a return to color,\" Silva says of 2025's eye-makeup trends, citing an upcoming resurgence of peach, pink and tangerine shades in contrast to the previous year's darker, dramatic hues.She predicts we'll increasingly tap into an \"ethereal,\" \"natural goddess-y look,\" calling out colorful mascara and radiant finishes as potential 2025 staples. Melinda Solares, a Sephora Beauty Director, also forecasts a rise in eye-catching looks: \"Maximalism will still be prevalent in the makeup category, but through self-expressive artistry and editorial additions versus heavy coverage and excess steps.\"Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
