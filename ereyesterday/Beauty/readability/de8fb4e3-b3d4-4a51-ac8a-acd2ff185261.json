  "description": "Of all the year's biggest nail trends, there's one that everyone on social media is suddenly raving about again: matte nails. That's right, the manicure finish is officially in its comeback era. Think of it like the edgier cousin of the high-shine looks you know and love that can make textures and nail-art designs really pop. Unlike classic trends like the \"rich girl\" designs you've been seeing everywhere, matte nails are timeless. The satiny finish adds a flatness to any nail look and is versatile enough to pair with all designs, including hearts, swirls, smiley faces, and even the classic french manicure. The best part? This style is a year-round staple, with colder months championing darker shades like burgundy, emerald green, or deep brown, while the warmer parts of the year often see more mood-boosting hues. If you want to take things up a notch, there's always the option for matte nail art, too. You can expect to see all kinds of matte nail ideas taking over your social feeds, whether it's dark hues, pastels, or something else entirely. You may even spot some out-of-the-box matte nail art designs like clouds or geometric shapes. Whether you want to go bold or keep things simple and classic, there are no limits to what you can do with matte nail designs. Here's everything else you need to know about the comeback trend, as well as some manicure ideas you can bring with you to your next salon appointment. Best Matte Nail-Polish Topcoats What we really love about matte nails is how easy it is to create the finish at home or, if you'd like a more complicated design, take it to the salon. Giving yourself a DIY manicure doesn't mean you have to stock up on matte colors, either. Grabbing a topcoat with a matte finish will provide equally flawless results while allowing you to continue using your favorite shades. Some of our favorites include the Essie Gel Couture Long-Lasting Nail Polish ($10), OPI Matte Top Coat ($11), Beetles Gel No Wipe Matte Top Coat ($7), and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish Matte Top Coat ($10). For anyone on a budget, we also recommend the Wet n Wild Matte Top Coat ($1). Best Matte Nail Colors There is no limit to the color options for this staple trend; you can adapt them to your aesthetic. If you're on the hunt for a more grungy look, consider reds and blacks, or opt for pastels and neutral shades if you're after a soft, delicate look. Neon colors will brighten your entire disposition and allow you to add bold patterns and designs to your manicure.",
