  "text": "Dior Beauty launched new bronzers in two different formats called the Forever Nude Bronzer ($52, available in 8 shades) that come in a soft glow and matte option along with a Forever Nude Bronze Jumbo ($64, available in 4 shades) in an oversized compact. Both come in a stunning quilted stitched mirrored compact that has an ultra luxurious feel. These are soft bronzers with a floral gardenia/jasmine like scent (I can’t quite pinpoint the exact notes, but it’s a nice floral). The bronzers launched online first and while they both have recommended shades based on your Dior foundation color, I was still unsure of which color to get. I ordered a few to try based on their charts. The names and numbers in the regular option aren’t the same as the jumbo which is a little confusing. The regular size has shades in the 01, 02 through 08 numerical order while the jumbos are listed at shades 10, 20, 30 and 40. I wear either a 2.5N or 3N in Dior foundations depending on the formulas. I have a medium tan golden undertone that shifts depending on how tan I am. My winter shade pulls more olive and neutral while my summer shade pulls more golden. The Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick has the best matches for me. I’m getting a little bit more sun so 3N is my best match now. If you’re thoroughly confused on which one to get, you’re not alone. Here’s what I bought and my thoughts on each shade. Beauty breakdown for what I’m wearing below too: Foundation – Dior Forever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick in 3N Powder – Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish Powder in Medium Eyeshadow – Makeup by Mario Master Mattes + Patrick Ta Eye Illusion Duo Do You Know Who I Am? Mascara – Tarte Tartelette Tubing Mascara Brows – Glossier Boy Brow Arch Pencil in Warm Brown Lip Gloss – Dior Addict Lip Maximizer in 090 Sparkly Sienna Nails – Dior Vernis in 330 Coral Pop Dior Forever Nude Bronze (regular sizes) Dior Forever Nude Bronze in the regular size is what I like the most because of the shades. I love that they have a soft glow version and a matte, although on my skin the glow one looks matte and I can’t really tell the difference in finish. 03 Soft is almost like my skin, definitely noticeable but subtle 04 Warm is my favorite of the ones I tried, this is my perfect soft bronze shade, the name is misleading because it’s really not “warm,” it’s just what they named it 04 Warm Matte is a little darker and cooler than 04 Warm, similar on my skin, but the matte version pulls darker on me The Forever Nude Bronze Jumbo bronzers are so beautiful and if you’re going to be using a lot of bronzer I love that they have an oversized version. Shade 20 Medium Matte is the better option for me out of the two jumbos I tried because it’s warmer in undertone. Shade 30 Tan Matte is significantly more cool in undertone and while it’s a good bronze color, cool tones end up looking grey and ashy on my skin. Overall a solid A+ for formula and performance. I love that they’re really soft and natural looking. I like the range of undertones and I think finding the right shade is a little tricky since I know we all have different preferences for how warm or cool something looks. Right now I think 04 Warm is my favorite and for the Jumbo one I’m partial to 20 Medium Matte. You can find the Regular Sized version at Dior, Nordstrom, Saks, Macy’s. The Jumbo Size is available at Dior, Sephora and Ulta Beauty. There’s still one more day to shop the Sephora Sale with code SAVEMORE! It ends 4/14. I will be posting my haul tomorrow but I don’t know if I will have time to give a full review to the other bronzers I hauled but I did swatch them in this video here. For those who asked here are some quick thoughts. I did try the new Haus Labs Powder Sculpt Powder Bronzer in Terra Sol Light Medium (third shade) and I am still undecided. I swatched multiple options in store and the sales associate thought the one I picked would be too light, but it’s definitely dark on my skin. It has a beautiful texture with a soft glow to it. The product is just a little hard to get right in terms of application and they seem to just sit on my skin. They look so beautiful swatched on the hand but don’t translate well on my face. Same goes for the blushes in the line. I love how they look on other skin tones but on me they just look very muddy. A lot of you have been really curious about the Westman Atelier Suntone Hydrating Matte Bronzing Drops. I picked Shade Soleil Parfait 2 in store. As a liquid bronzer it’s so sheer once you blend it, it disappears. I do really like it mixed in with a liquid foundation all over. It definitely gives you a more bronzed look but in a subtle way. I think it’s similar to the Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi Drops, but the Westman Atelier option has more pigment with a matte finish. So my thoughts are if you want a traditional bronzer, this is not the product for you (it’s just too sheer). But if you’re looking for something to mix in with moisturizer or foundation for an all over bronzed tint then I think you’ll like these.",

It ends 4/14. I will be posting my haul tomorrow but I don’t know if I will have time to give a full review to the other bronzers I hauled but I did \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DIEokgDuGwQ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eswatch them in this video here\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who asked here are some quick thoughts. I did try the new \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3MXOqVc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHaus Labs Powder Sculpt Powder Bronzer\u003c/a\u003e in Terra Sol Light Medium (third shade) and I am still undecided. I swatched multiple options in store and the sales associate thought the one I picked would be too light, but it’s definitely dark on my skin. It has a beautiful texture with a soft glow to it. The product is just a little hard to get right in terms of application and they seem to just sit on my skin. They look so beautiful swatched on the hand but don’t translate well on my face. Same goes for the blushes in the line. I love how they look on other skin tones but on me they just look very muddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of you have been really curious about the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3E2c014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eWestman Atelier Suntone Hydrating Matte Bronzing Drops\u003c/a\u003e. I picked Shade Soleil Parfait 2 in store. As a liquid bronzer it’s so sheer once you blend it, it disappears. I do really like it mixed in with a liquid foundation all over. It definitely gives you a more bronzed look but in a subtle way. I think it’s similar to the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3BqLNlV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eDrunk Elephant D-Bronzi Drops\u003c/a\u003e, but the Westman Atelier option has more pigment with a matte finish. So my thoughts are if you want a traditional bronzer, this is not the product for you (it’s just too sheer). But if you’re looking for something to mix in with moisturizer or foundation for an all over bronzed tint then I think you’ll like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
