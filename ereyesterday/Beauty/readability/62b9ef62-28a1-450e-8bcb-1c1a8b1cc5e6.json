  "description": "Picture this: You just indulged in a long, relaxing shower, but when it comes time to towel off, you find that your skin didn't enjoy the experience as much as you did. Splotchy, red, irritated patches of skin crop up on various parts of your body, even though the only things you've come into contact with are soap and water. If this post-shower rash sounds familiar to you, there are a few common culprits to know about. Shower rashes can crop up for a myriad of reasons. It could be a sign of dry skin, overly hot water, or merely the result of using a dull razor blade. However, rashes can also stem from more complicated skin conditions like contact dermatitis, which may be triggered by a particular substance. To learn more about what causes skin rash after showering and help you figure out the best course of action, PS consulted with multiple dermatologists. Read on to see their advice for finding relief and avoiding post-shower rashes altogether. Experts Featured in This Article: Michele Green, MD, is a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist based in NYC. Marina Peredo, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist, a member of the Women's Dermatology Society, the American Medical Association, and the International Society of Dermatology. What Causes Skin Rash After Showering? There are several potential causes for skin rashes after showering, so pay attention to your triggers. Some of the most common causes include: Dry Skin: According to experts, rashes that develop in the shower are often a sign of extremely dry skin (and your water temperature might be making things worse). \"Xerosis cutis, which is dry skin, is one of the most prominent causes for the development of a rash after taking a shower,\" board-certified cosmetic dermatologist Michele Green, MD, tells PS. \"This is because a high water temperature can strip the skin of the natural oils that keep it healthy and moisturized, causing it to become itchy.\" Hot Water: This means that overly hot showers can also cause skin rash and irritation. \"If a rash develops after taking a shower due to the temperature of the water being too high, it is common to experience symptoms such as redness, swelling, itching, flaking, or even peeling,\" Dr. Green says.   Shaving Practices: When it comes to post-shower rashes, poor shaving habits are another common culprit. \"Shaving can cause folliculitis - the inflammation of hair follicles,\" board-certified dermatologist Marina Peredo, MD, FAAD, says.\"If the blade is dull, it will irritate the skin.\" Can Skin Conditions Cause Post-Shower Rash? Pre-existing skin conditions can also play a role in these post-shower rashes. Here are a few to know about (but always check with your healthcare provider for the best personalized medical advice): Contact Dermatitis: \"Irritant contact dermatitis can cause the skin to become dry from taking hot showers,\" Dr. Peredo says. This skin disorder in particular can become aggravated during a shower routine, do to the number of potential irritants. \"The combination of hot water, fragrant soaps, and skin that isn't moisturized can make skin red, dry, and cracked,\" Dr. Peredo says. Cholinergic Urticaria: Both Dr. Peredo and Dr. Green agree that cholinergic urticaria can also cause a rash after showering. \"Cholinergic urticaria is caused by nerve fibers in the sweat glands,\" Dr. Peredo says. \"If you take a hot shower, your body temperature goes up, which can create hives.\" Eczema: The soap you use and the temperature of the shower itself can also make rashes appear for those who have eczema. \"Eczema can be triggered by substances that come in contact with the skin, such as soaps, cosmetics, clothing, detergents, jewelry, or sweat,\" Dr. Green said. \"Someone who struggles with eczema may experience a flare after taking a hot shower.\" How to Treat a Shower-Induced Rash There are several ways to help prevent skin rashes after showering. Here are a few expert-approved tips to start, but consider seeking medical advice if symptoms persist or worsen over time: Change the Water Temperature: No one's saying you have to take an ice-cold shower, but adjusting the water temperature is a great place to start when trying to avoid rashes. \"Keep the temperature of the water on the cooler side to help keep away any unwanted itching, redness, or discomfort,\" Dr. Green advises. A cooler shower is also much better for those with certain skin conditions. \"Taking shorter, cooler showers are good for irritant contact dermatitis and cholinergic urticaria,\" Dr. Peredo says. Stay Moisturized: Keeping skin hydrated is another simple fix. \"If your skin is dry, it's important to use a rich moisturizer that can strengthen the natural barrier of your skin,\" Dr. Green says. Dr. Peredo suggests moisturizing skin while it's still wet, so the lotion or oil gets a better chance to absorb properly. For those with extremely dry skin, it's best to consult with your dermatologist about a more personalized treatment plan. \"In extreme cases of dry skin, your dermatologist can prescribe topical steroid creams like hydrocortisone cream to reduce redness and inflammation,\" Dr. Green said. \"Oral antihistamines like Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin may also be needed to help alleviate any pruritic symptoms associated with your dry skin.\" Cool Off: Ease symptoms of a shower rash by cooling your skin down afterward. \"Using a humidifier and a cold-water compress can help soothe symptoms of the rash that appear after taking a hot shower,\" Dr. Green says. How To Prevent Skin Rash After Showering Creating regular habits for more hydrated, moisturized skin will reduce dryness and lessen the chance of developing a rash after the shower. Best practices to implement into your routine include: Moisturizing Skin: \"Apply a soothing, unscented body lotion to skin twice a day to keep skin well moisturized and prevent irritation,\" Dr. Green says. \"If you have dry skin, be sure to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water throughout the day in order to maintain healthy and moisturized skin.\" Getting Better Soap: Swapping out your existing body soap, shampoo, or skin-care products might also help prevent shower rashes. \"Stick to gentle soaps that don't have a fragrance to ensure that your rash is not an allergic reaction to an ingredient in your hygiene products,\" Dr. Green suggests. \"Skip using skin-care products that contain potentially irritating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), retinols, or retinoids. These ingredients are designed to increase the rate of skin-cell turnover and can be a cause for dry skin.\" Switching Out Razor Blades: If rashes are developing after you shave in the shower, it could be time for a new razor. \"Replace dull razor blades with new ones to help prevent folliculitis,\" Dr. Peredo suggests. Drying Off Well: Be mindful of how you dry off after the shower. \"Instead of rubbing your skin with a towel to dry after showering, gently pat the skin with a towel to prevent irritation,\" Dr. Green says. - Additional reporting by Chandler Plante Taylor Plumstead is a PS contributor.
