  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Fashion Month is finally here to save us from the cold, dark winter nights. Just kidding, it’s still going to be cold and dark, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy watching some outrageous beauty and fashion moments while firmly wrapped up inside in our blankets. Of course, we’ve already had a little taste of what’s to come thanks to Men’s Fashion Week and Couture Week taking over Paris, as well as Copenhagen Fashion Week landing in Denmark’s capital. Tyla took on sub-zero temperatures by turning heads in a navy side slit dress at the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2025 show and Jenna Ortega proved that black is the new black with her ultra-chic goth girl ensemble at Christian Dior. There were plenty of eye-catching looks on the runways, too, with Willy Chavarria making the case for barely there brows and red hot lips and Schiaparelli proving that sometimes it’s about not overtaking the outfit by embracing a minimalistic slick-back bun. Plus, Copenhagen has been serving us all the street style inspo, with colored faux fur jackets, knitted hoods, and office-appropriate neck ties going straight on our mood boards.As we head into the marathon of women’s shows lined up across New York, London, Milan, and Paris we’re still keeping one eye on all of the major fashion and beauty drops happening across February. From a designer luggage collaboration to a new bouncy mascara, click through to discover all the new launches heading your way this month. Beyoncé and Levi’s Launch Chapter 2When Beyoncé dropped “Levi’s Jeans” on her Grammy-winning album, Cowboy Carter, it was all but inevitable that the superstar would team up with the iconic denim brand in some way. After reimagining a 1985 laundromat-set ad last year, Beyoncé is back with Chapter 2 of her Levi’s Campaign, this time reimagining a 1991 ad. Set to the backdrop of the musician’s country-tinged track, the video (directed by Melina Matsoukas) stars Beyoncé clad in a bedazzled denim outfit at a pool hall, where she takes on Justified actor Timothy Olyphant in a game. Highlighted pieces include Levi’s Ribcage Wide Leg Jeans, Braided Vest, and Spade Trench. “There isn’t another wardrobe piece that evokes comfort, modern elegance, classic Americana attire, and nostalgia the way denim does,” Beyoncé said in a press release.  “And when I think of all those things, I think of Levi’s. For the second chapter in our collaboration we had even more fun in reimagining the denim on denim narrative, through the lens of a woman, who can be sexy, bold and a fierce competitor, all at once. We wanted to celebrate the duality of grace and power.” Louis Vuitton Launches LV Biker BagA new luxury handbag style is about to take over this spring, courtesy of Louis Vuitton: the LV Biker. Originally debuting during the fashion house’s SS25 runway show, the leather bag is inspired by biker jackets, featuring side straps and buckles similar to LV’s iconic trunks. Available in three sizes, the bag is also ultra versatile: it can be worn as a clutch, on the elbow, over the shoulders, or as a cross-body, and it boasts a collapsible construction for easy storage, too.  Shop now at Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton LV Biker PM, $, available at Louis VuittonVictoria's Secret Launches Designer Collaboration With AltuzarraVictoria’s Secret has unveiled a new designer series: Atelier Victoria’s Secret x Alturzarra.

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase.
