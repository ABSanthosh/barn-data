  "description": "New hair trends make waves every year, but only a select few leave a lasting impression. So far in 2025, the hair world has buzzed with bold, head-turning hues like the sleek shine of glossy black and the fiery pop of cherry red. Now, a fresh contender is taking the spotlight: the \"gala gold\" hair-color trend. The buttery, sunlit tones of gala gold create a timeless elegance that adds vibrancy to your look. With its multidimensional glow and universally flattering warmth, Gala gold is poised to be the most sought-after shade of the year. If you've spent years asking for ash tones, it might even redefine the way you think about blondes. Below, expert colorists reveal everything you need to know about gala-gold hair, including how to maintain it. Experts Featured in This Article Michelle Hong is a celebrity hair colorist and founder of NYC The Team salon in New York City. Diana Mildice is a colorist at Maxine Salon in Chicago. What Is the Gala-Gold Hair Color Trend? Celebrity hair colorist Michelle Hong describes gala-gold hair as \"the perfect hue of gold that is flattering on almost everyone.\" This delicate shade seamlessly blends bright blond and golden undertones to achieve a radiant, sunlit glow. \"It delivers a soft yet luminous honey tone that feels both warm and rich,\" Hong says. How to Achieve Gala-Gold Hair Achieving the perfect gala gold look requires expert precision, so it's best left to the pros. \"This look is achieved by blending blond with deep, rich hues of gold,\" says colorist Diana Mildice. The beauty of gala gold hair lies in its versatility. However, it can easily look off, if the application technique is unbalanced. Hong agrees, noting that in-salon balayage is the go-to technique. \"Balayage lifts the natural level and creates feathered dimension for an overall lightness,\" she says. A deep golden gloss is then applied to enrich the balayage, resulting in a luminous glow. How to Maintain Gala-Gold Hair at Home Maintaining gala gold hair is all about using the right products to preserve vibrancy and keep hair healthy. Hong recommends Shu Uemura YUBI Blonde Glow Revealing Shampoo ($23) for gentle cleansing that leaves hair with a glowing finish. Follow up with a lightweight but deep conditioning mask like Verb Ghost Hair Mask ($20) to lock in moisture and hydration, then finish with Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sealer Spray ($62) to reduce fading, protect against UV damage, and boost shine.",
