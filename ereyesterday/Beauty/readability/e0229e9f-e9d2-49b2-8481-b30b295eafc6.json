  "text": "True Jackson, VP, the former Nickelodeon series starring Keke Palmer, fictionalized a fashion-obsessed teen who landed a job as a top executive at a fashion company’s youth apparel division. The portrayal of a young Black woman at the helm of a company was a bold statement about the potential for diversity in the C-suite. But it also subtly foreshadowed Palmer’s future.If a True Jackson, VP reboot were ever to occur, inspired by Palmer’s own life, Jackson would transition from a fashion company to leading a legacy hair-care brand. And in this new vision, the title would change from VP to chief brand officer—of Creme of Nature, that is.Adding to her expansive resume—which already includes Emmy Award-winning actress, singer, podcast host, and mother—Palmer’s new job is not solely an ambassadorship but a role in which she’ll help ideate and shape the direction of heritage hair-care brand Creme of Nature. For Palmer, joining the Chicago-bred brand, which is Black-led and -founded, felt like kismet.“Ultimately, I want to move into more storytelling and not always be the performer. Right now, I’m focused on what it means to be in the seat and be given those positions,” she tells ELLE.com. “I’m really grateful that [Creme of Nature] saw me for this opportunity, because I have always represented my city Chicago, telling stories through my community representation.”Ahead, Palmer discusses her new position, key takeaways from her upcoming memoir, Master of Me, and the presidential election. You talked about this role being an extension of your storytelling. How does this new title, chief brand officer, contribute to this chapter of your life?It’s a continuation of the story I’ve been telling as a Black woman and as a millennial, which is that it’s our time to not be afraid to take over these positions. I can only speak to my generation when I say that, but we're always trying to figure out how to continue evolving and where we’re trying to go. Most of us are now in our early thirties, and we’re young and cool. But now, what does that mean? How do I make a real business out of this? How can I create longevity for myself? I think that’s the story [I’ve been telling] ever since True Jackson, VP—give us a chance, give us an opportunity, we can show up, we can do the job. I know how to build a deck, you know? I can have the conversations. Give us a seat. Let us have an opportunity to represent other people like me. What does this role entail, and what do you envision for this new era of Creme of Nature?When I posted the announcement, people commented, “Bring this product back, bring that product back.” So, I want to do a lot of listening. They brought me here for a reason, and I’m very excited about the opportunity to bring more innovation to the brand. Then, of course, the brand actually listening to me about product evolution: How can we update the packaging? Creme of Nature has beautiful packaging. But is there more that we can do for their next product? Right now, we’re focused on the Argan Oil From Morocco line, which is a beautiful line. But where else can we go? What other conversation are we trying to have? Then, my favorite part is the demos. Let’s show them how we do the silk press. Let’s show them how we do a flexi rod set. Lastly, it’s all about community. Sometimes, it’s bigger than the product; who is it speaking to? So a big aspect of this role is bringing us together and having more of these moments where we can have fun.Hair is intrinsically tied to a Black woman’s identity. Do you remember the earliest moment when you came to that realization?I was as young as five or six, because I went to a private school. I was the only Black kid in my class at the time, which is crazy, because I was born in 1993, but being the only minority in your class was common. I remember the kids telling me my hair was crunchy, because I used gel for my curls. But to us, it’s such a staple for our ponytails—it’s a cultural difference. Once I realized my differences, I had to be hyper-aware of them. When I put my crochet braids in, they loved me. As I got older and started wearing weaves, they loved it. I had to have a big come-to-Jesus moment, not because I don’t love wigs, weaves, or crochet braids—I love all that stuff, too—I just didn’t want to feel like I had to do it to be accepted. Eventually, I went through a period when I shaved my hair, where I wouldn’t necessarily say I was rebelling but was definitely pushing up against society’s standards. Then again, when I decided to take that leap and do something I never thought I would, which was wear my natural curl pattern on TV. It was a journey for me to find myself here. How has motherhood changed how you think about your hair? The process of how I think about hair has been happening to me for a long time, even before I had my son. However, the concept of self-care has become more significant in my life, because it’s a way for me to quarantine myself. It’s a way for my son to see me pour into myself. It’s a different kind of happiness, because he’s seeing mommy taking care of herself. I want to take care of my hair the same way I do for my skin. Rituals are important for us to feel good about ourselves.

It depends. If I’m doing a flexi rod set, then I’m probably only using the Gloss \u0026 Shine Mist or the Style \u0026 Shine Mousse. Now, if I’m wearing my wigs, I would mostly use the mousse, because moisture, moisture, and moisture. I also love the leave-in conditioner, because you need moisture in and out of the wigs. At night, I take that wig off, and put the leave-in conditioner on top of my hair with a little bit of that oil, and go to bed with a scarf on. It seems like it’s not much, but it does help. This routine allowed my hair to grow, because hair needs moisture to be malleable.With your upcoming memoir, Master of Me, what key lessons do you want readers to take away? I chose Master of Me as a title simply because I think that’s what we all should be focusing on—mastering ourselves. People often bring up what industry they work in; we all have careers, and we have things we want to achieve. But if you master you, it becomes so much easier to be diverse and flexible when things don’t go your way, career-wise, because they never will. It’s easier to spread out when you have been able to master yourself, what you want, your desires, and your needs. I want readers to understand the power of reframing perspective, shifting, and depersonalization. Another thing that I want people to learn is finding community with people who are like-minded and can support you. Go where the love is. So many of us are often looking for external validation, and it’s natural, because we’re human, but when you lean into the love, it really helps. Master of Me: The Secret to Controlling Your NarrativeAs we head into election season, what qualities are you looking for in a candidate? Somebody who’s not only pushing for democracy, but multicultural democracy for the minorities. Somebody who can inspire, because I think that the greatest gift a president can give us right now is inspiration to galvanize; someone who can make us feel excited to show up and lobby. Of all the things a president has to do, they have to influence; they’re basically an influencer to encourage everybody to get together and make a change. I’m looking for somebody who can do that and hopefully in a positive way. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Nerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.

Now, if I’m wearing my wigs, I would mostly use the mousse, because moisture, moisture, and moisture. I also love the leave-in conditioner, because you need moisture in and out of the wigs. At night, I take that wig off, and put the leave-in conditioner on top of my hair with a little bit of that oil, and go to bed with a scarf on. It seems like it’s not much, but it does help.

People often bring up what industry they work in; we all have careers, and we have things we want to achieve. But if you master you, it becomes so much easier to be diverse and flexible when things don’t go your way, career-wise, because they never will. It’s easier to spread out when you have been able to master yourself, what you want, your desires, and your needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"20\"\u003eI want readers to understand the power of reframing perspective, shifting, and depersonalization.
