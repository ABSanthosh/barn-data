  "text": "Some beauty brands only momentarily capture #SkinTok's attention, while others amass a devoted cult-like following. Beauty of Joseon — TikTok's crown jewel of viral K-beauty brands — has quickly risen through the platform's ranks thanks to its lightweight sunscreens and rice-infused skin-care products. Now, the brand is leveraging its global social-media virality in pursuit of U.S. expansion.\"We believe that skin care should be fun, and you'll see that reflected in every part of our brand,\" Sumin Lee, Beauty of Joseon's creative director and co-founder, tells Fashionista. \"At the same time, everything we make should be as effective as it is fun. Our virality started from the fact that our skin care truly works and our community loves the textures and benefits.\"With its name referencing the recipes handed down from Korea's Joseon Dynasty, Beauty of Joseon aims to bring features of Hanbang, which is based in traditional Korean herbal medicine, into modern skin-care routines through ingredients like rice, ginseng and pine-tree bud and leaf extracts. Marking its official foray into the U.S. market, Beauty of Joseon is hosting an experiential pop-up in Los Angeles that will be open to the public through Nov. 16. The Rice Wonderland showcases the brand's signature rice collection while engaging attendees via an immersive Rice Bar, photo booth and exclusive product offers.\"For our first U.S. pop-up, we wanted to create lasting memories for our community that's given us so much, and also introduce our brand to people who might not have experienced our products before,\" Lee says. \"I think that events and pop-ups are able to showcase parts of our story that don't come across digitally, and it's very exciting for us to have that kind of deeper conversation and connection.\"Photo: Marc Patrick/Courtesy of Beauty of JoseonLee notes that Beauty of Joseon views its consumer base as a \"global community\" where the brand's \"core messaging stays consistent throughout\" its demographics, from Korean to U.S. shoppers. \"Of course, every market has its unique consumer habits and preferences; when it comes to these details, we adapt accordingly,\" she continues. \"But when we think of the big picture, we have a strong image of who we are and what we want to do as a brand that always informs the base of our marketing strategy.\"When it comes to reaching U.S. consumers amid its expansion, Lee sums up Beauty of Joseon's marketing philosophy in one sentence: \"We focus on what we do best.\" That is: building a global community and developing unique, innovative products that set it apart from competitors, like its Revive Eye Serum: Ginseng + Retinal ($17) and Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics sunscreen ($18).Beauty of Joseon — and its Relief Sun sunscreen in particular — has spurred millions of views on the brand's TikTok page, more than 100,000 videos about the brand and tens of thousands of purchases on its TikTok shop. Lee says the brand's virality has been \"completely organic,\" leading to global online popularity in a short period of time. However, with TikTok's fast-moving nature and ever-shifting FYPs, maintaining brand engagement beyond a viral moment is an important step toward longevity.\"TikTok is an incredible asset for our brand, but we don't believe in building a brand purely off TikTok hype,\" Lee says. \"It's not sustainable to develop products with the sole goal of going viral.\"Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesSumin Lee, Beauty of Joseon co-founder.Photo: Marc Patrick/Courtesy of Beauty of JoseonThough Beauty of Joseon's TikTok success has introduced the brand to global audiences, the U.S. market does not have access to South Korea's broader list of approved UV filters, which the brand utilizes in its viral sunscreen. In fact, the FDA has not approved a new sunscreen filter since 1999, so Beauty of Joseon was tasked with formulating a version of its sunscreen for U.S. consumers using our very limited options. After many iterations, Daily Relief Sunscreen ($18) was born. With a similar lightweight feel to the brand's original sunscreen, it sports a slightly richer texture and a glow-y finish.As is increasingly common with viral, highly coveted beauty products, the brand has also fallen victim to counterfeit culture. To combat this, it has compiled a list of its authorized retailers around the globe for shoppers to reference.\"It's so important to us that everyone who tries Beauty of Joseon is able to get the experience we've worked so hard to develop,\" Lee says. \"We're in constant communication with our retailers to make sure that everyone who wants to try our brand can get their hands on the genuine, non-counterfeit version. We're currently working with Amazon to join their Transparency Program, which allows consumers to easily confirm authenticity with Transparency codes as they shop.\"Looking ahead, Beauty of Joseon is working on a lighter sunscreen formula with FDA-approved filters for U.S. consumers who prefer \"something more refreshing for oily or combination skin types\" set to launch next year. The brand is also zeroing in on in-person experiences with customers.\"For the past five years, we've been able to accomplish and communicate a lot as a digital-first brand,\" Lee says. \"Our next goal is to establish more of an offline presence, which will allow us to share an even deeper, more immersive side of our brand. To our U.S. community: We can't wait to meet you and open this new chapter of Beauty of Joseon together.\"Beauty of Joseon's Rice Wonderland pop-up is open now through Nov. 16 at 8382 Melrose Ave. in Los Angeles from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
