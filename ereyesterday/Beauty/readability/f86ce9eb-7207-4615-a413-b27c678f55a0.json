  "description": "With the holiday season underway, there's no better time for a festive manicure. There are plenty of easy nail-art designs you can try at home this winter, like a simple french manicure or cinnamon roll nails, but for the month of December, we like to go for something a bit more detailed, like holiday nail art. Snowflake nails are a classic winter look that we love, but there's something about Christmas-tree nails that have a special place in our hearts. If you're thinking to yourself, \"Can Christmas-tree nails really be stylish?\" have no fear. We thought the same until we laid an eye on these designs, which are stunning beyond belief. Christmas-tree nail-art designs are incredibly versatile, and these nail artists' interpretations are nothing short of uniquely beautiful. From minimalist takes on the design featuring tiny green trees to colorful metallic creations, there are so many different ways you can take Christmas-tree nail-art. We took to Instagram to find the cutest, most creative Christmas-tree nail designs to inspire your next manicure appointment. This roundup features options for all nail shapes and lengths, guaranteeing that you'll find a look you love. Keep reading to see 30 of the best Christmas-tree nail-art ideas ahead.",
