  "text": "We just did our insane move into our new house (after being displaced for 7 months, ahhhhh!) and lo and behold, a few of my Nordstrom Anniversary Sale goodies were waiting for me! I‚Äôm planning on doing a full try-on haul video for you soon but I wanted to give you guys a quick post of what I‚Äôve gotten so far so you can see how they fit.For reference I am 4‚Äô11‚Äù and typically wear size xxs/23 pants. First off I wanted to share these black satin joggers. These are SO COMFY and I love that the finish is more of a satin matte versus being overly shiny since it's more wearable and less likely to snag like delicate fabrics can often do. I took the XS but sizing seems pretty flexible since it has the elastic ankles. This light sweater is also super comfy and flattering although I do recommend wearing a nude bra since it runs slightly sheer. I'm wearing this On Gossamer one also on sale which has flattering padding and goes down to size 30A if you run petite like me. These block heels on these sandals make them surprisingly wearable and I love the modern square toe. The straps on my size 4 pair did seem to run snug so these are probably best for those with narrow to normal feet, but I purchased in both the snakeskin and nude variations.¬†I also shared these 14K gold chain-link earrings on IG stories that I've been wearing nonstop since they came in. They different enough to wear super casually but the dangle and sparkle when they shake can look classy too.¬†¬†This 100% cotton cardigan may be my new favorite! It comes in beige, grey, black, olive, and this pretty fall rust which is a much nicer color in person than the bright orange in the Nordstrom photo online. I'm wearing the XXS here and the fit is perfect. The upper sleeves here look puffy only because I was wearing that blouson sleeve sweater underneath but it's actually not too slouchy on the arms.I've been very, very into animal prints for the last couple of years and this oversized sweater is so cozy with a very chic zebra pattern. I especially like the brushed knit and the upward curve of the hem in the front. It does run oversized (I'm wearing XXS and it covers the bum with leggings) so if you like a more fitted look I'd size down.As a side note, I've had these Adidas cowhide slides for years without seeing it back in stock but I saw a powerboost version pop up so I'm ordering a pair for when these die because they've gone through 2 pregnancies and I will sob if I can't find them again! Speaking of Adidas, this men's hoodie which is also part of the Anniversary Sale is SO GOOD. Adidas is one of Ben's absolute favorite clothing brands to wear but I have a feeling I'll be stealing this one from his closet pretty frequently. It has a really nice tree branch print that has a negative-space look to it and I'm a big fan of this pale grey-beige. On me. I'm sure it looks good on him too though. üòúI also got him this Adidas Crew Neck Sweatshirt in black with camo stripes which is also on sale. ¬†I'll try to keep updating this post as I get new items in so feel free to bookmark this page if you want to use it as a reference. I'll also keep doing mini reviews on Instagram so you can follow me there @frmheadtotoe",
