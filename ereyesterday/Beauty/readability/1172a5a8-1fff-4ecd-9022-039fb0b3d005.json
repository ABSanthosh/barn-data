  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Dimitrios Kambouris Something we can all get behind: celebrities being more transparent and opening up about their personal skin-care journeys. We've seen it in the past, like when Keke Palmer spoke about her acne and PCOS, and now, Hailey Bieber is doing the same with her perioral dermatitis. Bieber posted a close-up photo of her skin on her Instagram Story on Jul. 18, 2025, explaining that she was having a perioral dermatitis flare, as well as what products she was using to manage it. \"Always flares when I'm traveling a lot, sleep deprived, hormones, the wrong SPF, new products, stress,\" one of the posts read. In the second slide, Bieber shared the products that work for her. \"What I use when I have a flare: so minimal. Rinse my face with water, prescription azelaic, hypochlorous acid, clindamycin, Glazing Milk ($32).\" Image Source: Instagram user haileybieber This isn't the first time Bieber has been candid with her followers about her skin struggles. In 2020, Bieber previously opened up about what perioral dermatitis is and how she learned to manage it. \"This is day 3 so it's calmed down a lot,\" read the text on Bieber's 2020 image of her slightly red cheeks and tiny blemishes. \"Since I like to be as transparent as possible about my skin: I have something called perioral dermatitis which I've had for a few years now.\" Image Source: Instagram user haileybieber Perioral dermatitis is an inflamed scaly or bumpy red rash that appears on the face, usually concentrated around the mouth. Back in December 2020, Bieber explained what the triggers are for her skin. \"Some things that I noticed trigger it: trying a new product, a product that's too harsh, weather, masks, sometimes certain SPF.\" But the biggest one for her is laundry detergent. She stressed the importance of seeing a board-certified dermatologist to get a diagnosis if you're experiencing an issue with your skin. \"It also took me getting the proper diagnosis from a dermatologist after stubbornly trying to treat it myself,\" Bieber wrote. \"Sometimes it gets so irritated only a prescription cream will calm it down. Self diagnosing is a no no.\" Tell 'em, Bieber.
