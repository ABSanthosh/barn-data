  "description": "As a teen, I was guilty of the upper- and lower-lid black eyeliner look to make my blue eyes stand out. Sure, it was effective, but it's also an intense vibe that I think made my eyes appear smaller. Now, my grown-up self relies on more subtle techniques, especially for everyday wear. My biggest flex these days? Brown mascara. For nighttime, my go-to is the YSL Lash Clash Volume Mascara in brown, but it's a little too high-impact for daytime looks. For a more low-key style, I'm obsessed with the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Lengthening and Volumizing Mascara ($45) in brown. If you have blue eyes like me or just want to experiment with a softer look, keep reading to find out why the Westman Atelier formula has stood out from the brown-mascara pack. About the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Westman Atelier is owned by celebrity makeup artist Gucci Westman. The formula is buildable and volumizing. The clean formula features carnauba and candelilla waxes for an ultra-creamy texture, shea butter to nourish and protect, and plant-derived ester for the rich brown pigment. The brush has an hourglass shape made from a plant-based filament. This mascara is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. What I Like About the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara You probably already guessed this, but I'm partial to this mascara because it's not overly dramatic. It leaves a soft touch, basically giving the effect of my natural lashes, just slightly enhanced. The brown pigment is also the perfect shade. I've had trouble with other brown mascaras in the past because they were too light, meaning they created more of a statement than I wanted. The Westman Atelier shade is a bit darker so it's nearly black, but a touch more delicate. I've also found that I can wear it on my lower lashes without coming off as too vampy - something I struggle with when using black mascaras. In that same vein, while this formula isn't technically waterproof, I've worn it (accidentally) during a hot yoga class with very little transfer - simply a tiny smudge that was probably only noticeable to me. Pretty impressive for a clean formula. Finally, it doesn't flake and comes off seamlessly, without pulling my lashes or leaving my eyes feeling dried out. Overall, this is the perfect everyday brown mascara - no notes. How to Use the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Personally, I don't think there's a way to go wrong with mascara, especially one that starts out with a light touch and can be built up. Westman herself suggests one swipe is all I need for a natural look. I usually opt for a single layer after curling my lashes since I like the subtle look. What to Consider Before Trying the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara If you have sensitive eyes that are sometimes reactive to natural products, you might want to try a sample before committing. If you're searching for a fully waterproof formula, this probably will fall short of your expectations; same goes for if you're aiming for an ultra-dramatic vibe. Where Is the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Available? The Westman Atelier mascara is available at a number of retailers: Westman Atelier, Sephora, Credo Beauty, Goop, Nordstrom, and Violet Grey.
