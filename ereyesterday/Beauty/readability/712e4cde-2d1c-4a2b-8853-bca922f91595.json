  "text": "Here’s what beauty editors already know and you should too: It’s time to consider Massage Envy as a go-to location for professional skin-care treatments. Beyond its full-body, zone-out massages, the nationwide wellness franchise’s offerings include customized facials and advanced complexion-perfecting treatments that will meet even the most discerning spa-goer’s standards. The franchise exclusively utilizes luxe, science-backed brands like PCA SKIN in its treatments, which are administered by top-level skin-care pros. Aestheticians complete a minimum of 500 hours of education, as well as continue to elevate their expertise with ongoing specialty training for new and innovative services. Here, we break down three of Massage Envy’s most popular results-driven skin-care treatments, and what to expect at each. DermaplaningrobertprzybyszWhat is it?A skin-care professional uses a dermaplaning tool (a flat medical-grade blade) to exfoliate the face by carefully shaving away dead skin cells and peach fuzz. In addition to the physical exfoliation, this glow-getting service at Massage Envy also includes multiple PCA SKIN correctives that address specific concerns with powerful, skin-nourishing ingredients, an enzymatic and alpha-hydroxy-acid exfoliating treatment for even more smoothing benefits, and a lightweight moisturizer that’s expertly applied to the skin to hydrate and offer antioxidant protection.What will it do for my skin?By exfoliating and temporarily removing vellus hair (also known as peach fuzz), dermaplaning can help improve skin texture with no expected downtime. Chemical PeelCourtesy of Massage EnvyWhat is it?A chemical peel is a professional solution that speeds up the exfoliation process, encouraging cell turnover to help improve texture, tone, and overall appearance. Massage Envy uses self-neutralizing peels from PCA SKIN that are effective in improving and preventing most skin concerns. After application, the provider will apply a routine of post-care PCA SKIN products that help correct, hydrate, and protect. You can also opt to upgrade your treatment experience with a Nourishing Light Enhancement—a 10-minute LED light-therapy session that the franchise says helps improve the appearance of facial wrinkles—and includes a hand-and-arm massage. What will it do for my skin?This top-booked treatment helps minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, can result in fewer breakouts, and helps reduce discoloration to debut a more even-toned and radiant complexion.Oxygenating TreatmentJustin W.What is it?The hero products in this service are three innovative PCA SKIN formulas that are utilized to help deliver oxygen directly to skin. First, the aesthetician uses an antioxidant-rich activator to hydrate and promote a clear complexion. The next product promotes detoxification, then an oxygenator containing vitamin B helps to combat signs of aging with an enhanced oxygen delivering experience. What will it do for my skin?The trio used in the treatment are formulated to encourage circulation and oxygenation of the skin. Oxygen is essential for healthy skin and can help result in a more rejuvenated complexion overall.Nicole Catanese is a beauty and wellness editor.",
