This month, we spoke with celebrity hair colorist Jenna Perry, the mastermind behind New York City’s Jenna Perry Hair salons. Throughout the past 20 years, she’s amassed an impressive Rolodex of cool-girl clients, including Bella Hadid, Chloë Sevigny, and Kaia Gerber. The hairdresser opened her first namesake salon in the East Village in 2019 before unveiling a larger flagship location in SoHo three years later. While the former, more intimate space is now reserved only for events and keratin services, Perry is planning on reopening it to the public this spring, complete with a retail section stocked with some of her favorite things—hair-related and beyond. “I think I’ve done all my dream clients, so I’m really lucky and grateful in that way,” Perry says. “Now, I’m about to embark on my dream project, which is the East Village location. It’s going to be the Miu Miu to my Prada (the SoHo salon).” Below, Perry dishes about the importance of Instagram, turning Kendall Jenner blonde, and the psychology of hair.My first jobI’m from Newport, Rhode Island, and there was a store called Grommette, which meant girl skater. Skateboarders were called groms back in the day, and Grommette was a clothing store that sold Juicy Couture, C\u0026C California, and Seven7 Jeans. My parents would never buy that stuff for me, so I worked there when I was 15, so I could afford it and get a discount. I loved working there because I got to merchandise everything. And I’ve always been ambitious and into customer service. It was so fun, and that store was the coolest store Newport has ever had.My worst jobMy worst job was babysitting. I just didn’t like having the responsibility—it was a show-up-and-get-paid kind of thing. Didn’t have a passion for child care, but I can’t wait to be a mom someday. How I got into hairI’ve always been into beauty. When I was a little girl, my grandmother and my aunt were in the hair salon a lot—they were beauty queens, and they would take me to the hairdresser with them. I loved that atmosphere. I was really inspired by it, and I was fascinated by beautifying women.Design by Leah Romero; Photo Courtesy of Marley RizzutiTwo months after graduating high school, I went to hair school, because I knew I wanted to move to New York City. I went to Paul Mitchell in Rhode Island. Shortly after that, I came to the city, and I’ve been here ever since—it’s been 20 years. I did everything. I assisted for a very long time behind the chair and at hair salons, and also I assisted session stylists. I was assisting fashion shoots for V and i-D and at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion shows, all while still working at a hair salon. About 10 years into my career, I really became enamored by hair color. At that time, I was working at Ion Studio, which is where the best hair colorists of the time were working. I studied under them, and that was when I put the scissors down and focused on hair color. What inspires my workMy whole brand and technique of hair color has been inspired by my niece, who’s 13 now. When she was born, she had the most beautiful, sun-kissed blonde hair, and I would put her on my lap and dissect where the highlights were coming from. I emulate that in my style. How I built my clienteleA lot of my connections to my clients were from being consistent on Instagram and networking on the platform. I think Jen Atkin connected me with Bella Hadid. Before that, I got connected to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley through my old boss, who was one of Guido Palau’s first assistants for years. So again, it was a combination of working hard, being connected to the right people, and showcasing my work on Instagram.Design by Leah Romero; Photo Courtesy of Marley RizzutiMy proudest hair transformationTurning Kendall Jenner blonde this last September was my Olympics. She was a pleasure to work with; we were in full communication the whole time as far as workshopping the look and making sure we were doing it properly. It took us three days, because I wanted to make sure that her hair really looked healthy—as if we did it in the span of a year. If you go low and slow with bleach, you can really get to that final finish of healthy-looking blonde hair. If I did that in one day, her hair would have been really noticeably damaged. And when she was first seen at Bottega Veneta, I let out the deepest sigh. Like, “OK, we nailed it. We crushed it.” That’s a moment that I’m really proud of.The best products for post-color careDefinitely Olaplex. I really, truly can’t live without that. Their whole line is really important to me. I also would say I’m a really big proponent of scalp care—the health of your hair starts at your scalp. My hair philosophyApproach everything with confidence and communicate with the client. What we do is really psychological. We’re touching someone. There’s a big energy release amongst the client and the professional. Also, people like to change their hair when they’re going through a major moment in their life. Sometimes, that moment isn’t their best moment, but you want to make sure that you’re their biggest supporter and that you’re helping them make the right decision.Why I’m reopening my original East Village salonI obviously grew up in Rhode Island, but I also grew up in the East Village. That community is so solid, still is, and I want to create a happy little beauty destination for people to go to. The East Village location is my little lucky charm. Every time I walk in there, I feel like I flourish, and it’s got the best energy. We created magic in that space. There’s also a lot of foot traffic in the East Village. A lot of people go there to shop small and find little treasures. It’s always been kind of the hub of the cool kids. And so I want to add a really well-curated selection of products—it’s going to feel like a candy shop.
