  "description": "Image Source: Amy Sussman/Getty Images If you don't know Jacob Schwartz by name just yet, chances are high that you'll recognize his work. The colorist, who started out working as an apprentice to celebrity colorist Tracey Cunningham, has touched the heads of some pretty famous stars, including Sydney Sweeney, Margot Robbie, and Bella Hadid - just to name a few. He currently works at Mèche Salon in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, where he mixes up some of the most perfect shades we've ever seen, including the hue you see on comedian Nikki Glaser. Glaser recently hosted the 2025 Golden Globes, and during her hilarious performance, we couldn't stop staring at her sunlit-blond hair color. When we found out Schwartz was responsible, we knew we needed to know more ASAP. So, we sat down with the colorist, who shared all of his behind-the-scenes tips and tricks for achieving Glaser's flawless shade. Ahead, Schwartz shares how to get - and maintain - the perfect blond. Keep scrolling to learn more. Tip 1: Achieving the Perfect Blond Is All About Technique Glaser's hair has been dubbed \"sunlit blond,\" a lived-in shade that blends highlights and lowlights. \"Sunlit blond is a color trend that I've seen popping up over the past couple months, and a trend that I expect to see much more of into summer,\" Schwartz says. \"It's super customizable and gives you that natural sun-kissed hue that so many blonds look for.\" In order to get Glaser's specific shade, Schwartz used both foils, hand-painted highlights, and lowlights for extra dimension. \"The front money pieces, I hand-paint to ensure precision, and I did the same with the extra poppy blond pieces that I layered throughout.\" Glaser has ends that are a bit blonder, and Schwartz says he uses foils on those areas to create an even tone. \"I always work in layers and keep those darker pieces closer to her head to mimic the natural highlights you get from being out in the sun.\" Image Source: Michael Loccisano/Getty Image Tip 2: Expect Frequent Touch-Ups The perfect shade doesn't come without putting in the work. In Glaser's case, her natural color is darker, so Schwartz says she requires frequent touch-ups to ensure she doesn't have visible root growth. Typically, someone with darker roots should expect to be in the salon every four to six weeks, while someone with a lighter natural hair color can stretch to every 10-12 weeks. \"Hair type and texture also determine how often someone should expect to be in the salon,\" Schwartz says. \"A radiant blond hue like this is extremely customizable, especially if you want to blend or cover grays, which many of my clients aim to do in the salon. For clients looking to cover grays, touch-up frequency depends on the amount of gray you want to cover and how comfortable you are with natural gray growth, among other factors like what type of dye is being used, like permanent, demi-permanent, or semi-permanent.\" Tip 3: How Often and How You Wash Your Hair Matters Schwartz recommends only washing your hair one to two times per week if your scalp and hair can maintain that schedule. \"For blonds, I generally recommend a purple shampoo to ensure the warmer tones don't look brassy,\" he says. \"I also love the Schwarzkopf Professional's BlondMe Blonde Wonders Toning Drops ($26), which help eliminate brassy tones from blond hair. You just add the toning drops to your favorite conditioner or mask. If you're looking for a hair mask, Schwartz recommends using a hydrating product, like the Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask ($30). To help stretch the time in between washes, Schwartz loves dry shampoos but cautions that you should always find the right product for your hair type - whether that's a spray or a powder. Another product that makes a huge difference? Filtered shower heads. \"I love the Canopy Filtered Shower Head ($150) because it removes chlorine and other contaminants like heavy metals from your water,\" Schwartz says. \"These can strip the hair of natural oils, not only leaving the hair damaged and dry, but negatively affecting your hair color, as well. A filtered shower head can lead to longer color preservation and less breakage, which is a goal for all my clients.\" Tip 4: Heat Style In Moderation Can't quit your hot tools habit? Don't worry - it's all about doing things in moderation. \"It's OK to pick a few things that are potentially damaging to your hair as long as you are using the right products and color line,\" Schwartz says. \"What you can't do is have platinum blond, chemically treated hair that you blow dry and straighten every day on high heat and expect it to stay healthy. My biggest piece of advice is to pick one or two things that you need to feel good and tailor your approach from there.\" So, if you're big on the platinum-blond look, try air-drying. If you can't quit your daily blow-drying, know you'll have to do less when it comes to coloring. Tip 5: Hair SPF Is A Must We always hear about putting SPF on our faces, but if you want your color to last, you'll want to extend that courtesy to your hair, as well. \"If your hair is heavily colored, I recommend avoiding direct sun exposure, as it can alter your color,\" Schwartz says. \"I always suggest a hair SPF or UV-rated heat protectant to my clients to help protect their strands from drying out and to keep their color looking its best. Many don't realize it, but just like the sun affects your skin, it can also impact your hair.\" Our current favorite is the Sun Bum Protecting Scalp Hair Mist ($17).

Don\u0026#39;t worry — it\u0026#39;s all about doing things in moderation. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s OK to pick a few things that are potentially damaging to your hair as long as you are using the right products and color line,\u0026#34; Schwartz says. \u0026#34;What you can\u0026#39;t do is have platinum blond, chemically treated hair that you blow dry and straighten every day on high heat and expect it to stay healthy. My biggest piece of advice is to pick one or two things that you need to feel good and tailor your approach from there.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"10\"\u003eSo, if you\u0026#39;re big on the platinum-blond look, try air-drying.
