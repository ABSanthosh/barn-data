  "description": "There's nothing quite like the way your skin looks after a professional facial - glowy, firmer, perfectly hydrated, your pores smaller and unclogged. And while facials are typically considered luxurious indulgences, the price you pay can vary widely, largely depending on the add-ons and extra services many aestheticians offer. From LED light therapy, dermaplaning, and chemical peels - there are lots of basic extras that can be tacked onto a basic facial to further increase the benefits. Whether you are aiming to reduce redness and inflammation, or looking to address stubborn acne or dark spots, many aestheticians offer these extra treatment options to help your skin get to its healthiest state. But, like we said, these are ultimately what can affect the final price you pay. So, we spoke with aestheticians to help you understand how much is a facial - be it a standard option or one with all the bells and whistles added. Experts Featured in This Article Lucia Miranda, LE, CCMA, is a licensed esthetician and certified medical assistant with Shafer Clinic Fifth Avenue in NYC. Carmela Barabas is an aesthetician at Mario Badescu. Leslie Lee, RN, is a nurse injection specialist. How Much Does a Facial Cost? A standard 60-minute facial can cost anywhere from $75 to $300, depending on what type of spa you go to and where you live. \"Facials in larger cities like New York and Los Angeles often cost more due to operational costs and more experienced aestheticians,\" licensed aesthetician Lucia Miranda, LE, CCMA, tells PS. \"A standard facial is ideal for maintaining healthy skin, and with the right add-ons, it can target specific concerns without straining your budget,\" aesthetician Carmela Barabas says, who adds that they're a good option for all skin types. When arriving at your appointment, your licensed aesthetician will evaluate your skin, listen to your concerns, and offer suggestions and optional treatments that can be added to your standard facial. That's where the costs can start to add up; most places provide you with a menu of additional extras (along with price), which can then be added to the standard facial for a more customized experience. There are also higher-end facials, which can cost anywhere up to $1,800. These types of facials include advanced technologies that enhance the experience to give better results and are tailored to meet specific skin concerns, Miranda says. How Does a Higher-End Facial Differ From a Standard Facial? \"Higher-end facials differ from standard ones mainly due to the quality of products, personalized treatments tailored to the client's skin type, condition, and concerns, and the overall experience,\" nurse injection specialist Leslie Lee, RN, says. Lee adds that for those new to facials, seeking relaxation, or without major skin concerns, a standard facial is a great starting point. \"However, for those who require targeted treatments or are looking for more noticeable skin improvements, a higher-end service may be more appropriate.\" Popular Add-Ons to Get With a Standard Facial Miranda says the following are the most popular: Extractions: This is a manual extraction of clogged pores, blackheads, and whiteheads to clear the skin. Dermaplaning: This uses a scalpel to gently scrape off dead skin and fine hairs. High-Frequency: Delivers low-current, high-frequency pulses to the skin through a glass electrode filled with argon or neon gas for addressing acne, fine lines, and dull skin. LED Light Therapy: Uses specific light wavelengths to address acne, redness, or fine lines. Microcurrent: Uses low-level electrical currents to stimulate the muscles and collagen production in the skin. Diamond Glow: Uses a diamond-tipped wand to exfoliate, extract impurities, and infuse serums. Hydrafacial: A specialized multi-step facial machine that cleanses, exfoliates, extracts, and hydrates the skin Oxygen Therapy: This sprays a mist of highly concentrated oxygen molecules infused with vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients into the skin. The Price of Facials at Popular Chains While add-ons and geographic location can impact the final cost, below is an overview of the average price of a facial at popular chains located across the country. How Much Is a Facial at HeyDay? At HeyDay locations, the 50-minute standard facial is $145 for non-members. Or, pay a $114 monthly membership, which includes one facial. Their standard add-ons - gua sha, LED light therapy, and professional peel - cost $50. Other enhancements available include dermaplaning, Diamond Tip Microdermabrasion, Hydro Wand Infusion, Microcurrent, Nano Infusion, and dermaplaning for $80. How Much Is a Facial at Massage Envy? Massage Envy offers customized facials: $75 for a 60-minute and $113 for 90 minutes. They also offer an hour-long customized back facial for $87. Customers can choose to add a nourishing light treatment, microderm infusion, a chemical peel, and an oxygenating treatment to their facial for $130 each. How Much Is a Facial at Glowbar? Glowbar's facials start at $60 for members and $75 for non-members. Additional treatments include dermaplaning, chemical peels, hydrating masks, extractions, high frequency, microcurrent, and LED light therapy, all for $60 each. (A monthly membership is $60 and includes a facial or one of these other treatments.) How Much Is a Facial at FaceGym? FaceGym's signature sculpt facial is priced at $108 for members and $135 for non-members. This facial features electronic muscle stimulation (EMS), the use of its branded skin-care tools, and products targeted to your specific skin needs. The \"Signature Hands\" facial, done without any of these tools, costs the same. Add-ons include LED Therapy, a vitamin shot, various masks, and buccal tension release; price range from $30-$130. How Much Is a Facial at Skin Spa NYC? Skin Spa NYC offers a $110 monthly membership, which includes one of the custom facials or other treatments (microdermabrasion, power peel, Fit Face microcurrent facial, PCA peel, dermaplaning, hydrafacial, Lightstim LED therapy). The prices for these range from $90-$350. How Much Is a Facial at Rescue Spa? Rescue Spa offers a variety of facials to choose from, ranging from $200-$750. Extras are priced from $50-170, and include options like a PCA peel, BioCell mask, customized collagen mask, oxygen, LED light therapy, and others. How Much to Tip After a Facial As a general rule of thumb, it's standard to tip your aesthetician 15 to 20 percent of the total treatment cost (including any add-ons). So, when thinking about how much a facial costs, make sure to factor that into the final price you'll pay. Given that there are so many different ways to customize a facial, there's really no universal or standard price. Your best bet? Take a look at the spa's website to better understand their pricing and various options. You can then chat with your aesthetician at your appointment about your complexion concerns and needs in order to come up with the facial protocol that's best for your skin - and your budget.
