However, Kayali previously won me over with another sweet concoction, Burning Cherry, so I was intrigued to try this latest offering. Yum Boujee Marshmallow creates a first impression that’s nothing like its name. The scent is bright, zesty, and decidedly fruity and floral, relying heavily on its top notes of freesia, lemon, and apple. It’s almost a bit too intense for my nose, but, luckily, it has a gorgeous dry down. It’s warm and musky at the base, balanced with hints of sweetness that's really wearable. This is where it lives up to its marshmallow name, aided by notes of whipped cream and vanilla. This new launch reminds of the sweet body sprays from my teens, but a lot more elegant and refined (and a lot less cloying). I can still smell it on my clothes at the end of the day.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writerShop SephoraKayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow 81 Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at SephoraD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum“I’ve been sharing Big Sur Eucalyptus with my partner; it’s the ultimate genderless fragrance. Initially, it’s a burst of fresh, woody, green crunchiness thanks to eucalyptus, rosemary and wet wood, but as it settles into the skin, it takes on a warm and spicy feel with hints of cardamom and dry leaves. It’s the perfect balance between a breath of crisp winter air and cozying up in an oversized hoodie. I love the chic bottle, too, which takes pride of place on my bedside cabinet.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromZara Shades Of Lust Eau de Parfum“This was my first time trying a Zara fragrance, and I have to say that I’m pleasantly surprised. Not only does Shades Of Lust come in an intricate glass bottle that looks way more expensive than it actually is (and bears a striking resemblance to Guerlain perfumes), the longevity and projection are both incredible for the $23 price tag. Just one spray on my wrists fills my nose — and my immediate surroundings — with a delicious aroma of white peach and orange blossom, which takes a good few hours to fade. Anyone who likes fruity floral scents will be absolutely on board, especially if you’re already a fan of peach-centered perfumes like Parfums de Marly Valaya or Kilian Paris Good Girl Gone Bad.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ZaraZara Shades Of Lust Eau de Parfum, $, available at ZaraJo Malone Fir \u0026 Artemisia Cologne“To my nose, this perfume doesn’t lean feminine or masculine. The woodsy note of fir tree is the star here, and there’s a quiet dash of something minty and bitter in the background. I don’t normally love patchouli as I find it too masculine for my taste, but here it’s subtle. This scent reminds me of the holiday in that it’s warm, but not spicy. Don’t expect robust staying power, but I think that works perfectly here. It stays close to the skin, making it quite an intimate and cozy scent. If this did have intense projection, it would be too overbearing (off-putting, even). All in all, this scent reminds me of hugging someone you love while wearing a thick sweater.” — Tanyel Mustafa, senior writerShop Blue MercuryJo Malone Fir \u0026 Artemisia Cologne, $, available at Blue MercuryMerit Retrospect L'Extrait de Parfum“Upon first sniff, Retrospect does give the impression of a grandma scent, but hear me out: it’s chic,like you’ve just discovered her vintage Chanel jacket hiding in the back of the closet, and her perfume is still clinging to the fabric. It’s familiar and comforting. The pear top note hits you first, and while that initial blast is strong, it dries down and begins to smell more unique and skin-like. This is where it starts to shine. The florals (jasmine, orris, and rose) peek through, and aldehydes cut them with a sharp, clean zing. The notes of musk, jasmine, and moss then linger for hours, wrapping you in a warm, nostalgic hug. I love to wear this with knits — there’s just something so soothing about it on a chilly winter’s day.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing WriterShop MeritMerit Retrospect L’Extrait de Parfum, $, available at MeritMaison Francis Kurkdjian APOM Eau de Parfum“APOM, which stands for 'A Part of Me’, is the perfume I’ve been turning to whenever the winter blues have been getting to me. I like to think of it as a bottled up ray of sunshine that feels surprisingly appropriate for cold and gloomy days. The main characters are ylang-ylang and neroli, which are both notes that bring back some of my happiest memories traveling through Southeast Asia (as these types of scents are heavily featured in spa products out there). The two florals are elevated by orange blossom, which creates a scent profile that’s much more sophisticated than your average floral perfume. Notes of amber and white musk further ground the scent, making it a more warm and nostalgic experience. This perfume has The White Lotus season three (which just so happens to be set in Thailand) written all over it, and I’ve been reaching for my bottle whenever I need to channel my inner rich auntie.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromMaison Francis Kurkdjian APOM Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromBDK Parfums Rouge Smoking Eau de Parfum“From Kayali Burning Cherry to Zara Cherry Smoothie, I have an obsession with cherry perfumes. They’re often tart and syrupy in equal measure and therefore a lot more nuanced than your typical fruity fragrances, which can be overly saccharine. At first spritz, BDK’s Rouge Smoking is quite similar to Kayali’s offering, thanks to notes of cherry, almondy heliotrope flower and zingy bergamot, but the dry down is where it stands out and triumphs. It becomes clean and comforting (that’ll be the white musk, vanilla and cashmere wood) and I’ve never known a fragrance to cling to the skin and clothes quite like it. The staying power is incredible. It’s a sexy cherry scent for grown ups that transcends seasons but works particularly well in winter. I always look forward to spritzing it.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop Neiman MarcusBDK Parfums Rouge Smoking Eau de Parfum, $, available at Neiman MarcusChanel No.5 Limited-Edition Eau de Parfum“Despite the influx of tourists around the holiday season, I do appreciate seeing all the festive decorations around London. One of my favorite strolls has been via New Bond Street, which is currently decked out with glorious Christmas lights shaped like Chanel No.5 bottles. I’ve definitely developed a stronger love for this classic perfume since entering my 30s, especially with how the sharp and piercing aldehydes interact with my body chemistry to create a luxurious, soapy scent that doesn’t smell like anything else. For the holiday season, Chanel has released a special edition of No.5, featuring a bottle draped in handwoven silk to create a ‘snowfall’ effect. The fairytale packaging makes this an even more worthy collector’s item, if you ask me.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ChanelChanel No.5 Limited-Edition Eau de Parfum, $, available at ChanelJo Loves Black Cashmeran and Tonka Parfum“This would make the perfect addition to any winter perfume wardrobe. With spicy cardamom, a heavy helping of ginger and a dash of rum, it’s like a warming masala chai with a slab of dark chocolate on the side — rich but never bitter thanks to vanilla-esque tonka bean, which lends a subtle sweetness. Whenever I wear this, I feel so powerful.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop Jo LovesJo Loves Black Cashmeran and Tonka Parfum, $, available at Jo LovesLike what you see?
