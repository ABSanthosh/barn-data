  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Richard Harbaugh What do you get when you combine Rita Ora, a mullet, a pixie haircut, and a bottle of bleach? Rita Ora with an iconic \"mixie\" haircut. On Dec. 2, Ora attended the 2024 British Fashion Awards at London's Royal Albert Hall wearing a look that can only be described as '80s punk-rock. Outfit-wise, she sported a gray suit with a striped shirt and a pink tie, paired with chunky silver accessories. Our eyes, however, were glued to her hair. Ora has most recently been seen with long, \"brond\" hair, but last night, she switched things up dramatically. Not only was her hair cut into a mixie - a mix between a mullet and pixie - but the color was completely different, as well. The top was bleached into a golden-honey tone, and the longer area in the back was a deeper brown. (Also, her eyebrows were bleached to match, so it's clear Ora has no trouble committing.) Ora's new look is a substantial switch-up from anything we've seen her with recently. While she has been blond in the past, the short cut is what really caught our attention. Experts Featured in This Article Jenny Cho is a celebrity hairstylist who has worked with stars like Kristen Bell and Daisy Edgar-Jones. \"A mixie is an edgy haircut that is longer in the back, like a mullet, and short, like a pixie, in the front,\" celebrity hairstylist Jenny Cho says. \"Mixie as a haircut feels uniquely different from what we've been seeing but also has a slight '70s retro vibe that feels familiar.\" This isn't the first time we've seen a celebrity sport a mixie - Halsey, Zoë Kravitz, Kristen Stewart, and Charlize Theron have all had one at some time or another. While it does require frequent salon visits to keep the style in tip-top shape, it does typically work for all hair types and textures. Additionally, they're deemed fairly low-maintenance when it comes to day-to-day styling. Keep scrolling to take a closer look at Ora's new 'do.
