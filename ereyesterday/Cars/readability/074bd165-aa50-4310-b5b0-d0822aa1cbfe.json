  "description": "Ather Energy has announced a rebranding of its software-enabled feature bundle – previously known as the ‘Pro Pack’ – to ‘AtherStack Pro’.  Ather’s connected feature suite gets a new identity under the ‘Stack’ umbrella Feature list includes safety tech, Bluetooth functions, and app-based controls No change in pricing; 5-year battery warranty still included AtherStack Pro continues to offer the same features No change in pricing; better aligns with Ather's new nomenclature While the suite of features remains unchanged, the company says this nomenclature aligns better with its AtherStack technology platform, which underpins the brand’s connected EV ecosystem. AtherStack is the company’s proprietary software that powers everything from its electric scooters to charging infrastructure, accessories, and the mobile app. The rebranding is expected to simplify communication and give customers a clearer understanding of what the feature pack is built on. AtherStack Pro continues to offer the same set of safety and connectivity features. This includes SkidControl, FallSafe, Theft and Tow Alerts, and Live Location Sharing. Convenience tools like Magic Twist and AutoHold continue to be present amongst others. Importantly, there are no changes to the pricing or benefits under the new AtherStack Pro name. Customers will continue to get a complimentary 5-year battery warranty, reinforcing Ather’s push for a longer-term ownership experience. Also see: Ather Rizta long term review, 2,300km report",
