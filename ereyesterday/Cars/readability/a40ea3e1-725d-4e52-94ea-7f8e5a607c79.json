Now with 8k miles, it is powered by a 6.2-liter V8 linked with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car is finished in Designo Mystic White II over black leather and Alcantara and features 19″ and 20″ 10-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, gullwing doors, a carbon-fiber airfoil, bi-xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable seats, Keyless Go, COMAND with navigation, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This SLS AMG Black Series was recently acquired by the selling dealer and is now offered in California with the owner’s manual, one key fob, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Nevada title. The SLS AMG Black Series was unveiled at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show and was the fifth Black Series model developed by AMG. The car is 154 pounds lighter than the standard SLS AMG, and features include a wide-body kit, revised aerodynamics, a titanium exhaust system, and a carbon-fiber hood as well as an increase of carbon-fiber components in the drivetrain and spaceframe. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in October 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded. This example is finished in Designo Mystic White II (048) and features gullwing doors with pop-out handles as well as bi-xenon headlamps, a carbon-fiber airfoil, straked front fender vents, power-folding mirrors, carbon-fiber mirror caps, tinted windows, and polished exhaust outlets. The car received paintwork in 2024 reportedly to correct damage following the removal of paint-protection film, invoices for which are presented in the gallery below. Staggered-width 19″ and 20″ 10-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The SLS AMG Black Series features an AMG Ride Control suspension with electronically controlled two-stage damping, speed-sensitive power steering, and a wider track compared to the standard SLS AMG. Stopping power is provided by AMG-branded brake calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The brake fluid was flushed and a service was completed on the front and rear wheel bearings and hubs in July 2024. The cabin features heated power-adjustable AMG sport seats trimmed in black leather and Alcantara with red stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, A-pillars, headliner, and door panels. Amenities include a rearview camera, Keyless Go, optional extended carbon-fiber interior trim, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features aluminum shift paddles and frames a 240-mph speedometer and a tachometer as well as gauges for oil temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles. The hand-assembled 6.2-liter M159 DOHC V8 was revised for the Black Series with modified camshafts, shorter intake runners, and revised valve timing. Output was factory rated at 622 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The cabin air filter was replaced and an oil change was performed in July 2024. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
