  "description": "This 1965 Porsche 356C began its life as a coupe and was rebuilt and modified as an Emory Special cabriolet by Emory Motorsports before being delivered to the prior owner in February 2024 and acquired by the seller's father on BaT in June 2024. Power is provided by a 2.6-liter Emory-Rothsport flat-four that combines Porsche 911 internals and bespoke components housed in a custom-cast case and features electronic fuel injection with individual throttle bodies, twin-spark coil-on-plug ignition, and dry-sump lubrication. Finished in Tropical Green Metallic over Vine Green leather, the car’s bodywork incorporates a lowered removable hardtop, increased windshield rake, deleted bumpers, rolled rocker panels, and a louvered decklid. Additional equipment includes a Type 901 five-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, PEP adjustable shock absorbers, a 911-style rear suspension setup, 16” billet aluminum wheels, a custom 15-gallon aluminum fuel tank, custom reclining seats, a MOMO steering wheel, and electric air conditioning. This Emory Special cabriolet is now offered in Frisco, Texas by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a detachable black convertible top, a tonneau cover, an Emory shift knob, a spare fuel cap, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner's LLC.",

Power is provided by a 2.6-liter Emory-Rothsport flat-four that combines Porsche 911 internals and bespoke components housed in a custom-cast case and features electronic fuel injection with individual throttle bodies, twin-spark coil-on-plug ignition, and dry-sump lubrication. Finished in Tropical Green Metallic over Vine Green leather, the car’s bodywork incorporates a lowered removable hardtop, increased windshield rake, deleted bumpers, rolled rocker panels, and a louvered decklid. Additional equipment includes a Type 901 five-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, PEP adjustable shock absorbers, a 911-style rear suspension setup, 16” billet aluminum wheels, a custom 15-gallon aluminum fuel tank, custom reclining seats, a MOMO steering wheel, and electric air conditioning. This Emory Special cabriolet is now offered in Frisco, Texas by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a detachable black convertible top, a tonneau cover, an Emory shift knob, a spare fuel cap, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. While the traditional Emory Outlaw builds adhere to a factory appearance, Rod Emory’s Specials incorporate one-off modifications to each car’s bodywork. This example was transformed from a coupe into an open-roof configuration during the build, and additional custom touches include inverted decklid louvers, an increased windshield rake angle, deletion of the bumpers, and installation of Pre-A-style rolled rocker panels. Finished in Tropical Green Metallic, the car also features custom mesh horn grille and brake duct covers, a through-hood competition-style fuel filler, GT-style fender-mounted side mirrors in body-color housings, and competition-style decklid hinges. The low-profile body-color removable hardtop can be exchanged for a black soft top or a black tonneau, both of which are included in the sale. The hood handle has been deleted, and a spare black fuel cap with a grab handle in the silhouette of a mockingbird also accompanies the vehicle. The 16×5.5” billet aluminum wheels are finished in black and are secured to brushed hubs, and 205/55 Michelin PS A/S tires are mounted at each corner. Stopping power is handled by custom four-wheel slotted and ventilated disc brakes with an ATE master cylinder and rear parking brake mechanisms. The cabin is trimmed in Vine Green leather with perforated inserts over lowered reclining bucket seats with backrests extended by 2” for both the driver and passenger. The rear seats have been deleted, and additional features include gray square-weave carpeting, black rubber floor mats, latch-and-link lap belts, roll-up windows, door pockets, a custom aluminum passenger grab handle, black switchgear knobs, and Classic Retrofit electric air conditioning. An uninstalled Emory shift knob is included in the sale. The MOMO steering wheel features an etched Emory hub and sits ahead of VDO instrumentation including a central 8k-rpm tachometer, a 120-mph speedometer, and a combination gauge for oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 408 miles since completion of the build. A mechanical VDO Kienzle clock is situated in the glovebox door. The 2.6-liter “Outlaw-4” flat-four was designed by Jeff Gamroth of Rothsport Racing as a condensed interpretation of the 911 engine’s architecture utilizing custom components with a sand-cast aluminum case, 6061 billet camshaft housings, Elgin billet camshafts, and a stroker crankshaft. Additional equipment includes Rothsport fuel injection with individual throttle bodies, MoTec-managed twin coil-on-plug ignition, a full-flow dry-sump lubrication system with coolers and a remote filter, a Fuelab fuel pressure regulator and gauge, and fiberglass shrouding. Output was rated by Emory Motorsports at 260 horsepower. Further highlights include a hand-built 15-gallon aluminum fuel tank, a front-mounted electric oil-cooling fan, custom stainless-steel exhaust headers, and a sport muffler. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Type 901 five-speed manual transaxle with an aluminum case. The custom suspension comprises a 911-style rear arrangement with narrowed trailing arms, PEP adjustable shock absorbers, and front and rear sway bars. Steering is handled by a custom rack-and-pinion setup. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
