  "description": "This 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,400 Gullwing coupes built during three years of production and was shipped to the Mercedes-Benz agent in London, England, on July 26, 1955, for delivery to the Right Honorable Lord Terence O’Neill, who later became the fourth Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Chassis 55000545 passed through the hands of two additional UK owners before being imported in the 1970s to the US, where it spent time under the stewardship of two different German natives in California. It was sold in 2004 to Scott Grundfor, whose San Luis Obispo shop subsequently performed a refurbishment for the car’s next owner between 2005 and 2007. Work during the project is said to have included a repaint in the original shade of Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Fawn MB-Tex and red plaid cloth, and an overhaul of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six. The car was later purchased in 2016 by a San Rafael collector who commissioned a further refresh that was carried out over the ensuing eight years. Additional features include Bosch direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, a four-speed manual transmission, a 3.42:1-ratio differential, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, interchangeable sets of Fawn MB-Tex and plaid cloth seat cushions, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 Gullwing was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve with a copy of its factory data card, a Mercedes-Benz Classic certificate, invoices from work performed between 2017 and 2024, a set of Taris Charysyn fitted luggage, and a clean California title.",

Chassis 55000545 passed through the hands of two additional UK owners before being imported in the 1970s to the US, where it spent time under the stewardship of two different German natives in California. It was sold in 2004 to Scott Grundfor, whose San Luis Obispo shop subsequently performed a refurbishment for the car’s next owner between 2005 and 2007. Work during the project is said to have included a repaint in the original shade of Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Fawn MB-Tex and red plaid cloth, and an overhaul of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six. The car was later purchased in 2016 by a San Rafael collector who commissioned a further refresh that was carried out over the ensuing eight years. Additional features include Bosch direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, a four-speed manual transmission, a 3.42:1-ratio differential, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, interchangeable sets of Fawn MB-Tex and plaid cloth seat cushions, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 Gullwing was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve with a copy of its factory data card, a Mercedes-Benz Classic certificate, invoices from work performed between 2017 and 2024, a set of Taris Charysyn fitted luggage, and a clean California title. Development of the 300SL was spurred by US importer Max Hoffman’s suggestion that Mercedes produce a sports car appealing to the American market. The model was inspired by the company’s W194 sports racers, from which it inherited its upward-opening doors made necessary by the high sills of its lightweight tubular space frame. Introduced at the 1954 International Motor Sports Show in New York, the production version of the 300SL utilized steel bodywork with aluminum panels for the hood, trunk lid, door skins, rocker panels, and floorboards. This example left the factory finished in Feuerwehrrot (DB 534) and is said to have received a repaint in its original shade during the refurbishment performed between 2005 and 2007 by Scott Grundfor \u0026 Co. The nose section was again repainted in 2021 after repairs to the left front “eyebrow” and surrounding fender and rocker panel surfaces as well as straightening of the nose panels during the 2017-2022 refresh by Don Mertz Restorations in Sun Valley, California. Various pieces of brightwork were re-plated during the project. Features include bumpers without guards, a driver-side mirror, pivot-out door handles, and fender louvers with twin horizontal aluminum spears. Chrome 15” wheels wear body-color hubcaps and were mounted with 205/70VR15 Michelin XWX tires in 2022, as was a matching spare housed in the trunk. The hydraulic braking system incorporates finned aluminum drums at each corner, with duplex actuation at the front wheels. A refresh of the brake system performed by Van Nuys Sport Cars in Sherman Oaks, California, in 2021 included replacement of the master cylinder, drums, and hoses. Work performed by Phil Reilly \u0026 Co. in Penngrove, California, in December 2024 included a rebuild of the booster and repairs to the parking brake system. The cabin was re-trimmed during the 2000s refurbishment in the factory-specified combination of Fawn MB-Tex with red plaid gabardine over the seat cushions. An interchangeable set of seat cushions trimmed in Fawn MB-Tex is included. Additional features include tan square-weave carpeting, black rubber floor mats, a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror and ashtray, an ivory-color shift knob, and a Becker Mexico radio. The power-operated antenna wiring was repaired in December 2024. The two-spoke, ivory-color steering wheel can be pivoted downward at its hub to facilitate entry and exit for the driver. A body-color dash fascia hosts VDO instrumentation including a 270-km/h speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, a windup clock, and gauges monitoring fuel level, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and oil temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 5k kilometers (~3k miles), approximately 20 of which have been added under current ownership. Canted at an angle to allow a lower hoodline, the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six utilizes Bosch direct mechanical fuel injection and features dry-sump lubrication, an aluminum cylinder head mated to an angled block surface, a single overhead camshaft, and sodium-filled exhaust valves. Output was factory rated at 215 horsepower at 5,800 rpm. This example’s engine is said to have been overhauled during the mid-2000s refurbishment. Additional mechanical work performed between 2017 and 2024 included a rebuild of the auxiliary fuel pump, repairs to the radiator and oil cooler, and replacement of the battery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an all-synchromesh four-speed manual transmission. Four-wheel independent front suspension incorporates a double-wishbone front arrangement and a dual-joint rear swing axle, with both ends utilizing coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers. The underside, suspension components, and fuel tank were cosmetically refurbished during the work performed by Don Mertz Restorations between 2017 and 2022, which also included refurbishment of the aluminum belly pans. Engine number 198.980.5500542 is shown stamped on the block and engine tag above, matching the number listed on the factory build sheet. Chassis number 5500545 is shown stamped on the frame and chassis tag in the photo gallery below. The factory data card lists the original colors and equipment including a 3.42:1 rear end ratio, export plates, and instruments in English. The Mercedes-Benz Classic Zertifikat can be viewed in the gallery, as can an entry for the car in the Gullwing Register that is dated 2006 and lists the original owner as the Rt. Honorable Lord O’Neill. A two-piece set of fitted luggage by Taris Charysyn in West Kill, New York, is wrapped in red-brown leather and lined in red plaid cloth.
