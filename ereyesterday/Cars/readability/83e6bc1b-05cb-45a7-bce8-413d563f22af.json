  "text": "Apr 28, 2025 3:17 PM EDTToyota's highest-ranking namesake has a lot to say about the company's attitude towards high-perforance EVs. As the former President and CEO and now chairman of Toyota’s board, Akio Toyoda has long balanced his corporate responsibilities with a passion for racing. Under the pseudonym “Morizo Kinoshita,” he created a second identity on the track, competing in major motorsport events such as the 24 Hours of Nürburgring in 2009, 2014, and 2019. Often behind the wheel of Toyota- and Lexus-branded race cars. In fact, his input behind the wheel at races and behind development, production, and race cars has been cemented so deeply into Toyota lore that cars like the Toyota GR Corolla Morizo Edition have been named after him. Toyoda isn't a big fan of electric sports cars or race cars. In a recent interview with Automotive News, Toyoda doubled down on his skepticism of battery-electric vehicles. However, when acknowledging that some Toyota engineers want an EV sports car, he said that the idea doesn't exactly align with his values. “There will always be people inside Toyota passionate about developing electric sports cars,” Toyoda told AutoNews. “But for me, as the master driver, my definition of a sports car is something with the smell of gasoline and a noisy engine.” In addition, he still believes that the company has a mountain to climb when it comes to building a selection of EVs that fit with Toyota's mantra of providing affordable, high-quality cars to its customers. Currently, in the United States, Toyota offers only one EV: the bZ4x, a crossover co-developed with Subaru. “Toyota is a mass-production brand, so we also need to think about affordability, even with BEVs,” he said. “Once Toyota has the capacity to offer affordable BEVs, then maybe that’s a moment when I as a master driver will be introducing a BEV sports car.” EVs are not “exciting” to drive, says Morizo In response to a question asking him if in his capacity as Toyota's “Master Driver,” would he ever race an EV in a competitve race, the man known to enthusiasts simply as Morizo expressed that he wouldn't want to race an EV because the kind of races he likes to do (endurance races) would be less about driving skill and more about the cars' technical limitations. “No! It’s not exciting,” he said. “Because you won’t be able to go around the circuit for more than an hour. The kind of races I enter are mostly endurance races, so with the current BEVs, it’s not going to be a race of the cars. It’s a race of charging time or battery exchange or something. The next master driver will have to take on that challenge. That’s their job.” Final thoughts I am not exactly surprised about Toyoda's deterrance towards this sort of thing. He has been openly critical about EVs in the past, and this is just more ink in that section of the book. In a statement at a Toyota company event in January 2024, Morizo argued that EVs “come as a set with infrastructure,” arguing that many Toyota drivers live in parts of the world with little to access to electricity. “No matter how much progress BEVs make, I think they will still only have a 30 % market share,” Toyoda said. “Then, the remaining 70% will be HEVs [hybrid-electric vehicles], FCEVs [fuel cell electric vehicles], and hydrogen engines. And I think [gas] engine cars will definitely remain. I think this is something that customers and the market will decide, not regulatory values ​​or political power.” In the same AutoNews interview, he defended the company's push toward hybrids by saying: “we said as a company the enemy is carbon,” additionally noting that in the span of making 27 million hybrid cars, it “had the same impact as 9 million BEVs on the road.” “But if we were to have made 9 million BEVs in Japan, it would have actually increased the carbon emissions, not reduced them. That is because Japan relies on the thermal power plants for electricity,” he said. “We should look at all options and work in all directions. As a company, we have been very consistent in saying what we’re fighting against is carbon dioxide.” Taken together, Toyoda’s on-track alter ego and his cautious stance on EVs paint a clear picture: he’s someone who believes driving should remain an emotional, accessible experience, not just a political or regulatory checkbox. Whether it’s pushing Toyota’s race cars to their limits or advocating for a more flexible approach to carbon reduction, Toyoda consistently champions a future where car enthusiasts still have a say in how that future looks.",

And I think [gas] engine cars will definitely remain. I think this is something that customers and the market will decide, not regulatory values ​​or political power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2626\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" sizes=\"(min-width: 750px) 750px, calc(100vw - 60px)\" srcset=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_16,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 16w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_32,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 32w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_48,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 48w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_64,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 64w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_96,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 96w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_128,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 128w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_256,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 256w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_384,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 384w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_640,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 640w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_750,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 750w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_828,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 828w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_1080,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 1080w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_1200,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 1200w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_1920,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 1920w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_2048,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 2048w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg 3840w\" src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/w_3840,q_auto:good,c_limit/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkyNjI3/akio-toyoda-highlights-toyota-innovations-at-ces-2025.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n            \n        \n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\u003cp data-wp-block=\"{\u0026#34;dropCap\u0026#34;:false}\" data-wp-block-name=\"core/paragraph\"\u003eIn the same AutoNews interview, he defended the company\u0026#39;s push toward hybrids by saying: “we said as a company the enemy is carbon,” additionally noting that in the span of making 27 million hybrid cars, it “had the same impact as 9 million BEVs on the road.”\u003c/p\u003e\n            \n        \n\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\u003cp data-wp-block=\"{\u0026#34;dropCap\u0026#34;:false}\" data-wp-block-name=\"core/paragraph\"\u003e“But if we were to have made 9 million BEVs in Japan, it would have actually increased the carbon emissions, not reduced them.

Whether it’s pushing Toyota’s race cars to their limits or advocating for a more flexible approach to carbon reduction, Toyoda consistently champions a future where car enthusiasts still have a say in how that future looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
