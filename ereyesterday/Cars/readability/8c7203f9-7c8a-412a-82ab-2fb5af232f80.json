  "description": "The KTM 390 Enduro R is a dual-sport motorcycle recently showcased at the 2024 edition of EICMA. KTM did not disclose any specifications for the 390 Enduro R then and has now revealed them on its official website.  KTM 390 Enduro R has the same engine as the 390 Duke The bike features a 4.2-inch TFT display, two riding modes It has a 9-litre fuel tank and weighs 159kg, 6kg less than the Duke The 390 Enduro R is the latest addition to KTM’s already established 125 Enduro R and 690 Enduro R. For starters, it gets KTM’s LC4c engine with a capacity of 399cc – same as the 390 Duke, which delivers 44.2hp overseas, a little lower than the India-spec 390 Duke's 46hp. It is likely that when the 390 Enduro R comes here, it will make the full 46hp. The torque remains unchanged at 39Nm. This engine is nestled within a trademark KTM steel-trellis frame. For braking duties, there’s a small 285mm front disc mated to an axial caliper, a 240mm rear disc and switchable dual-channel ABS.  In typical Enduro fashion, the 390 Enduro R has a 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheel setup. The USD fork and monoshock have 230mm of travel, and the bike has a massive 272mm ground clearance. It is a slender machine with minimal bodywork and a small 9-litre fuel tank, tipping the scales at 159kg without fuel; it is 6 kilos lighter than the Duke. While its appearance is minimalistic, the 390 Enduro R is a decently feature-rich bike for the class. It has a 4.2-inch TFT display and two riding modes, Street and Offroad. Additionally, the TFT dash is capable of accessing music, incoming calls and turn-by-turn navigation.   The Enduro R is launching in the coming weeks, as is the 390 Adventure S. KTM also recently revealed more details of the 390 SMC R on its website, and we expect its launch here in the second half of this year. The 390 Adventure S will come with bigger 21-inch/18-inch spoked wheels, while the SMC R will roll on 17-inch wheels at both ends.  Also see: KTM 390 SMC R spotted testing, launch expected",
