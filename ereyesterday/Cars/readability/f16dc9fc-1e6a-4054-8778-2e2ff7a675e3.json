  "text": "ChargePoint thinks it has a plan to end the rampant vandalism of EV chargers.ChargePoint, one of the nation’s largest charging networks, has announced plans to reduce EV charger vandalism at every location.The plan has two main components. First, ChargePoint is introducing new cut-resistant cables that are designed to prevent cable theft, which it claims include “novel cut-resistant materials integrated into the cable.” ChargePoint VP of product management Steve Farrell explained to The Verge that the cables actually have a patent-pending technology that includes steel strategically placed throughout the cable to stop bolt cutters or other cutting tools used by thieves. The downside of this new technology is that the cables will be less flexible.ChargePoint is also rolling out a real-time alarm system, dubbed “ChargePoint Protect,” which the company claims will enhance the security of charging stations. The system will be integrated into ChargePoint’s current speakers, screens, and lighting and can notify customers, station owners, and law enforcement when it detects vandalism.The alarm system will be offered to existing station owners at no charge through an over-the-air software upgrade.ChargePoint Home Charger left 3/4 viewChargePointWhy ChargePoint is doing thisLet’s be really clear: this is about protecting ChargePoint’s equipment.The alarm system is meant to thwart thieves, not increase personal safety. ChargePoint says that ChargePoint Protect “is capable of detecting charging cable tampering in real time and automatically engaging the alarm system with the aim of deterring vandals.” The cut-resistant cables serve as a second line of defense. If vandals ignore the alarm system, cutting through the cable will become significantly harder, and the time spent tampering with the equipment may deter them from pursuing the crime.ChargePoint expects the two anti-theft technologies to reduce station owners' repair costs. ChargePoint station in Sonoma, CAChargePoint/County of SonomaWill it work?ChargePoint has over one million chargers nationwide and recently introduced a new “Omni Port” that combines multiple charging plugs into one single port, making their network one of the largest and most versatile in the country.Considering that EV owners frequently charge their vehicles when their power levels are low, it’s crucial that ChargePoint stations are accessible and functioning correctly to avoid frustration.ChargePoint stations are also frequently located in high-traffic areas, such as municipal buildings or the parking lots of major retailers, like Target. Effectively managing the equipment is essential for maintaining strong partnerships with these organizations and keeping business flowing.“We do not view ourselves as victims of vandalism,” said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint, “but rather responsible for solving it, not only for our customers but for the industry.”ChargePoint in-car appVolvoFinal ThoughtHaving functional charging stations in popular locations is one of the key items in alleviating range anxiety and accelerating EV adoption. For what it's worth, ChargePoint seems committed to achieving that, at least in terms of preventing downtime caused by vandalism.It’s also a sound strategy to save some money, as constantly replacing charging cables can get pricey.Still, if a thief wants to steal a cable, they’ll find a way. I’m not sure how much strategically placed steel will help, but I’d venture thieves don’t want to put in work while an alarm is blaring.",
