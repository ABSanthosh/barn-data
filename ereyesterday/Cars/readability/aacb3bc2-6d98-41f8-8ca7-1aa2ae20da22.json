  "text": "Apart from new vehicles, those sold since January 1, 2021, may also qualify for the 10-year warranty February 4, 2025 at 19:30 by Brad Anderson To get the extended warranty, owners must service their cars at a Nissan dealership. Mitsubishi Australia offers a similar 10-year warranty that also requires dealer services. Nissan has also announced a new capped-price servicing plan for its models Down Under. If you live in the US and buy a new Nissan, you’ll receive a 3-year/36,000-mile limited warranty. If on the other hand, you live in the UK and pick up the keys to a new Nissan, you’ll also get a 3-year warranty, although one that extends up to 60,000 miles. In Australia, Nissan has just launched a new car warranty that blows those from the US and UK out of the water, offering an incredible 10 years/300,000 km (~186,000 miles) worth of coverage. Nissan has historically offered a five-year/unlimited-km warranty to Aussie buyers, and this new warranty serves as an extension of that. To get 10 years of coverage, though, owners must have their vehicles serviced at the correct intervals at a Nissan dealership. Read: Nissan To Cut Shifts At Rogue And Altima Plants, Slashing US Output Mitsubishi has a similar program in Australia. It offers a 10-year/200,000 km warranty for new vehicles routinely serviced at its dealerships. Mind you, Nissan’s offer isn’t just valid for new models. Any Nissan purchased since January 1, 2021, that has had all scheduled services with Nissan at the correct time will automatically qualify for the warranty extension. Vehicles that haven’t been serviced at Nissan dealers may also be eligible, although they will need to be taken to a dealer to have a scheduled service and a vehicle assessment to check their eligibility to enter the program. Nissan Australia has also launched a new five-year flat-price service program. For the Nissan Qashqai, X-Trail, Juke, and Pathfinder, there’s a flat servicing fee of AU$399 (~$240) for each service for the first five services, while the Patrol, Navara, and Z services are AU$499 (~$300) each. Nissan Leaf owners have a flat service fee of just AU$349 (~$210). “In tough times and in a period where the new car market is full of mixed messages, Nissan Australia is putting our customers first,” Nissan Oceania director of Aftersales Michael Hill said. “The new service-activated warranty is Australia’s only 10-year 300,000km warranty and is industry-leading. It’s designed to deliver peace of mind to our customers. Peace of mind that Nissan has your back. Peace of mind that Nissan is with you for the long term.”",
