  "description": "Fiat performance brand's first UK-bound SUV is also its most powerful car ever – but is it a true performance EV? What few attempts have been made to reimagine the classic hot hatch format for the electric age have so far been tepid at best, but is that now beginning to change?The acid-green Abarth 600e (other colours are available…) before is one of several new-for-2025 cars that suggest things are indeed changing.Car makers are waking up to the fact that adding an extra motor to an otherwise sedate EV and stiffening the chassis doesn’t automatically result in a rewarding B-road reprobate. They’ve clocked the fact that nobody is rushing to swap their Hyundai i20 N for a Volkswagen ID3 GTX.There’s something reassuring about the French having led the charge in the rehabilitation of a format that Brits have always loved.They’re time-honoured leaders in the field, and the new Alpine A290 does lift-off oversteer and costs a sensible-for-2025 amount, at around £33k.We like it. And the Italians are at it too, with the Abarth 600e, which is an electric hot-hatch conceived in a more traditional mould than you might be expecting.The Abarth 600e range at a glanceYou can have the 600e in one of two specifications: Turismo or Scorpionissima.The Turismo makes use of a 237bhp, front-mounted, separately excited electric motor developed in-house, with a 54kWh battery pack good for a range of 207 miles. The Scorpionissima is a special edition, of which 1949 examples will be made to recognise Abarth's founding year. It gets the 276bhp motor from the Alfa Romeo Junior Veloce, cutting the 0-62mph time from 6.2sec to 5.9sec.It also comes with the sound generator (designed to mimic the noise of a combustion engine) introduced on the Abarth 500e hot hatch.As it will be the best seller, the Turismo will be the focus of this review.On the outside, every car comes with 20in alloys and a more aggressive bodykit, while inside you get a 10.25in infotainment system, a 7.0in digital instrumentation display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a voice assistant with ChatGPT.Abarth’s own sat-nav system is standard on the Scorpionissima but optional on the Turismo.",

  "text": "So the Abarth has a decent powertrain, but does it really feel like a proper hot hatch when you hit a decent country road? C Yes and no. Even though the centre of gravity is helpfully low, the measures taken to contain the weight of the car are immediately obvious, because the ride quality is... robust. Whether it’s unacceptably so will depend on how an individual prefers a hot hatch.Volkswagen Golf GTI fans won’twarm to this degree of reactivity, but anybody who has enjoyed Renaultsport efforts of the past 20 years will probably accept it and the sense of fizzing alertness it brings. The same people will probably enjoy the way the 600e’s nose hunts a little on corrugated roads, the suspension geometry, grippy Michelins and diff combining to fire load up the steering column in vaguely Morse-code fashion but the result never becoming unruly. That said, you can see why the torque delivery is mapped conservatively, ramping up progressively instead of the instant stabbing that many car makers think the customer wants (we don’t; do you?). When you’re really on it, and even in Scorpion Track mode, which is the only way to have all 278bhp at your disposal, torque-steer isn’t nearly as much of a problem as you might expect. Finding a rhythm therefore isn’t difficult. The relationship between steering, diff and throttle is nicely synchronised. You get a tonne oftraction on mid-corner and exit, and point-to-point the car is heroically quick at times. Where I struggled to gel with it was turn-in. Its weight is palpable on a trailing throttle and the steering is a bit mute on the subject of grip levels, so you don’t often have theconfidence to sling the car into bends. If you do manage it, there isn’t quite enough easy adjustability to be savoured. Conversely, put the 600e down a really tricky road andthe firm back axle can become self-adjusting too readily. So this Abarth isn’t the finest driving tool and neither is it the easiest thing to live with, but it is quick and it does have a distinct personality – one that’s identifiably hot hatch, the way it used to be, if not to a world-class standard.",
