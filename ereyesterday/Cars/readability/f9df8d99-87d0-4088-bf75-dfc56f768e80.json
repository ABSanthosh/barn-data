  "text": "Fortunately, there were no bystanders or other cars in the path of the speeding Mustang January 17, 2025 at 18:28 by Brad Anderson The pony car has been left with extensive front-end damage after hitting a wall. Repairing the Mustang will likely cost the owner or the insurer thousands of dollars. It probably won’t come as a surprise to you that yet another Ford Mustang has fallen victim to some truly terrible driving. Footage of this latest crash was caught by the security camera of a multi-level parking lot and shows that driving fast in tight and confined spaces like a parking area, is not a good idea. While most of us know that, this driver apparently doesn’t. There’s no word on where exactly this incident took place but there’s a big TopGolf logo visible in the background, pointing towards it happening somewhere in the US. In the video, the fresh seventh-generation Mustang speeds into view and is clearly traveling way too fast. Watch: Fords Keep Smashing Into This Building In North Carolina It looks like the driver was on the brakes as soon as the ‘Stang came into view, likely hoping they could slow down before crashing into the concrete barrier. As the car continues to quickly approach the edge of the parking lot, the driver tries to turn to the left – but to no avail, as the Ford slams into the wall. Significant damage has been done to the passenger-side front quarter of the pony car. The headlight has been broken in half, the bumper destroyed, and the quarter panel wrecked. Moments after the impact, the driver jumps out, clearly distraught by what had just happened. The video cuts out while several people rush towards the scene of the crash. There are many safe places where one can go fast: they’re called racetracks. While we have no idea why the driver of this Mustang decided to head onto the top floor of this parking, there’s a good chance they thought it was a secluded area to have some fun away from prying eyes. Then again, maybe they were fans of the Tokyo Drift scene where Sean races Han’s Silvia S15 against “Drift King” Takashi’s 350Z in a similar parking lot. If you’ve seen the movie, you know how that went down – and if you haven’t, well, let’s just say the beautiful Silvia didn’t deserve to be treated like that… Video Reddit",
