  "text": "Despite changing course on becoming an all-EV brand by 2030, Cadillac is pushing forward with its electric lineup 2 hours ago by Sam D. Smith Cadillac plans to have five EVs in its lineup by the end of this year. The brand expects electric cars to account for 35 percent of sales. GM’s luxury arm will offer ICE models for as long as there is demand. EV sales are on the up across several key markets, with China leading the charge with a 76 jump in February 2025, followed by Europe with a 29 percent rise. Even with a potential shift in US policy under the leadership of President Donald Trump, North America too has recorded significant growth – 20 percent up year-to-date. While the rate of adoption may not have quite hit the lofty targets some manufacturers had, Cadillac is ready for a drastic shift towards electric cars. By the end of 2025, Cadillac will offer at least five EVs, including the Lyriq, the Escalade IQ and IQL, and the Optiq crossover. Soon, the three-row Vistiq will join the party, along with the ultra-luxury $300,000+ Celestiq. Read: 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL Is Long, Really Long The new models are the backbone of Cadillac’s predictions that EVs will account for 30–35 percent of U.S. sales in 2025, a significant jump from the 18 percent they represented last year. “The momentum is really there,” said Brad Franz, Cadillac’s director of marketing, in an interview with CNBC. “We’re going to ride that momentum and we’re not launching the vehicles to redistribute the business among [internal combustion engines] and EV portfolio. It’s to grow the business.” Scaling Back The EV Dream Of course, Cadillac’s latest strategy is vastly different from what it had proposed a few years ago. Despite EV sales growing year by year, the rate by which they increase hasn’t quite met expectations. In response, Cadillac has walked back its initial plans to become an all-electric car manufacturer by 2030. The party line is that the brand will let consumer demand dictate when combustion cars disappear from its lineup. Reading between the lines, parent company General Motors is also looking to hedge its bets with a new administration that campaigned heavily against federal support for EVs. Crucially though, it isn’t stopping Cadillac from offering a full range of EVs. Its overall US sales grew by 8.8% in 2024, with Lyriq sales more than tripling since its late 2022 debut, so it seems there’s potential there. As the brand balances EV expansion with continued gas-powered offerings, its commitment remains clear: providing customers with choice in the evolving luxury vehicle landscape.",
