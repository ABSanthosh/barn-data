  "text": "Along with the refreshed exterior, changes are also expected inside, including the addition of the Mercedes Hyperscreen 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Mercedes-Benz will keep offering the S-Class with multiple engine choices across the lineup. The S 63 E Performance and Maybach models will continue as the range-topping versions. The updated S-Class features redesigned headlights and taillights for a refreshed appearance. A few weeks ago, news broke that Mercedes-Benz is delaying the launch of the facelifted S-Class, pushing it back to late this year or possibly the first half of 2026. While this might be mildly distressing for the world’s millionaires, it gives the German automaker more time to refine its flagship luxury sedan. And given the S-Class’s reputation, that extra time will likely be put to good use. As the new S-Class will ‘only’ be a facelift, rather than a complete redesign, it will use the same platform and should be sold with largely the same powertrain options. Many of the most significant changes will come on the visual front and these renderings give us a good idea of how it may look. A Fresh Face, but No Drastic Changes Recent S-Class prototypes have been spotted sporting redesigned headlights featuring Mercedes’ new signature three-pointed star daytime running lights, These elements, first previewed on the CLA Concept from 2023, are likely to make their way onto other Mercedes models as well. The renderings, created by artist Kelsonik for Auto Mail, showcase these updated headlights in detail, along with the larger grille we’ve seen on testers. Read: 2026 Mercedes S-Class Caught With Supersized Grille And Starry Lighting Illustrations Kelsonik/Auto Mail Complementing the new headlights will be a reshaped front bumper that looks a tad sportier and is similar in design to the all-conquering S63’s, complete with new air intakes. Along the sides of the S-Class, however, major changes are unlikely, as swapping out body panels like quarter panels and door skins is costly, even for a luxury brand like Mercedes. Several tweaks will be made to the rear. Once again, the automaker’s focus will be on the lights. As we’ve seen with recent prototypes, the overhauled taillights include new LED signatures, giving the S-Class a more modern look. Upgrades are expected in the cabin as well, including a redesigned dashboard featuring a Hyperscreen display similar to the one in the all-electric EQS. While Mercedes has yet to confirm specific software updates, the system will incorporate all the latest MBUX enhancements. Carscoops understands that most of the current model’s powertrains will carry over. These may include a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six producing 442 hp and 413 lb-ft (559 Nm) of torque, as well as a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 delivering 496 hp. The flagship S63 E Performance is also expected to receive the same facelifted treatment as the rest of the lineup and will likely continue to produce a neck-snapping 791 hp and 1,055 lb-ft of torque. More: Mercedes And Maybach S-Class Finally Get Hyperscreen Dash Mercedes is also giving the ultra-luxurious Maybach version a similar update, with revised front and rear styling, a three-pointed star lighting motif, and an upgraded interior. It’s expected to debut alongside the standard S-Class refresh. The speculative render of the facelifted S-Class pictured above, with the current model below.",
