Why? An EV’s real range is still “completely inadequate,” which is why “there has been little demand” for zero-emission models. However, we have it on good authority an inaugural EV is planned, based on the next-generation X7. Specifically, it’ll be a more potent version of the unannounced iX7.

It’s an interesting projection considering the European Union will force car manufacturers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by the middle of the next decade. Combustion engines won’t be banned per se. In theory, ICE could stick around if synthetic fuels gain traction. Some brands (such as Toyota) have also been experimenting with hydrogen-fueled combustion engines.In the meantime, demand for plug-in hybrids and pure electric cars will “heavily depend” on government subsidies. ALPINA believes the transition to EVs will be a lengthy process because many European countries are reducing incentives or eliminating them altogether.",
