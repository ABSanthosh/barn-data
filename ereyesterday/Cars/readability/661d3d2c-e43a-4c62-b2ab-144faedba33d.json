  "text": "Mar 15, 2025 8:00 PM EDTThe return of an unloved icon The Jeep Compass doesn't get a ton of respect. It's an entry-level vehicle that is filling the gap between the loved Renegade, and the capable Cherokee. It's based on older FCA tech, but it's still competitive and is a good product for Jeep sales as they moved nearly 112,000 in 2024. That's not too shabby. Currently, the Jeep Compass is competitive with Ford's outstanding Bronco Sport. They are both built for commuting, but have the capacity to become capable off-road vehicles on mild off-road terrain. The turbocharged, 200 horsepower engine currently offered in the Compass wakes up its performance, and helps keep it competitive. Even Jeep's incentives on current models seem to be growing. The next Compass will be bigger and appeal to a wider audience Jeep recently released the teaser sketch above of the 2027 Jeep Compass, and it's a tantalizing hint of what we should expect. Right off the bat, the lines are strong, even masculine. It reminds me of an older Jeep Cherokee concept, but smaller. Speaking of size, it looks like they will base the next Jeep Compass on the STLA Medium platform. Thus, no matter what, we're going to see a larger Jeep Compass. Power should come from three different options: a gas, hybrid, and all-electric powertrain. It's a pretty good bet that Stellantis will offer all-wheel drive (AWD) or some type of 4×4 system to go with each powertrain option. One of many questions is whether the hybrid is actually a plug-in hybrid (PHEV). I'm guessing the answer is “yes.” Sources say that the next Jeep Compass will first debut in Europe. Production starts in Melfi, Italy in 2025, while North American production is expected to begin in 2026. Stellantis is retooling the Brampton plant in Canada for the next-generation Compass, with production expected to begin near the end of 2025—provided that some political issues are resolved by then. Final thoughts Jeep is in a precarious position right now. It is one of the main breadwinners for Stellantis in North America, but some of its loyal fans are becoming annoyed. The reality is that most Jeeps are painfully expensive, and even the Wrangler is largely priced out of reach for many. This makes other competitors look more alluring to disenfranchised consumers. I've driven just about every permutation of the Jeep Compass, including prototypes in Moab, UT. The current model, even the lower-level Sport and Latitude, is not bad at all. I think they are a bit forgettable, considering their lack of flash, but they drive well, and the power/economy tradeoff is quite good. A base model Jeep Compass currently costs about $27,000, with the off-road-capable Jeep Compass Trailhawk starting around $33,000. These are the least expensive Jeeps out there, and they're the only hope for many who want to buy a Jeep product. Hopefully, Jeep will remember this when it introduces the all-new Compass in 2026.",
