  "text": "This 1957 Porsche 356A coupe has been refinished in Slate Grey over red leather and is powered by a replacement 1.7L flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 15″ ventilated steel wheels, a driver-side mirror, body-color bumpers, and bucket seats. The car was acquired by the selling dealer in 2022, and subsequent work involved resealing the engine, replacing the clutch and flywheel, and reupholstering the interior. This 356A coupe is now offered with a copy of the Kardex, a 2024 service invoice, and a clean California title. Specified in orange from the factory, the car was repainted in Slate Grey under prior ownership following an engine fire. The rear decklid grille and windshield seal were replaced, and paintless dent removal was performed in 2024. The seller notes various blemishes around the exterior. The 15″ ventilated steel wheels wear hubcaps and are mounted with 165/65 Sumitomo tires. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner, and Koni shocks are fitted. The seller states that the brakes and suspension have been overhauled. The interior was refreshed by the selling dealer in 2024 and features bucket seats upholstered in red leather along with color-coordinated door panels and gray carpets. Interior appointments include a passenger-side grab handle, lap belts, and a body-color painted dashboard. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation consisting of a central 6k-rpm tachometer, a 120-mph speedometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 25k miles, approximately 500 of which were added by the selling dealer. The seller states that the mileage is not accurate, and total mileage is unknown. The replacement flat-four was sourced from a 1959 356A 1600S and is said to have been increased in displacement to 1.7L using upgraded camshafts. The electrical system has been converted to 12-volts, and the engine was resealed as part of work performed by the selling dealer in December 2024. The associated invoice is provided in the gallery below. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. Service in December 2024 also involved replacing the clutch, pressure plate, and release bearing in addition to the flywheel and crankshaft seal. The copy of the Kardex shows initial delivery information as well as the factory color and powertrain serial numbers. Filed under: 356 You are not connected to real-time updates.
