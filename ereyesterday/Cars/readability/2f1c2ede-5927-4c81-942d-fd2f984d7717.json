  "text": "You can bet your bottom dollar this recommissioning from ECD Automotive Design cost an arm and a leg 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson ECD rebuilt a classic Jaguar with new bodywork and a modernized 400 hp V12 engine. The E-Type GTO features custom UK-formed panels inspired by D-Type and Series I models. Inside is brown Spinneybeck leather, brushed aluminum, and hidden tech like Bluetooth audio. It’s hard to improve on perfection, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying. The Jaguar E-Type has long been considered one of the most beautiful cars ever built, yet somehow, someone just looked at one and thought, “But what if we made it even better?” Read: If You Can’t Stand Jag’s Type 00, Then You’ll Love This Original Type That someone is ECD Automotive Design, and their answer comes in the form of a reimagined classic with a sharper body, a rebuilt V12, and a new name: the GTO. What you’re looking at is the Bridgewater Commission, a bespoke E-Type built for one of ECD’s clients. To create an E-Type unlike any other, ECD commissioned custom body panels from UK craftsmen. The design draws inspiration from the original Series I E-Type as well as the Jaguar D-Type racer. The new body includes a unique hood, a customized tail, and functional louvers. Remarkably, it makes the already gorgeous E-Type even more stunning. The car has also been resprayed in Metallic British Racing Green. Reworked Power, Old-School Drama Once the body was complete, it was sent to the US and installed onto the chassis of a Series II E-Type. ECD then tasked Team CJ from Austin, Texas, to rebuild and tune the naturally-aspirated Jaguar V12. It now breathes through a bespoke exhaust, stays cool with a modern system, and benefits from updated fuel injection. Output? North of 400 horsepower, all sent to the rear wheels for maximum grin potential. The modifications don’t stop there. An all-new suspension that offers adjustable ride height and damping has been added. There is also a new steering rack, six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers, and a set of 15-inch Turrino Wire wheels with Pirelli tires. A Familiar Cabin, Elevated Then there’s the cabin. When restoring and modifying classics, it’s easy for companies to slap in some screens, install new leather, and call it a day. ECD hasn’t done that, and instead, they’ve ensured the cabin feels like the original, albeit more luxurious. It rocks custom seats finished in Spinneybeck Lucente Hercules leather. There’s also a brushed aluminum dash with classic gauges and toggles. It feels authentic because it is — only nicer. Modern touches are there if you look for them. The E-Type GTO has been equipped with a Bluetooth audio system, automatic headlights, and power locks, but they’ve all been hidden throughout, helping to return the classic feel of this 1960s great. As ECD chief executive Scott Wallace puts it, “This is the Jaguar GTO that never was—but always should have been. The Bridgewater Commission challenged us to look beyond restoration and build something entirely original. We weren’t just honoring Jaguar’s history, we were evolving it.” Photos ECD",
