  "text": "These are the top five electric vehicles that last for more than 400 miles on a single charge. Longer range brings higher prices, of course, but range anxiety is real.The days of hoping and praying to make it to your destination on a single charge are long gone. The average EV now has at least 200 miles of range, so the stressful early days with one of the original electrical vehicles, like the Nissan Leaf with only 75-mile range, are behind us. But with ramped-up range (and bigger and more efficient batteries) comes higher prices. To eliminate range anxiety you need to throw down real cash. One of the more affordable EVs with longer range doesn’t even make our top five: the Hyundai Ioniq 6 with up to 361 miles on a single charge for about $44,000. Most long-range options are luxury vehicles that come with luxe pricing to match.Here are the five EVs that will reduce your anxiety and fulfill all your range hopes and dreams.2025 Lucid Air Grand Touring: 512 milesLucid entered the EV game in 2021 and blew everyone’s mind with its 500-plus mile range on the Lucid Air Dream edition. But the launch edition wasn’t the end of the impressive range. The now top trim, the Grand Touring, has taken over the title as longest-range EV available in the U.S. with 512-mile range.For a starting price of $109,900, the 819-horsepower beast gets its endurance from a 118 kWh battery pack.2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV WT Max Range: 492 milesThe newest Chevy EV is a pickup truck with some impressive range. Across the Silverado EV lineup (Work Truck, LT and RST) the standard, extended and max range battery packs offer 390- to 492-mile range. The longest range Silverado EV is expected to ship by the end of this year. A standard range battery pack for the WT will be available later into 2025 for $57,095. But a range estimate isn’t available yet.The WT with Max Range starts at $77,795 while the top-trim RST Max Range offers 460 miles for $97,895. To achieve these huge numbers there’s a huge battery in the pickup: 200 kWh.2025 Rivian R1T Max: 420 milesRivian, like Lucid, is a newer entry in the electric vehicle landscape, but it’s been upping its offering each year since its electric pickup truck’s 2021 arrival. The R1T now sits at a max of 420 miles. The Standard battery pack (92.5 kWh on a lithium iron phosphate battery) offers 270 miles of range. The recently updated Large and Max packs (109 and 141 kWh, respectively) get up to 330 and 420 miles.2025 Rivian R1S.Rivian2025 Rivian R1S Max: 410 milesThe 2025 Rivian R1S electric SUV received similar battery upgrades as its truck version for the new model year. But its Max pack size is more limited with a 410-mile range. With the new battery packs comes more range for the Standard and Large R1S versions compared to 2024.New for 2025 is a tri-motor setup on the Max pack with 850 horsepower and 1,103 pound-feet of torque. Further into 2025 a monstrous quad-motor configuration will offer 1,025 horsepower and 1,198 pound-feet of torque — more than 2024’s four-motor version.2025 Tesla Model S: 402 milesTesla is the EV pioneer and the original startup in the space, so it feels somewhat ironic that its luxury sedan is at the bottom of the top five. But this is what Tesla always wanted: competition. The Model S stays competitive even if it can’t keep up entirely and ekes out its spot in the long-range lineup with over 400 miles of range. The all-wheel drive version hits 402 miles starting at $74,990, while the Plaid performance version ($89,900) drops to 359 miles but makes over 1,000 horsepower and can go zero-to-60 mph in under 2 seconds. Speed or range? That’s what it comes down to. If you’re at all anxious about low battery charge, go for the range boost.A Tesla Model S at the Montreal Electric Vehicle Show.Bloomberg/Getty ImagesFinal thoughtsWith great range comes greater prices, but also impressive performance and bulked up battery packs. These EVs all offer over 400 miles of range, which keeps any low battery worries at bay. The long-range selection also leans toward premium options and higher trim levels and souped-up packages. So if you're going all out for the sake of battery life, you might as well go all the way with the top amenities and features. You won’t be spending as much time sitting around at public charging stations with any of these models.",
