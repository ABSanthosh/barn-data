  "description": "After we exclusively reported that the Ninja 1100SX would launch in our country this month, Kawasaki India has done just that. The new Ninja 1100SX is priced at Rs 13.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and is available only in its standard guise here.  The Ninja 1100SX is slightly less powerful than the Ninja 1000SX Longer 5th, 6th gears for improved highway cruising manners Deliveries begin in January 2025, bookings open for Rs 50,000 Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX price, changes over Ninja 1000SX Powering the Ninja 1100SX is a liquid-cooled, 1,099cc, inline-four mill making 136hp at 9,000rpm and 113Nm of torque at 7,600rpm. Compared to the Ninja 1000SX, that’s a decrease of 6hp but an increase of 2Nm. Kawasaki has lengthened the Ninja 1100SX’s 5th and 6th cogs for lower engine rpm while cruising out on the highway, which it says also yields better fuel efficiency.  The Ninja 1100SX’s chassis components are nearly identical to the Ninja 1000SX, with the only difference being a marginally larger rear disc brake – by 10mm. The electronics suite is carried forward, too, with power modes, riding modes, traction control, a bidirectional quick-shifter and cruise control.  The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX was a popular model for the Japanese company in India, as it combined litre-class performance with all-day comfort and touring capabilities. For now, Kawasaki India hasn’t gotten the 1100SX’s up-spec SE version with Ohlins suspension and Brembo brakes to India, and only the standard variant is on offer.   The new Ninja 1100SX has no real direct rivals to speak of in our market, with the closest competition coming from Triumph’s road-biased Tiger 900 GT (Rs 13.95 lakh). It can be booked from all authorised Kawasaki dealerships for a token amount of Rs 50,000. Deliveries will begin in January 2025.  Also see: 2020 Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX review, test ride",
