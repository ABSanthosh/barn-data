  "text": "The cars have been built for the UAW, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait December 9, 2024 at 19:10 by Brad Anderson Each of the six 296 GTBs is finished in a distinctive color. Adorning each interior is Beige Honolulu leather with Gold Metallic accents. Ferrari is celebrating its 30th anniversary in the Middle East and to mark the occasion, it’s unveiled six special 296 GTBs at an event in Abu Dhabi for each of the six Gulf Nations. While we suspect some local buyers would have preferred to see Ferrari launch special versions of the quicker and more powerful SF90 Stradale, the Italian marque quietly retired that car a few months ago, meaning the SF90 Spider and 296 GTB/GTS are the brand’s only mid-engined supercars, other than the new flagship F80 hybrid hypercar. Read: Wrecked Ferrari 296 GTB Is A Very Sad Sight Each of the six 296 GTBs presented in the UAE has been equipped with Arabian Golden Sheen (aka bronze) that have been contrasted by several different body colors. Perhaps the most enticing of them all is the Metallic Green example built for Saudi Arabia. Dedicated to the UAE is a 296 GTB with a Pearlescent White finish, and like the others, it rolls on a set of gold-colored wheels and includes a unique script on the engine cover. Heading to Oman is a Metallic Blue 296 GTB, while bound for Qatar is one painted in a deep shade of maroon. The one-off Metallic Black car has been dedicated to Bahrain, while the golden brown one has been built for Kuwait. Several custom touches have been made to the interiors of the cars. All have cabins bathed in Beige Honolulu leather with Gold Metallic leather accents, diamond-stitched seats, and gold-threaded Prancing Horse logos on the headrests. Adding to the luxurious vibes of the cars are leather-upholstered front luggage compartments. Ferrari hasn’t said if the special one-offs will be sold to private customers or if the firm’s local divisions will take ownership of them.",
