Finished in black over black premium leather upholstery, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Optioned with the Premium and Driver Assistance packages, the car also has a limited-slip differential, a power-retractable hardtop, a panoramic roof with Magic Sky Control, 19″ AMG five-spoke alloy wheels, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, Lane Keeping Assist, Parktronic, a backup camera, massaging heated and ventilated seats, Airscarf Neck Warmers, a Harman Kardon sound system, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. This R231 is now offered with a window sticker, a VMI report, manufacturer’s literature, a Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title. The car is finished in black (040) and features a power-retractable hardtop with a Magic Sly Control panoramic roof panel. Additional details include AMG spoilers and side skirts, front and rear parking sensors, LED taillights, a decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, tinted windows, and bi-xenon headlights with Active Curve Illumination. The Carfax report lists an accident with a parked vehicle in a June 2013 entry that resulted in damage to the left side, though no additional information is provided. The 19″ AMG five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 255/35 front and 285/30 rear Continental tires, the rear of which were replaced in 2024. The car rides on an AMG-tuned Active Body Control (ABC) electronically adjustable suspension, and stopping power is provided by AMG-branded calipers over slotted and cross-drilled rotors. The heated and ventilated active multi-contour seats have massaging functions and are upholstered in black premium leather, which is complemented by Black Ash veneer trim. Interior amenities include seat-position memory, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, Lane Keeping Assist, a back-up camera, Keyless-Go, Airscarf neck warmers, a Harman Kardon sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, illuminated door sills, a wind deflector, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The leather-wrapped AMG Performance steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 25k miles. The twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter M157 V8 was factory rated at 530 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Service in preparation for the sale included an oil change and replacing the engine and cabin air filters. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed AMG Speedshift MCT automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Mercedes-Benz of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, as well as factory colors, equipment, options, and a total retail price of $156,455. Manufacturer’s literature and a VMI report are included in the sale. The Carfax report lists the aforementioned accident. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
