  "description": "This 1967 Chevrolet C10 pickup was the subject of a multi-year performance-focused build that was completed in 2024. The 6.0-liter LS2 V8 utilizes a Tick Performance camshaft, Mahle pistons, I-beam connecting rods, and high-capacity fuel system components, and it breathes through a 2.3-liter Whipple supercharger. A modified T56 six-speed manual transmission sends power to a Moser 9\" rear axle, and the truck rides on a No Limit Engineering independent front and four-link rear suspension along with adjustable Ridetech coilovers and 22\" HRE wheels. AMD bodywork is painted Olympic White and the pickup bed was refinished with stained cedar slats, modified wheelhouses, and black runners and hardware. The cabin is outfitted with Dakota Digital instrumentation, billet fixtures, kick-panel speakers, and a TMI black vinyl bench seat. Acquired by the seller in 2019, this modified C10 is now offered in Canada with build records and British Columbia registration.",

  "text": "This 1967 Chevrolet C10 pickup was the subject of a multi-year performance-focused build that was completed in 2024. The 6.0-liter LS2 V8 utilizes a Tick Performance camshaft, Mahle pistons, I-beam connecting rods, and high-capacity fuel system components, and it breathes through a 2.3-liter Whipple supercharger. A modified T56 six-speed manual transmission sends power to a Moser 9″ rear axle, and the truck rides on a No Limit Engineering independent front and four-link rear suspension along with adjustable Ridetech coilovers and 22″ HRE wheels. AMD bodywork is painted Olympic White and the pickup bed was refinished with stained cedar slats, modified wheelhouses, and black runners and hardware. The cabin is outfitted with Dakota Digital instrumentation, billet fixtures, kick-panel speakers, and a TMI black vinyl bench seat. Acquired by the seller in 2019, this modified C10 is now offered in Canada with build records and British Columbia registration. The exterior was repainted during the build, reportedly in the GM shade of Olympic White, and the seller reports four layers of high-gloss clearcoat and a ceramic coating were applied. An AMD hood, radiator support, fenders, and doors were installed along with LED lighting, and the windshield, windows, floor boards, rocker panels, windshield molding, and grille are said to have been replaced. The pickup bed was refinished with stained cedar slats, which the seller states were handmade, as well as black runners and hardware. The rear coilover reservoirs are mounted to the modified rear wheelhouses. The truck rides on an adjustable suspension comprised of a No Limit Engineering “wide-ride” independent front unit along with a Fatbar four-link rear setup. Ridetech coilovers are fitted at all four corners, and additional details include front and rear sway bars, No Limit control arms, and a high-performance pitman arm. Black HRE forged wheels measure 22×11″ in front and 22×14″ out back, and they are mounted with 295/30 and 315/20 Yokohama Advan tires. Braking is handled by hydroboosted four-wheel discs with a Wilwood master cylinder, red calipers, drilled and slotted rotors, and stainless-steel lines. The truck is equipped with power steering as well as a Wilwood Pro Spindle kit, according to the seller. Inside, a TMI Products Sport X bench seat is trimmed in black vinyl, and custom panels with billet hardware are affixed to the doors. An MPI steering wheel sits on a tilting column ahead of Dakota Digital instrumentation, and further equipment includes A Bowler billet shifter, Ringbrothers hardware, and kick-panel speakers. The odometer shows 109 miles. Total mileage is unknown. The 6.0-liter LS2 V8 was installed in 2024 and was assembled with forged Mahle pistons, Clevite bearings, Scat I-beam connecting rods, and a Tick Performance Stage 2 camshaft. The cylinder heads feature updated valves, BTR double valve springs, ARP fasteners, and titanium retainers. Further components include a Cold Case aluminum radiator, No Limit Engineering motor mounts, a Cloyes timing set, a Melling high-flow oil pump, and a billet serpentine drive setup. The 2.3-liter Whipple supercharger kit utilizes an intercooler, a 160-degree thermostat, a fuel pump booster, and revised injectors, while further fuel system modifications consist of a Rick’s tank and an Aeromotive fuel pump. Tuning is handled by Holley engine management. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Tick Performance “Level 2″ T56 six-speed manual transmission that is said to have been upgraded with a Monster clutch kit, bronze fork pads, carbon-fiber synchronizer rings, and billet third and fourth synchronizer keys. The Moser 9” rear end is equipped with a limited-slip differential, Timken bearings, and Auburn 3.70:1 gears. Gibson stainless-steel headers flow to a dual exhaust system with MagnaFlow mufflers and Vibrant resonators. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada.
