  "description": "This 1993 Porsche 911 is one of a reported 1,437 Turbo 3.6 models produced for the 1993 and 1994 model years, and it is one of a limited number that were specified in Amazon Green Metallic over black full leather upholstery. The car was delivered new in Germany and remained registered in the country until it was relocated to Japan in 2008, and it was acquired and imported to the US by the selling dealer in 2024. Powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, the car has an optional 92-liter fuel tank, 18\" Speedline wheels, a power sunroof, a CD stereo, air conditioning, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, and a fixed rear spoiler. Service in preparation for the sale included a Porsche Classic Technical Certificate inspection, replacing the tires, an oil change, and flushing the brake fluid. This German-Market 964 Turbo 3.6 now shows 100k kilometers (~62k miles) and is offered in California with a Porsche Classic Technical Certificate, a seller-provided decode sheet listing 28 individual options, partial service records, a tire inflator, and a clean Arizona title.",

The car was delivered new in Germany and remained registered in the country until it was relocated to Japan in 2008, and it was acquired and imported to the US by the selling dealer in 2024. Powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, the car has an optional 92-liter fuel tank, 18″ Speedline wheels, a power sunroof, a CD stereo, air conditioning, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, and a fixed rear spoiler. Service in preparation for the sale included a Porsche Classic Technical Certificate inspection, replacing the tires, an oil change, and flushing the brake fluid. This German-Market 964 Turbo 3.6 now shows 100k kilometers (~62k miles) and is offered in California with a Porsche Classic Technical Certificate, a seller-provided decode sheet listing 28 individual options, partial service records, a tire inflator, and a clean Arizona title. The 964 Turbo featured widened bodywork when compared to the contemporary 911 and was fitted with aerodynamic side mirrors and a fixed rear spoiler. The 3.6-powered variant was introduced in January 1993, and this example is finished in Amazon Green Metallic (L39A). Features include a power sunroof, headlight washers, self-leveling headlights, a rear window wiper, and fog lights. The selling dealer notes that paint meter readings indicate paintwork was performed on the hood, front and rear fenders, and bumper covers under previous ownership. The multi-piece 18″ Speedline wheels were mounted with replacement 225/40 front and 265/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires in February 2025, and the brake fluid was flushed at that time. The Turbo features uprated brakes compared to the standard 964, including larger calipers and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. A front strut tower brace was added under previous ownership. The cabin features optional heated and power-adjustable front sport seats trimmed in black leather that extends to the dashboard and door panels. Amenities include air conditioning, a CD stereo, an anti-theft system, an onboard computer, and Turbo 3.6 embroidery on the folding rear seat backs. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer as well as a 320-km/h speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 100k kilometers (~62k miles). The turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six was factory rated at 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, and the selling dealer tells us it was removed and overhauled at approximately 77k kilometers (~47k miles). An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. The car has not been inspected by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair or Air Resources Board. The seller-provided decode of the car indicates it was specified new with a close-ratio five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Decoding the option sticker reveals the information below, and a seller-provided specifications list in the gallery below lists a total of 28 individual production options. L39A – Amazon Green Metallic paint VD – Black Full Leather upholstery C00 – Version for Germany 139 – Seat heating, left 340 – Seat heating, right 383 – Sports seat, left, electrical height adjustment 387 – Sports seat, right, electrical height adjustment 407 – Polished 18″ three-piece wheels 545 – 92-liter fuel tank 650 – Sun-moon-roof The Porsche Classic Technical Certificate lists serial numbers, options, and a production date of June 1993.
