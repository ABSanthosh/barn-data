  "text": "Published:  July 21st, 2025 I was in New York last week to see the 2026 Subaru Uncharted unveiled. I brought you the specs here -- but what I didn't do is bring you my take. I had hoped to write it Friday, but my travel day turned sour when I touched ground in Chicago (O'Hare needs more gates, Chicago needs less traffic) and I let my thoughts marinate over the weekend.Not that I have a ton to say -- the Uncharted is another in a growing segment of small, sporty crossover EVs. Subaru said the Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV are direct competitors -- and I'd argue the Kia Soul EV and Kia EV4 might also fit.Oh, and Subaru didn't say this in the press materials for obvious reasons, but the Uncharted shares its bones with the upcoming Toyota C-HR electric vehicle.So the EV intender looking for a small hatchback will have more than a few options -- and I am not even listing a few models that will be similar in size to the Uncharted, but not price or mission. Back to the Subie. I wasn't sure what to make of it when all I had in front of me was photos -- I like the availability of a t-two-tone roof and the wedge shape, but I am less enthralled by what is perhaps the most off-putting design piece: The squared-off steering wheel.On the other hand, I think the dual wireless phone chargers in the center console make for smart design, and I hope the large infotainment screen will come with updated UX. I also liked the narrow headlights flowing into the front \"grille\" and the lower front fascia -- it's a more cohesive look than, say, the Solterra. The latter has a bit too large a maw, while the Uncharted brings it together in a more compact package. The range and power numbers on the all-wheel drive trims are nice, though the drop to 221 ponies on the FWD trim is more than I expected, even with the removal of an electric motor.One thing that I didn't know before the unveil -- this car will have 8.3 inches of ground clearance.One thing I did know, and mentioned in my initial post -- Subaru was on a mission to convince us that the Uncharted has a suspension tuned for fun. I'll hold my judgment until I drive it, but it seems one of Subaru's selling point for the Uncharted will be the fun-to-drive factor.The other main selling point? The ability to get outdoors. Sportiness and outdoor adventure are two brand hallmarks, and the company wants the Uncharted to fit right in.I am still skeptical about any EV, regardless of range, going too far from a charger -- seriously, someone someday will make a lot of money by figuring out the EV equivalent of jerry cans -- but I have no doubt the Uncharted will be fun to sling across switch-backed dirt roads, and I have no doubt it will get you and your canoe to the boat launch. Gallery: 2026 Subaru Uncharted So, after my first glance of the Uncharted parked static in a New York studio, I walked away thinking it looks pretty good, a few decisions aside. I walked away wondering what it's like to drive, whether the roofline will eat into rear headroom, and how the new infotainment will look.If Subaru prices this right and nails the fun-to-drive factor, it will have an advantage over the pure commuter Kona EV and Niro EV.As soon as we drive it, we'll let you know. Until then, what we have here is a good-looking compact EV that looks the part.[Images © 2025 Tim Healey/TTAC.com]Become a TTAC insider.
