This Pantah DM500SL is now offered at no reserve with Italian registration documents and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The bodywork is finished in light metallic blue with red and blue graphics over a black steel trellis frame. Equipment includes a half fairing, a clear windscreen, a center stand, rear-set foot controls, and folding passenger pegs. The seller notes that the red two-up seat has a split low on the right side. Gold-anodized 18″ alloy wheels wear older Pirelli tires. Suspension consists of a conventional fork as well as dual adjustable Marzocchi shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is from dual twin-piston Brembo calipers up front and a single-piston version at the rear. Clip-on handlebars are mounted beneath the top triple clamp and frame instrumentation consisting of a 220-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and a central bank of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 21k kilometers (~13k Miles). The 499cc L-twin features Desmodromic valve timing, dual Dell’Orto 36mm carburetors, electronic ignition, an electric starter, and a dual exhaust system. The oil was changed and the battery was replaced in November 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive chain.
