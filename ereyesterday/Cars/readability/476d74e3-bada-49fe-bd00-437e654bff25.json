  "text": "Auction listing offers rare chance to buy a fully built off-road Mazda MX-5 roadster with street roots May 24, 2025 at 19:45 by Chris Chilton A Mazda MX-5 modified for off-road work is up for auction. The first-gen Miata has a Paco Motorsports Offroadster kit. Other mods include a Flyin’ Miata turbocharger conversion. The Mazda MX-5 is a versatile machine, capable of taking you to work during the week without complaining through the depths of winter and holding its own on track days and sunny, top-down adventures on the weekend. The only thing Miata engineers never imagined the roadster would need to do is go off road. But this one can. Although it’s still rear-wheel drive, this first-generation NA Miata up for grabs on Cars\u0026Bids has enough trail-ready parts that it can go places a stock MX-5 will never dare get close to – unless it’s strapped to the roof of Jeep Wrangler. Related: This Lifted, AWD, Subaru WRX-Powered Mazda MX-5 Miata Is A Go-Anywhere Machine Originally a 1994 M Edition finished in Montego Blue Mica, the Miata, nicknamed Bajayata, now has a Paco Motorsports Offroadster kit to give it twice as much ground clearance as some SUVs, 31-inch BF Goodrich rubber and custom-valved AFCO Racing coilovers at each corner beneath TIG-welded fender flares. Zerek Fabrication front and rear bash bars, underfloor skid plates and a Track Dog Racing Hard Dog diagonal roll bar keep the nose, tail, occupants and mechanical components protected. And there’s a spare 15-inch wheel strapped to the SQIIRL MODS luggage rack in case one of those monster truck tires gets mortally wounded by a sharp rock mid-trail. But the mods don’t end there. The extra weight of the wheel and tire package alone would take the edge off the stock NA’s 128 hp (130 PS) 1.8, so this one has a Flyin’ Miata turbocharger kit and billet steel flywheel, plus a six-speed ’box transplanted from a 2004 MX-5. The real surprise, though, is inside, the owner having retained the stock tan leather sports seats and carpets where you might expect to see bare floors and fixed buckets. It’s an odd mix, but going the OEM route is sure to deliver a more comfortable off-road ride. We’ve seen lifted Miatas before but this is one of the better ones. And while it won’t be to everyone’s taste, it looks fun and it’s on-trend, what with Lamborghini and Porsche building off-road versions of the 911 and Huracan. It should also be a lot less expensive than a used 911 Dakar, some of which have been changing hands for over $300k. You can check out the full Cars\u0026Bids listing here.",
