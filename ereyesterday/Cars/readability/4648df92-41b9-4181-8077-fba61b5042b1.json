Maybe there is a workaround to disable it since 30yo anti-theft features are no longer valid?Needs brakes all around.Kinda important, figure 4-5+ bills unless you go with all Chinesium. Self-leveling doesn't work so rear end is a bit bouncy.Probably can/should be ripped out and replaced with conventional shocks/struts.

Mechanic advised this is almost always a bad transfer case and declined to investigate further, instead wanting to disconnect the front axles. Subsequently the battery drained so I removed and recharged it, which reset the fault and the idiot lamp hasn't lit in the year since. Just, full disclosure. I don't know what else to say about it.I'd just disconnect it and not monkey around with 30yo AWD systems. The drain is concerning because it could be an entirely separate issue, this needs a home with a trickle charger until the drain is sorted (unless you want to play pop the hood and disconnect the battery every time you use it). There's a few tiny scratches in the paint, most of which will probably buff out. There's a cluster of micro-scratches immediately behind the driver door handle, from 32 years of opening the door. The hood has some... blargh spots... on it, similar to bird droppings but probably some other organic matter. These may also buff out.Blargh spots concern me but its clearly not a Sunday car so expect body issues. They key here would be little to no rust vs needs clearcoat etc....Overall, a buy with the understanding its a project or parts car. Figure total recon $2,000+ with labor not including wearables and fluids not mentioned (and I may be low, I haven't bought Benz parts in forever). Edit: I was told to budget for new springs and shocks up front on my '93 244 because they're finally due after all these years and north of 170K miles (car is really TMU that's just a guess). This is probably in the same boat if you want to do it right.",
