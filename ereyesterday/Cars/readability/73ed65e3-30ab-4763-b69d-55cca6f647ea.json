  "description": "The Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ is a hybrid sports sedan that packs in supercar-rivalling performance for a price of Rs 1.95 crore (ex-showroom). Yes, Mercedes is asking for double the price of an AMG C 43, but is the C 63 twice the car? To find the answer and get a taste of its track capabilities, we experience it on the Buddh International Circuit. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ performance What gave the previous editions of the C 63 an almost legendary status were their manic V8 petrol engines. In this iteration, though, Mercedes has plonked in a 2-litre turbo-petrol unit. But it isn’t a run-of-the-mill engine – its M139L is the most powerful four-cylinder in the world. It carries forward the F1 tech from the C 43 sedan, such as the electric exhaust gas turbocharger, wherein a small electric motor spins up the turbo even before the exhaust gases gush in, thereby eliminating turbo lag. But it gets a larger turbo, which takes the max output to 476hp/545Nm, an increase of 68hp/45Nm over the C 43. The M139L is the most powerful four-cylinder engine in the world. The talking point of this car, however, is its plug-in hybrid technology, which comprises a rapidly charging/discharging 6.1kWh battery and an electric motor on the rear axle that develops a peak output of 204hp/320Nm under full boost. Interestingly, the electric motor is mated to a 2-speed gearbox – one gear for acceleration up to speeds of 140kph and the other capable of supporting the engine up to 280kph. The C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+, being a plug-in hybrid, has a charging provision on the left side, which can support slow charging of up to 3.5kW. Mercedes claims an EV-only range of 13km. With 680hp and 1020Nm, acceleration is savage. Sure, the C 63’s plug-in hybrid tech has added over 300 kilos to its weight. However, with the petrol engine and electric powertrain working in conjunction with each other, the C 63 produces an output of 680hp and 1020Nm. And at full throttle, acceleration feels savage. With a sledgehammer-like thrust, not only does it leap forward like a scalded cat, but it also sustains its performance at the top end, with revs maxing out at 7000rpm. Speeds upwards of 200kph on the race track felt rather effortless to achieve. The 9-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox complements, and at least on the race track while being driven with verve, it feels perfectly calibrated with this powertrain. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ ride and handling Equally astonishing is its cornering prowess. The C 63 gets a wider front track, a 10mm longer wheelbase and additional body stiffening compared to the C 43. Further, its 50:50 weight distribution, rear-axle steering and AMG’s 4MATIC+ system do a stellar job of masking its 2.1-tonne kerb weight. It dives into corners willingly, and with a quick ratio steering, it feels sharp and eager to change direction. What’s also impressive is the way its brakes shed speed, and its pedal only adds to the confidence. However, under heavy braking, there’s no getting away from the car’s sheer mass. There’s also a drift mode to speak of, wherein all the torque is sent to the rear wheels, making it rather easy to slide around. There are eight drive modes, three brake energy regeneration settings, three damper stiffness settings and a plethora of adjustability. Unfortunately, though, due to our limited time with the car, we didn’t get a chance to try out all these, and for the track drive, we left the car in its maximum setting (Race mode) only. Handles with surprising agility despite its 2.1-tonne kerb weight. Like the C 43, this C 63 has mics in the exhaust system, which pick up the sounds and play them through the vehicle’s speakers in real time for a sporty aural experience. For a four-cylinder, it does sound quite nice, especially in Race mode, and you’ll also hear the occasional pops and crackles from the exhaust, which adds to the drama. However, AMG loyalists and enthusiasts will be sore with the transition from a V8 to a four-cylinder; the latter simply cannot match the V8’s theatrics. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ design The press cars have been brought to our shores in an exclusive F1 edition, and while this edition isn’t available for sale, Mercedes is offering the C 63 with a laundry list of configurations for buyers to customise their car as per their tastes and preferences. What’s common, though, is its Panamericana AMG front grille and a front bumper with huge intakes. 20-inch alloys are standard with the C 63; these wheels are exclusive to the F1 edition. Incidentally, its bonnet features a functional air scoop designed to dissipate heat from the engine bay. The fenders, on the other hand, feature fake air inlets and ‘Turbo E-Performance’ badging. As part of the F1 package, our test car sported 20-inch wheels, along with additional fins on the rear bumper. Quad exhaust tips, a boot lip spoiler and the C 63 badge outlined in red are other stunning details. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ interiors Ventilated front seats are standard. These are the optional 'Sport' seats. On the inside, the C 63 feels largely identical to its half-priced sibling, the C 43, with a stunning dashboard, high-quality materials and a tasteful use of ambient lighting. Our F1 edition press car sported a generous use of red carbon fibre panels, optional sports seats and a panoramic sunroof. What’s nice is that the seats are comfortable, storage areas are plenty, and its rear seat area is spacious. Since the hybrid’s battery is placed beneath the boot floor, its 280 litres of luggage space is small. For context, the A45 hatchback gets a 370-litre boot. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ verdict Quad exhaust tips, diffuser and rear spoiler add to its aggression. There’s not an iota of doubt that the Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ is the quickest and most potent iteration of this sports sedan to date. But where the C 63 editions of yore were brimming with emotional appeal, this one feels rather clinical and overly tech-driven in its approach. Its interiors don’t feel too different from the C 43, and while it certainly drives better than its lesser sibling, it doesn’t feel twice as good to justify its asking price. Still, if you’re in the market for a sports sedan with mind-bending performance, this new C 63 has you covered. But be prepared to cough up an eye-watering Rs 1.95 crore (ex-showroom) to get your hands on one. Also See: Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ video review",
