A hybrid is the smart choice. In a market divided between petrol and electric, hybrid SUVs deliver a winning mix of both. At their best, they offer some of the the fuel savings associated with an electric car, teamed with the steadfastness of a combustion engine. They're also a hit with company car drivers thanks to lower benefit-in-kind tax rates, making them a savvy financial pick too. This list comprises of regular hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs. Plug-in hybrid tech works especially well in SUVs, where there's space to fit batteries and motors without sacrificing too much practicality or comfort. While regular hybrid SUVs are less economical, but are typically cheaper to buy and don’t need to be plugged in. Topping our list is the Skoda Kodiaq. Our testers were impressed with its comfort, practicality and its 71 miles of electric-only range. Keep reading to dive into our top picks and we’ll help find the right hybrid SUV for you. Design8Interior9Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs9 Pros Very roomy and practicalPHEV offers unrivalled electric rangeControl are well-resolved Cons Doesn't ride as well as it shouldAuto gearbox indecisive at low speed Too many models Best for: all-round abilityThe Volkswagen Tiguan, Volkswagen Passat, Skoda Superb and Skoda Kodiaq all share the same platform and powertrains - but it’s the Kodiaq that really stands out to us.Its impressive 71-mile (WLTP) electric range puts head and shoulders above most other PHEVs in its class, while its tall, practical design makes it a family-friendly powerhouse. The middle row is so spacious, it rivals the Mercedes S-Class for legroom.The boot is massive too. It offers 745 litres worth of space - but there’s a catch: there’s no seven-seat option for the PHEV. That’s exclusive to the regular models.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior9Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs7 Pros Exceptional electric-only rangeImpressive digital cabin technologyLots of luxury cabin feel Cons Rides like a heavy SUVExpensiveRide comfort isn’t unremarkable Best for: EV range with a posh interiorIf it's the potential for lots of electric-only running that attracts you to the idea of a hybrid SUV - whether that's for what it saves you at the petrol pump or on your annual P11D form - one contender currently stands out clearly from the field: the Mercedes GLC 300e.Mercedes fitted a whacking great 31.2kWh drive battery to this car for its second-generation version. That would have been unusually large for a full-size luxury SUV, let alone a mid-sized one. It makes the GLC 300e good for a claimed 83 miles of EAER tax-qualifying electric range - and one of few cars on this list that'll get you a 5% benefit-in-kind (BIK) qualification even if you lavish plenty of options on it.The snag is, however, that even base-spec models cost around £65,000. But it is a modern Mercedes SUV, which means it's not short of digital multimedia technology or luxury cabin feel.The car is driven by a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine working in tandem with a 134bhp electric drive motor. Weighing almost 2.3 tonnes, it's not the most dynamic drive in this list and struggles a little with vertical body control on country roads. But it's smooth and quiet whether running electrically or not; has decent electric-only oomph to match that electric range; and doesn't penalise owners with reduced boot volume, either.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs6 Pros Ride and handles really wellPlenty of real-world electric rangeSmooth and powerful straight six Cons No seven-seat optionPHEV trades a little cargo spaceExpensive Best for: performance The star attraction of the plug-in version is its creamy-smooth 3.0-litre straight six, which works in tandem with an electric motor to give both a startling turn of speed and surprisingly low running costs.Given its head, this combination musters an impressive 485bhp and the electric motor has enough urge to make the car feel brisk enough while mooching around. Speaking of which, thanks to a 25.7kWh battery, the X5 can travel on pure electricity for up to 66 miles, which is both nifty and allows the car to qualify for the 8% BIK tax bracket.In spite of the increase in kerb weight (this BMW causes the scales to creak under strain of 2495kg), the 50e drives as well as any BMW X5 there has ever been and, for those who don't know, that's a high dynamic marker for a large SUV. It's polished, slick and refined, but also controls its mass well and handles neatly and with compelling poise for a big car. Inside, cabin quality is good enough to compete with anything else on this list, and practicality is strong even though the packaging of the PHEV drive battery robs the car of its third row of seating and a little of its cargo capacity.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Huge amounts of spacePlush and comfortable interiorUp to seven seats Cons Love-it-or-hate-it designHeavyGruff when engine kicks in Best for: spaceThe Santa Fe offers standout looks (love them or hate them), a huge amount of space, seven seats and a genuinely plush interior.The engine range opens with a 1.6-litre hybrid, which uses a turbocharged petrol engine supported by an electric motor. Total power stands at 212bhp and 270lb ft, and it’s nice to drive, with all-electric power available in town. Hyundai’s seven-seater also comes with a plug-in hybrid, which uses the same 1.6-litre turbocharged engine but a 13.8kWh battery and a 96bhp electric motor. With 249bhp, it does a great job of shifting the heavy Santa Fe with a welcome degree of quietness and refinement. Its 0-62mph sprint takes just 9.3sec, which is competitive, although it is slightly let down by its 33-mile electric-only range, which is behind much of the competition. Overall, though, the Santa Fe is a great hybrid SUV and should definitely be considered by those seeking a larger-than-average model. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior7Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Great valueLooks distinctiveImpressive cabin quality Cons Ride and handling just okayNot as spacious as othersCoarse engine at higher speeds Best for: versatilityFor a PHEV to be really tax-efficient, it must offer a blend of electric range and value – which is precisely what the Kia Sportage PHEV does. You'll have to look long and hard for a family car that is as practical as this, that has more than 40 miles of lab-test-certified electric range and so qualifies for 8% BIK, and that can be snapped up for little more than £40,000.It is a fairly compact SUV but offers adult-appropriate passenger accommodation in both rows of seats, and a robust and high-quality cabin. It can be bought with a 48V mild-hybrid powertrain; as a full hybrid (HEV) with only limited electric range and no plug; and as a 1.6-litre PHEV with a certified 42 miles of electric range. The PHEV has the most power and also better performance and drivability than the cheaper HEV.The Sportage's slightly anodyne handling is unlikely to excite you, but its styling remains really distinctive, and its ownership credentials are clear.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior9Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs6 Pros Smooth six-cylinder petrolEnticingly luxurious cabin and rideLow BIK Cons High starting priceSpend too much on options and you can end up in wrong tax bracketVery big Best for: luxuryNow in its third generation, the most dynamic of all Range Rovers is, unsurprisingly, the best Sport yet. At the heart of the car’s appeal is the brand’s latest plug-in hybrid drivetrain, which combines a lusty turbocharged Ingenium 3.0-litre straight six with a gearbox-mounted electric motor and very generous 38.2kWh battery.The result is an impressive electric-only range of up to 74 miles. So provided you don't put too many heavy options or big alloy wheels on your car, this is one of the few SUVs in our top 10 to give you access to a 5% BIK classification. For cosseting luxury, no car on this list can match the Range Rover Sport, its spacious and opulent interior dripping in rich materials and the sort of slick tech that adds plenty of showroom appeal. On the move, it’s nearly as quiet and comfy as its big sibling, but the addition of four-wheel steering and active anti-roll adds an extra dimension of agility and driver engagement.It’s not cheap, but the best things in life rarely are. A shoo-in for pride of place in the directors' car park, then.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs6 Pros Low BIK with high performanceCabin richnessDigital tech Cons Pricing you'd expect from a big PorscheNot quite as refined as some rivalsHeavy Best for: driver appealThe Porsche Cayenne remains the segment's defining performance SUV. It has always offered knockout performance powertrains, of course, but in this latest, facelifted, third-generation version, it puts at least as much emphasis on tax-savvy plug-in hybrid power, in order to keep the car relevant as the high-powered business executive's status SUV of choice.Between the Cayenne E-Hybrid, Cayenne S E-Hybrid and Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid versions, there are now three PHEV models to choose from - and, while none quite competes with rivals for the longest electric range on this list, all qualify for an 8% BIK band. The two lesser models combine V6 turbo petrol engines with their electric motors, with the S E-Hybrid making a little over 500bhp and managing 0-62mph in a little under 5.0sec. The Turbo E-Hybrid is one of few V8 hybrid PHEVs on the market, offering in excess of 700-horsepower, 0-62mph in just 3.7sec and a top speed of more than 180mph.Bristling with driver appeal and with a refreshed interior packed with material quality and digital technology, there's no other PHEV quite like this - and few that justify a high price in such clear and direct sporting terms.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design7Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs7 Pros Range of more than 50 milesWell packagedDesirable Cons Slightly distracting screenLarger cars available for similar moneyClunky automatic gearbox Best for: affordable luxuryBMW's second entry in this top 10 illustrates how quickly hybrid technology is improving. Three years ago, only a handful of electrified mid-sized SUVs were rated for more than 40 miles of electric running and most of those were priced at a premium, even when sold by non-premium brands.Today, however - even with the rampant inflation we've seen since then - you can pay less than £45k for a mid-sized SUV rated for more than 50 miles of EAER electric range, provided you know where to look.The BMW X1 is where. It is offered with two PHEV powertrains in addition to cheaper ICE powertrains: the X1 xDrive25e and xDrive30e. Both use 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbo petrol engines for the front axle, and electric drive motors over their rear ones; both can be equipped just so for a little over 50 miles of EAER electric range; and while the 25e offers 242bhp of total system power, the 30e increases that to 321bhp.The X1 has an especially spacious cabin for a mid-sized SUV and handles with plenty of grip and precision, although its multimedia usability isn't great. But it is one of the smarter ways to get lots of electric running in a smaller and more affordable package.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling6Costs7 Pros Refined and luxuriousSome smart digital featuresLong warranty Cons Hybrid system isn't a natural entertainerNot as spacious as some for the moneyEngine drones loudly at idle Best for: reliabilityRefinement feels like it should be a natural quality for a hybrid SUV, but few of them offer as much of it as the Lexus NX. Lexus has been making electrified SUVs for longer than most car companies, of course - but it's the company's habitual focus on filtering out the outside world and lavishing fine attention to detail on producing a really relaxing driving experience that shine through in the NX.This is a mid-sized, five-seat SUV designed to compete with anything from a Range Rover Evoque to a BMW X3. Available with a choice of electrified powertrains - as a 350h self-charging four-cylinder hybrid, or a 450h+ plug-in option - it doesn't railroad private buyers into living with a PHEV option that may not suit them. If you go for the pricier PHEV, you'll get a car rated for 45 miles of electric range. But if you can't charge it, and don't pay company car tax anyway, you could have the regular hybrid instead, save a few quid, and know that you're not lugging around so many kWh of battery ballast that isn't really useful to you.Lexus's familiar hybrid drive system makes for a slightly distant-feeling driving experience but it doesn't want for outright performance, while the handling of F-Sport versions, on adaptive dampers, is neat, tidy and precise.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design6Interior6Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling6Costs9 Pros Great value for moneyGood performanceSpacious Cons Not as good to drive as many other alternatives Some cheap interior materialsAnnoying ADAS system Best for: valueMG’s popular SUV is powered by a 1.5-litre petrol engine with hybrid assistance. It offers 195bhp - the same as in the hybrid MG 3 - and is managed by a three-speed automatic gearbox. Among the ZS’s headline attractions are its starting price and value for money. It starts from sub £20,000, making it one of the cheapest hybrids you can buy today.That said, it’s not nearly as good to drive as the other SUVs in this list, but it's well equipped compared with many - especially at that price point.Finance this car with DrivenfiHOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST HYBRID SUV Before visiting a showroom, figure out which type of hybrid fits your lifestyle. If you don’t have access to home charging or a nearby public charger, a regular hybrid is likely the better choice.Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) work best if you can charge at home - ideally at a low electricity rate.Cost needs to be considered too. PHEVs usually cost more upfront, and the savings only add up if you can charge cheaply and often. HOW WE TESTED AND SELECTED At Autocar, we’ve driven every new car on sale. For this list, we focused only on full hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs. No mild hybrids, no fully electric cars, and no petrol or diesel-only models.From there, we filtered out any hybrids with a rating below four stars. What’s left? The best-performing hybrids for a range of real-world needs. FAQs What is a hybrid SUV? A hybrid SUV is a sports utility vehicle that combines two or more power sources to propel the vehicle. Generally, they pair an internal combustion engine (ICE) with a battery and a single (or dual) electric motor. What types of hybrid SUVs are available?  There are three types of hybrid, all of which are available in the UK.  The first is a mild hybrid (MHEV), which provides the least electrical assistance. An electric motor supports the engine, but MHEVs cannot be driven on electric power alone. They usually offer minor fuel savings over a regular internal combustion car.  A full hybrid (HEV) can run on both combustion and electric-only power, or both at the same time. Their pure electric usage is usually limited to lower speeds, such as driving through town.  Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also combine combustion engines and electric motors but are equipped with much larger batteries for prolonged driving on electric-only power. Some of the best and most expensive plug-in hybrids offer as much as 80 miles of electric-only driving, so if you keep them charged, you might never need to fill up the tank with fuel. While they can be quite heavy, they're usually significantly more powerful than their combustion-only counterparts.  Which hybrid is best for me? The type of hybrid car you choose will very much depend on your own personal use case.  Mild hybrids are useful for saving fuel on high-distance journeys, so are a good choice for those with long commutes.  Full hybrids are handy for those who drive in several different environments, such as through town, around a suburb and on faster motorways. As they can be used on electric-only for limited distances, they can be very useful for navigating through traffic silently, and keeping the air clean.  Plug-in hybrids, meanwhile, are a great choice for drivers who want to spend more time driving on electric-only power. If you've got the means to recharge the battery, they can often provide you with enough electric power so you'll never have to top up the tank at the pumps. If you're travelling longer distances, they can also offer considerable economy gains over standard petrol and diesel cars. Be warned, though: plug-in hybrids are often significantly more expensive to buy than regular combustion cars.  Which hybrid is best for company car drivers? Plug-in hybrids can be a brilliant option for company drivers. This is because they produce low CO2, meaning they fall into lower benefit-in-kind bands. Even cars with electric-only ranges of less than 30 miles will fall into the 14% BIK band, which is the fifth lowest band. Cars with ranges between 40-69 miles are in the 8% BIK band, while others with 70-129 miles (of which there is a growing number of cars available) are just 5%.  In short, if you want a company car and aren't quite ready for all-electric power, a plug-in hybrid is the way to go.  Which car companies make hybrid cars? Hybrids have risen in popularity over the past five years or so, and you'll struggle to find a car maker that doesn't offer electrification. Lexus, Toyota and Suzuki are some of the pioneers of hybrid power with remarkable reliability records, while other brands including BMW, Volkswagen and Audi are also experienced with the technology. Even the more premium sports car brands, such as Lamborghini, Porsche and McLaren, are also responding to the increased importance of electrification.  Join our WhatsApp community and be the first to read about the latest news and reviews wowing the car world.

An electric motor supports the engine, but MHEVs cannot be driven on electric power alone. They usually offer minor fuel savings over a regular internal combustion car. \nA full hybrid (HEV) can run on both combustion and electric-only power, or both at the same time. Their pure electric usage is usually limited to lower speeds, such as driving through town. \nPlug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also combine combustion engines and electric motors but are equipped with much larger batteries for prolonged driving on electric-only power. Some of the best and most expensive plug-in hybrids offer as much as 80 miles of electric-only driving, so if you keep them charged, you might never need to fill up the tank with fuel. While they can be quite heavy, they\u0026#39;re usually significantly more powerful than their combustion-only counterparts. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhich hybrid is best for me?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nThe type of hybrid car you choose will very much depend on your own personal use case. \nMild hybrids are useful for saving fuel on high-distance journeys, so are a good choice for those with long commutes. \nFull hybrids are handy for those who drive in several different environments, such as through town, around a suburb and on faster motorways. As they can be used on electric-only for limited distances, they can be very useful for navigating through traffic silently, and keeping the air clean. \nPlug-in hybrids, meanwhile, are a great choice for drivers who want to spend more time driving on electric-only power. If you\u0026#39;ve got the means to recharge the battery, they can often provide you with enough electric power so you\u0026#39;ll never have to top up the tank at the pumps. If you\u0026#39;re travelling longer distances, they can also offer considerable economy gains over standard petrol and diesel cars. Be warned, though: plug-in hybrids are often significantly more expensive to buy than regular combustion cars. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhich hybrid is best for company car drivers?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nPlug-in hybrids can be a brilliant option for company drivers. This is because they produce low CO2, meaning they fall into lower benefit-in-kind bands. Even cars with electric-only ranges of less than 30 miles will fall into the 14% BIK band, which is the fifth lowest band. Cars with ranges between 40-69 miles are in the 8% BIK band, while others with 70-129 miles (of which there is a growing number of cars available) are just 5%. \nIn short, if you want a company car and aren\u0026#39;t quite ready for all-electric power, a plug-in hybrid is the way to go. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhich car companies make hybrid cars?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nHybrids have risen in popularity over the past five years or so, and you\u0026#39;ll struggle to find a car maker that doesn\u0026#39;t offer electrification. Lexus, Toyota and Suzuki are some of the pioneers of hybrid power with remarkable reliability records, while other brands including BMW, Volkswagen and Audi are also experienced with the technology. Even the more premium sports car brands, such as Lamborghini, Porsche and McLaren, are also responding to the increased importance of electrification. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cblock\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin our \u003ca href=\"https://chat.whatsapp.com/IRAK6Rf3pMGHUwVXXnG4Eh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhatsApp community\u003c/a\u003e and be the first to read about the latest news and reviews wowing the car world.
