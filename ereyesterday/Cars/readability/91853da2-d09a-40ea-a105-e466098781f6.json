  "description": "Last year, Ultraviolette introduced the updated F77 Mach 2, bringing subtle design tweaks, new features, and drivetrain improvements. However, many riders wanted a more comfortable  setup, especially since most F77 owners primarily rode within city limits. Enter the F77 Super Street—a refined version of the Mach 2 with adjusted ergonomics and minor design changes. So, is the Super Street the better choice among the F77 models? Absolutely. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street design updates The Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2 has always been a striking machine, and the Super Street stays true to that design. Visually and feature-wise, it remains largely unchanged from the Mach 2, with no exclusive new additions. However, it does come in four new colors, though distinguishing between the two models requires a sharp eye. The most noticeable differences are the taller, wider handlebar and a redesigned headlight cowl. The rider footpegs remain the same as before and the company says this is done to maintain some sense of aggression with the ergonomics. Feature-wise, everything carries over, including 9 levels of regen, 3 levels of traction control, and dynamic stability control as standard on both variants. Ultraviolette also claims that the new headlight cowl improves aerodynamics by 15-20 percent compared to the Mach 2. It continues to get the same 5-inch TFT that is now slightly more inclined offering better legibility. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street ride and handling Despite weighing in at 207kg, the F77 Super Street’s ergonomic tweaks have made it a more manageable machine. Compared to the Mach 2, it feels noticeably easier to maneuver at low speeds, making urban riding less demanding. That said, its weight is still apparent when lifting it off the stand or pushing it around at parking speeds. While the more relaxed riding position offers some clear improvement in comfort, it doesn’t drastically alter the overall experience. The suspension setup remains unchanged and is carried over from the Mach 2. However, the new handlebar design reduces weight over the front fork, allowing for slightly more usable suspension travel.  Our test ride was limited to a go-kart track and well-paved backroads, but on the occasional rough patch, the Super Street felt a bit more forgiving. Although, this might just be because there’s less load on your wrists and back. Handling remains sharp, and through a series of corners, the bike is just as engaging as before. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street performance and braking Like the Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2, the new F77 Super Street is available in two variants. The base model features a 7.1kWh battery, delivering 36.2hp and 90Nm of torque, with an IDC range of 211km. The top-spec F77 Super Street Recon, which we rode, comes with a larger 10.3kWh battery, delivering 40hp and 100Nm of torque, while offering an impressive 323km IDC range. Riding the Super Street is a unique experience, with ample torque always available on demand. On a tight and technical track like the one we tested on, the throttle felt precise and easy to modulate. With the highest level of regenerative braking engaged, I found myself rarely using the brakes, allowing for a smooth and fast-paced flow through corners. Braking performance is commendable, though the only drawback I noticed was the bike’s weight under heavy braking. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street verdict The F77 Mach 2 is an exciting machine but demands more from the rider due to its aggressive ergonomics. In contrast, the F77 Super Street retains all the best aspects of the Mach 2 while offering a more accessible ride with its relaxed ergonomics.  A clear representation of the difference in ergonomics between the F77 Mach 2 and Super Street. Considering it comes at essentially the same price as its sibling, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to step up to an electric motorcycle that’s both fun and engaging but also reasonably comfy for city riding.
