While Josh Allison’s name was already established in the custom bike world, he knew he’d have to take things to the next level to launch American Metal Customs, and he’ll be the first to admit ‘The Disciple’ Knucklehead had its fair share of complexities.

  "text": "Anyone who’s ever picked up a wrench has probably experienced the urge to create something from scratch; something that exudes craftsmanship and attention to detail. Few of us have what it takes, and pro builders must go even further to prove their mettle. While Josh Allison’s name was already established in the custom bike world, he knew he’d have to take things to the next level to launch American Metal Customs, and he’ll be the first to admit ‘The Disciple’ Knucklehead had its fair share of complexities. Raised in a family of artists and a habitual sketcher, Josh needed only the right powerplant in-house before he could commit his artistic vision to paper—and eventually sheet metal. As luck would have it, he had a line on a 1941 Harley-Davidson EL Knucklehead engine in New York—rebuilt to factory specification for the project. The rest would be fabricated. Josh explains that inspiration for a build can come from most anything—architecture, nature, fabrics, etc.—but a vintage bicycle provoked the design of The Disciple’s bodywork. Look no further than a 1950s Schwinn Hornet and you’ll find the impetus for the Knucklehead’s sharp lines. Like its pedal-driven counterpart, The Disciple’s tank is a split design with chiseled lines up top and a dramatic curve accenting the 45-degree V-twin heads. The art-deco wings also come from the Schwinn, executed in bronze, with a complimenting inlay covering the backbone. A detailed and complex assembly, Josh relays that it was one of the most complex parts to get right. The saddle is also a study in mixed metal fabrication. It’s composed of steel and bronze layers with some trick beadrolls and contrasting rivets. Hinged up front, and sprung in the rear, its elongated shape is also reminiscent of classic Schwinn hardware. In the world of Harley bobbers, there’s no finer frame than factory rigid, and the sloping backbone provided the stock stance Josh was after. Original pieces command thousands on their own, so a reproduction straight-leg frame was sourced and Josh bodyworked the cast sections and windowed the neck for a clean, enhanced stock look. Up front, Josh embraced creative liberty and experimented with an Indian-style, leaf-spring front end he had sitting around since his days at Orange County Choppers. He shortened it to keep the stance tight with the 21-inch front spool wheel, and removed a leaf from the spring pack to keep the ride plush. Custom fabricated bars maintain the vintage feel, accented by a brass clutch lever and grips. While The Disciple certainly embraces bygone eras, Josh insists there’s no point in building a bike that isn’t functional, and you’ll notice a few modern sensibilities in the build. The absence of a front brake is offset by a disc out back with dual calipers from TC Bros. Josh also installed a Baker 6-into-4 transmission, which as the name suggests, provides six forward gears in place of the stock four-speed. Additionally, there’s a kicker to solidify credibility with the graybeards, but also an electric start on the open primary. To further captivate onlookers, Josh worked loads of detail into the Knucklehead with various brass fittings, caps, and accents, continuing the mixed metal theme throughout. The custom air cleaner, kicker pedal and valve stem cap incorporate vintage religious figurines, reinforcing the bike’s namesake. These pieces and retro taillight assembly were sourced from Light Asylum, and Josh relishes working in these obscure items to add depth to the project. For a builder who insists on functional customs, Josh finds The Disciple rides every bit as good as it looks, and it was finished just in time to make a splash at the Fuel Cleveland show. And speaking of a splash, the Cleveland crowd was able to sample an all-new whiskey line by American Metal, with its flagship bottle inspired by the bike. Aptly named The Disciple, the Tennesee Straight uses recorded acoustics from the Knucklehead in its barrel aging process, and Josh sent us a sample on the house.
