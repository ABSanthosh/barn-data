  "description": "In the run-up to the global debut of the Kia Syros on December 19, the Korean brand has released a new teaser that shows the interior of the upcoming compact SUV. Other than confirming a few features seen in previous spy shots, the new Syros teaser also previews a number of interior details. Syros to debut a new steering wheel in India, similar to Kia's EV3 Features include terrain modes, push-button start, and a wireless charger To get 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engine options Kia Syros interior teaser One of the most noticeable highlights of the Syros’ cabin is the new two-spoke steering, seen on the likes of the Kia EV3. It sports the new off-centre Kia logo and gets several buttons and switches, some of which control the infotainment system, and one that is badged as Terrain Modes. This system will likely be similar to the Traction Modes offered on the larger Seltos mid-size SUV, which uses traction control to alter the amount of grip available. The Seltos’ system gets Mud, Snow/Wet, and Sand modes. Alongside the gear knob (an automatic is seen in the teaser) are buttons for push-to-start, parking sensors, and the camera. Range-topping versions are expected to get a 360-degree camera and front parking sensors, as previous Syros spy shots have shown. A corner of the large infotainment touchscreen is also visible, likely to be a 10.25-inch unit, and a digital instrument cluster will be offered in higher trims. A panoramic sunroof and an ADAS suite will be part of the features list on range-topping variants. Other details visible in the teaser include a wireless smartphone charger, two USB-C ports in the centre console, and a layered dashboard theme. Kia Syros engine options As we reported earlier, the Syros will be available with petrol and diesel engine options. However, to differentiate it from the Sonet, with which it’ll share space in the compact SUV segment, it’ll just have the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and the 1.5-litre diesel engine options, likely with their respective automatic gearbox options. The 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol will only be available with lower variants of the Sonet. An all-electric version of the Syros is expected to join the line-up about six months after prices for the petrol and diesel versions are announced, which is expected to happen in January at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. More details about the tall-boy SUV, which will sit between the Sonet and the Seltos in Kia India’s line-up, will be revealed in the coming days. Stay tuned.
