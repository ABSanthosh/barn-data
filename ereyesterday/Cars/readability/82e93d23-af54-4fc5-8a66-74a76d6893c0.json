  "description": "The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R has maintained its lead on the sales charts for the fourth year in a row, with 1.98 lakh units sold in the fiscal that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025). As we reported at the start of the month, the hatchback outsold the Tata Punch by a narrow 1,969-unit margin. However, a look at the top 10 bestsellers for FY2025 shows the continued dominance of SUVs, with just 3 hatchbacks and 1 sedan in the list. Without digressing further, these were the 10 bestselling cars in India in FY2025, based on SIAM’s wholesale numbers. 10 best-selling cars in FY2025ModelUnits10.Mahindra Scorpio N/Classic1,64,842 9.Maruti Dzire 1,65,021 8.Maruti Fronx 1,66,216 7.Maruti Baleno 1,67,1616.Maruti Swift 1,79,6415.Maruti Brezza 1,89,1634.Maruti Ertiga 1,90,972 3.Hyundai Creta 1,94,8712.Tata Punch1,96,5721.Maruti Wagon R 1,98,451 7 Maruti models among FY2025’s 10 bestsellers  Tata Punch is the bestselling SUV Maruti Ertiga continues as the only MPV on the list 10. Mahindra Scorpio 1,64,842 units With nearly 1.65 lakh units, the Mahindra Scorpio N and Classic together made it to the top 10 and are the only ladder-frame models on the chart. Priced between Rs 13.99 lakh and Rs 24.89 lakh, the Scorpio N comes with strong petrol and diesel engine options paired with a manual or an automatic gearbox and is a rough-and-tough SUV that even has off-road capabilities in 4x4 form. However, its drawbacks include cramped third-row seating and a poorly designed luggage area. Meanwhile, the Mahindra Scorpio Classic has a refined diesel engine and rugged appeal, but at its Rs 13.62-17.50 lakh price range, it lacks features and isn’t a particularly dynamically sound 7-seat SUV. 9. Maruti Dzire 1,65,021 units Despite SUVs continuing to place high on the top 10 sales list, the Maruti Dzire has managed to take the ninth spot with 1,65,021 units. Launched in November 2024, the fourth generation of Maruti’s compact sedan seems to have provided a push in terms of sales. The Dzire is known for its excellent ride and handling and good low-end response from the 1.2-litre petrol engine. However, for the Rs 6.84 lakh-10.19 lakh you pay for it, there are some features missing on top-spec trims, and the rear-seat headroom is a bit of an issue. 8. Maruti Fronx 1,66,216 units The Maruti Fronx has been on an upward trajectory throughout the year, hitting the 2 lakh sales milestone in September and ending the fiscal with 1,66,216 units. The Fronx’s highlights include the space and comfort it offers, along with an appealing design. However, our reviews of this compact SUV priced in the Rs 7.52 lakh-12.88 lakh range have shown that the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine option isn’t as punchy as expected, and the SUV also lacks some popular features. 7. Maruti Baleno 1,67,161 units With sales of 1,67,161 units, the Maruti Baleno is the first hatchback to feature in the top 10. It rivals the Tata Altroz and Hyundai i20 and costs Rs 6.70 lakh-9.92 lakh. While the Baleno boasts excellent ride quality and a spacious cabin, it now comes with an AMT gearbox option, which isn’t as smooth as the CVT unit offered previously with the premium hatchback. 6. Maruti Swift 1,79,641 units Maruti Suzuki’s answer to the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios outsold its more premium stable-mate, the Baleno, by a significant 12,480-unit margin, and that’s despite there being a significant price overlap between the two. The Maruti Swift is priced in the Rs 6.49 lakh-9.50 lakh range and is known for its light controls, easy-to-drive nature and impressive fuel economy. The demerits include a lack of punch from the engine. 5. Maruti Brezza 1,89,163 units Maruti’s other compact SUV offering, Brezza, which it retails from the Arena dealerships, witnessed sales of 1,89,163 units. Known for its comfortable ride, practicality and space, the Brezza is on the expensive side for what it offers – it costs Rs 8.69 lakh-14.14 lakh, and its 1.5-litre petrol engine has weak mid-range performance. 4. Maruti Ertiga 1,90,972 units The only MPV in this list is the Maruti Ertiga, which sold just over 1.9 lakh units during the year. Its excellent value proposition, combined with a flexible and practical cabin, has definitely helped its sales. However, the Kia Carens rival lacks some features and doesn’t have a diesel engine option. Ertiga’s prices range between Rs 8.97 lakh and Rs 13.26 lakh. 3. Hyundai Creta 1,94,871 units The popularity of the Hyundai Creta continues, with nearly 1.95 lakh units sold in the April 2024 to March 2025 period, helping the mid-size SUV reach the third spot. It should be noted that the all-electric version, the Hyundai Creta Electric, which launched in January this year, has also helped the sales marginally. This mid-size SUV outsold all its segment rivals – from the Maruti Grand Vitara to Honda Elevate to Skoda Kushaq to Volkswagen Taigun – partly due to the roomy and feature-packed interior. The Creta costs Rs 11.11 lakh-20.50 lakh, and its top-spec variants are pricey. Some plastics used inside could have been of better quality. 2. Tata Punch 1,96,572 units Tata’s smallest SUV was its bestselling model in FY2025, with over 1.96 lakh units sold. Priced from Rs 6.20 lakh to 10.32 lakh, the Tata Punch rivals the likes of the Citroen C3, Maruti Ignis, and the entry-level variants of the Nissan Magnite. This compact SUV boasts attractive packaging, mature driving manners and an elevated seating setup. However, higher variants are pricey, the petrol engine is dull, and the AMT gearbox isn’t the best unit around. 1. Maruti Wagon R 1,98,451 units Maruti’s popular tall-boy hatchback retains the top spot with 1,98,451 units. The Wagon R may not be ideal for highway runs due to its light build and boxy design, but the shape helps it boast a roomy cabin. In urban environs, the Wagon R is also easy to drive and frugal. This Tata Tiago rival is priced between Rs 5.65 lakh and Rs 7.48 lakh. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
