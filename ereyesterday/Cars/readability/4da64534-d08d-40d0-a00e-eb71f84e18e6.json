Additional equipment includes a rear spoiler, 16″ Fuchs wheels, four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, fog lights, a sunroof, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and height-adjustable front sport seats. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 930 Turbo coupe is now offered with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The body is finished in black and features a power-operated sunroof along with front and rear spoilers. Additional equipment includes a rear window wiper, headlight washers, and front fog lights. The image above and the majority of the photos in the listing gallery were taken in May 2024. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires measuring 205/55 front and 245/45 rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The height-adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in black leather and are complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include air conditioning, an analog clock, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo that was repaired in 2019. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 15k miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer tells us that work in January 2024 consisted of cleaning the fuel system, rebuilding the warm-up regulator and fuel distributor, and replacing the fuel filter and accumulator along with assorted seals. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Paul Miller Porsche of Parsippany, New Jersey, along with colors, equipment, options, and a total of $63,795. Manufacturer’s literature and service records will accompany the car. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
