This year, One combined forces with the AIMExpo to hold an additional event in Las Vegas alongside AIM, providing a unique opportunity to see two completely different sides of the industry. Started by the one-and-only Thor Drake, The One Show has always been unique in its quest to celebrate weird, rare, custom, classic and unconventional bikes, and we wondered if the event would hit as hard outside the context of Portland. With a list of 43 confirmed builders and countless additional motorcycles on hand, our concerns were quelled and the event expected to draw more than 9,000 attendees daily. Bouncing between shows, we were able to dig deep into a few of the motorcycles on display, and these are just a few of our favorites. John Panem’s 2014 Honda Ruckus We’re unashamed scooter guys, and John Panem’s 2014 Honda Ruckus was one of several that had our attention at the 2025 One Motorcycle Show. Panem’s Honda is loaded with handmade carbon fiber components and perfectly exemplifies the tuner style that makes the Ruckus scene great. Panem’s Ruckus gets a bunch of its attitude from a PCX swap with parts from Chimera Engineering. Suspension components from RRGS and some killer aluminum mags set the stance, and Panem added a steering stabilizer to the front end that’s routed right through the bodywork. Speaking of bodywork, John’s Honda Ruckus probably had the most righteous application of carbon fiber of the entire One Show. The front fender, fuel tank and footboards are finished in a perfect carbon weave, but his seat really stole the show. At the front, you’ll find a hole with a cheeky bit of text, but it’s actually an integrated intake velocity stack. Excellent fit and finish extends to every corner of Panem’s Ruckus, down to nuts and bolts, and there’s no denying that this little Honda was certainly a fan favorite. Jack Huisinga’s Ducati Desmo 450 Customs and creativity are cornerstones of The One Motorcycle Show, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find a few restored classics in the crowd. Jack Huisinga’s Ducati Desmo 450 was probably our favorite, looking fresh off the showroom floor for 1974. That’s impressive, considering Huisinga started with only a frame and an engine. Huisinga’s Ducati comes from a long line of hot Ducati singles, and the 1974 450 Desmo is arguably the pinnacle of Ducati’s single-cylinder technology. The factory had been sprinkling GP race tech down to its 250, 350 and 450 roadsters, and by 1971, that included Fabio Taglioni’s coveted desmodromic valve actuation. The rest of the chassis was similarly upgraded, with a five-speed transmission, 35 mm Marzocchi forks and a twin-sided front Grimeca brake—making the 300-pound Desmo a lightweight thrill for experienced riders. While the model had some early teething issues, it was well sorted by 1974 with a stronger bottom end and a steel fuel tank to comply with U.S. import regulations. While Ducati soon shifted resources to its 90-degree twins, the Desmo 450 is still regarded as one of the best sporting singles of all time. Andy Dibrino’s CFMOTO Flat Tracker CFMOTO isn’t a name you’d expect to find around the American Flat Track ranks, but that could all be about to change. Rider Andy Dibrino is a jack of all trades on two wheels, and he brought a tracker to The One Show that he’s been developing with CFMOTO and Savage Custom Fabrication. The ‘aha’ moment sets in when Dibrino reveals the mechanical underpinnings of the project—the CFMOTO 800NK—which astute readers will immediately identify as the KTM 790 Duke in different clothes. While it’s a little softer and cheaper than an orange Austrian version, the 800NK has been the subject of plenty of good press, and Dibrino’s tracker looks right as rain. With a full carbon fiber body and extensive modifications to the frame, Dibrino’s tracker clearly retains little stock hardware. Textbook modifications to the rake and trail come courtesy of a custom swingarm with a K-Tech coilover and 43 mm billet triple clamps from Lowery Racing—the hot-pink accented wheels are their work as well. Dibrino credits Savage Custom Fabrication with the heavy lifting on the project, and while it’s far from finished, we’re looking forward to seeing another hat in the ring for flat-track racing soon. 1962 BSA Bobber ‘Super Fly’ The Harley-Davidson name is synonymous with America’s 1960s custom bike scene. When we think about choppers and bobbers of the day, we think of V-twins, but if you watch any of the crappy old biker films, you’ll find scores of chopped-up old British twins. Appropriately named ‘Super Fly,’ this BSA bobber expertly epitomizes an underrepresented group of the ’60s custom scene. The basis for the project was a 1962 BSA Super Rocket, equipped with a pre-unit 646 cc twin and a single Amal carburetor—good for 46 hp. If it’s not a survivor, it could certainly pass for an old show bike of the day, because this thing just oozes 1960s flavor. Aside from the scalloped paintwork on the tank and oil bag, every piece of the BSA is plated or polished, right down to the frame and Monobloc carburetor. Cocktail shaker mufflers, Bates lighting and the narrow ape bars match the motif, as does a sassy set of polished 21F/19R wheels. It’s hard to find a single item out of place, and it’s clear this BSA was built with expert discretion. Credited on its plaque as the work of ‘Neto \u0026 Jon,’ we don’t have many details for you beyond what the eye can see, but I suspect more could be found on the Gram @reppohccyco. Mike Rabideau’s Harley-Davidson Shovelhead The madman behind Majik Mike’s Designs, Mike Rabideau has been building custom motorcycles since 2003. Back then, he lived near Harley’s backyard in Racine, Wisconsin, but he’s since moved to Vegas where he opened his shop and did a stint as a fabricator on Counting Cars. It’s Mike’s goal that every bike he builds should look like it’s moving, even standing still, and that’s certainly true of this Shovelhead he recently completed for a customer. Mike’s client had a style and a few colors in mind, but the majority of this build is textbook Majik Mike. He got started with a ’79 Harley Shovelhead engine, which he rebuilt before applying a thick coat of black paint and adding brass accents throughout. What looks like an aftermarket frame, is actually a highly modified ’81 Harley frame that Mike hard-tailed, extended the neck, added rake and dropped the seat. The wheel combo was picked specifically by the customer, consisting of a 19-inch spool wheel and a modified 16-incher from a Harley Fat Boy. Forks are a set of shortened 39 mm tubes from a Sportster. While the client specified a black and gold color scheme, Mike stressed that a third color was needed and the detailed paintwork was applied by Ryan Evans. Gold leaf in the paint is paired with various brass accents throughout the motorcycle, including the grips, headlight bezel, pegs jockey shift knob and more.

The factory had been sprinkling GP race tech down to its 250, 350 and 450 roadsters, and by 1971, that included Fabio Taglioni’s coveted desmodromic valve actuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"The One Motorcycle Show Las Vegas 2025\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/one-moto-show-vegas-4.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe rest of the chassis was similarly upgraded, with a five-speed transmission, 35 mm Marzocchi forks and a twin-sided front Grimeca brake—making the 300-pound Desmo a lightweight thrill for experienced riders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the model had some early teething issues, it was well sorted by 1974 with a stronger bottom end and a steel fuel tank to comply with U.S. import regulations.
