  "description": "I vividly remember my first dalliance with the charming Royal Enfield Classic 350 – our then long-termer when I was just an intern. It was early July, and I was riding to Mumbai from Pune with the monsoon in full swing. Despite the unforgiving weather, that ride is etched in my memory. After that, I remember asking Rishaad (the bike’s primary custodian) for it every chance I got, and while I absolutely adored it, I couldn’t help but wish for a bit more performance. Prior to this, my only other experience with an RE was my uncle’s Interceptor 650, and I wished for a bike that would marry the styling and comfort of the Classic 350 with the performance of the 650cc parallel-twin. And that’s exactly what the company has done (well, almost). Say hello to the gorgeous Classic 650 Twin. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin design, quality, colours There are good-looking bikes and then there are good-looking bikes. This Classic 650 Twin definitely falls in the latter category. The overall silhouette is a union between the Classic 350 and the Shotgun, both handsome bikes to begin with, and it keeps building on that. You can identify the Classic 650 Twin as a Classic for sure but you won’t mistake it for the smaller one. That big engine, twin pipes and its sheer size make the 650 easy to identify. The gorgeous Classic 650 Twin has the best finish of any modern Royal Enfield. While the visuals are derived from the smaller 350, the 650 Twin’s colour palette is unique. There are four colours on offer – Bruntingthorpe Blue, Vallam Red, Teal Green and the Black Chrome. The latter two are colours seen on the original UCE Classic models and the Teal Green is by far my favourite colour here. It is the only one amongst the four options to get a colour-matched frame and main stand (yes, you read that right). Beefy handlebar clamp and chromed-out switchgear cubes are a premium touch and unique to the Classic 650 Twin. Fit and finish is the best on any Royal Enfield yet and there are lashings of chrome everywhere. Even the switch cubes and wheel hubs are chromed out! RE wants to drive home the fact that you’re on the bigger Classic so there’s a beefy handlebar clamp (of course, it’s chrome) and fittingly, even the headlight housing is properly prodigious. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin weight, manageability At 243kg, the Classic 650 Twin is the heaviest modern-day RE yet (at least until the Himalayan 650 arrives). The weight is a non-issue at anything over walking speeds, but you’ll feel every ounce muscling the bike around in the parking lot and while putting it on the main stand. My only gripe on the design front is that the gap between the rear fender and the tyre is a little unsightly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nowhere near as unseemly as on a Harley X440, but on an otherwise good-looking bike, it’s definitely a fly in the ointment. The bike you see in all the pictures has a solo seat, but customer bikes will come with a pillion seat and grab rails, just like the Shotgun. The riding position is very neutral and you can easily spend a lot of time in the saddle. Seat height is set at a relatively low 800mm, but this is perhaps the toughest bike with an 800mm perch to get your feet down on. I’m 5’11” and I could just about get both my feet flat on the ground – and I had to sit on the lowest part of the seat for that. To blame is the wide engine, which splays your legs out a fair bit. Shorter riders will have to find a workaround or look elsewhere. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin riding experience Enough praise has been showered on Royal Enfield’s twin-cylinder engine already, but I’m here to lay some more onto that pile. This is easily the best engine on any Indian motorcycle – in my books at least – and for good reason. Smooth, tractable and with torque almost everywhere, this motor excelled in every situation. Going through sleepy towns, blasting through corners and even holding 80mph (124kph) on the motorway, everything was navigated with reasonable ease. The motor is carried over as is from the Shotgun, with no mapping or gearing changes. The Classic 650’s chassis is similar to the Shotgun, with the same main frame and the same steering  geometry. The differences boil down to a telescopic fork here vs a USD on the Shotgun, and different wheel sizes (19/18-inch wheels, like the smaller Classic – the Shotgun uses an 18/17 setup). The Showa fork is 43mm in diameter and the twin shocks are the same as the Shotgun’s. Suspension travel, too, is the same fore and aft, at 120mm and 90mm, respectively. Stiff rear shocks are the main drawback here. While the Classic 650 is a willing companion if you want to attack corners, the mid-set pegs can scrape without too much trying and you need to adjust your body position accordingly. I also missed having a heel shifter, like on the smaller Classic, but these complaints are something I can easily look past. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin ride and handling What I simply cannot ignore is the stiff and jarring ride. And I’m saying this after riding the Classic 650 Twin in the UK, where the roads are head and shoulders better than ours. This is literally the only thing that is actively stopping me (and I suspect will do so for many others) from going out and buying one today, that’s how good the rest of the bike is. Brake sizes on the big Classic are the same as the Super Meteor and Shotgun, and that means they’re powerful enough but in a progressive manner. Fun fact: the calipers are RE branded but are the same ByBre units seen on the aforementioned two models. This is something, I’m told, will trickle down to other REs in time. Dash is same as 350, Tripper standard on all colours. The spec sheet worshippers may lament the lack of a USD fork but, honestly, I don’t think it’s any worse off without one – this look suits the Classic better. Never once did I feel that the front end was lacking in feel or stability and we were keeping a fair lick on these beautiful UK roads. Seats and mounting points same as Shotgun 650. While the laced wheels do mean tubed tyres today, Royal Enfield says tubeless wire-spoke wheels are in development, which is encouraging to hear. However, it’s still early days so don’t expect to see them anytime soon. Hopefully,  you will then be able to fit the tubeless wheels even on the single-cylinder Classic/Bullet models down the line. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin expected price, verdict Royal Enfield hasn’t revealed the price of the Classic 650 Twin but has hinted that the starting price will be in the Shotgun’s ballpark and the top chrome colour in the Super Meteor’s territory. That is sure to make the Classic 650 Twin a heart-over-head purchase. You could also argue that the Shotgun and Classic are too similar in how they ride and that the extra cash you shell out is just for the form factor and riding position. With the Classic 650 Twin, Royal Enfield has been quite clear that its focus is on the relatively untapped export markets. With what I’ve experienced, I’m sure it will do well for them and I wish them all the best. However, I can’t help but shake this nagging feeling that the suspension will be a problem on our roads and while this is a wonderful bike in many days, it isn’t the Classic 650 I used to dream about. I hope to be wrong, but we’ll find out soon enough. Also See: Royal Enfield Classic 650 twin video review",
