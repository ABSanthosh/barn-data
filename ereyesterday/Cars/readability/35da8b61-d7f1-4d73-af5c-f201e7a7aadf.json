  "description": "The year 2025 will see leading car manufacturers enter the EV space, while some are going to expand their lineup. With the Bharat Mobility Global Expo (BMGE) taking place in January, car buyers will get a taste of how the year will pan out for EVs. Below are listed upcoming 12 SUVs and an MPV that should be on your radar. Hyundai Creta EV The Hyundai Creta EV will be based on its ICE sibling and will rival the Maruti e Vitara. Being based on the regular Creta, it will have a familiar silhouette save for the aerodynamic design elements typical in electric cars. Inside, it will borrow a lot of features from the Alcazar facelift. As for range, expect a maximum of 400 kilometres from a 45kWh battery. Notably, the same cell pack will power the Kia Carens EV. Hyundai will launch the Creta EV on January 17, with prices expected to go from Rs 25 to 35 lakh. Maruti Suzuki e Vitara Maruti’s first EV is the production-spec version of the eVX concept. The e Vitara retains most of the concept’s upright yet angular design and is quite similar on the inside as well. Naturally, some design details, outside and in, have been toned down for the production model.  Expected to launch in March 2025, the Maruti e Vitara will come with two battery pack options. The entry-level version will get a 144hp motor on the front axle, while the battery with the larger variant will have a 174hp motor. The AWD version will get a 65hp rear axle-mounted motor as well, bringing the combined output to 184hp and 300Nm. Maruti is targeting an MIDC range of over 500km for the Hyundai Creta EV, Tata Curvv EV and Mahindra BE 6e rival.  Toyota Urban Cruiser EV Toyota’s version of the Suzuki e Vitara has already been showcased in concept form as the Urban SUV. It will be launched in India towards the end of the year. Styling tweaks and interior themes will help differentiate the two models, though under the skin, the Toyota and Suzuki will be identical. Options will include an AWD version, too. Considering the compact e SUV segment into consideration, a Rs 20 to Rs 30 lakh price bracket is radical. Tata Sierra EV Tata will bring back the Sierra nameplate with the new EV, while petrol and diesel versions will follow soon after; the company used the same format for the launch of the Curvv EV and its petrol and diesel counterparts. The Sierra EV will use the same Acti.EV architecture – essentially Tata’s Gen2 EV platform – used by the Punch EV, Curvv EV and Harrier EV, though the battery and motor specifications are yet to be confirmed. The Sierra EV may also get an AWD setup as an option, with a motor on each axle. Styling will be close to the concept and will feature a large rear glass area that is a visual link to the original Sierra of the 1990s. Tata can launch the electric Sierra either in 2025 or 2026. Tata Harrier EV Having been showcased in near-production form last year, the Harrier EV is expected to go on sale around March 2025. Likely to sport a 60kWh battery, the Harrier EV will offer 500km of range on the MIDC cycle. What will make the Harrier EV unique is that it’ll be Tata’s first all-electric model to sport an AWD setup, with an electric motor on each axle. In fact, it’ll be the first Tata – in five years – with power going to all four wheels. Distinguishing the Harrier EV from its ICE counterpart is a closed-off grille, new front and rear bumpers, and new alloy wheels.  The interior has yet to be seen officially, but we expect loads to be shared with the Harrier diesel, and some elements from the Curvv EV. Tata has confirmed that like the other models based on the Acti.EV platform, the Harrier EV will have vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging capacities, and we expect it to get a flat floor as well. Mahindra XUV 3XO EV Essentially the XUV400 EV with a 200mm shorter rear overhang, the all-electric version of the XUV 3XO is likely to share the same styling as the compact SUV, besides EV-specific changes. Sources tell us that it’ll come with a smaller 35kWh battery pack than the XUV400 to better position it against the Tata Nexon EV. Mahindra will launch the electric vehicle at a premium over the standard 3XO mostly by July 2025. Mahindra BE 6e (prices of all variants) We have reported extensively on the Mahindra BE 6e SUV launched in November. The car has a concept-inspired design which may look radical. As for output figures, they are 281hp and 380Nm with a 0-100kph time of 6.7 seconds. Two batteries of 59kWh and 79kWh will be on offer and the ARAI range ranges between 556km and 682km. Mahindra has revealed only the range-starting BE 6e’s price - Rs 18.90 lakh - and is set to release the entire price list next month. Deliveries are to commence from February-end. Mahindra XEV 7e The standard SUV version of the XEV 9e, without the raked roofline and with a third row of seats, is expected to arrive later in the year. The 7e will likely share all of its features, safety kit, tech, battery and powertrain options – among other bits – with the 9e. Expect similar range and performance figures, too. The all-electric three-row SUV will rival the Tata Harrier EV. We expect the car to arrive by late 2025. Mahindra XEV 9e (prices of all variants) The larger Mahindra XEV 9e coupé-SUV shares its platform, battery and powertrain options with the BE 6e, and is correspondingly marginally slower and less frugal on a single charge. On the other hand, cabin and luggage space is greater than the smaller BE, and it gets more tech like a passenger-side infotainment screen. Prices start at Rs 21.90 lakh, while the complete rate list will be revealed at the BMGE 2025, and deliveries will begin at the end of February. Considering its price point and size, the BYD Atto 3 is currently the XEV 9e’s closest rival.  Kia Carens EV The all-electric MPV will share its design with the upcoming Carens facelift, albeit with EV-specific changes like aero-optimised wheels and a closed-off grille area. Its powertrain and battery setup are expected to be shared with the Creta EV seeing as they share the same platform, among other mechanical components, as stated before. India debut of the electric Carens may happen towards the end of 2025 Kia Syros EV  Not much is known yet about the all-electric version of the Syros other than the fact that it will only be available in front-wheel drive format. It’s expected to go on sale about six months after the ICE versions that will be showcased at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January. As for rates, Kia could price it from 15 lakh onwards. BYD midsize e SUV While not much is known, BYD is planning to launch a new SUV that will rival the Tata Curvv EV, Hyundai Creta EV, Mahindra BE 6e and the Maruti e Vitara. BYD recently filed patents for two SUVs - Bao 3 and Denza N9 - both of which are a segment above and not to be confused with the aforementioned. The Chinese brand may showcase the SUV at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Launch may happen in the second half of 2025, around when its specifications will become clear. Citroen Aircross EV The French brand’s next EV is likely to be the electric version of the Aircross. Considering the 5+2 seat SUV shares its platform with the C3 hatchback, which has an all-electric derivative, an electric version of the Aircross is only logical. However, the eC3 uses a 29.2kWh battery and a 57hp electric motor, and Citroën may opt for a bigger battery and motor here. Expected pricing and launch timeline are Rs 18 lakh and H2 2025, respectively. Citroen Basalt EV With the Basalt-based EV, Citroen will enter the soon-to-be crowded all-electric midsize SUV space, taking on the Curvv EV, BE 6e, and the bevy of new models. It’ll likely share its powertrain and battery pack with the Aircross EV, seeing as it is also built on the same platform, which can accommodate both internal combustion and electric powertrains. Additionally, the Basalt EV’s pricing will hover around the Aircross EV’s and the two may launch together.
