The seller purchased the car on BaT in March 2023, and service under current ownership included changing the oil and replacing the transfer case, tires, and rear brake rotors and pads. This F13 6-Series Coupe has 60k miles and is offered with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax Report, and a clean Virginia title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Imola Red (405), and the M Sport Package added M aerodynamic bodywork and LED fog lights. Additional exterior details include adaptive LED headlights, a glass sunroof, front and rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets with black finishers. Scratches are noted on the front bumper cover. The 20″ Style 373M alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires manufactured in 2023. The car is equipped with Dynamic Damper Control and Active Roll Stabilization, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. Work performed under current ownership included flushing the brake fluid and replacing the rear brake rotors and pads. Scuffs are visible on the wheels.

A head-up display projects critical information onto the windshield. The digital odometer indicates 60k miles, approximately 11k of which were added under current ownership.
