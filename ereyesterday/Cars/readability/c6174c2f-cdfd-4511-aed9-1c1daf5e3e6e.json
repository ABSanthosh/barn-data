  "description": "Triumph is gearing up to launch a more premium version of the Scrambler 400 X. This variant will be called the Scrambler 400 XC, and the main difference between the two bikes will be that the XC will run on a pair of cross-spoke wheels. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC to feature cross-spoke wheels Will get body-colour-matched high fender and flyscreen Likely to cost around Rs 25,000-30,000 more than the 400 X Triumph Scrambler 400 XC: What do we know so far? The higher-spec XC variant will feature cross-spoke wheels, high fender and a flyscreen The Triumph Scrambler 400 XC will share its engine, frame, and most cycle parts with the existing 400 X. The differences between the two Scrambler 400 variants will boil down to a pair of cross-spoke wheels that support tubeless tyres in place of alloys. The XC will also get a body-coloured high fender, flyscreen, and additional engine protection, which is currently offered as an accessory on the regular Scrambler 400 X. All these upgrades are likely to push the price up by a fair margin. Currently, the Scrambler 400 X is priced at Rs 2.67 lakh, and the dealers we have spoken to have led us to believe the Scrambler 400 XC will carry a premium of around Rs 25,000 over the 400 X. At that price, it will be positioned very close to the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 and KTM 390 Adventure X. However, it is worth noting that the Scrambler price has not changed much since its launch at 2.67 lakh, whereas the Speed 400 has risen from the original introductory price of Rs 2.23 lakh to Rs 2.46 lakh. The Scrambler 400 XC will be sold alongside the Scrambler 400 X. We expect Triumph to launch the XC variant sometime next week. Also see: ADV motorcycles with the lowest seat height under Rs 4 lakh",
