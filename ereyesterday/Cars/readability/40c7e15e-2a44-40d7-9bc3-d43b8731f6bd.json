  "description": "This 2004 Volkswagen R32 shows 68k miles and is one of approximately 5,000 produced for the US market for a single model year, of which 1,034 were finished from the factory in Reflex Silver Metallic over black leather. The 3.2-liter VR6 has been modified with a VF Engineering supercharger and sends power to the wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and an all-wheel-drive system fitted with a Peloquin torque-biasing front differential which was installed following the seller's 2018 acquisition. Modifications performed under current ownership also include an Exit 9 Performance cog-style pulley, a Fluidampr pulley, 630cc fuel injectors, a CTS Turbo intake manifold, and a United Motorsport ECU tune in addition to tubular headers, USP Motorsports catalytic converters, and Bilstein PSS coilovers. The car is further equipped with 18\" Aristo wheels, Koenig heated front seats, and a Monsoon sound system. The rear brake calipers, rotors, and pads were replaced in November 2024. This Mk4 R32 is offered with service records, a water/methanol injection kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller's name.",

The 3.2-liter VR6 has been modified with a VF Engineering supercharger and sends power to the wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and an all-wheel-drive system fitted with a Peloquin torque-biasing front differential which was installed following the seller’s 2018 acquisition. Modifications performed under current ownership also include an Exit 9 Performance cog-style pulley, a Fluidampr pulley, 630cc fuel injectors, a CTS Turbo intake manifold, and a United Motorsport ECU tune in addition to tubular headers, USP Motorsports catalytic converters, and Bilstein PSS coilovers. The car is further equipped with 18″ Aristo wheels, Koenig heated front seats, and a Monsoon sound system. The rear brake calipers, rotors, and pads were replaced in November 2024. This Mk4 R32 is offered with service records, a water/methanol injection kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller’s name. In comparison to the fourth-generation GTI, the R32 is distinguished by revised bumper covers and side skirts along with a rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, R32 badging, and dual polished exhaust outlets. VX Tuning headlights have been added, which feature black housings and bi-LED low beams with R-logo projector lenses and a red “Demon Eye” parking light function. This example is also equipped with a power sunroof, rear spoiler, rear window wiper, and heated power-adjustable side mirrors. Noted blemishes include scratches and dings as well as scuffs on the front bumper and lip, and areas of corrosion on the body are visible in the photo gallery below. The 18″ Aristo alloy wheels are mounted with Vercelli tires. The car utilizes a Bilstein PSS suspension with front coilovers, while stopping power is handled by an Alcon big brake kit and Goodridge stainless-steel brake lines. The rear brake calipers, rotors, and pads were replaced in November 2024, and the seller notes that the emergency brake was also adjusted and a compression test performed. The heated Koenig front sport seats are trimmed in black leather with “R”-logo backrest embroidery, while brushed alloy trim, R32-branded door-sill plates, and metal pedal covers accent the cabin. Passengers are provided with automatic climate control, cruise control, and a Monsoon audio system linked with a CD/cassette stereo and a trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer. The R32 steering wheel is wrapped in thicker leather compared to the contemporary GTI, and it frames a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer, a digital multifunction display, and supplementary readouts. A boost gauge is affixed to the steering column. The digital odometer shows 68k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The instrument panel was repaired in May 2006, and the vehicle speed sensor was replaced in March 2024. The seller notes a braking system warning light is illuminated and the brake pad wear sensors have been removed to accommodate the big brake kit. The 3.2-liter VR6 was revised under previous ownership with a VF Engineering supercharger, which was rebuilt in 2021 and fitted with ceramic bearings and an Exit 9 Performance 64-tooth cog-style pulley. Additional modifications include a Fluidampr pulley, 630cc fuel injectors, a CTS Turbo intake manifold, a United Motorsport ECU tune, VF Engineering engine mounts, a red powder-coated valve cover, and black powder-coated intercooler piping. The seller reports dual bypass valves and a three keyway crankshaft were also installed and the valve cover gasket, throttle body, and air conditioning compressor were replaced under current ownership. The battery was replaced in March 2024. Invoices for work performed are presented in the image gallery below. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a Haldex-based 4MOTION all-wheel-drive system. A Clutch Masters FX100 clutch disc and single-mass steel billet flywheel have been added along with a Peloquin front differential. The right front CV axle and the clutch master cylinder are noted to have been replaced in 2024. Exhaust gasses flow through Michael Underhill tubular headers, USP Motorsports high-flow catalytic converters, and a Milltek Sport cat-back section. Corrosion is present on underside components. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Filed under: vw You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
