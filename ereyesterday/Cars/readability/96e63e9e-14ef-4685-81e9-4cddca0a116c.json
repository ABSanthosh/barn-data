  "text": "If you're looking for a 6.4-liter Hemi V8, you can now cross the Durango off your list 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Dodge has killed the Durango SXT, Citadel, and 392 for 2025. The death of the Durango 392 is notable as there’s one less model with a 6.4-liter Hemi V8. The Durango SRT Hellcat survives and Dodge is offering a handful of special editions. The 2024 Durango had six different trims and countless packages. Dodge is now simplifying things for 2025 and there are just three survivors. Unfortunately, there are a few notable casualties as the Durango Citadel and Durango 392 are no longer with us. The latter’s death will be felt by fans as it was powered by a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 producing 475 hp (354 kW / 482 PS) and 470 lb-ft (637 Nm) of torque. It enabled the SUV to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 4.4 seconds and run the quarter-mile in 12.9 seconds.

Additional changes are limited, but all models now come equipped with a 10.1-inch Uconnect 5 infotainment system. The Durango GT’s Plus Package also comes with extra equipment. The now entry-level Durango GT has LED lighting units and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Buyers will also find power heated front seats, a second-row bench, and a split-folding third-row. They’re joined by a heated steering wheel, a 7-inch multi-information display, a tri-zone automatic climate control system, and a six-speaker audio system. Power is provided by a 3.6-liter V6 developing 295 hp (220 kW / 299 PS) and 260 lb-ft (352 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission, which can be paired to rear- or all-wheel drive. The mid-level Durango R/T has a sportier exterior with larger 20-inch wheels. Buyers will also find a sport-tuned suspension, a nine-speaker Alpine audio system, and second-row USB-C charging ports. The biggest upgrade is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 with 360 hp (268 kW / 365 PS) and 390 lb-ft (528 Nm) of torque. It’s paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox and a standard all-wheel drive system. That brings us to the range-topping Durango SRT Hellcat, which features heated and ventilated front seats as well as heated second-row captain’s chairs that are separated by a center console featuring illuminated cup holders. The model also has leather-wrapped surfaces, a power adjustable steering column, and a 115-volt power outlet. The real highlight is a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 producing 710 hp (529 kW / 720 PS) and 645 lb-ft (874 Nm) of torque. It enables the model to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.5 seconds, run the quarter mile in 11.5 seconds, and hit a top speed of 180 mph (290 km/h). Besides the almighty engine, there’s an adaptive damping performance suspension, Brembo brakes, and a unique all-wheel drive system.",
