  "description": "This 1967 Chevrolet Corvette coupe underwent modifications prior to the current owner's 2024 acquisition, including the installation of a 5.7-liter L98 V8 and revised bodywork, a repaint in red, and a refresh of the interior. A Tremec five-speed manual transmission was installed in 2024. The car is equipped with 15\" Boyd Coddington wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a side-exit exhaust system, and triple taillights as well as a Corvette-branded cassette player and C4 Corvette bucket seats trimmed in red and black leather. This modified C2 is now offered in Texas on dealer consignment with a clean California title.",

  "text": "This 1967 Chevrolet Corvette coupe underwent modifications prior to the current owner’s 2024 acquisition, including the installation of a 5.7-liter L98 V8 and revised bodywork, a repaint in red, and a refresh of the interior. A Tremec five-speed manual transmission was installed in 2024. The car is equipped with 15″ Boyd Coddington wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a side-exit exhaust system, and triple taillights as well as a Corvette-branded cassette player and C4 Corvette bucket seats trimmed in red and black leather. This modified C2 is now offered in Texas on dealer consignment with a clean California title. Finished from the factory in Goodwin Green, the car was fitted with a front splitter, fender flares, and triple taillights under prior ownership and refinished in red with black accent stripes on the front. Details include fender vents, a curved glass rear window, a domed hood, retractable headlights, and a side-exit exhaust system. Five-spoke 15″ Boyd Coddington wheels are mounted with Copper Cobra Radial G/T tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs with red calipers. The refreshed cabin houses bucket seats that were sourced from a C4-generation Corvette and are trimmed in red and black leather. Appointments include a heater, a vertical Corvette-branded cassette player, an analog clock, and lap belts The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 99k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter L98 V8 was installed under prior ownership and is fitted with revised headers, a Be Cool radiator, and an Optima Yellow Top battery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec five-speed manual transmission that was fitted in 2024. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information: Style 67 437 – 1967 Corvette coupe Body S6237 – St.Louis body number Trim 430 – Green vinyl upholstery Paint 983 – Goodwood Green Filed under: c2 You are not connected to real-time updates.
