  "description": "A few months after it made its global debut at EICMA 2024, the Aprilia Tuono 457 has been launched in India at Rs 3.95 lakh (ex-showroom, Maharashtra). The sport-naked Tuono is largely mechanically identical to the fully-faired RS 457 but has noticeably distinct styling.  Aprilia Tuono 457 has the same power output as the RS 457 Its rider triangle is more upright thanks to the handlebar Bookings are open; deliveries will begin by March The Aprilia Tuono 457 is powered by the same 457cc parallel-twin engine that’s seen on the RS, producing 47.6hp and 43.5Nm and paired to a 6-speed gearbox along with a slip-and-assist clutch. A bi-directional quickshifter is available as an optional accessory. The Tuono 457’s frame, suspension, brakes and electronics suite are also shared with the RS in typical Aprilia fashion.    Where the Tuono differs from its sibling is the way it looks; in fact, it also differs greatly from the larger capacity Tuonos. A small new LED headlight flanked by two sharp daytime running lights replaces the signature Aprilia tri-bulb setup on the new Tuono 457. Another difference is the Tuono’s slightly reduced fuel tank capacity: 12.7 litres on the Tuono versus 13 litres on the RS 457. However, both motorcycles have the same 175kg kerb weight.   The Tuono 457 also has slightly shorter gearing, thanks to a rear sprocket that’s one tooth larger than the one on the RS 457. It can be had in one of two colourways: a striking red/black option and a more subtle white/grey scheme. Bookings open today, and deliveries are slated to begin by March.  At Rs 3.95 lakh, the Tuono 457 sits Rs 25,000 below the RS 457, and its main rival is the recently repriced Rs 3.50 lakh Yamaha MT-03. Another credible option in this displacement range is the Rs 2.95 lakh KTM 390 Duke, which also saw a price revision recently, although compared to the twin-cylinder Yamaha and Aprilia, the Bajaj-made KTM is powered by a single-cylinder engine.  Also See: Aprilia RS 457 vs Yamaha R3 comparison",
