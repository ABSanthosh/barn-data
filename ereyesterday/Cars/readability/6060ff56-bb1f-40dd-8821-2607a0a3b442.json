  "description": "The Kia PV5 has been unveiled ahead of its debut, which was scheduled for February 27 at the carmaker’s 2025 EV Day event. Not only is the PV5 Kia’s first van but also the introductory model for its Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), a modular skateboard designed to spawn all-electric multi-purpose utility vehicles targeted towards private and commercial sectors. Kia will offer the PV5 van in Passenger and Cargo body styles The Passenger version has rear seats, but the Cargo one doesn’t Separate screens for the instrument cluster and the infotainment system Kia PV5 exterior design The PV5 will come in two body styles: Passenger and Cargo. While both will have the same core design, the latter eschews rear seats in favour of luggage space. Being the more consumer-facing option, the PV5 Passenger sports a clean, futuristic styling. Up front, it gets high-mounted angular LED strips, which double up as indicators, and the main headlight units are situated lower. The PV5’s charging port is in the centre of the fascia, with a front-facing camera above it and a large radar sensor underneath. Both PV5 body styles have different tailgates Over to the side, plastic body cladding can be seen all around the PV5 Passenger’s lower half, and the upper half shows off chunky side mirrors and a large glass area. The pillars, bonnet and upper half of the fenders are blacked out. At the rear, the PV5 Passenger has a single lift-up boot lid; the Cargo body style gets dual, side-opening tailgate doors. Kia PV5 interior   PV5 dashboard to get two screens Kia has only revealed the PV5’s exterior, with full interior images likely reserved for the upcoming EV Day. However, the exterior images show glimpses of the cabin, most notably separate screens for the instrument cluster and the infotainment system and thick grab handles on the A-pillars. The Kia PV5 will primarily compete against the Volkswagen ID Buzz in international markets. Currently, it’s unclear whether Kia plans to bring the PV5 to India, but the company’s 2025 EV Day may shed more light on this.
