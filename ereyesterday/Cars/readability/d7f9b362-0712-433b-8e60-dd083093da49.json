  "text": "The turquoise, red, orange, and green livery is reminiscent of classic Porsche race cars July 18, 2025 at 21:11 by Brad Anderson One-off Porsche GT3 RS designed with Dua Lipa will soon hit the auction block. All of the money raised from this auction will benefit the pop star’s foundation. RM Sotheby’s expects the flamboyant 911 GT3 RS to sell for over $470,000. This is a Porsche 911 GT3 RS unlike any other as, instead of being configured by a prolific car collector, it was brought to life through a collaboration between pop superstar Dua Lipa and Porsche. The resulting design makes it one of the most flamboyant GT3 RSs we’ve seen, and in under two weeks, it’ll be offered for sale. Read: Porsche 911 GT3 RS Driver Discovers Trees Are Much Stronger Than Red Wheels Much like how some of Dua Lipa’s music has a retro feel to it, the design of the GT3 RS is the same. It originally left the factory in Arctic Grey but with the singer’s input, has received a wild turquoise, red, gold and dark green livery. The design seems to have taken inspiration from some of the wild liveries used by Porsche race cars over the decades. Unique Styling, Track-Ready Specs Along with the vivid paintwork, the car features ‘Dua Lipa Rennstall’ lettering across the sides and hood. It’s equipped with the Weissach Package, Clubsport Package, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB), and a front-axle lift system. Lipa was actually seen driving it through the streets of Monte Carlo during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend in late May. The odometer shows 5,264 km (3,270 miles), indicating the car has not been a garage queen. Photos RM Sotheby’s In contrast to the exterior, the cabin is relatively restrained. It features black leather upholstery with red stitching, a red tachometer, and carbon fiber accents, small touches that maintain the performance-focused feel while nodding to the exterior’s palette. Auction Proceeds for a Good Cause Interested buyers will be pleased to know that all of the funds raised from the auction will benefit Dua Lipa’s Sunny Hill Foundation. This charity works to support Kosovan communities, in particular the arts and culture sectors. RM Sotheby’s expects the car to sell for over €400,000 or about $470,000, which is roughly around the going rate of a similar low-mileage GT3 RS in the United States. If you’re the type who prefers their track toys with a splash of pop-star flair and wouldn’t mind telling people your GT3 RS was once driven through Monaco by Dua Lipa herself, you can check out the full listing here.
