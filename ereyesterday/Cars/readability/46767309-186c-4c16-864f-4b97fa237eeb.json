  "description": "Hero’s electric subsidiary, Vida, has released yet another teaser just a few weeks before the suspected launch of the VX2, their new, more affordable offering.   The VX2 will likely be offered in multiple variants   It will be aimed at a wider market compared to the V2  Likely to launch on July 1 The VX2 will share major internal components with the V2  Design elements and the feature set will be its differentiating factor  In the new teaser, we see flashing lights and the scooter’s silhouette in the same bright red colour. Thanks to the images found a month ago of the undisguised scooter at a dealership, we know the design will be much softer and more traditional compared to the V2’s aggressive styling. The VX2 will also be equipped similarly, though with a few downgrades, such as a smaller TFT, a physical key slot, a different set of switchgear and a flatter, single seat. This new teaser also reveals that it will be only getting drum brakes. The rest of the internals are likely to be quite similar to the V2. With respect to Vida’s current line-up, the VX2 is expected to be competitively priced and is likely to be offered in variants, as we saw a ‘Plus’ variant in the previously mentioned images. These scooters are likely to launch on July 1, and it remains to be seen what pricing strategy Hero will adopt. Also see: Hero Vida VX2 electric scooter teased ahead of July 1 launch",
