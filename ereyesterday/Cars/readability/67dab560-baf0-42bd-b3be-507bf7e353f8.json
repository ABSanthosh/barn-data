  "text": "Whether you’re driving a new Pagani or a clapped-out Honda Civic, happiness levels on a drive can quickly plummet if you find yourself crashing through—or anxiously avoiding—bumps and potholes.There’s no shortage of talk about the United State’s “crumbling infrastructure,” but how bad is it really? Across the country, the percentage of “unacceptable” miles of road has increased by about 2 percentage points over the last 20 years, from 16.2% to 18.3%, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). In 2022, the most recent year of available data, that equates to about 144,000 miles of unacceptably rough roads—more than the total miles of all roads in California, Texas and Florida combined.But what does that all mean for your personal experience driving? Well, it largely depends on where you live. As with most issues, road quality can vary drastically from state to state, so we crunched the numbers to see for ourselves how states stack up against one another.Five states with the worst road qualityThe five states on this list have some room to approve, to say the least. Across the five states in this list, just over a third of all roads are considered unacceptably rough by the BTS.1. HawaiiIn 2022, the Aloha state had the highest percentage of unacceptable miles of any state in the country, about 39%. Since 2002, the share of unacceptable roads has increased 13 percentage points—nearly six times worse than the national average. If you ever have the privilege of driving along one of Hawaii’s bumpy roads, hopefully you’ll be too distracted by the rest of the state’s beauty to notice the rough ride.2. Rhode IslandRhode Island has made improvements to its roads since a 2018 low, but the state still has a long way to go. In 2022, Rhode Island had the second-highest percentage of unacceptable miles of any state in the country, about 37%. Since 2002, the share of unacceptable roads has increased 20 percentage points—nearly nine times worse than the national average.3. New MexicoWhen people call New Mexico the “land of enchantment” they must not be talking about its roads. In 2022, New Mexico had the third-highest percentage of unacceptable miles of any state in the country, about 33%. Since 2002, the share of unacceptable roads has increased by about 16 percentage points—over six times worse than the national average.4. ConnecticutConnecticut Department of Transportation crews reconstruct a southbound Interstate 95 bridge on November 05, 2023 in Westport, Connecticut.John Moore/Getty ImagesConnecticut has made major improvements to its roads from a 2015 low, when over half of its roads were unacceptably rough. But, even after a decade of upgrades, the constitution state still ranks as one of the worst states for road quality in the country. In 2022, 33% of its roads were deemed unacceptable. Since 2002, the share of unacceptable roads has increased 11 percentage points—over four times worse than the national average.5. Mississippi30 years ago, Mississippi’s roads were not only not bad, they were actually far better than the national average. But, decades of neglect have sent the quality of the state’s roads declining drastically. In 2022, Mississippi had the fifth-highest percentage of unacceptable miles of any state in the country, about 30%. Since 2002, the share of unacceptable roads has increased by about 9 percentage points—over three times worse than the national average.Five states with the best road qualityIf you’re looking for some buttery-smooth—or at least reasonably flat—roads, these states have them in abundance. Across the five states in this list, less than 5% of all roads are considered unacceptably rough by the BTS.1. AlabamaHere it is, the envy of drivers the country over: Alabama. In 2022, less than 2% of Alabama’s roads were considered unacceptably rough. Across the years, Alabama has prioritized its road quality, maintaining some of the best quality roads of any state for decades. Since 2002, the percentage of unacceptable roads in Alabama has increased by just 0.2 points—about 10 times less than the national average.2. IndianaThe Hoosier state has been on a tear over recent years. As recently as 2019, nearly a quarter of Indiana’s roads were considered unacceptably rough. By 2022, that number shrank to just 3%, earning Indiana its spot as the second-best state in the country for road quality. Since 2002, the percentage of unacceptable roads in Indiana has decreased by about 7 points—a rare case of roadway infrastructure actually improving in recent decades.3. WyomingThe equality state clearly has no tolerance for bad roads (bad joke, so sorry). In 2022, Wyoming had the third-best roads of any state in the country, with just over 4% of its roads considered unacceptably rough. That figure is particularly high, but even at relatively low points, the state has maintained above-average road quality compared to the rest of the country. Since 2002, the percentage of unacceptable roads in the state has increased by about 3 points—a testament to the standard of road quality in Wyoming.4. KansasWelcome to Kansas highway sign on Interstate 70 headed east.UCG/Getty ImagesKansas’s roads have been above-average for decades, but in recent years they have become truly exceptional. In 2022, Kansas had the fourth-best roads of any state in the country, with just over 4% of its roads considered unacceptably rough. Since 2002, the percentage of unacceptable roads in Kansas has decreased by about 4 points.5. IdahoThe gem state truly lives up to its nickname when it comes to the quality of its roads. In 2022, less than 5% of Idaho’s roads were considered unacceptably rough. Since 2002, the percentage of unacceptable roads in Idaho has decreased by about 2 points.How do we measure road quality?We’ve been talking about “unacceptably rough” roads, but what exactly does that mean? When assessing road quality, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics uses something called the International Roughness Index (IRI), which measures how much a vehicle bounces over a given stretch of road. Roads with higher IRI scores are considered rougher, while those with lower scores are smoother. The threshold for an “unacceptable” road is set at an IRI of 170 inches per mile or greater.Final thoughtsThe stark contrast in road quality between states highlights the importance of infrastructure investment. Smooth roads in states like Alabama and Indiana reflect decades of upkeep, while rough roads in states like Hawaii and Rhode Island show the cost of neglect.Whether you’re cruising buttery roads or braving bumpy ones, road conditions are shaped by decisions made long ago. If your state didn’t rank well, take heart—investments in infrastructure are ongoing, and smoother drives may be ahead.",

The work is part of a $104 million project on the key northeast transportation corridor funded 90 percent by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress in 2021. From the total of $1.2 trillion allocated nationwide, Connecticut was given $5.38 billion for infrastructure projects to be used over 5 years. The Westport construction was the second major part of the project, where both northbound and southbound sections of bridge were slid into place over two weekends in order to reduce impact to motorists on I-95, one of the oldest and busiest interstate highways in the United States.
