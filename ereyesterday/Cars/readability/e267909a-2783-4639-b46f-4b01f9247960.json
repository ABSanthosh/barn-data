  "description": "This 2004 Saab 9-5 Arc wagon was modified when it was new by Scandinavian Airport and Road Systems (SARSYS-ASFT) with airport runway friction-testing equipment before it was delivered to and used by the Salt Lake City International Airport until 2024. Finished in yellow over charcoal leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four linked with a five-speed Sentronic automatic transaxle. Equipment includes 16\" Alloy wheels, disc brakes, automatic climate control, heated power-adjustable front seats, a roof light bar, roof rails, a rear water tank, a retractable rear wheel, and additional equipment to test and record runway surface conditions. The car was purchased and relocated to Illinois by the seller in October 2024, and it now has 29k miles. This 9-5 wagon is now offered at no reserve with spare test wheels, operation manuals, a 2022 calibration certificate, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title in the seller's name.",

Finished in yellow over charcoal leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four linked with a five-speed Sentronic automatic transaxle. Equipment includes 16″ Alloy wheels, disc brakes, automatic climate control, heated power-adjustable front seats, a roof light bar, roof rails, a rear water tank, a retractable rear wheel, and additional equipment to test and record runway surface conditions. The car was purchased and relocated to Illinois by the seller in October 2024, and it now has 29k miles. This 9-5 wagon is now offered at no reserve with spare test wheels, operation manuals, a 2022 calibration certificate, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title in the seller’s name. Saab began working with the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) in the 1970s to integrate standardized friction-testing equipment for paved surfaces in their vehicles, and the friction-testing division of the company was sold to ASFT following General Motors’ partial acquisition of Saab in 1989. This wagon was finished in Polar White (283) from the factory and was subsequently painted in the current shade of yellow when it was equipped with friction-testing gear. Exterior details include a roof light bar, roof rails, fog lights, heated and power-adjustable side mirrors, a rear wiper, and an equipment mount below the rear bumper. A water port was installed on the roof during the modifications. An access hole is present behind the left-rear wheel, there is a ding on the left-rear wheel arch, and there is a crack below the right fog light. The 16″ five spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 215/55 Cooper Cs5 Ultra tires. The car is equipped with ventilated front and solid rear disc brakes. The cabin features heated power-adjustable front seats upholstered in charcoal leather, and interior appointments include automatic climate control, wood veneer dashboard and center console trim, and Saab-branded floor mats. Retrofitted equipment includes readouts for ambient and surface temperatures, pressure, water delivery controls, a central control screen, and a printer for test results. The floor of the spare tire well has been partially removed to accommodate a retractable arm with a friction testing wheel, and further revisions to the interior include a water tank in the place of the rear seats, a water pump, and a hand-held calibration tool. Blemishes are noted on the rear headliner. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, boost pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 29k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four was factory rated at 220 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque, which is routed to the front wheels through a five-speed Sentronic automatic transaxle. An oil change was performed under current ownership. Additional photos of the test wheel and the underside condition are presented in the gallery below. Manufacturer’s literature, two keys, SARSYS operation manuals, and spare test wheels are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
