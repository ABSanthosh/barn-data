  "text": "Based on the GT Speed, this Continental was made for the Bentley Boys June 10, 2025 at 20:35 by Michael Gauthier A hardcore version of the Bentley Continental GT Speed has been spied near the Nürburgring. The mysterious model features aerodynamic tweaks and could revive the Supersports moniker. Little is known about the car, but it presumably has more power than the 771 hp GT Speed. Bentley might be an ultra-luxury brand, but they have a racing pedigree and they’re not afraid to dust it off from time to time. It appears that time has come once again as spy photographers have snapped a hardcore prototype, which could be a Continental GT Speed RS or Supersports. Looking like a matte black bad ass, the prototype follows in the footsteps of the regular Speed, but adopts canards and a massive rear spoiler. We can also see a unique four-tailpipe exhaust system, which replaces the traditional oval setup. More: New Bentley Continental GT Speed Goes PHEV With 771 HP And A Batur-Inspired Face They’re joined by black wheels that appear to be sourced from the regular model and presumably measure 22-inches. However, that could change by the time production commences. While the styling changes are minor, the upgrades are focused on performance. This suggests the mysterious model will slot above the Speed and be even more extreme. Baldauf We’ll likely learn more about the prototype in the coming months, but the regular Continental GT Speed has a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 engine that produces 591 hp (441 kW / 600 PS) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque. It’s joined by a plug-in hybrid system, which consists of a 25.9 kWh battery pack and a 188 hp (140 kW / 190 PS) electric motor. This gives the car a combined output of 771 hp (575 kW / 782 PS) and 738 lb-ft (1,000 Nm) of torque. It enables the all-wheel drive coupe to rocket from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.1 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 208 mph (335 km/h). The model also has a WLTP electric-only range of 50 miles (81 km). To put those numbers into perspective, the 2017-2018 Continental Supersports had a twin-turbo 6.0-liter W12 developing 700 hp (522 kW / 710 PS) and 750 lb-ft (1,017 Nm) of torque. It hit 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.4 seconds and topped out at 209 mph (336 km/h).",
