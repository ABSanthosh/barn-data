  "description": "This 1935 Packard Eight Series 1201 wears style 811 phaeton bodywork and is said to have spent 50 years with the same family in Ohio. It underwent a refurbishment in the 1970s before being purchased in 2013 by Packard collector Tom Crook, from whom the seller purchased the car in 2015. The 320ci straight-eight was rebuilt later that year, and the car subsequently won third-in-class at the 2022 Packards International at the San Marino Motor Classic, and participated in the 2023 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Finished in yellow over red leather upholstery, the car features a three-speed manual transmission, mechanical drum brakes, an adjustable ride-control suspension, red-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a cormorant radiator mascot, a driver-side spotlight, rear-hinged front doors, a tan soft top, a fold-down luggage rack, and a rear footrest. This Twelfth Series Packard is now offered with a copy of a letter from Raymond Dietrich discussing the construction of 1935 phaeton bodies, service records, car show awards, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

The 320ci straight-eight was rebuilt later that year, and the car subsequently won third-in-class at the 2022 Packards International at the San Marino Motor Classic, and participated in the 2023 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Finished in yellow over red leather upholstery, the car features a three-speed manual transmission, mechanical drum brakes, an adjustable ride-control suspension, red-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a cormorant radiator mascot, a driver-side spotlight, rear-hinged front doors, a tan soft top, a fold-down luggage rack, and a rear footrest. This Twelfth Series Packard is now offered with a copy of a letter from Raymond Dietrich discussing the construction of 1935 phaeton bodies, service records, car show awards, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The Series 1201 Eight was introduced in August 1934 and was offered in 10 body styles, with 4,781 Standard Eight examples produced for the model year. The phaeton bodywork on this example was repainted in its current yellow using lacquer paint in the 1970s, and it features a cormorant radiator mascot, a driver-side spotlight, running boards, a tan soft top, rear-hinged front doors, glass wind wings, red pinstriping, dual taillights, and a folding luggage rack. The windshield wipers do not work, and the seller notes areas of cracked and checked paintwork. Red-painted wire wheels wear chrome trim rings and Packard Eight-branded hubcaps, and they are mounted with 7.00–17 Firestone bias-ply wide-whitewall tires. Dual side-mount spares are stowed in body-color hard covers topped with mirrors in the front fenders. The Twelfth Series Eight featured a revised X-member frame with boxed side rails. Stopping power is provided by mechanically operated drums at all four wheels. The cabin features front and rear bench seats that were reupholstered in red leather during the 1970s refurbishment. Color-coordinated door and kick panels are fitted, while red carpets were installed under the seller’s ownership. Equipment includes dual gloveboxes, a robe bar, a rear footrest, and a fold-down rear armrest. The AM radio does not work. The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a painted woodgrain dash housing a bright instrument cluster. The 120-mph speedometer and clock do not work, and the five-digit odometer is stopped at 54k miles. Approximately 3,500 miles were added under the seller’s ownership, around 200 of which since the odometer stopped working. Total mileage is unknown. The 320ci straight-eight features nine main bearings and a Stromberg carburetor. Output was factory rated at 130 horsepower. The engine was rebuilt by Ernie Foster of Gardena, California, in 2015, and photos and invoices from the service are presented in the gallery. The radiator was re-cored in September 2023, and an oil change was last performed approximately 200 miles ago. The seller notes that the generator was rebuilt by Advanced Electrical Rebuilders, with an Autolite regulator having been installed. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission. The Series 1201 rode on a 134″ wheelbase and featured a suspension that incorporates front and rear leaf-sprung solid axles with double-acting hydraulic lever-arm shock absorbers that can be adjusted for firmness via the Ride Control knob under the dash.
