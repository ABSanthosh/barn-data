  "text": "Some cars have more than 30 speakers, but we want to hear from you whether high-end audio systems are worth the price 2 hours ago by Michael Gauthier Many vehicles offer premium audio systems as standalone options or part of higher-end trims. While some brands focus on speaker count, others prioritize sound quality in their systems. Cadillac offers up to 40 speakers in the 2025 Escalade, which tops the 19 in the base model. Long before screen sizes and digital displays took center stage, automakers wooed customers with premium audio systems. And while the tech has evolved, the allure of high-end sound is still very much alive today, with manufacturers cramming in speaker counts that would make a home theater blush. There’s no shortage of examples as the 2025 Cadillac Escalade offers three different setups including a standard 19-speaker AKG Studio Audio system. If that’s not enough, there’s a 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference system. That can increase to 40 speakers with the available Executive Second Row package, which adds headrest-mounted speakers in back. Read: Volvo Owners Find Fake ‘Bowers \u0026 VVilkins’ Speakers In Chinese Cars Aside from Cadillac, the Mercedes E 350 offers a $1,030 Burmester 4D surround sound system with 17 speakers. Furthermore, the Ford Mustang has 6-, 9-, and 12-speaker options with the latter being a B\u0026O sound system by Bang \u0026 Olufsen. While many automakers brag about their speaker counts, the team behind the 12-speaker Klipsch audio system in the Nissan Armada Platinum Reserve recently boasted about how much sound quality they got out of their relatively small speaker count. This wasn’t easy as the system took approximately two to three years to develop. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops That brings us to our question of the day, do you care about premium audio systems? That’s probably too simple of a question as there’s a fine line between good and bad systems with plenty of room between. More: 2025 Infiniti QX80 Will Be First Luxury SUV To Feature A Klipsch Audio System No one’s going to expect miracles from the Sentra’s four-speaker setup, but the six-speaker system should be good enough for most people. However, the model can also be equipped with an optional eight-speaker Bose premium audio system. It’s a bit like wine, there are a few decent options under $20 but you know what you’re getting. Stepping up to a higher price point should net you better results but, if you go even higher, is there a proportionate leap in quality? With all that being said, are you the type to shell out extra for a premium audio system, or do you think it’s all just marketing hype? Some people can’t live without top-notch sound, while others couldn’t care less as long as they can hear the GPS. Where do you fall on the spectrum?",
