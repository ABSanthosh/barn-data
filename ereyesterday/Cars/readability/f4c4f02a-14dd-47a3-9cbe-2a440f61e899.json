  "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.
