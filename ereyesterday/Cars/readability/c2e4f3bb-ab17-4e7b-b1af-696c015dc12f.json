  "description": "The Rynox Air GT gloves have been a compelling choice for urban riders seeking a balance between comfort, protection and affordability. Rynox has now updated them with some flexible rubber protection that covers the carpal bones for better abrasion resistance. While they remain the same overall, this new addition has driven up their price by Rs 700.  These gloves are crafted from perforated, soft, full-grain leather with additional leather panels in high-abrasion zones. They are designed to offer both durability and ventilation, making them pretty usable in our tropical climate. Flexible armour doesn’t compromise overall comfort. While Rynox says the fingers are pre-curved and don’t require any wear-in, these gloves felt a bit too rigid initially, and I found that they do require a bit of breaking in. After this, they feel quite comfortable, thanks partly to the accordion stretch panels, allowing for easier hand movements. The built-in touchscreen-compatible fingertips work well enough but don’t allow for very precise inputs due to the rounded edges on the fingertips, although this holds true for most gloves. Despite the leather construction these gloves have decent ventilation. The cuff has a small elastic panel that allows for easier ingress and egress of your hand. This, paired with the adjuster on the wrist, ensures a tight yet comfortable fit. In terms of protection, these gloves are CE certified to the EN 13594:2015 standard and offer TPU protectors with HD foam backing on the knuckles, HD foam inserts on the fingertips and joints and the newly added protection for the carpus bones.  The only change is the added protection on the palm. Despite our summer heat, these gloves feel decently ventilated and don’t add any discomfort to my commutes or rides. However, it’s worth noting that they are not waterproof, making them less ideal for the monsoons. While these gloves may not cater to high-speed touring or track days, they excel in city environments and short weekend getaways. Available in four colours, the Air GT are a solid pair for any beginner rider looking for nice gloves without breaking the bank.
