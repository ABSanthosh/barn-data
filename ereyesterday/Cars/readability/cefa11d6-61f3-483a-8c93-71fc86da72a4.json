Finished in Rosso Corsa with a black soft top over tan Connolly leather, the car is powered by a 3.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a gated six-speed manual transaxle, and it has a limited-slip differential, 18″ magnesium wheels, pop-up headlights, automatic climate control, and an Alpine head unit and CD changer. An engine-out belt service was completed in 2023, and the clutch hydraulic system was serviced along with the air conditioning in 2024. This F355 Spider shows 42k miles and is offered with a tool kit, a soft top boot, fitted luggage, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Idaho title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa, and styling elements include a power-operated black convertible top as well as pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. The front bumper cover was repaired and repainted in July 2023. Blemishes around the vehicle are pictured in close-up photos shown in the gallery below. The 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. Ferrari-branded brake calipers are mounted over ventilated discs at each corner. The sport seats are trimmed in Tan Connolly leather that extends to the center console, door panel inserts, and lower dashboard. Other appointments include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, and drilled aluminum pedals. K40 radar detection equipment is noted, and the sound system has an Audison amplifier as well as an Alpine CD changer and head unit. Sticky buttons are said to have been refinished under previous ownership, and the air conditioning system was repaired in February 2024. Broken vents, corrosion on the driver-side door jamb, and some areas of shrunken leather are reported flaws. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. Ancillary instruments in the center stack include an analog clock and gauges for fuel level and oil temperature. The alarm and airbag alerts remain illuminated. The six-digit odometer shows 42k miles, ~100 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out belt service was completed in July 2023, and the battery was replaced in February 2024. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The primary clutch cylinder and clutch pump were replaced in March 2024. A tool kit, a soft top boot and storage bag, and a leather suitcase are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
