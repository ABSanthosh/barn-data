  "description": "Mahindra Racing secured its second podium finish of the 2025 Formula E season, with Edoardo Mortara finishing second at the Jakarta E-Prix. Mortara narrowly missed out on victory to Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, who scored his first-ever Formula E win. Andretti’s Nico Mueller completed the podium in third place. The race delivered plenty of drama, with a dusty track described by some drivers as a “wet race without water”. Ticktum wins, 0.371 sec ahead of Mortara Mueller on podium for Andretti Rowland extends Formula E championship lead Ticktum scores first Formula E win Cupra Kiro’s first Formula E win since Season 1 Starting from fifth on the grid, Ticktum initially dropped down the order after the first round of Attack Mode. But he clawed his way up the field and soon found himself in contention for victory after Jake Dennis and Nyck de Vries’ retirements. He had to fend off Mortara in the closing laps, though. Ticktum was helped by the timing of the final Full Course Yellow, which came just as Mortara took his final Attack Mode activation, leaving the Mahindra driver unable to use the power boost and four-wheel drive that came with it. Ticktum successfully kept Mortara at bay to secure his first Formula E win after 60 race starts in the championship. This is also Cupra Kiro’s first race win since the inaugural 2014-15 season, when the team competed under the name NEXTEV. Addressing the media after the race, Ticktum said, “I’ve got a lot of hate from people over the years – people with short-term memory issues forgetting that I’ve won a fair few things on my way up the ladder.” “I think the first three seasons in Formula E were very tough. It was difficult to remain motivated, but this season is pretty much as good as I could have hoped for,” he added. “We definitely struggled at the start; hit the ground running to adapt to all the new systems and the new powertrain, and the team has done a remarkable job. Specially since Miami, I think the rate of improvement has been very good.” Mahindra on podium at Jakarta De Vries out of race after contact with Dennis The Jakarta E-Prix started off as a strong round for Mahindra, with both of its drivers making it through to the duels in qualifying. Mortara’s P2 finish hands the team it’s second podium result of the season so far, following de Vries’ second-place finish at Monaco. However, it was bitter-sweet result for Mortara. While he did secure his best result of the season so far, he also admitted he was disappointed for the team. “I think we should have got both cars on the podium,” he said. “The race was lucky and unlucky [for me]. For the second Attack Mode, yes I was in front of Dan (Ticktum) and I think if we had no interruptions, probably we had a good chance of finishing in front of him. But we’re also very lucky that the good guys in front of us stopped.” De Vries, meanwhile, was locked in battle for victory with Jake Dennis early on. On lap 23, the Mahindra driver pulled alongside Dennis and was ahead by just a whisker, but moved to the right and made contact with Dennis’ Andretti car in the process. Stewards handed de Vries a 10-second penalty for the incident, but none of it would matter with both Dennis and de Vries dropping out. Dennis ended up P17 after an issue with releasing the Full Course Yellow limiter, while de Vries retired due to a technical issue. Mortara’s podium result was enough for Mahindra to hold on to fifth place in the teams’ championship, just six points behind McLaren. Reflecting on the race, Mahindra Racing team principal Frederic Bertrand said, “For us it was a super well-executed race on Edo’s [Mortara] side for sure. Also on Nyck’s side, [but there was a] small mistake at one moment and a small issue for him.” He added, “It was a proud moment for us to see two Mahindra’s leading the race; maybe it could have been a one-two at the end, to be honest. But we are super happy and proud because this is our second podium – first podium for Edo, which should give him an additional level of confidence for Berlin.” 2025 Formula E championship standings Nissan, Oliver Rowland extend lead Mueller ended up finishing third, gaining 10 places from his starting position. Antonio Felix da Costa finished fourth, followed by Nick Cassidy and the McLaren duo of Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird. Envision Racing teammates Sebastian Buemi and Robin Frijns finished P8 and P9, respectively. After a disappointing qualifying performance, championship leader Oliver Rowland made some good progress in the race. But he was handed a 5-second penalty for causing a collision with Max Guenther, dropping him to 10th place. Despite scoring just one point at Jakarta, Rowland has managed to extend his championship lead to 69 points over Pascal Wehrlein, who finished just outside the top 10 in P11. Da Costa is third overall, just three points behind his Porsche teammate. Formula E will next head to Berlin for another double-header round on July 12-13. 2025 Jakarta E Prix results 2025 Jakarta E-Prix resultsPosDriverTeam1Dan TicktumCupra Kiro2Edoardo MortaraMahindra Racing3Nico MuellerAndretti Formula E4Antonio Felix da CostaPorsche5Nick CassidyJaguar6Taylor BarnardMcLaren7Sam BirdMcLaren8Sebastien BuemiEnvision Racing9Robin FrijnsEnvision Racing10Oliver RowlandNissan11Pascal WehrleinPorsche12Mitch EvansJaguar13Lucas di GrassiLola Yamaha ABT14Norman NatoNissan15Jean-Eric VergneDS Penske16David BeckmannCupra Kiro17Jake DennisAndretti18Zane MaloneyLola Yamaha ABTNCNyck de VriesMahindra RacingNCStoffel VandoorneMaseratiNCJake HughesMaserati NCMax GuentherDS Penske Also see: 2025 Formula E: Maserati, Nissan win Tokyo E-Prix Mahindra Racing: New Formula E car designed for performance, not cost",
