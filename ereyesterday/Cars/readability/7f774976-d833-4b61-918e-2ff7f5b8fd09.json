  "description": "In what is being billed as Hyundai India’s most aggressive product launch plan, the country’s second-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer is gearing up for 26 launches over the next 5 fiscal years. This ambitious rollout includes 20 internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and 6 electric vehicles (EVs), comprising a mix of all-new models, full model changes, and product enhancements to its current portfolio. Hyundai’s new model offensive is in response to a recent dip in market share New Venue, Creta, Creta Electric facelift, and a new hybrid SUV are in the pipeline Hyundai new model plan and strategy Hyundai India market share is under pressure from Tata and Mahindra “We are excited to announce that we will be launching 26 products by FY2030, including a mix of new models, full model changes, and product enhancements – comprising 20 ICE vehicles and 6 EVs. Additionally, we shall be introducing new eco-friendly powertrains like hybrids. These aggressive and strategic launch plans demonstrate our strong commitment to innovation, the Indian market, and delivering sustained value to our customers,” Hyundai Motor India MD \u0026 CEO Unsoo Kim told reporters on Friday. According to Hyundai’s investor presentation, this product offensive aims to reinforce the company’s brand appeal, deepen customer engagement, and arrest the recent dip in market share. While Hyundai continues to hold the No. 2 position, behind Maruti Suzuki, its lead over Tata Motors is narrowing, and the Korean brand is also facing mounting pressure from Mahindra. Both homegrown rivals have rapidly gained ground in India’s fast-evolving passenger vehicle landscape, particularly in the SUV and EV segments. New Hyundai models include hybrids Next-gen Venue, all-new Creta, new hybrid SUV above Alcazar among launches The scale and timing of the upcoming launches reflect Hyundai’s dual-play strategy – continuing to back its robust ICE portfolio while also preparing to capitalise on India’s accelerating shift toward electrification. The latter includes having EVs and hybrids, with Hyundai Motor India COO, Tarun Garg, also confirming, “We are bringing in strong hybrids for sure. We would not like to comment beyond that.” This launch blitz will span multiple segments and price points, reaffirming Hyundai’s commitment to the Indian market, which remains one of its largest global operations. Among the 26 launches will be the next-gen Hyundai Venue, the third-gen Creta, a mid-cycle refresh for the Creta Electric, a new hybrid SUV positioned between the Alcazar and Tucson, and possibly, a facelift for the Ioniq 5. Industry experts say the success of this product onslaught will be critical in determining whether Hyundai can sustain its leadership in key segments, particularly as competition becomes fiercer and consumer preferences evolve.
