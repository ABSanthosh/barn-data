But ask any seasoned rider who’s gone down at speed—your hands are often the first things to hit the pavement. So choosing the right motorcycle gloves isn’t just about comfort or aesthetics. Motorcycle gloves have evolved far beyond stitched leather and knuckle padding. Today’s market is awash with everything from featherweight motocross mitts to carbon-laced gauntlets pulled straight from the MotoGP paddock. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the options, you’re not alone. Why Gloves Matter Let’s start with the basics. Your hands are vulnerable, and not just in a crash. Long hours on the bars expose them to wind, sun, vibration and rain. Gloves provide a buffer between your skin and the elements, and when designed well, they’ll do it without numbing your grip or feeling like a hot oven mitt. More importantly, gloves are a key piece of your protective kit. They offer abrasion resistance, impact protection, and in high-performance models, armor and retention systems designed to keep the glove on your hand in a slide. Simply put, if you’ve invested in a quality helmet and jacket, your gloves should be part of the same conversation. Abrasion Resistance This is the baseline. Good gloves use materials that won’t shred the moment they meet tarmac. Cowhide is still a favorite, though deer and goatskin offer excellent dexterity with slightly less bulk. High-denier textiles like Cordura or Kevlar reinforcements often show up in adventure and sport-touring gloves, especially where ventilation is key. Armor and Padding Knuckle armor is almost standard at this point, ranging from molded plastic and carbon fiber to flexible D3O. Palm sliders—often overlooked—can reduce the risk of a scaphoid fracture by letting your hand slide rather than catch during a fall. Ditto for wrist protectors. Ideally, you’d be equipped with all these features in the event of a worst-case scenario, but they aren’t always practical for casual riding. Closure Systems Hook-and-loop closures (read: Velcro) are the norm, but you’ll find more robust wrist cinches and gauntlet straps on track-oriented gloves. These not only secure the glove but also ensure it won’t fly off if things go sideways. CE Ratings: How to Read the Label Sliders, stitching and TPU protectors are the marks of defense for motorcycle mitts, but who judges their effectiveness? While multiple systems are in use for helmets, the world has more or less adopted the European CE rating system for gloves. Under EN 13594, motorcycle gloves are tested and certified for things like abrasion resistance, knuckle impact absorption, seam strength, tear resistance and how well the glove stays in place during a crash. You’ll often see gloves rated as Level 1 or Level 2, with Level 2 being the higher spec. To earn CE Level 1, a glove must withstand at least 4 seconds of abrasion in high-risk zones (like the palm and outer edge) and absorb a modest amount of impact energy at the knuckles. Level 2 raises the bar, requiring around 8 seconds of abrasion resistance and far better impact absorption. So, if that’s the standard, why aren’t all gloves CE-rated? There are plenty of gloves on the market that are not CE-rated, and in most cases, it’s because the manufacturer is unwilling to incur the expenses and wait time it takes to get a product tested. In a side-by-side comparison, the features of a CE-rated glove will be nearly identical to a similar, un-rated glove, but the CE glove is being produced on a larger scale, where the investment for testing was deemed worthwhile. Match Your Glove to Your Ride 1. Motocross and Off-Road Gloves Designed for lightweight performance and maximum airflow, MX gloves are the closest thing to a second skin. Usually made from breathable synthetics with silicone grip patches, they offer next to no impact protection. That’s not a design flaw; it’s a reflection of the riding style, since off-road spills usually involve softer landings and lower speeds, where flexibility and control outweigh armor. Motocross gloves are the most prominent offerings on the market, since they’re affordable to manufacture and handy for all sorts of off-road recreation. Brands like FOX Racing, Troy Lee Designs and numerous others tailor their offerings for MX riding specifically, but for the casual enthusiast, we like Biltwell’s Moto Gloves. They’re built tougher than some of the more racy offerings on the market, and include mindful everyday touches like touchscreen fingertips and expansion joints. Best for: Dirt bikes, trail riding, enduro or dual-sport rides that spend more time off-pavement. 2. Short-Cuff Street Gloves This is the bread-and-butter category for urban riders, weekend warriors and commuters. Short-cuff gloves strike a balance between comfort, protection and convenience. They’re easy to slip on and off, pair well with jackets that have snug wrist closures and come in both leather and textile variations. Comfortable and convenient for everyday use, the best short-cuff gloves disappear on your hands but still show up when it counts. For the last several months, we’ve been designing and testing the new El Chapo short-cuff bobber gloves (from yours truly), which we find to be the perfect companion for everyday riding. They’re made from sturdy, genuine cowhide leather to ensure they’ll stand up to a slide, and built-in hard-shell protectors will keep your knuckles from getting dusted. With expansion joints, touchscreen-compatible fingertips and double-stitch panels in heavy wear areas, we’re sure the El Chapo glove will be your new go-to. Best for: Cafe racers, roadsters, city riding and short touring hops. 3. Gauntlet and Race Gloves Track-day veterans and aggressive street riders know the value of full-coverage gauntlet gloves. These are built for serious protection, with extended cuffs that overlap your jacket sleeves, double closures, hard armor and reinforced seams. A quick glance at the Jerez 4 gloves from REV’IT reveals all the tech that goes into a premium, track-designed glove. This kangaroo leather gauntlet is contoured to the natural shape of your hand and has built-in, multi-layer knuckle protection. TPU sliders on the palms buy your hand time in a slide, and finger bridges between the pinky and ring finger to prevent ‘finger roll’ during a crash. Protection extends up into the wrist, and the Velcro closure is beefy, ensuring the glove stays in place if it hits the fan. Yes, they’re overkill for a grocery run. But if you’re chasing apexes or logging serious miles at speed, they’re worth every cent. Best for: Track days, fast road riding and aggressive touring. One Size Doesn’t Fit All You wouldn’t wear motocross boots on a café racer, so don’t expect one pair of gloves to cover every kind of ride. Most riders find themselves rotating between at least two pairs—one for warm weather and quick jaunts, and another for longer or more spirited rides. When choosing gloves, try them on with your regular riding jacket. Flex your hands on a bar or grip. Can you reach the controls easily? Do the seams press into your palms? Are your fingertips swimming? A glove that fits well will feel like an extension of your hand, not an obstacle. Gloves are personal, and they should be. They’re your connection to the machine, the elements, and, sometimes, the asphalt. Invest in good ones. Take care of them. Replace them when they’re worn. And most importantly, wear them—every ride, every time. Because when you’re sliding across the pavement, the last thing you want to think is: “I should’ve worn better gloves.” Gloves featured in this guide include: Bike EXIF El Chapo Short-Cuff, Biltwell MOTO, Goldtop Silk-Lined Predator \u0026 Quilted Cafe Racer and REV’IT Jerez 4.",

In a side-by-side comparison, the features of a CE-rated glove will be nearly identical to a similar, un-rated glove, but the CE glove is being produced on a larger scale, where the investment for testing was deemed worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-745x498.jpg\" alt=\"Biltwell Moto Gloves\" width=\"745\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-745x498.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-569x380.jpg 569w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-720x481.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-275x184.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/motorcycle-glove-guide-1.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMatch Your Glove to Your Ride\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1.
