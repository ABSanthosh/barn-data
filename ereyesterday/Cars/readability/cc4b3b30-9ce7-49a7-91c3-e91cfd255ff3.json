The car is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over Champagne leather. Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, a power-operated sunroof, and air conditioning. This Carrera coupe shows 107k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Gruppe P collection with the owner's manual, partial service records, and a clean Massachusetts title.",

The car is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over Champagne leather. Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, a power-operated sunroof, and air conditioning. This Carrera coupe shows 107k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Gruppe P collection with the owner’s manual, partial service records, and a clean Massachusetts title. The car is finished in black and features a power-operated sunroof, a rear spoiler, integrated fog lights, and heated power-adjustable side mirrors. Paint meter readings are provided in the gallery. The 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels were refinished and mounted with Michelin Pilot Exalto tires in 2025. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The cabin features front seats upholstered in Champagne leather, and amenities include air conditioning and power windows. The seller notes that the driver’s front seat height adjustment switch needs to be replaced and the footwell blower motor fans are inoperative. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 107k miles, approximately 24k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.2-liter M930/21 flat-six was factory rated at 202 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Work in February 2025 carried out by German Performance Service of Brighton, Massachusetts included performing a valve adjustment and oil change, installing a Steve Wong ECU chip, and replacing the DME relay, crank position sensor, oil lines, valve cover gaskets, and rear crankshaft oil seal. The valve seals need to be replaced per the selling dealer. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch and cable were replaced in February 2025. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. Interested to see what Car and Driver thought about the 911 Carrera when it was new? Click here to check out their February 1984 Road Test.
