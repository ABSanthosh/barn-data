Finished in F8 Green over Sepia Laguna leather upholstery, the car is further equipped with a limited-slip differential, the Driver Convenience Group, the Customer Preferred Package 25C, Brembo brake calipers, a competition suspension, 20″ Devil’s Rim Brass Monkey wheels, HID Air-Catcher headlamps, widebody fenders, heated and ventilated front seats, a Harman Kardon sound system, and a Uconnect infotainment system with navigation. This Hellcat Widebody Last Call was purchased new by the owner and is now offered in Kentucky on dealer consignment with black and red keys, a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in F8 Green with satin black front and rear spoilers. Additional details include HID Air-Catcher headlamps, widebody fenders, an aluminum hood with dual air scoops, Hellcat fender badges, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. The 20″ Devil’s Rim Brass Monkey wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. The car is equipped with a Widebody competition suspension system with adaptive dampers. Braking is handled by black-finished six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo calipers. The heated and ventilated front seats are upholstered in Sepia Laguna leather with matching seatbelts and embossed Hellcat logos on the front backrests. Amenities include driver-seat power adjustability, a folding rear seat, keyless entry, push-button start, a Uconnect infotainment system, navigation, a Harman Kardon sound system, engine-turned accents, bright pedals, cruise control, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a red 200-mph speedometer and 7k-rpm tachometer along with a configurable digital display. The digital odometer indicates 69 miles. The supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 produced 717 horsepower and 656 lb-ft of torque when new and is equipped with aluminum cylinder heads and a forged-steel crankshaft, connecting rods, and pistons. A “Last Call” plaque is affixed under the hood near the driver-side headlight. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Dan Cummins Dodge of Paris, Kentucky, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total price of $92,241.
