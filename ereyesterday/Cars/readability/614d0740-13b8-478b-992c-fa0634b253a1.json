  "description": "It was undoubtedly the finest collection of classic and vintage Mercedes-Benz cars ever seen in India. What made it even better for those present at the start or waiting along the route was that spectators could see, hear, and smell these cars as they drove by. The 11th edition of the Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Rally (MBCCR), organised by Autocar India, saw 95 of Merc’s finest heritage cars lined up and displayed on the lawns of the Taj Lands End in Bandra, Mumbai, with 60 of these seen for the first time at the rally. Significant Mercedes Benz cars from every era were on display A total of 95 Mercedes-Benz cars were part of the line-up Focus was on designer Bruno Sacco and the iconic character he gave to the cars The rally was flagged off by Mumbai BJP president and MLA Ashish Shelar as well as Mercedes-Benz India MD and CEO Santosh Iyer. It wound its way from the Taj Lands End in Bandra, past the sea link, and on to Worli and South Mumbai, thrilling the crowds gathered to witness Mercedes' heritage cars driving by. The event was attended by Mumbai BJP president and MLA Ashish Shelar.  First held in 2014, MBCCR has grown to become not only India's but also one of the world’s premier automotive events. Even more importantly, it can be credited with helping spark the huge vintage and classic Mercedes-Benz restoration movement we see in India today. “This year, we have several points of focus for the MBCCR, and we have a record number of entries coming in from outstation, some from as far away as Kerala and Goa,” said rally curator Perseus Bandrawalla. “Not only is this a tribute to the faith owners have in their at least 20- or 30-year-old cars, but it also shows us how big this event has become.” And this, despite the three showcase events held by Mercedes-Benz India and Autocar India for the first time – one each in Cochin, Goa, and Chennai – is where 95 cars were displayed. “MBCCR is a museum on wheels, showcasing cars right from the world’s first automobile; the 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen (replica), to the state-of-the-art modern classic; the SLS AMG with its iconic gullwing doors. You can practically see the evolution of automobiles over the last 130 years,” added Bandrawalla.  This year's rally saw the participation of 95 vintage and classic Mercedes Benz models.  The stars of the show this year were the Kompressor or supercharged cars from the 1920s and 1930s. These included the 500k, 540k, and the 630k. The supercharged engines gave these cars an advantage in terms of performance, with the 500K and 540K powered by straight eights. Both cars also have very interesting origins; while the 540K, which belongs to the Pranlal Bhogilal collection, came from the state of Jawhar, Hormusji Cama’s 500K is said to have come from the Kingdom of Nepal. The cars are also simply gorgeous to look at, with their big, flowing fenders, pointed Mercedes radiators, and attractive dashboards. The third car, Yashvardhan Ruia’s 1929 630K, is an earlier six-cylinder model that was formerly part of the state of Tikari. When you see it standing alongside the other two, you realise just how tall the radiator grille is and how much more regal it looks compared to the two lower, sportier cars. The 500k with its supercharged 5.0-litre engine rolling down South Mumbai's streets in all its glory.  This year, the MBCCR also celebrated the design genius of Mercedes designer Bruno Sacco. His robust yet restrained sense of style, the way he made all his designs look like they were crafted from a solid block, and his famous detailing; big bold surfaces with chamfered edges and an almost geometric perfection and progression. Also celebrated this year was the 40 years of the legendary W124, the Merc that started it all in India. I still remember when and where I saw my first W124 in the flesh. And it wasn’t just Sacco’s block-like design that stood head and shoulders above; it was the manner in which the cabin was designed and especially put together. In fact, the whole car gave off a solid and robust vibe that was – and is – so pleasing. And it was great to see all the cars – the coupe, convertible, the limo, and the estate – lined up together. MBCCR celebrated 40 years of the W124 which was the Merc that started it all in India. Another special class of Mercedes-Benz showcased was the elite Super Limousine Class, the ultra-long wheelbase model designed for royalty and dignitaries. As the name suggests, there’s a long list of classics to look out for, including the Grosser, the 600 Pullman, the Nurburg, the 300 Adenauer, and the W126 ‘1000’ SEL. What also drew plenty of attention was the Tribute Class, featuring cars that inspired their owners to create tribute replicas of the originals, including a 190E EVO II Tribute, a W124 Hammer replica, and a few surprises, one of which was a W123 AMG Tribute. And finally, the Mile Munchers Class, a special shout-out to the robust reliability of German engineering. Featuring cars driven all the way to Mumbai for the rally from the far corners of the country, these include cars that have made their way here from Lucknow, Rajkot, Goa, and Kochi, such as the V123 300D Limousine, a W123, W111, and many more. Every classic generation of the E-Class was on display at MBCCR 2024. The rally drew the most accomplished vintage and classic car collectors from across the country, each of whom participated with cars from their collections. These included publisher Viveck Goenka, industrialist Yohan Poonawalla, Himanshu Sinh of Gondal, Pratapsinh Gaekwad, and Rajiv Kehr. The line-up this year also included a specially liveried W123 from Pratapsinh Gaekwad’s garage, Yohan Poonawalla’s 190SL that originally belonged to Maharani Gayatri Devi, and the 300Sc Roadster from the Bhogilal collection, which is 1 of 51 ever produced. This particular car originally belonged to the Sikkim royal family. It was then bought by the late Pranlal Bhogilal in the late 1960's. This car was one of the first cars in the world to run on fuel injection.  A rare 170V cabriolet-limousine crusing down Bandra after the flag off. Among the star cars that stood out was the Nürburg, or the W08, with its inline 8-cylinder engine developed by Ferdinand Porsche. This particular 1929 example with a tourer body, owned by Mumbai's Yashwardhan Ruia, is one of the few and best examples of the Nürburg in the world. Another stunner was the pillarless and stately 300D Adenauer, or W189, from the 1950s, belonging to Abbas Jasdanwalla. Named after Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, the rally had around half a dozen cars of this type. Also present was the 230SL, or the W113 Pagoda belonging to Huzaifah Bagasrawala. It has been the class winner at the 21 Gun Salute Concours in 2023. Also present at the rally were half a dozen SLs, in all shapes and sizes, along with Viveck Goenka’s 600 Grosser limo. Santosh Iyer, MD \u0026 CEO of Mercedes-Benz India had this to say about the rally’s 11th edition, “We are thrilled to celebrate the 2024 edition of the Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Rally, a true celebration of automotive history, craftsmanship, and innovation. For over a decade, this event has become the highlight of Mumbai’s winter season. MBCCR continues to bridge the past, present, and future of automotive excellence. I am proud to see the legacy of Mercedes-Benz preserved through this vibrant community, and it is inspiring to witness the dedication of collectors and restorers who keep these timeless vehicles in pristine condition.” Hormazd Sorabjee, Editor of Autocar India said, “The Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Rally is the backbone of the classic car movement in India, giving rise to a new genre of classic car collectors and enthusiasts. Autocar India is proud to be associated with such a passionate community of classic car enthusiasts.”",
