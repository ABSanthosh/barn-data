This 992.1 4S coupe is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The car is finished in GT Silver Metallic (M7Z), and exterior equipment includes a sunroof, LED headlights, fog lights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and front and rear parking sensors. The rear spoiler was repaired in January 2024. The 20″ and 21″ RS Spyder Design wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Two tires were replaced in November 2023. Standard equipment on the Carrera 4S includes a Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) that features a 10mm lower ride height. Braking is handled by red-finished Porsche-script calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable front sport seats feature Porsche-crest headrests and are trimmed in Bordeaux Red leather. Cabin amenities include a Burmester sound system, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a surround-view camera system, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel features paddle shifters and a drive-mode dial, and it fronts a central 8k-rpm tachometer with an inset speed readout that is flanked by twin LCD screens with configurable displays. A Sport Chrono stopwatch is mounted atop the center of the dash. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles. The twin-turbocharged 3.0L flat-six was factory-rated at 443 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle.
