  "description": "Ultraviolette Automotive has launched its F77 line-up in ten European countries, becoming the first Indian electric two-wheeler brand to establish a retail presence across these many nations in the region. The F77 Mach 2 and F77 SuperStreet will now be available in Germany, France, the UK, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. No mechanical changes to international spec models Both models will get the same 10.3kWh battery Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2, F77 SuperStreet international launch details This move highlights Ultraviolette’s aim to expand its footprint beyond India Both the F77 Mach 2 and the F77 SuperStreet will be powered by a 10.3kWh battery, producing a claimed peak output of 30kW and 100Nm of torque. While these models share their underpinnings, they differ in design and ergonomics. Both motorcycles will be equipped with electronic aids such as dual-channel ABS, traction control and 10 levels of regenerative braking.  Currently, the company is offering limited-period pricing for customers in Europe who pre-book by July 31. The F77 Mach 2 is available at 8,990 euros, while the F77 SuperStreet starts at 9,290 euros. After the aforementioned date, prices will be 9,990 euros and 10,390 euros, respectively. For reference, when converted into rupees, the F77 Mach 2 costs Rs 8.96 lakh and the F77 SuperStreet Rs 10.35 lakh in Europe. In India, both models’ prices start at Rs 2.99 lakh for the 7.1kWh variant and go up to Rs 3.99 lakh for the 10.3kWh variant. It remains to be seen how Ultraviolette’s offerings will be received in these mature two-wheeler markets, where consumer expectations around quality, dealer support and after-sales service are high.
