  "description": "This 1987 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa was the subject of a multi-year backdate build by Patrick Motorsports of Phoenix, Arizona, that was completed in 2022. Work included the installation of steel backdated bodywork, a 3.8L flat-six equipped with Bosch Motronic engine management, a custom exhaust system, and a replacement limited-slip differential. The G50 five-speed manual transaxle was also rebuilt, and the car was repainted Dolphin Grey and fitted with a KW G-body suspension kit, Boxster S-sourced disc brakes, 17\" Fuchs-style wheels, nickel-plated brightwork, LED headlights, bodyside stripe decals, and a green removable roof panel. Inside, the cabin houses green leather sport seats, a Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM) head unit, electric air conditioning, and keyless entry. A custom decklid with an integrated ducktail spoiler and front and rear green leather seats with Pepita cloth inserts were constructed during the build and are also included in the sale. This backdated Carrera Targa was acquired by the current owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Blaine, Washington, with build photos, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",

A custom decklid with an integrated ducktail spoiler and front and rear green leather seats with Pepita cloth inserts were constructed during the build and are also included in the sale. This backdated Carrera Targa was acquired by the current owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Blaine, Washington, with build photos, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title. The body was fitted with steel fender flares and longhood bodywork before it was repainted in the Porsche shade of Dolphin Grey during the build. Replacement glass and a 911S-style front bumper were also added at that time and the brightwork was nickel-plated. Additional alterations include LED headlights, side-view mirrors that exit through the door vent glass, Porsche Light Gray bodyside stripe decals, and a green targa roof panel. A color-matched ducktail decklid is shown installed below. The 17″ Fiske wheels are wrapped in Continental ExtremeContact Sport tires showing 2021 date codes. A KW G-body suspension kit featuring adjustable coilovers and sway bars was installed during the build, and stopping power is provided by Boxster-S-sourced cross-drilled discs at all four corners. The cabin features front sport seats and rear seating surfaces trimmed in green leather with bright ventilation grommets. Color-coordinated upholstery extends to the lower dashboard, center console, shift boot, and door panels, while gray square-weave carpeting lines the floors and black leather trims the dash. Equipment includes power windows, an electric air conditioning system, a Porsche Classic Communication Management head unit, subwoofers located beneath the front seats, cup holders, and an alarm system with keyless entry. An additional pair of heated front sport seats and matching rear seats trimmed in green leather with Pepita cloth inserts are included in the sale. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts backdated green-letter VDO instrumentation including a central 8k-rpm tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, a quartz clock, and combination gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 2,100 miles since completion of the build, approximately 50 of which were added under current ownership. The 3.8L flat-six was built by Patrick Motorsports in 2021. A Bosch Motronic engine management system was also installed at that time. The G50 five-speed manual transaxle was also overhauled during the build and a replacement limited-slip differential was installed. The exhaust system incorporates stainless-steel heat exchangers and a Dansk muffler. A collection of photos taken during the build is presented in the gallery.
