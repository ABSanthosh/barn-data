  "text": "A woman in a Ford Escape got a real reminder of nature’s power when a massive tree came crashing down on her SUV April 13, 2025 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers A tree fell on a Ford Escape in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and video captured the accident. The driver survived the incident and was the only person inside the crossover at the time. Driving is always a bit of a gamble. Most of the time, the danger comes from other motorists, your own split-second decisions, or unpredictable road conditions. Occasionally, a rogue animal might jump into the mix. But a woman in Pennsylvania recently faced a far more unusual threat: her parked vehicle was completely destroyed, and no other car was involved. While on her morning commute, a massive tree fell straight out of the forest and landed on her SUV. A security camera at a nearby gas station caught the entire incident. More: Man Damages 2,500-Year-Old Tree By Driving Nissan Armada Through It The fuel stop sits at the corner of Lenape Rd and Street Rd (yep, that’s its name – a very meta one if you ask us). At approximately 7:47 a.m. on Monday, a woman in a Ford Escape slowed to a stop behind traffic. Moments later, a massive tree in the woods to her right fell across the road. It broke into pieces and crumpled her SUV like it was a tin can. Thankfully, the driver, the sole occupant at the time, was unharmed and hopped out seconds after the incident. The aftermath is truly remarkable. The roof is completely caved in, which shows how devastating the impact wast. Most car roofs are capable of holding the weight of the car itself and then some. In this case, the force of the tree itself was simply overwhelming. While it’s unclear what exactly led to the tree fall, weather reports from Chester County warned residents about extreme phenomena. In the days leading up to the incident on April 7, the area experienced wind gusts of up to 20 mph, cold temperatures, and lots of rain. More: How Much Damage A Stray Tire Can Cause If It Hits Your Car Local news outlet WMUR says that at least one witness of the accident ‘heard cracking’ before the tree fell. May we all be as fortunate as the woman in that Escape. She might not have, um, escaped the accident (though neither the SUV nor its driver are to blame for it) but she did get out of it unscathed, and that’s what really matters as things could have been much worse.
