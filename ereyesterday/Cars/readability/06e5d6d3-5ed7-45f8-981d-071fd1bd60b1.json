  "text": "A motorcycle like the 1974 Ducati 750SS simply couldn’t be manufactured and sold today, and it’s a small miracle that it even passed in the 1970s. A barely homologated version of Ducati’s Desmo L-twin road racer, the 750SS was finicky, raw and probably illegal for road use in most places with its fiberglass fuel tank, Conti megaphones and unfiltered 40 mm Dell’Orto pumper carburetors. Just 401 examples were built from late 1973 into 1974, and these ‘green frame’ 750s are regarded as one of the most significant and desirable production Ducatis ever built. The story has been told time and time again, about how Paul Smart and Bruno Spaggiari accomplished a legendary 1-2 finish at the inaugural Imola 200 in 1972, catapulting Ducati to new heights globally. Still, it’s hard to overstate the significance of the victory, as Ducati’s brand recognition was regional at the time, known mostly for small single-cylinder motorcycles. Ducati’s L-twin engine was still quite new at the time, with engineer Fabio Taglioni having sketched his first L-twin just two years prior, and a victory on the world stage could open doors to lucrative performance segments for the brand. So it’s no surprise that the Ducati brass moved to capitalize on the victory by offering a street version of the celebrated Imola Desmos, and the resulting 750 Super Sport was arguably the fastest motorcycle available in 1974. Production started late in 1973, with the Super Sport being easily distinguishable for its Imola-inspired green and silver paintwork with heavy flake. A half-fairing with Smiths instruments was used in place of the racer’s full bodywork, but the scalloped fiberglass fuel tank was retained—complete with a clear zipper panel for indicating fuel level. Given its expedited production, the paint shades varied significantly between components. The same can’t be said about the 90-degree L-twin, though, as its heavily polished cases and Desmodromic valve gear made for a powerplant that was second to none. The early round-case 750s were based on the GT castings with Imola-style connecting rods and unfiltered 40 mm Dell’Orto pumper carburetors. Valve actuation was Ducati’s signature Desmo system, utilizing separate cam lobes and rocker arms to open and close the valves. Devoid of valve springs, Desmo twins didn’t experience valve float and could operate at 10,000 rpm. Ducati’s racing development influenced the chassis as well and made for a jarring, but uncompromising ride. The L-twin served as a stressed member, and no matter how hard it was pressed, it didn’t flex. Suspension was superb for the day, with a center-axle Marzocchi fork and 18-inch Borrani wheels providing sharp handling within the bike’s 59-inch wheelbase. A pair of 275 mm Scarab brakes were used up front, while a single Lockheed handled the rear. Equipped with a pair of minuscule fenders, Conti megaphones disguised as mufflers and laughable switchgear in the fairing, the 1974 Ducati 750SS had minimal road-going concessions, and required regular maintenance to maintain its Desmo valvetrain. Kept in tune, the 750 L-twin supplied torque in excess, and 70 hp at 9,000 rpm—good for over 140 mph in stock trim. That power came at a price though, right around $3,200, which would be over $20,000 in today’s money. While the road racing landscape shifted quickly for Ducati, there was no changing the fact that the 750 L-twin had solidified the brand as a household name, and as such, the green-frame 750SS has become incredibly sought after. The best examples can fetch over $200,000, but this unrestored 1974 Ducati 750SS selling at Mecum’s Las Vegas 2025 sale is a horse of a different color. What it lacks in shine, it makes up for in stark originality, and it’s somehow equally as fetching. Mecum’s details are depressingly slim, but the bike does appear to be in original unrestored condition, complete with the correct zip-in seat, Conti exhaust and other unique bits. The paint is original and in somewhat presentable condition, and while the fairing appears to be a slight mismatch, recall that they weren’t spot-on to begin with. The high-shoulder Borrani ‘5-slash’ wheels are correct for the machine, and if you look closely, that’s original-spec Metzler C7 rubber as well. The Smiths odometer shows just 5,114 km [3,177 miles], and the originality is there to support it. Once a prized possession of cannonball legend “Slow Joe” Gardella, it’s been consigned to Mecum since his passing and will be transferred to a new custodian at no reserve. This one’s unlikely to set a high mark for its hammer price, but it’s certainly one of the most fascinating and original 750 Super Sports left in existence. Source: Mecum",
