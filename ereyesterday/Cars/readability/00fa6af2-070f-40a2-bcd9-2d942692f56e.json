Finished in GT Silver Metallic over Black leather and Alcantara upholstery, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six linked with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes the Chrono package, 20″ and 21″ magnesium center-lock wheels, rear-axle steering, carbon-ceramic brakes, a front-axle lift system, and LED headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System along with a rear wing, navigation, Voice Control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a CD stereo, and a Bose sound system. This 991 GT2 RS has 700 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, owner’s manuals and accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the name of the seller’s trust. Weight savings were targeted with the GT2 RS program, and Porsche fitted multiple carbon-fiber components including the hood, front-fender vents, side intakes, side mirrors, and rear wing. The Weissach Package reduces weight further through the use of carbon fiber for the roof panel and the anti-roll bars. Downforce is increased with a larger rear wing, an underbody diffuser, and a deeper front fascia, while NACA ducts in the front trunk lid aid in brake cooling. This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and features LED headlights in black with washers and the Porsche Dynamic Light System along with fog lights, high-gloss black door handles, and carbon-fiber window-triangle trim. Center-locking 20″ and 21″ magnesium wheels are mounted with 265/35 front and 325/30 rear Dunlop Sport Maxx Race 2 tires produced in 2018. The car is equipped with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Stability Management, a front-axle lift system, and rear-axle steering. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes were standard on the GT2 RS and feature yellow calipers and cross-drilled rotors. The fixed-back seats are upholstered in Black leather and Alcantara with red stitching along with Weissach embroidery on the headrests. The dashboard, center console, and door panels are trimmed to match, and additional appointments include carbon-fiber trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation along with the Chrono package, Voice Control, and a Bose surround-sound system. The Alcantara-wrapped GT steering wheel is equipped with lightweight shift paddles, and it frames a central 8k-rpm tachometer, a 250-mph speedometer, a configurable TFT display, and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 700 miles, approximately 120 of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six was factory rated at 700 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Features include an intercooler spray system, a titanium exhaust system, and a carbon-fiber engine cover in addition to an optional extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. Included in the sale are a Porsche-branded helmet case, battery charger, and luggage in addition to other accessories and documents shown in the gallery. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche Woodland Hills in California, factory colors and equipment, and a total price of $341,130.
