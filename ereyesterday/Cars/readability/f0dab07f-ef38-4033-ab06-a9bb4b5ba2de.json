  "text": "Two drivers in New England managed to make a bad situation, namely racing on public roads, worse by crashing - and in plain view of law enforcement at that July 21, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers A video showing two reckless BMW drivers navigating traffic ends with a dramatic crash. It also happens right in front of an NYPD patrol car sitting on the side of the road. Videos like these have led to the arrest of associated individuals across the nation. A new video circulating online captures a reckless driving stunt that takes a sudden, destructive turn. Two BMWs, weaving aggressively through traffic in New England, end up crashing into each other — and it all happens right in front of an NYPD cruiser. This kind of driving was somewhat common for a time around New York. Over a year ago, an account called “Slow Benz” was gaining notoriety as it depicted drivers breaking laws, driving recklessly, and taunting NYPD officers. In May of 2024, the person police accused of leading that account, 19-year-old Antonio Ginestri, went to jail. After initially getting out, police arrested him again, this time for charges related to ATM and handbag thefts.  More: Florida Put A Mustang On Patrol But It’s Winning More Votes Than Tickets Since then, his account and associated accounts haven’t been nearly as popular. Nevertheless, they’ve remained alive. In one recently highlighted on Reddit, two BMW M3s are cutting up in traffic when the drivers over-estimate their skill level. As a green car leading the pair swerves across several lanes, it does so directly in the path of the following car. The gap is too small, the brakes can’t slow the car fast enough, and the two collide.  The camera car slams into a barrier and the driver pulls over onto the side of the road. It’s unclear what happens with the green BMW, but it appears to drive away. Regardless, it seems that police won’t have to do much to track down either driver as one officer is sitting on the side of the road with a front-row seat for the crash itself.  Video Reddit After a little digging, it turns out that this video is one posted by the Slow Benz YouTube account some eight months ago. Entitled “SQUEEZE TEAM TRYOUT GONE WRONG,” it documents even more of the drive in higher quality video. The reality here is that folks like Ginestri will likely continue to pull stunts like this until the police do enough work to stop them and make a true example out of the people they catch. Other states have made it clear that good detective work can accomplish a lot. In 2022, Carscoops exposed Scott Kitfield, a man posting similar videos online but in California.  A year later, police used a helicopter and ground units to track Kitfield, spotting him at triple-digit speeds. After a brief chase, officers pulled back and allowed the helicopter to follow from above until he eventually stopped. He was arrested on the spot. One year after that, authorities convicted him of fleeing police, reckless driving, and participating in a speed contest. Seeing as we’ve covered Ginestri and his associates several times, it wouldn’t be all that surprising to see the crew deal with a similar downfall anytime. Hopefully, the NYPD can follow that example and shut these immature folks down before they hurt people.  Credit: A Reddit User",
