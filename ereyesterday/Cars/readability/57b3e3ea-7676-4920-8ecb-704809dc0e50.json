Features include a removable roof panel, four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, 14″ Cromodora five-lug alloy wheels, power windows, a Becker AM/FM radio, and air conditioning. This E-series 246 was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered in Houston, Texas, as part of the DriverSource 2025 Spring Motoring Collection with a Marcel Massini Report, Dino Compendium documentation, a copy of Dino Compendium by Matthias Bartz, the owner’s manual, a tool kit, refurbishment records, and a clean California title. With bodywork designed by Aldo Brovarone and Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina, the prototype 206 GT first appeared at the 1965 Paris Auto Salon and was followed by revised concepts at the 1966 and 1967 Turin Motor Shows. The 2.0L 206 entered production in early 1968 and was later superseded by the 2.4L 246, which was offered in GT coupe and GTS targa-top variants beginning in 1969 and 1971, respectively. This GTS example is one of approximately 2,900 E-series cars produced between September 1971 and July 1974. The Scaglietti-built bodywork on this example came finished from the factory in Rosso Chiaro and was repainted in Azzurro Metallizzato during the refurbishment. Additional exterior features include a removable roof panel, a driver-side mirror, chrome bumpers, and a power antenna. US-market lighting includes recessed rectangular front turn signals, side markers, and rear reflectors inboard of the taillights. The 14″ Cromodora five-lug alloy wheels wear Dino-branded center caps and were mounted with 205/70 BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires in September 2024. A matching spare wheel is housed in the front trunk. The suspension was overhauled in 2021 and incorporates unequal-length A-arms, coilover shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars at front and rear. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted ventilated disc brakes all around. The brake master cylinder was replaced and the calipers were rebuilt in 2021. The fixed-back bucket seats were reupholstered in Nero leather and replacement black carpets were installed during the refurbishment. Additional features include gray “mouse-fur” dash trim, power windows, a Becker Grand Prix AM/FM radio, air conditioning, a gated shifter, and headrests mounted to the seatbacks. The leather-trimmed MOMO steering wheel features a Dino horn button and frames Dino-branded Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 170-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,750-rpm redline, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 26k miles. The mid-mounted 2.4-liter Tipo 135CS V6 features a 65° angle between cylinder banks, dual overhead camshafts on each bank, Magneti Marelli ignition, and a trio of two-barrel Weber carburetors. The carburetors were rebuilt and various engine oil seals were replaced during the refurbishment. Compression test results are viewable in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. A composite photo showing chassis, body, engine, and gearbox numbers around the car has been provided by the selling dealer. The Marcel Massini report lists the original colors and component numbers as well as the build and ownership timeline. Manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, and service records accompany the vehicle along with the front blue California license plate. An included copy of Dino Compendium written by Matthias Bartz retained in its factory packaging is shown at the end of the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
