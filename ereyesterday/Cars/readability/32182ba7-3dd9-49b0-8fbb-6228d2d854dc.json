It is equipped with 19″ alloy wheels, a brush guard, a power-operated sunroof, turn signal and taillight guards, rear parking sensors, heated front and rear seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Harman Kardon sound system, and a Pioneer touchscreen head unit. The seller acquired the truck on BaT in May 2024. Work performed in November 2024 consisted of replacing the accelerator pedal sensor and battery along with the fuel pump, control module, and filter. This G55 AMG has 114k miles and is offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, service records, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. Finished in black, the vehicle has a brush guard, a power-operated sunroof, fog lights, turn signal and taillight guards, running boards, and rear parking sensors. The body-color spare tire cover is a replacement that has been refinished according to the seller. Damage is noted on the Carfax report in 2014, 2015, and 2019. There are areas of touch-up paint and some trim pieces on the doors are loose. Photos of paint imperfections are provided in the gallery below. Ceramic window tint film was reportedly applied under current ownership. The 19″ alloy wheels are said to have been sourced from a 2021 G550 and are mounted with Pirelli Scorpion Zero tires measuring 275/55. An Electronic Stability Program (ESP) came standard and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with slotted rotors at all four corners. The brake pads are said to have been replaced in 2024. Designo black Nappa leather with contrasting stitching extends from the heated and 10-way power-adjustable front seats to the heated rear bench, which are complemented by wood trim on the center console, steering wheel, and door panels. Additional appointments include a multicontour driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Harman Kardon sound system, and a Pioneer touchscreen head unit that the seller notes is linked with a rearview camera. Flaking paint is present on the center stack. The heated multifunction steering wheel fronts a central 160-mph speedometer flanked by a 7,500-rpm tachometer and a fuel level gauge. The odometer indicates 114k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The supercharged 5.4-liter M113K V8 was factory rated at 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was most recently performed in 2024. A replacement fuel pump, control module, and filter were installed in preparation for the sale in addition to the accelerator pedal sensor and battery. Power is sent to all four wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and three locking differentials. The Carfax report notes the aforementioned damage.
