  "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GTA is one of approximately 500 examples of the aluminum-bodied homologation model built between 1965 and 1967 and was completed on September 28, 1965. Chassis AR613705 is said to have been delivered new to Société Française Alfa Romeo (SOFAR) in Paris, France, on October 22, 1965, and raced in Europe through the early 1970s. It was relocated to Japan in 1991 and subsequently purchased by is current owner in 2015 before being brought to Osaka, where it remained until being imported to the US in 2024. Finished in orange with green accents, the car is powered by a 1,750cc twin-cam inline-four that features a twin-plug cylinder head as well as dual Weber carburetors. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transmission linked with a sliding-block rear axle fitted with a limited-slip differential. Further equipment includes 14” Campagnolo alloy wheels, Koni shock absorbers, plexiglass side windows, and a roll cage along with black vinyl–trimmed bucket seats paired with latch-and-link harnesses. This GTA is now offered on dealer consignment with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, invoices from 2025, a spare set of Campagnolo alloy wheels, and a clean Montana title.",

Chassis AR613705 is said to have been delivered new to Société Française Alfa Romeo (SOFAR) in Paris, France, on October 22, 1965, and raced in Europe through the early 1970s.

Further equipment includes 14” Campagnolo alloy wheels, Koni shock absorbers, plexiglass side windows, and a roll cage along with black vinyl–trimmed bucket seats paired with latch-and-link harnesses. This GTA is now offered on dealer consignment with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, invoices from 2025, a spare set of Campagnolo alloy wheels, and a clean Montana title. A derivative of the roadgoing Giulia Sprint GT, the GTA model was developed by Alfa Romeo’s motorsport division, Autodelta, as a lightweight competition variant for homologation in the European Touring Car Championship, in which GTAs went on to win titles in 1966, 1967, and 1968. Construction of alleggerita examples consisted of aluminum alloy body panels bonded and riveted to steel structural panels of a thinner gauge than that of the standard Sprint GT. The GTA model’s weight-saving measures also included the use of magnesium in mechanical components, plexiglass side windows, and lightened door handles. Originally finished in red, this example is said to have been repainted in light blue early on before receiving another color change to its current shade of orange with green accents. The car features a stepped hood, mesh grilles, and door-mounted Vitaloni side mirrors along with red-finished front and rear tow hooks. Silver-painted 14×6.5” Campagnolo alloy wheels were mounted with 195/65 Michelin MXV3-A tires in January 2025. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes with slotted and cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cockpit is protected by a roll cage with removable door bars and houses a pair of fixed-back bucket seats accompanied by Simpson four-point latch-and-link harnesses. Black vinyl upholstery extends from the seats to the dash and door panels, and further details include a lockable glovebox, vent windows, and Alfa Romeo–branded door sill covers. A three-spoke steering wheel fronts Jaeger instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 220-km/h speedometer, and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 94k kilometers (~58k miles), and the selling dealer notes that true mileage is unknown. The 1,750cc DOHC inline-four is said to have been installed in the late 1960s in place of the factory 1.6-liter engine and features dual Weber 45 DCOE carburetors, a twin-plug cylinder head, and a finned oil sump. A compression test was performed in February 2025, and results of 175 psi for each cylinder are listed on an invoice in the photo gallery below. The spark plugs were replaced at that time. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The rear axle is located by an Autodelta sliding block, while the independent front suspension setup incorporates adjustable upper control arms. Coil springs, Koni shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars are utilized at the front and rear.
