  "description": "This 1973 Lincoln Continental Mark IV was purchased used by the seller's late father from King Cadillac-Oldsmobile in Albany, New York, in August 1973. It is powered by a 460ci V8 linked with a C-6 three-speed automatic transmission. Finished in Lime Gold Moondust over dark green upholstery, the car was inherited by the seller in 2021 and is equipped with a dark green vinyl roof, a power sunroof, 15\" steel wheels with covers, power-assisted front disc brakes, a limited-slip differential, power windows, a push-button AM/FM radio, and automatic climate control. Work since the seller's acquisition is said to have included a brake system overhaul, a coolant system and transmission fluid flush, and replacement of the tires and fuel pump. This Continental Mark IV is offered at no reserve with a copy of the 1973 car invoice, factory literature, spare parts, and a clean Virginia title in the seller's name.",

It is powered by a 460ci V8 linked with a C-6 three-speed automatic transmission. Finished in Lime Gold Moondust over dark green upholstery, the car was inherited by the seller in 2021 and is equipped with a dark green vinyl roof, a power sunroof, 15″ steel wheels with covers, power-assisted front disc brakes, a limited-slip differential, power windows, a push-button AM/FM radio, and automatic climate control. Work since the seller’s acquisition is said to have included a brake system overhaul, a coolant system and transmission fluid flush, and replacement of the tires and fuel pump. This Continental Mark IV is offered at no reserve with a copy of the 1973 car invoice, factory literature, spare parts, and a clean Virginia title in the seller’s name. The Mark IV debuted for the 1972 model year and was stretched four inches over the outgoing Mark III. Opera windows were added as a standard feature, and vacuum-operated headlight covers returned from the previous generation. This example is finished in Lime Gold Moondust (4U) with a dark green vinyl roof and is equipped with a power sunroof, a power-telescoping antenna that does not work, and dual side mirrors. Rust and paint chips are noted on the lower fenders, hood, and wheel wells. Paint meter readings can be viewed in the gallery below. The 15″ steel wheels feature covers and were mounted with 225/75 Hankook Optimo H724 whitewall tires under current ownership. Braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. Work under current ownership reportedly included rebuilding the brakes, replacing the brake hoses, and refurbishing the wiper motor. The cabin houses power-adjustable front seats and a rear bench upholstered in dark green. Interior equipment includes power windows, a push-button Philco AM/FM radio, an electronic rear window defogger, and automatic climate control. The tilting wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a 120-mph speedometer, a Cartier clock, and a central fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 32k miles, less than 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 460ci V8 was factory equipped with a four-barrel barrel carburetor and was rated at 220 net horsepower when new. Work since 2021 is said to have included flushing the coolant, performing a tune-up, and replacing the fuel pump and hood insulation. The removed fuel pump is included in the sale. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a C-6 three-speed automatic transmission that reportedly received a fluid flush since 2021. The transmission filter and exhaust resonator were also replaced. Corrosion is visible on the chassis and underside components.
