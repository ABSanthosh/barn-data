  "description": "The Xoom 125 is the latest scooter from Hero and it has all the makings of being the latest success story for the company. Hero Xoom 125 design and style Xoom 125 has a catchy design and good presence The new Xoom makes a strong impression thanks to its design and presence. This is not an excessively large or bulky scooter, but it does stand out. Those big 14-inch wheels wrapped in fat rubber do wonders for the overall silhouette. Hero has also done well to give this scooter its own unique design, and it looks quite different from the Xoom 110, even though the family resemblance is immediately identifiable. Catchy colours and sharp styling help the Xoom 125 stand out on the road. There are four colour options and the matte yellow you see here looks particularly good, even if it's quite clearly inspired by the TVS NTorq 125. Nevertheless, with its sporty stance and striking looks, this is a scooter most young riders would love to be seen on. Hero Xoom 125 engine and performance Motor borrowed from Destini 125 but makes more power here The motor is borrowed from the Destini 125, but it produces a little more power here – 9.9hp and 10.4Nm. On the move, the feeling and sound is of a rather conventional automatic scooter and throttle calibration is very smooth. There is a hint of vibration in the floorboard at around 20kph, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the motor smoothens out beautifully as the speeds rise and it is absolutely refined at about 60kph. Engine is shared with the Destini 125 but is more powerful here. Hero claims a segment leading 0-60kph time of 7.6s, despite the fact that this is one of the heavier 125cc scooters (121kg) and its power figures aren’t segment leading either. It’s hard to verify that claim from the riding experience as well because the power delivery is quite linear. While there is a pretty strong pull at lower revs you have to twist the long-travel accelerator wide open to find it – even then, it doesn’t quite have as strong a surge as you’d find in something like the TVS Ntorq. Just like the 110, the Xoom 125 gets two spacious cubbies on the front apron. The overall performance can be described as quick and refined but not particularly exciting. Top speed should be above a speedo indicated 90kph and the scooter managed to climb up to 80kph without much stress, even on a slight uphill section. As for fuel efficiency, Hero claims 54.9kpl, which is par for the course with this segment.  Hero Xoom 125 chassis, handling and comfort Xoom 125 is one of a handful of Indian-made scooters to ride on 14-inch wheels The Xoom 125 shares the same basic chassis as the Destini 125 and Xoom 110, but with a different wheelbase and steering angle. The big deal here is the use of 14-inch wheels, which makes this the only other locally manufactured scooter to offer them apart from the Yamaha Aerox 155 and the Aprilia SR range.  14-inch wheels lend the Xoom 125 good stability. Big wheels bring in stability and the Xoom feels very well balanced at low speeds, which addresses that nervous feeling you can get from scooters with smaller wheels. Low-speed agility is still quite good despite the long 1,327mm wheelbase, but it certainly doesn’t have the super-light steering feel you’d get from a conventional scooter. There wasn’t a whole lot to judge about outright handling on the crowded Delhi streets we rode on, but this does come across as a confident and fun handling scooter. The Xoom 125 gets a tethered USB charger. The only dynamic aspect I didn’t like was the braking. The actual performance is fine, but the levers feel hard and require some effort to slow the scooter down. As for the suspension comfort, it seems to strike a middle ground between the harsh Aprilia and the soft and plush Ntorq. On Delhi’s smooth, tarmac roads, comfort was good, but we’ll need to see what it’s like on Mumbai’s fast but bumpy concrete surfaces. Hero Xoom 125 seating comfort, features Xoom 125 is a decently comfortable and feature-rich scooter The seating position is decently spacious and while the handlebar will meet a tall rider’s knees at full lock, it’s not bad and is easy to manage. At 777mm, the seat height is low enough, but the seat (and scooter) is fairly wide and riders shorter than 5’6” may not be able to get both feet flat on the ground.  It is decently comfortable but the seat is wide, which could hinder shorter riders from getting their feet on the ground. As for features, unlike the Xoom 110, this scooter thankfully comes with an external fuel-filler cap and there’s even a warning chime in case you forget to close it. Beyond that, some things are nice like the standard LED projector headlamp, or the glovebox with a USB charger and the scrolling LED indicators that come on the top model. However, there are a few missing things like a parking brake lock and a silent-start system. Some may also find the LCD display a bit basic in an age where rivals are moving on to TFT units, but this display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the top model.  LCD display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the ZX variant. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict It could be another win for Hero, priced almost on par with TVS Ntorq 125 What needs to improve is the overall quality and attention to detail, and a closer inspection will reveal uneven panel gaps in a few places and cheap feeling, flexible black plastics in others. That being said, the value is excellent and priced between Rs 86,900 and Rs 92,900, this scooter is on par with the lower variants in the Ntorq line-up and about Rs 30,000 cheaper than the only other 125cc scooter with 14-inch wheels in our market – the Aprilia SR 125. The Xoom has some real desirability to it and it is priced very well too. And with such good pricing, I think Hero has pulled off another win with this scooter, much like they have with the Xtreme 125, which is selling superbly well for the company. Like that bike, this is a very good looking thing, and it has real desirability to it – I’d love to have rocked up to college on this scooter back in the day. But there’s more on offer as well, because, just like the Xtreme 125, the Xoom is quick, fun, practical and very good value for money. Also See: Hero Xoom 125 video review",

That being said, the value is excellent and priced between Rs 86,900 and Rs 92,900, this scooter is on par with the lower variants in the Ntorq line-up and about Rs 30,000 cheaper than the only other 125cc scooter with 14-inch wheels in our market – the Aprilia SR 125.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250312105224_8.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Xoom has some real desirability to it and it is priced very well too.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fd3ff59f-7fff-9768-49bb-9474240fd08e\"\u003eAnd with such good pricing, I think Hero has pulled off another win with this scooter, much like they have with the Xtreme 125, which is selling superbly well for the company. Like that bike, this is a very good looking thing, and it has real desirability to it – I’d love to have rocked up to college on this scooter back in the day. But there’s more on offer as well, because, just like the Xtreme 125, the Xoom is quick, fun, practical and very good value for money.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso See: \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-video-reviews/hero-xoom-125-video-review-434810\"\u003eHero Xoom 125 video review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434809\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434809\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434809\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434809\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
