Sign up and bring your car out to the first BaT event of the year, which we are holding on January 25 from 7-11am as part of the infamous B\u0026BS show at the beautiful Scottsdale facility of OTTO Car Club (a BaT Local Partner). Attendance is free for all, so we encourage you to bring your BaT purchase or other special car out to the show (or simply bring yourself, friends, and/or family).

We will accommodate as many of you as we can! Spectator parking can be had on surrounding neighborhood streets.
