  "description": "Starting January 2026, all new two-wheelers sold in India must be equipped with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and dealerships will be required to provide two BIS-certified helmets—one each for the rider and pillion. MoRTH mandates ABS on all new two-wheelers Effective from January 2026 Ministry of Transport mandates ABS from January 2026 Along with this, every new 2-wheeler sold should come with two helmets In a significant move aimed at enhancing road safety, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has announced that all new two-wheelers sold in India from January 2026 must come equipped with ABS, regardless of engine capacity. In addition, it will be mandatory for dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with every new vehicle—one for the rider and one for the pillion passenger. The decision is expected to address a major cause of road fatalities in the country, especially among two-wheeler users. According to government data, a large number of two-wheeler accidents involve brake-related skidding and head injuries, which the new rules aim to reduce. While the move is widely welcomed by road safety advocates, some manufacturers have raised concerns over potential cost implications for entry-level models. However, government officials believe the benefits in terms of saved lives and reduced injuries will far outweigh the price increase.  For reference, major two-wheeler manufacturers like Hero, Honda, TVS, Bajaj and Suzuki have a number of their products that fall under the 125cc mark, which will all need to be updated to meet this new rule. All of these products are priced around the Rs 1 lakh mark (ex-showroom), and they are likely to see an increase in price owing to the additional hardware necessitated by this new rule.  Perhaps the segment of the market that will be the most affected will be the entry-level 100cc motorcycles, which start from the Rs 60,000 ballpark (ex-showroom). For two-wheelers that require the addition of a front disc as well as single channel ABS, customers could be looking at a price hike of roughly Rs 6,000 - Rs 10,000.   The ministry is expected to release detailed guidelines and timelines soon to ensure a smooth rollout of the regulation.   Also see: Rajiv Bajaj to step down from KTM parent company Pierer AG’s supervisory board",
