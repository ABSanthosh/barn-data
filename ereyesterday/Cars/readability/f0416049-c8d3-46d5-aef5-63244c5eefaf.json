  "text": "Authorities in Oregon reported that the driver eventually crashed and registered a .29 BAC 2 hours ago by Michael Gauthier An Oregon woman was reportedly seen driving a Toyota Tundra on its rims at nearly 100 mph. The truck later crashed and authorities arrested the woman for DUI and reckless driving. She reportedly had a blood alcohol content of .29, which is well above the limit of .08. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and that, unfortunately, means lots of drinking and driving. As Mothers Against Drunk Driving recently noted, the night before Thanksgiving is “Blackout Wednesday” as many people go to bars to have fun with friends and family. This can have deadly results as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found 35% of fatal car crashes on Thanksgiving Eve in 2022 involved drunk drivers. Even more alarmingly, 23% of drivers involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol content of .15 or higher. More: Drunk Driving Deaths Hit Nearly 20-Year High Despite Fewer DUI Arrests That’s worth thinking about today for two reasons as it’s Thanksgiving Eve and police in Hillsboro, Oregon recently pulled over a driver who was allegedly so drunk they didn’t even notice they were driving on their rims. Making matters even worse, this reportedly occurred at nearly 100 mph (161 km/h). The Hillsboro Police Department was notified about a white pickup driving recklessly on Highway 26 around 8:30 PM on November 25. Shortly after officers were dispatched, people called 911 to say the truck had crashed near Brookwood Parkway. Officers eventually arrived on the scene and found a disabled Toyota Tundra. As you can see in the picture, there’s little left of the front wheel and the tire is completely gone. The rear tire remains, but it’s no longer attached to the vehicle. The 35-year old driver, Skylar Peplinski, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence as well as reckless driving. The department said she had a blood alcohol content of .29, which is nearly 4 times the legal limit. Images: Hillsboro Police Department",
