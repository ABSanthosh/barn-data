  "text": "Mar 13, 2025 1:53 PM EDTThe welcome return of a legendary German supercar In early 2024, the world said goodbye to the Audi R8–a mid-engine supercar that quickly cemented its status as one of the all-time greats. The R8's future was uncertain for quite some time, but we finally have some news that suggests a third-generation R8 is on its way. Sharing the glorious 907-horsepower, plug-in hybrid, 10,000-rpm, twin-turbocharged, flat-plane crankshaft V8 found in the recently unveiled Lamborghini Temerario, it seems development on the third-generation Audi R8 is nearly complete, according to Autocar, and should hopefully arrive in late 2027. We're extremely excited for the beloved model's return and can only imagine how fantastic it'll look. And we have done so. Using generative text-to-image artificial intelligence, we imagine what a revived Audi R8 could look like, incorporating current Audi design cues and imagining what powertrains and platforms it could feasibly optimize. These images are for speculation purposes only and in no way depict any actual Audi products.  The third-generation Audi R8 will have astonishing technical specifications As it's meant to share its platform and most of its mechanical components with the mesmerizing Lamborghini Temerario, the next-gen Audi R8 could benefit from an astounding 907 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. The thrilling numbers don't end there, though, because the twin-turbocharged, 4.0-liter V8 employs a flat-plane crankshaft and three axial-flux electric motors to quickly soar towards its 10,000-rpm redline. To keep all that power in check, the Temerario sends its thrust to all four wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The way it feels behind the wheel is immensely customizable too, with thirteen unique drive modes to choose from. All this tech and muscle results in a staggering 2.7-second 0-60 mph launch and a top speed of over 213 miles per hour. It's also not unprecedented for the Audi R8 to have unique, less-powerful, more-affordable powertrain options when compared to its Lamborghini cousin. Who knows, maybe we'll even get a limited-production special edition, akin to the R8 RWS of yesteryear, that sees the removal of its plug-in hybrid battery technology, leaving only the 789-horsepower, 10,000-rpm, twin-turbocharged V8 and rear-wheel drive. If that were to ever really happen, the Chevrolet C8 Corvette Z06 had better watch its back. Audi recently unveiled its new A6 Avant to the world, a stunning refresh of one of Germany's all-time greatest station wagons. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that we'll see the A6 in standard Avant form, but hopefully, we'll see the wagon return as an Allroad and in RS6 guise. The R8 will combine the Temerario's performance with Audi's current style Regardless of how you feel about the A6 Avant, it's one of the most attractive examples of Audi's recently-refreshed design language that's sweeping across the brand's entire lineup. Certain styling cues, like the rounded edges, streamlined proportions, and aggressive fixtures, will inevitably make their way into the upcoming R8's aesthetic profile. Building on the foundation of the Lamborghini Temerario and expanding on the R8's iconic design with slimmer, more streamlined proportions, edgier headlights and fixtures, and an overall more aggressive and stately tone, the next-gen Audi R8 should closely resemble what you see pictured above. Its styling will stay true to the R8's iconic lineage while subtly incorporating the Temerario's proportions and Audi's current design identity. On the inside, the ethos of freshness will likely continue, seamlessly blending the ergonomically uncomplex environment R8 owners are used to with a subtle touch of modern enhancement. Its Lamborghini roots may shine through subliminally through the dashboard's angular, surrealist proportions and edgy details strewn about. Unlike the Lamborghini, however, the R8 has always tended towards a softer, more grand-tourer approach to its interior environment. Flashy suede leather surfaces and vibrantly colored stitching are replaced by plush, high-end leather, and matte black and forged carbon accents are swapped out for metallic chrome and gloss carbon fiber. Final thoughts Although these renders are merely speculative, they closely represent a feasible design for the third-generation Audi R8 based on the model's lineage, the Lamborghini Temerario's proportions and powertrain, and Audi's recently-renewed design language. Thankfully, however, the third-generation R8 is no longer a vaporware of mere speculation. With its adoption of a plug-in hybrid, twin-turbocharged V8, the experience behind the wheel of the new R8 will be vastly different from that of previous generations. However, with the Temerario's screaming 10,000-rpm redline, that might not be such a bad thing after all. Are you excited for the return of the Audi R8 as a plug-in hybrid, V8-powered supercar with nearly 1,000 horsepower, or do you feel like road-car performance has gone too far and prefer the divine goodness that is a naturally-aspirated V10 paired to a gated manual transmission? Would you be more intrigued by a leather-clad, grey-suit-wearing third-generation Audi R8, or are you more partial towards the vibrant Lamborghini Temerario? Let us know how you feel in the comments–we love to hear from you!",
