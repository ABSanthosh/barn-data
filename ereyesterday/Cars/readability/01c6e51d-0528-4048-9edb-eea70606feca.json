  "description": "This 1976 Ferrari 308 GTB is finished in Nero over matching leather and is one of approximately 800 vetroresina examples produced with fiberglass bodywork between 1975 and 1977. Powered by a 2.9-liter quad-cam DOHC V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, it is equipped with a limited-slip differential, Weber carburetors, a Tubi Style exhaust system, and 14″ Campagnolo wheels as well as air conditioning, power windows, a MOMO steering wheel, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The car is said to have been sold new at Wide World of Cars in New York, with subsequent ownership in Connecticut, Colorado, Germany, and Mexico. The current owner purchased the vehicle in 2021, and work in May 2025 consisted of changing the fluids and replacing the timing belts, water pump, thermostat, cam-cover gaskets, and more in addition to adjusting the carburetors and timing. Previously listed on BaT in November 2020, this 308 GTB shows 35k miles and is offered again on dealer consignment in Arizona with an owner's manual, tool and tire-change kits, a service record, and a clean Montana title.",

The current owner purchased the vehicle in 2021, and work in May 2025 consisted of changing the fluids and replacing the timing belts, water pump, thermostat, cam-cover gaskets, and more in addition to adjusting the carburetors and timing. Previously listed on BaT in November 2020, this 308 GTB shows 35k miles and is offered again on dealer consignment in Arizona with an owner’s manual, tool and tire-change kits, a service record, and a clean Montana title. Introduced at the 1975 Paris Motor Show, the 308 GTB featured Pininfarina-styled bodywork constructed of glass-reinforced plastic over a tubular steel chassis. Just 808 fiberglass-bodied vetroresina cars were produced by Carrozzeria Scaglietti before the switch to steel body panels in June 1977. This example is finished in Nero and is believed to have been repainted under prior ownership. Exterior details include pop-up headlights, side air inlets, later-style mirrors, black bumpers, and a vented deck lid. Campagnolo 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 205/70 Michelin XWX tires, and a spare on a matching wheel is secured in the front trunk. The car features fully independent suspension with double wishbones front and rear, and braking is provided by a ventilated disc at each corner. The brake fluid was flushed in May 2025. The bolstered seats are upholstered in Nero leather, and additional appointments include air conditioning, a Blaupunkt cassette stereo and graphic equalizer, power windows, and a gated shifter with a dogleg gear pattern. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,700-rpm redline, and gauges for fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure. A clock and an oil-temperature gauge are housed in the left end of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 35K miles, approximately 150 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 2.9L quad-cam V8 was factory equipped with Weber DCNF downdraft carburetors and factory-rated at 237 horsepower for the US market. The timing belts and tensioners were replaced in May 2025 along with the water pump, thermostat, air-pump seal, fuel filter, and camshaft-cover gaskets. Additional work included changing the oil and coolant, resealing the distributors, and adjusting the carburetors and timing. Cylinder-compression measurements taken at that time can be viewed in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and the gearbox fluid was changed in May 2025. A Tubi Style exhaust system has been fitted. Tool and tire-change kits will accompany the vehicle, as will an owner’s manual. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
