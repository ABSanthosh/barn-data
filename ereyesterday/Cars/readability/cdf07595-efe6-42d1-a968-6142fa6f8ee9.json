  "description": "About 43 lakh passenger vehicles were sold in India in the financial year that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025), of which 4,48,233 units, or around 10 percent, were MPVs. Among factors that draw buyers in a value-conscious market like India to the MPV segment are the high levels of practicality, the ability to transport seven people and their luggage comfortably, and the fact that more and more car-owning families are taking the road for their holidays across the country. So, here’s a quick look at the bestselling MPVs of FY2025. Maruti Ertiga was India’s bestselling MPV for the sixth year in a row Maruti’s XL6 and Invicto, along with Renault Triber, saw a decrease in sales Luxury MPVs Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire sold over 1,000 units each in FY2025 Best-selling MPVs in India in FY2025ModelFY25 salesMarket share (%)FY24 salesYoY change (%)Maruti Ertiga1,90,97442.611,49,75727.52Toyota Innova Crysta+Hycross1,07,20423.9298,1089.27Kia Carens64,60914.4163,1672.28Maruti XL637,1118.2845,130-17.77Toyota Rumion21,8784.885,973266.28Renault Triber19,9054.4422,446-11.32Maruti Invicto4,0360.904,598-12.22Kia Carnival1,3610.30--Toyota Vellfire1,1550.26400188.75TOTAL4,48,2331003,89,57915.06 Maruti Ertiga 1,90,974 units sold, up 28 percent Maruti Suzuki India’s first crack at the MPV segment continues to win over buyers and has been India’s No. 1 MPV for the past six fiscal years. In FY2025, the Maruti Ertiga, which is available in petrol and CNG powertrains, sold 1,90,974 units, up 28 percent year on year (YoY). This is its best-ever fiscal year performance, making it Maruti’s bestselling utility vehicle and India’s fourth best-selling car in FY2025 after the Maruti Wagon R, Tata Punch and Hyundai Creta. In FY2025, Maruti sold 41,217 more Ertigas than it did in the previous year, which speaks volumes for the demand this popular family mover continues to command. Ertiga accounted for 26 percent of Maruti’s UV sales of 7,20,186 units, up 11 percent from FY2024. In fact, it missed out on being the company’s No. 1 passenger vehicle model by just 7,477 units, with the Wagon R (1,98,451 units) winning that accolade. Toyota Innova Hycross and Crysta 1,07,204 units sold, up 9 percent Toyota Kirloskar Motor sold 1,07,204 units of its bestselling product, the Innova MPV, an increase of 9 per cent YoY. The Innova comes in Crysta and hybrid Hycross forms, and the demand has been particularly strong for the latter, which has helped accelerate sales for this popular model.  In FY2025, TKM hit its best-ever sales of 3,09,000-plus units, and the Innova was a key growth driver, along with the Urban Cruiser Hyryder and Fortuner SUVs, Taisor compact SUV and the Rumion MPV. Kia Carens 64,609 units sold, up 2 percent The high-on-space-and-comfort Kia Carens MPV, with 64,609 units dispatched, has posted marginal YoY growth of 2 percent. The Carens’ best fiscal was FY2023, with 70,314 units sold. In early February 2025, the versatile and spacious MPV drove past the cumulative sales milestone of 2 lakh units in the domestic market, 36 months after its launch. The Carens is targeted at large families scouting for a premium, spacious cabin, as well as day-to-day practicality. It comes with a choice of multiple powertrains. It is likely that the somewhat slower sales of the model this year were due to the news that there is a new Carens, as well as an electric Carens, slated for launch later this year. Maruti XL6 37,111 units sold, down 18 percent The Maruti XL6 is the premium, 6-seat avatar of the popular Ertiga. It is powered by the same 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine and offers the same automatic and manual gearbox options. However, while the Ertiga has hit its best-ever sales, the XL6’s numbers are down 18 percent YoY to 37,111 units in FY2025. Toyota Rumion 21,878 units sold, up 266 percent The Toyota Rumion MPV is one of the Japanese brand’s most successful products in the past two years. Since its launch in August 2023, the sensible, no-nonsense Ertiga-based people-mover – which is among the four rebadged Maruti Suzuki models in Toyota’s portfolio – has made its presence felt in the affordable MPV market. After all, 21,878 units of it were sold in FY2025, up 266 percent YoY on a low year-ago base of 5,973 units. Renault Triber 19,905 units sold, down 11 percent The sub-4-metre, 7-seat Renault Triber which offers MPV-like versatility for hatchback money and size, continued to see a decline in its sales. Renault dispatched 19,905 Tribers in FY2025, down 11 percent YoY. What doesn’t help is the meek 72hp, 96Nm, 1.0-litre petrol engine – a CNG version arrived in February – that comes paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard. The Triber facelift has been spied testing and is expected to launch later this year. Maruti Invicto 4,036 units sold, down 12 percent The Maruti Invicto, which is produced by Toyota for Maruti, sold 4,036 units in FY2025, down 12 percent YoY. Maruti launched the Invicto in July 2023, and the MPV’s total sales over these 21 months stand at 8,634 units. Like the Innova Hycross, the Invicto is big on space, comfort and features. However, unlike the Toyota, it is only sold with a strong hybrid engine, which delivers impressive fuel economy. Kia Carnival 1,361 units sold Launched in October 2024, the Kia Carnival builds on the legacy of its predecessor while offering enhanced features aimed at redefining passenger comfort. Notwithstanding the high sticker price of Rs 63.91 lakh, the Carnival has sold 1,361 units in the last six months of FY2025. The large diesel-engined MPV scores high on comfort and flexibility and goes all out to pamper its occupants to the hilt. Toyota Vellfire 1,155 units sold, up 189 percent Proof that even a very high sticker price for an MPV cannot dissuade buyers is the ultra-luxurious Toyota Vellfire. Priced between Rs 1.22 and Rs 1.33 crore, the XL-sized MPV has sold 1,155 units – 755 additional units than FY2024’s 400 units, registering a whopping 189 percent growth. The Vellfire boasts a cavernous cabin that’s home to some of the best seats. A sister product to the more luxuriously appointed Lexus LM, the Vellfire is powered by a 193hp, 240Nm, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine combined with an 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp and is paired with an e-CVT; our Vellfire review tells you what it’s like to drive and be driven in. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
