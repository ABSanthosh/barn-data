  "description": "The Hyundai Alcazar has been updated with a new Corporate trim that finally brings a panoramic sunroof to the diesel range. Priced from Rs 17.87 lakh, the new Corporate trim is available with both manual and automatic gearboxes, and only in 7-seater guise. Hyundai has also made the DCT gearbox with the petrol engine a little more affordable by offering it on the second-from-base Prestige trim at Rs 18.64 lakh. Alcazar gets new Corporate diesel trim with panoramic sunroof Corporate trim is available only in 7-seater guise DCT gearbox with petrol now more affordable by 2.30 lakh Here’s a look at the prices of the new Hyundai Alcazar variants: Hyundai Alcazar new trims launched (prices, ex-showroom)Variant Price Alcazar Corporate Diesel 7-strRs 17.87 lakh Alcazar Corporate Diesel AT 7-strRs 19.29 lakh Alcazar Prestige Petrol DCT 7-str Rs 18.64 lakh Hyundai Alcazar Corporate: what’s new? So far, the Alcazar only came equipped with a panoramic sunroof on the petrol variants, available from the second-from-base Prestige trim. The diesel variants did not get a panoramic sunroof for two reasons – one, to keep pricing at par with the petrol and two, in the interest of fuel economy. Hyundai had managed to save about 50kgs on the Alcazar diesel by not offering the panoramic sunroof, and that helped achieve a fuel economy of over 20kpl, which is what customers value when buying a diesel. Alcazar diesel now gets a panoramic sunroof with new Corporate trim. However, it’s no secret how much Indian car buyers fancy a panoramic sunroof, which is why Hyundai seems to have given into the trend. The new Corporate trim sits between the existing Prestige and Platinum trims, and apart from the panoramic sunroof, it also comes equipped with LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, dual-zone AC, ambient lighting, 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charger, 6 airbags and ESC. The Alcazar diesel uses a 1.5-litre mill that produces 116hp and 250Nm; the new Corporate trim is available with both 6-speed manual and 6-speed AT gearbox. Hyundai Alcazar new petrol-DCT variant launched Meanwhile, the new Prestige petrol-DCT variant makes the 7-speed DCT gearbox more affordable by 2.30 lakh; previously it was offered on the Platinum trim onwards, which is priced from Rs 20.94 lakh. The DCT gearbox is mated to the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine that produces 160hp and 253Nm of torque.
