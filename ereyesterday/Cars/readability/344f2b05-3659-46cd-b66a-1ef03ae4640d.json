  "description": "This 1957 Porsche 356A Carrera is a GS “de Luxe” coupe that was completed on January 15, 1957, before being sold new by Competition Motors in Hollywood, California. The car is said to have been purchased in California in 1975 by its then-19-year-old owner, whose 45-year stewardship included a refurbishment in the 1980s and a 2010 mechanical refresh that included the installation of a replacement 1.5-liter Type 547/1 four-cam flat-four. In 2020, the car underwent an additional refurbishment that included a repaint in the original shade of silver and a re-trim of the interior in red leatherette. Additional features include a roller-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, twin Solex carburetors, a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel drum brakes, Koni shock absorbers, 15” chrome wheels, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. Following award-winning appearances at both the 2023 Amelia and 2023 Hilton Head Concours d’Elegances, the car was listed on BaT in October 2024 before being purchased by the current owner. This Carrera GS is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a copy of its Kardex, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a Reutter Certificate of Production, invoices from engine and transaxle work, awards, and a clean Montana title in the owner's name.",

The car is said to have been purchased in California in 1975 by its then-19-year-old owner, whose 45-year stewardship included a refurbishment in the 1980s and a 2010 mechanical refresh that included the installation of a replacement 1.5-liter Type 547/1 four-cam flat-four.

Additional features include a roller-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, twin Solex carburetors, a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel drum brakes, Koni shock absorbers, 15” chrome wheels, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. Following award-winning appearances at both the 2023 Amelia and 2023 Hilton Head Concours d’Elegances, the car was listed on BaT in October 2024 before being purchased by the current owner. This Carrera GS is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a copy of its Kardex, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a Reutter Certificate of Production, invoices from engine and transaxle work, awards, and a clean Montana title in the owner’s name. Introduced in 1955, the Carrera variant offered power from a derivation of the four-cam engine designed by Dr. Ernst Furhmann for use in Porsche’s competition efforts. In 1957, the Carrera offerings were divided into the GT and GS, or de Luxe, models, with the latter more luxuriously equipped for comfortable road use. Either Carrera specification could be chosen for coupe, cabriolet, or Speedster body styles. Originally finished in silver, this example is said to have been repainted in a non-factory shade of plum prior to being purchased by its previous owner, who had it refinished in red. The Reutter-built body was returned to its factory silver shade during the refurbishment that is said to have been performed in 2020 by Eurowerks in Campbell, Texas, and Grubbs Collision and Motorsports in Garland, Texas. The project also reportedly included chrome work by Christensen Plating Works of Vernon, California, and Victor Miles of Ventura, California. Features include body-color bumpers with overriders, a driver-side mirror, a single rear grille, quad beehive taillights, and gold badging. Chrome wheels wear baby moon hubcaps and are wrapped in 165SR15 Michelin XZX tires, as is a matching spare secured in the front compartment. Stopping is handled by hydraulic drum brakes at each corner, and the brake lines are said to have been replaced in April 2023. The cabin was re-trimmed under prior ownership by Autos International in Escondido, California, and features Wine Red leatherette over the front bucket seats and rear bench with matching upholstery over the door panels, rear side panels, and upper dash. Additional features include oatmeal square-weave carpeting, black floor mats covered by red and black Coco Mats, a lockable glovebox, a passenger-side grab handle, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. The beige-color two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color dash housing green-letter VDO instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 160-mph speedometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil pressure and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 60k miles, a few of which have been added under current ownership. The instruments are said to have been refurbished by Palo Alto Speedometer in California between 2020 and 2024. The 1.5-liter Type 547/1 flat-four (*P90785*) is a replacement that was overhauled and installed by Bill Doyle’s Rennwagen Motor Company in Jackson, Wyoming, between 2010 and 2012 in place of a Super 90 engine that had previously been fitted. Features include a roller-bearing crankshaft that was rebuilt during the engine overhaul as well as dual overhead camshafts, a dry-sump lubrication system, and dual-throat Solex carburetors. Additional work performed at the time of the engine installation included refreshes of the fuel pumps, replacement of the oil lines, cleaning of the oil tank, and modification of the exhaust headers. The engine’s top-end components were reportedly disassembled and resealed in April 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Type 644 dual-mount four-speed manual transaxle with a “Spyder D” second gear, and the gearbox was overhauled in 2010 by Vic Skirmants of 356 Enterprises in North Branch, Michigan, with replacement synchros, bearings, bushings, and differential gears. The clutch and pressure plate were replaced during the engine installation between 2010 and 2012, which also included resurfacing of the flywheel. Koni shock absorbers are in place at each corner. The Kardex lists the original color as well as delivery in the US and two warranty claims at Competition Motors. Stampings viewable in the photo gallery below include transaxle number 12488 and partial chassis numbers stamped on the rear decklid and front hood hinge. Invoices from the engine and transaxle overhauls are also viewable in the gallery. This Carrera earned a class award at the 2023 Amelia Concours d’Elegance and the Palmetto Award at Hilton Head Concours d’Elegance that same year. Additional recognitions at the PCA Maverick Region include the President’s Choice award at the 2023 Concours and the Founder’s Day People’s Choice award and Best in 356 Class award. In 2024, the car was featured on the cover of the February/March edition of PCA Maverick magazine, Slipstream. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
