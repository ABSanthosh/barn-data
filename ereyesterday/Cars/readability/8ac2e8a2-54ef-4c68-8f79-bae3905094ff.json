  "description": "This 1962 Maserati Spider 3500 GT is one of approximately 250 Vignale-bodied convertibles built during five years of production and was ordered new by Auto-König of Munich, Germany, in January 1962. Chassis 1421 was shipped to Auto-König in August 1962 before being sold to its first owner near Munich, and it is said to have later undergone a color change to yellow following collision repairs. After additional accident damage in 1973, the car awaited repairs until being purchased in 1999 by a German owner who initiated a refurbishment that remained incomplete for several years. Under subsequent ownership, the unfinished car was sent to Leo B. Peschl Classic Sports Cars in Cologne, Germany, before being sold in 2016 to its current owner, who commissioned the completion of the refurbishment over the next three years. Work during the project included a repaint in the original shade of white with a blue hardtop, a re-trim of the interior in blue leather, and an overhaul of the 3.5-liter DOHC inline-six. Following the completion of the refurbishment, the car achieved Maserati Classiche certification in 2022. Additional features include triple Weber 42 DCOE carburetors, twin-plug ignition, a ZF five-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 16” Borrani wire wheels, and a navy convertible top. This Tipo 101/C is now offered on dealer consignment in Roeselare, Belgium, with Maserati Classiche certification documents and badges, copies of its factory order and build sheets, photos from the refurbishment, and Belgian registration.",

Following the completion of the refurbishment, the car achieved Maserati Classiche certification in 2022. Additional features include triple Weber 42 DCOE carburetors, twin-plug ignition, a ZF five-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 16” Borrani wire wheels, and a navy convertible top. This Tipo 101/C is now offered on dealer consignment in Roeselare, Belgium, with Maserati Classiche certification documents and badges, copies of its factory order and build sheets, photos from the refurbishment, and Belgian registration. Following a series of prototypes, Giovanni Michelotti’s open-top interpretation of the 3500 GT was introduced in 1959 and earned Carrozzeria Vignale the contract to build a production convertible variant. In lieu of the contemporary coupe’s Superleggera coachwork, the Spyder’s construction incorporated steel bodywork with an aluminum hood, trunk lid, and doors while riding on a wheelbase 10 centimeters shorter than that of the coupe. Among factory options for the Spyder was a removable hardtop. This example’s bodywork was placed on a rotisserie and stripped to bare metal before a repaint in its original shade of Biancospino during the refurbishment performed by Leo B. Peschi Classic Sports Cars between 2017 and 2019. The hardtop is listed on build sheets as factory equipment and was refinished in its original shade of Blu Medio during the project. Exterior details include inward-angled fender vents, stepped taillights, round front signal repeaters, a driver-side mirror, and a navy blue convertible top that can be stowed under a matching boot. Borrani wire wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in 6.00-16 Michelin Piloti X tires, while a trunk-mounted spare wears Pirelli rubber. Four-wheel disc brakes became standard for the 3500 GT models in 1962. The cabin was re-trimmed during the refurbishment in blue leather over the front bucket seats, rear occasional seats, door panels, and center tunnel. Additional features include color-keyed carpeting, black lap belts for the front occupants, power windows, a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, and a lockable glovebox. The split-rim steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color dashboard fascia housing Jaeger instrumentation including a 250-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 85k kilometers (~53k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The 3,485cc Tipo 101 inline-six features an aluminum block and cylinder head, with the latter featuring hemispherical combustion chambers and dual overhead camshafts. Induction is through triple Weber 42 DCOE carburetors, while ignition is handled by two spark plugs per cylinder. The engine was overhauled during the 2017-2019 refurbishment. A maintenance service is said to have been performed in 2020, approximately 1k kilometers after completion of the refurbishment. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the latter of which became standard for the 3500 GT models in 1960. Suspension incorporates double wishbones and coil springs up front and a leaf-sprung solid axle at the rear, with tubular shock absorbers and anti-roll bars featured at both ends. The engine block is stamped with non-matching chassis number AM107*2106*, although an additional stamp of internal number 1180 matches the internal number listed on the factory build sheet shown in the photo gallery below. A Maserati Classiche badge engraved with the chassis number is affixed to the body, and the Maserati Classiche certification box is showcased in the gallery. The build sheet lists the original colors, specifications, and equipment numbers. Also included in the sale are the car’s factory order sheet and shipping notice and Maserati Classiche documents including a Certificate of Origin, a Technical and Aesthetic Characteristics sheet, and a Historical Information sheet. Additional images from the refurbishment can be viewed in the gallery. The vehicle is being sold on its Belgian registration, which serves as an ownership document in the EU.
