  "description": "Volkswagen’s ID sub-brand showcased three concepts: Era and Evo SUVs, and Aura sedan, on Tuesday. The carmaker has yet to publish specifics on each model’s powertrain, but has confirmed that all are new-energy vehicles (NEVs), which include plug-in hybrid, range-extender and all-electric powertrains. VW will be introducing 30 new vehicles by 2027 in China, which are previewed by these ID concepts. Era SUV previews VW's first range-extender powertrain Evo is a sibling to the ID Unyx SUV Aura has a similar silhouette to the Volkswagen Bora sedan (Vento successor in Europe) Volkswagen ID Era SUV concept Up to 1,000km range Made in collaboration with the Chinese automotive manufacturer SAIC, with which Volkswagen has a joint venture (JV), the ID Era concept previews the brand’s first range-extender powertrain. A petrol engine or generator is solely used to charge the battery, and with maximum fuel and battery levels, the vehicle can deliver a range of up to 1,000 km. Inside, the VW ID Era SUV has a seven-seat setup similar to the Volkswagen Tayron (sold in international markets). Volkswagen ID Evo SUV concept 800V electrical architecture Volkswagen’s second SUV concept here, the ID Evo, is built by its sub-division based in Anhui, China. It is a sibling to the ID Unyx - a rebadged version of the Cupra Tavascan. However, the Evo concept swaps the Unyx’s rakish rear roofline with a more traditional SUV look. Also, Evo’s electric version packs an upgraded 800V electrical architecture (400V system used by the Unyx), a new zonal computer setup for a wide range of new digital services and quick over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Volkswagen ID Aura sedan concept First car based on CMP The VW ID Aura sedan is a result of the brand’s JV with First Automotive Works (FAW), one of China’s oldest and largest automotive manufacturers. While it did not disclose the dimensions of the sedan, it has a similar silhouette to the VW Bora (successor to the Volkswagen Vento in Europe). The Aura concept will spawn the first car based on the new Compact Main Platform (CMP), which is specifically aimed at the Chinese market. The production versions of the concept trio will feature a Level 2++ AI-based autonomous driving system. “In certain situations, cars will be able to drive fully autonomously, including overtaking and turning manoeuvres and independently merging into traffic, with the driver’s supervision,” Volkswagen said in a statement.
