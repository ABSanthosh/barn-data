  "text": "Ford wants to conquest Jeep owners with incentives. We see this a lot throughout the automotive industry -- OEMs even track the data on conquests. Car companies are always looking to get sale by enticing folks who currently own something from another brand.It's not really shocking -- any business is going to try to poach customers from the competitor, even if those folks go back to the other brand later -- but it's a bigger deal in the car world since cars are a big purchase, people go years between buying or leasing a new vehicle, brand loyalty can be strong, and dealers play a role, too.In other words, McDonald's corporate HQ is certainly aware that someone might buy an Egg McMuffin one day, go to Wendy's for breakfast the next, and then back to Mickey D's on day three. That customer will probably vary up the brands he/she buys fast-food from.But, perhaps, Jeep could conquest a Chevy customer and keep them for life. Or, perhaps, Ford could get someone who's owned Wranglers for 20 years to buy a Bronco. And maybe that person goes back to Jeep -- or maybe not. So, how has that worked for you? Have targeted discounts from an OEM gotten you to switch brands? I realize that might not apply to everyone -- some of you just buy the best car available at the time of purchase, and brand loyalty means little or nothing to you.But some of you are fiercely loyal. Or would be, unless the price is right. So, go ahead, sound off below.[Image: Ford]Become a TTAC insider.
