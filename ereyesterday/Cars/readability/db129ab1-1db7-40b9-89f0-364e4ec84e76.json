Raoul Hyman, Sohil Shah win Indian Racing League cars’ title Tijil Rao crowned LGB F4 champion Navaneeth Kumar wins Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup title Indian Racing League winner: Goa Aces JA Racing Goa Aces JA Racing’s title bid received a massive boost on Saturday after Sohil Shah secured the hat-trick – bagging pole position, the race win and the fastest lap. This handed the John Abraham-owned team the overall championship lead, with Shrachi Rarh Royal Bengal Tigers just two points behind with one last race to go. However, Shrachi Rarh Royal Bengal Tigers’ hopes were dashed early on when Ruhaan Alva lost the rear of his car and slid across the track into Akash Gowda. The Safety Car made a brief appearance before racing resumed, and Goa Aces JA Racing’s Raoul Hyman cruised to victory ahead of his teammate Gabriela Jilkova. Results Race 1 1.
