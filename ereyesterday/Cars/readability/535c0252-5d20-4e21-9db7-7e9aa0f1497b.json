  "text": "British tuners Chelsea Truck Co. and Kahn Design have prepared a widebody kit for the 90 and 110 models April 10, 2025 at 20:59 by Brad Anderson Two British tuners gave the Defender 90 a redesign with zero performance gains. The 4×4 has been equipped with 20-inch forged wheels and 33-inch all-terrain tires. Adorning the cabin is plush black and blue leather on the seats and dashboard. There’s something so cool about two-door off-roaders. Whether it is icons like the Suzuki Jimny, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Bronco, or Toyota Land Cruiser, these two-door creations with short wheelbases don’t just look the part but are also very capable. Sadly, there aren’t all that many two-door 4x4s available anymore, but of those on the market, the Land Rover Defender 90 is one of the best. Now, two British tuners have partnered to create a very special Defender 90, known as the Concept 001. This very special Land Rover has been brought to life by Chelsea Truck Co. and Kahn Design and showcases several upgrades that will soon be offered to customers. It could be perfect for Defender owners who want something a little different. Read: You Might Regret Buying The New Defender After Seeing This Classic Rebuild The most significant upgrade made is the fitment of new 20-inch Hammerhead RS-Forged wheels. While one could argue that 20-inch wheels are a little too big for a serious 4×4, they are clad in 33-inch all-terrain tires that should provide a good mix of on-road and off-road performance. Complementing these new wheels are flared fenders. Elsewhere, the tuners have tweaked the Defender’s headlights and designed a new spare wheel cover. The lower body panels also have a new 3D-textured protective paint finish. Chelsea Truck Co and Kahn Design have also added new rear diffuser spats in carbon fiber and installed a new hood with cooling vents. Inside, things get a bit more dramatic. The cabin is trimmed in a mix of black and blue leather across the seats, dash, and door panels, accented with piping in Britannia Blue for that extra touch of flair. According to Chelsea Truck Co, the exterior upgrades made to this Defender 90 will be offered to owners of both the Defender 90 and 110 models. These changes cost an eye-watering £25,000 (about $32,000 at current exchange rates), which seems like a lot, particularly since they don’t actually improve the Land Rover’s performance in any way. Yes, they make it look a little meaner, but is that worth the price of a brand new Toyota Camry?",
