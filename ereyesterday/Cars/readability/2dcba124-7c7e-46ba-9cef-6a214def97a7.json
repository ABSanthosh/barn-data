The car is finished in Active Red over gray cloth upholstery, and power comes from a turbocharged 2.5-liter RB25DET inline-six paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a carbon-fiber hood, GT-R–style bodywork, 19″ Kansai wheels, a Blitz turbo timer, an A’PEXi FC Commander, an HKS CAMP 2 display, an aftermarket air intake, a front-mount intercooler, and an SP Sports EXAS Evo Tune exhaust center section and muffler. This R34 Skyline is now offered by the selling dealer in Illinois at no reserve with a clean Georgia title. The car is finished in Active Red (AR2) and has been fitted with a carbon-fiber hood and a GT-R–style rear spoiler, bumpers, badges, and side skirts. The selling dealer notes that the front lip has been repaired in preparation of the sale. Staggered-width 19″ Kansei wheels are mounted with Haida tires. The car was factory-equipped with HICAS four-wheel steering and four-wheel disc brakes. Ultra Racing chassis braces have been added. The right-hand-drive cabin features bolstered bucket seats upholstered in gray cloth. Aftermarket additions include a Japanese-market touchscreen stereo, a Blitz turbo timer, and an A’PEXi FC Commander. The leather-wrapped Personal steering wheel frames a 180-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline and an inset oil pressure gauge, and readouts for fuel level and coolant temperature. An HKS CAMP 2 display has been fitted in the center of the dashboard and includes readouts for water temperature, boost pressure, battery voltage, and oil pressure and temperature. The digital odometer shows 115k kilometers (~71k miles). The turbocharged 2.5-liter RB25DET Neo inline-six has been fitted with an aftermarket air intake, a front-mount intercooler, and an SP Sports EXAS Evo Tune exhaust center section and muffler.
