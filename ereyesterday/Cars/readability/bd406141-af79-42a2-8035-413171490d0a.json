  "description": "Mahindra has revealed new details about its upcoming BE 6e and XEV 9e electric SUVs in the latest round of teasers. The all-new models are set to debut on November 26 and will be the first of ‘born EVs’ from the Indian brand. Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e to get 59kWh and 79kWh battery options Claimed 20-80% charge in 20 minutes with a 175kW charger Outputs range from 231hp to 286hp for RWD models Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e battery, charging details As we had reported, both e-SUVs are underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform. Both will also come with the option of 59kWh and 79kWh battery packs with an LFP (Lithium iron phosphate) chemistry. In addition, Mahindra has revealed that using a 175kW DC fast charger, the batteries can charge from 20 percent to 80 percent in just 20 minutes. Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e powertrain details The Mahindra BE 6e and XEV 9e will feature what the brand calls a ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ made up of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. The outputs for the motor range between 231hp and 286hp, depending on the application. Do note that these figures are for the rear axle-mounted motor only and that the BE 6e, which is expected to come in AWD form, will have a higher combined output due to the addition of a motor on the front axle. While other details are scarce, the company has said both e-SUVs will get drive modes, a semi-active suspension system and brake-by-wire technology. We already have some info on the interior and exterior of Mahindra’s BE 6e and XEV 9e, and more details on these models will be revealed closer to their debut on November 26. Stay tuned.
