  "text": "One of Chevy’s restored C10 pickups will receive a modern V8 engine from a Camaro March 5, 2025 at 19:53 by Brad Anderson The new Chevrolet Vintage program will restore classic models from the 1960s-1990s. Some of the most memorable cars in the program include the Opala, Chevette, and 3100. GM is already working on restoring a 1990 Monza Classic EF and a Chevrolet C10. Chevrolet has launched an intriguing restoration and restomod service for some of its classic models, but there’s a catch: it’s currently limited to the Brazilian market. This new initiative celebrates GM’s 100th anniversary in the country and kicks off with a handful of iconic cars. Unfortunately, there’s no word on whether a similar program will make its way to the U.S. anytime soon. The project is known as Chevrolet Vintage and looks to restore and modify several vehicles produced locally from the 1960s to the 1990, including the Opala, Chevette, and the 3100 Brasil pickup truck. The program offers two approaches: traditional restorations that focus on preserving the original charm and accessories of these classics, and restomods that integrate modern technology to enhance comfort, safety, and reliability. Read: This 1990 Chevy K1500 Silverado Looks Brand New After 35 Years And Just 1,245 Miles The company is already working on a couple of cars for the program. The first is a restoration on a 1990 Chevrolet Monza Classic EF. This car was a modified version of the Opel Ascona C built for Brazil and was the nation’s first car with electronic fuel injection. There’s no word on how much work is going into the car, nor is it clear if the Monza is owned by GM itself or has been commissioned by a private collector. Chevrolet Vintage is also giving the classic 1975 Chevrolet C10 pickup a restomod treatment, swapping in a V8 engine from a Camaro for a little extra muscle. Chevrolet Monza Classic – Brazil Several other automakers offer restoration programs, but typically, they’re reserved for high-priced models where it makes sense to spend a heap of money refurbishing and upgrading them. In Japan, Nissan operates a restoration program for classic Skyline models. It goes to great lengths to return the vehicle’s back to how they were when they left the factory, stripping them down, dipping the chassis to prevent rust from forming, and completely rebuilding engines to bring them back to factory-fresh condition. As for Chevy’s Vintage program? Well, let’s just say their press release is about as detailed as a coffee napkin. It’s unclear how deep the restorations and restomods will actually go. One thing’s for sure: this is still a pilot program, so if it doesn’t catch on, it could end up being as short-lived as the Monza’s stint as Brazil’s first car with electronic fuel injection.",
