  "description": "The Tesla Model Y facelift has gone on sale in select Asian countries and special administrative regions, bringing updates to every aspect, especially the range: 719km (CLTC estimate). The Australia and New Zealand Tesla websites show the facelifted EV as well. Besides Korea, the delivery timeline in these lands ranges between March and June. Only the Long Range AWD and RWD variants have been refreshed The revised Model Y (code name: Project Juniper) is 47mm longer than the previous car Initial deliveries will begin in China, one of the world’s top EV markets Other markets including North and South America, Europe and the Middle East still offer the pre-facelift Model Y. In January 2024, the Tesla Model Y was crowned the world’s best-selling vehicle, with then estimated sales of 1.23 million units. Tesla Model Y facelift dimensions, exterior, colors Aerodynamic 19-inch alloy wheels enhance range; connected rear LED bar is new The 2025 Model Y runs 4,797mm in length, 47mm more than the pre-facelift car. However, the width is a scant 1mm narrower at 1,624mm. Its drag coefficient (Cd) has reduced from 0.23 to 0.22, which can contribute to boosting range and reducing wind noise. This year’s update makes the electric SUV adopt Tesla’s new design language with a connected light strip identical to the Cybercab robotaxi. Nearly the entire face is sealed save for the air dam. Door handles on the side are electrically operated and blend in well with the doors for aero. For maximum range, 19-inch alloy wheels will be ideal; 20-inch ones are optional but less efficient. The width-wide LED treatment is followed at the back too and the bumper looks chunkier than before.  Color availability differs on a region-to-region basis Tesla is offering up to six shades with the Model Y electric vehicle, namely Pure Black (in Taiwan only), Starry Grey, Pearl White, Glacier Blue, Flame Red and Quicksilver. The nomenclature and availability of these shades differ in the Asian countries where the Tesla best-seller is offered.  Tesla Model Y facelift interior, features Inside, subtle changes were made to the materials used and equipment. To keep the dashboard uncluttered, the central 15.5-inch touchscreen houses all key controls of the car and runs on an updated OS. The front seats now get the ventilation function with new fabric upholstery. Tesla has further added an 8-inch touchscreen for rear passengers to play games and control AC, mounted just behind the front centre armrest. The Model Y's official boot capacity is unclear, but with the back seats folded down in the five-seater EV, it is over 2,130 litre (2,041 litre previously). Tesla Model Y facelift safety Tesla Model Y automatic lane change feature The Model Y’s monocoque body frame has been engineered to better absorb impact during a crash. Autonomous driving is taken care of by advanced driver assistance systems with hardware like a front autopilot camera and blind spot monitoring lights in the ORVMs. The over-the-air (OTA) updates-enabled touchscreen inside also displays lane change animations when self-driving. While a Basic autopilot package is standard with the Model Y, Enhanced and Full-Self Driving bundles are optional upgrades. Tesla Model Y facelift range, charging speed As mentioned earlier, only the Long Range AWD and RWD Model Y variants are refreshed as of now. They have claimed ranges of up to 719km and 662km per charge, respectively, according to the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC). For reference, this is up 117km and 59km to the older Model Y SUV. Even the 0 to 100kmph sprint time has improved by 0.5 seconds at 4.3 seconds in the AWD car and the single motor takes 0.6 seconds less at 5.9 seconds to clock the 100kph mark. Peak charging speed remains at 250kW, with up to 266km added in 15 minutes.  Also, see: Tesla restarts scouting for showroom space in Delhi Tesla Cybertruck image gallery",
