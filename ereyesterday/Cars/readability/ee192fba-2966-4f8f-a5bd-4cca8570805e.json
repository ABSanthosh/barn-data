  "description": "A fully electric E-Class is in the works and will be available by 2027, Mercedes-Benz confirmed during its Capital Market Day presentation. The electric sedan's launch in India could also happen later. Competing with Tesla and BMW, this new E-Class EV is expected to offer premium features and an extended range. The German marque also shared details about the S-Class facelift and a smaller derivative of the G-Class, which we have previously reported. Uniform design for petrol, diesel and electric four-wheelers E-Class EV to be larger than its ICE equivalent Smaller G-Class SUV to be called g for differentiation Mercedes E-Class electric details To pack Level 3 ADAS suite Representational image The teaser of the electric Mercedes sedan boasted a similar silhouette to the E-Class on sale at the moment and may blend elements from both its combustion-engine counterpart and next-generation Mercedes electric cars. This new E-Class EV will be larger than its ICE counterpart and feature advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) up to Level 3. It may arrive as a replacement for the EQE Sedan sold overseas and be sold alongside the E-Class petrol and diesel models. In India, Mercedes sells just the E-Class LWB, which is priced from Rs 78.5 lakh to 92.5 lakh. Mercedes S-Class facelift slated for 2026, EV by 2030 S-Class ICE and EV to be sold alongside in the coming years Representational image Featuring tech and styling updates, the facelifted S-Class is unlikely to receive changes in the existing set of powertrains. Customisation options with the 2026-bound luxury sedan will be expanded via the Mercedes Manufaktur range. The respective prices of the S 350d (diesel) and S 450 (petrol) are Rs 1.79 crore and Rs 1.89 crore, and a slight price increase is likely with the updated limousine. Additionally, Mercedes stated that an S-Class electric sedan is being considered and will arrive by the end of 2030.  Mercedes G-Class but smaller It is called 'g' instead of 'G' This is not the first time that the automaker has talked about developing a smaller version of its G-Class SUV. With the launch of the G-Class electric (officially called G 580 with EQ Technology), it is evident that Mercedes wants to expand its SUV line-up. The new SUV will get an internal combustion engine (ICE) and all-electric powertrains along with a four-wheel drive. Mercedes may also offer the 'baby’ G as a plug-in hybrid in some international markets. For differentiation, the nameplate of the upcoming mini G-Class will read ‘g’ instead of ‘G’. Just like the S-Class facelift, the Manufaktur package will be on offer here. For reference, the G 580 has a Rs 3 crore price tag, while the AMG G 63 is pricier at Rs 3.64 crore.  Mercedes GLC EV and C-Class EV to launch in 2026 Both electric vehicles are part of the brand's 'core luxury' faction  2026 will also see the arrival of the Mercedes GLC electric SUV and C-Class EV. The upcoming electric version of the GLC and C-Class will sit in the 'core luxury' segment, currently occupied by the likes of the CLE and E-Class globally. Both may be underpinned by the MMA platform, which will be used in the new CLA sedan.
