This HRC Grom Cup was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, and it is now offered for off-road use only in Florida with a rear stand and a bill of sale. The bodywork is finished in red, white, light blue, and dark blue HRC livery with white Honda script and wing decals. Equipment includes a black solo seat, a lower body cowl, a rear tail panel, and rear set foot controls. Black-finished 12″ alloy wheels with red Grom script wear IRC tires. Suspension consists of an inverted fork as well as a monoshock connected to the swingarm. Braking is handled by red-finished Nissin calipers fitted over cross-drilled discs at both ends. The black handlebar carries black grips, a twist-grip throttle, and clutch and brake levers. The LCD display is set ahead of the top triple clamp and contains multiple displays including a tachometer, a fuel level gauge, a speedometer, and a gear indicator. The odometer shows zero kilometers. There is no keyed ignition. The air-cooled 124cc SOHC single features electronic fuel injection, an electric starter, CD ignition, and a Endurance Racing upswept right-exit exhaust. The bike has not been ridden by the selling dealer. A video showing the bike running can be viewed in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a drive chain.
