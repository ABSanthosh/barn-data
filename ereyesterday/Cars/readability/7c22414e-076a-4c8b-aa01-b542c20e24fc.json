  "description": "This 1967 Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 is one of 455 Series II examples produced between 1965 and 1967. Chassis 7575 was delivered new in Beirut, Lebanon, and was exported to Canada prior to 1975. It was imported to the US later in the 1970s and spent time in several states and Mexico before it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. The car is finished in silver over black leather upholstery, and power comes from a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 paired with a five-speed manual gearbox. Equipment includes triple Weber carburetors, a limited-slip differential, an ANSA quad-exit exhaust, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 15” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, a 330 GT Series I dashboard, and a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio. This 330 GT is now offered on dealer consignment in Scottsdale, Arizona, with factory literature, tools, service records, and a clean Colorado title.",

Equipment includes triple Weber carburetors, a limited-slip differential, an ANSA quad-exit exhaust, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 15” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, a 330 GT Series I dashboard, and a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio. This 330 GT is now offered on dealer consignment in Scottsdale, Arizona, with factory literature, tools, service records, and a clean Colorado title. Designed by Tom Tjaarda at Pininfarina, the 330 GT debuted at the Brussels Motor Show in early 1964 as a replacement for the 330 America. It features a longer wheelbase and a wider grille than its predecessor. The Series II model was introduced in 1965 and featured styling updates that included single headlights, three-louver fender vents, and bumpers with rubber-lined overriders. This example has been refinished in silver and features a Talbot driver-side mirror, pop-out rear quarter windows, Pininfarina quarter panel badges, a retractable antenna, and an ANSA quad-exit exhaust. Borrani wire wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in 215/70VR15 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires that were installed in October 2020. A Campagnolo alloy wheel mounted with a Michelin tire is stowed beneath the trunk floor. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes with a dual-circuit master cylinder and a single Dunlop booster. The left-hand-drive cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench seat that were retrimmed in black leather in the 2000s. The car is outfitted with a wood-paneled 330 GT Series I dashboard, and replacement red carpets are protected by darker mats. Additional equipment includes power windows with door-mounted switches as well as air conditioning, a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, a Pininfarina-branded ashtray, and lap belts. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. Additional readouts for water temperature, amperage, and fuel level are mounted in the center of the dash along with a clock. The five-digit odometer shows 65k kilometers (~40k miles), approximately 5k kilometers of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter Colombo Tipo 209 V12 breathes through triple Weber carburetors and was factory rated at 300 horsepower. A top-end rebuild was performed by Exclusive Motorcars of Arizona in October 2018, and work included the installation of a replacement timing chain, valves, and an electronic ignition system as well as rebuilds of the cylinder heads, carburetors, and water pump. Service performed in 2022 included the installation of a replacement battery and a fuel leak repair. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the latter of which was rebuilt in 2012. You are not connected to real-time updates.
