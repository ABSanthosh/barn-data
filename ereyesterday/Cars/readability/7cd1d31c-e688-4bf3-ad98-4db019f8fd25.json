  "text": "One of the cars coming to Spring Fest will be equipped with matte black stripes, and it sounds like they could eventually be offered as an option March 21, 2025 at 20:28 by Michael Gauthier Spring Fest is returning after a five year absence and will celebrate Stellantis performance. Dodge will use the event to showcase customized versions of the new Charger Daytona. One of the models will have matte black stripes with red accents and Fratzog logos. The Spring Festival of LX is back after a five-year break, and it’s coming in hot with a fresh new identity—this time, as the home of all things related to Stellantis performance. This means Chargers, Challengers, Magnums, and 300s will be joined by Durangos, Grand Cherokees, and Ram 1500 TRXs. While it’s notable that Spring Fest is marking a return (March 21-22, 2025), we’re more interested in Dodge’s participation as they’ll be using the event to showcase customized versions of the new Charger Daytona. One of them will be a black liftback that features matte black stripes with red edging. More: Dodge Promotes Charger’s Standard AWD System As Discounts Top $12k The stripes sport the Fratzog logo and Dodge said they’re compatible on cars with both glass and steel roofs. On models with the former, occupants can look up and see the Fratzog pattern through the glass. That sounds like they’re headed for production and Dodge noted “stripes have long been a popular customization option for … muscle lovers looking to add a distinctive look to their vehicle.” In fact, Mopar offered three different stripe kits for the Challenger. While LX fans will likely be peeved about the lack of a V8 engine, Dodge CEO Matt McAlear said, “California has been among the top-selling states for Charger and is the largest EV market in the United States with more than 376,000 EV registrations last year alone – that’s three times the number of EV registrations than the next closest state, so there’s a huge opportunity to reach new customers and Charger fans alike.” He added, “Spring Fest is one of the many customer events that gives us a great opportunity to meet with our owners in this region in person, give them a chance to learn about our newest products, show potential new customization options and get their direct feedback.” Speaking of which, officials will be on hand for roundtable discussions and customer clinics to get feedback. Attendees can also vote on potential future colors for the Charger and they’d be Plum Crazy not to choose purple or Sassy Grass.",
