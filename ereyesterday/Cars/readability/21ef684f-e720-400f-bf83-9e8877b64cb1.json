The car is finished in Silver Gray Metallic (A08) and is equipped with a black convertible soft top as well as xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, and quad exhaust outlets. The 18″ M double-spoke Style 67 wheels are mounted with 225/45 front and 255/40 rear Bridgestone Potenza RE980 AS tires that show 2023 and 2024 date codes. The car was factory equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs. The heated power-adjustable front sport seats and door-panel inserts are upholstered in black Nappa leather, and the cabin features a black dashboard with Brushed Aluminum Shadow trim accents. Interior amenities include cruise control, navigation, Harman Kardon audio, and automatic climate control. The multi-function leather-wrapped steering wheel features M-color stitching and frames a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 33k miles. The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was factory rated at 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque.
