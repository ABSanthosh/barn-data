Finished in dark blue over Maroon leatherette, it has 15″ slotted steel wheels, front disc brakes, and a push-button AM radio. A four-speed manual transmission is paired with its 1.8-liter inline-four, which was serviced along with the steering in preparation for the sale. This 122S is offered with tools, accessories, and a clean Pennsylvania title. Finished at the factory in dark blue (96), the body was repainted circa 1980, and flaws at the front of the hood are noted along with a replacement mirror and side moldings. Metal repairs to the floors were completed under previous ownership. The 15″ slotted steel wheels have bright hubcaps and are mounted with 165-series Michelin thin-whitewall tires. Front disc brakes are paired with rear drums. The steering tie rod ends were replaced in 2024 according to the selling dealer. The front bucket seats and folding rear bench are upholstered in maroon leatherette. Appointments include a perforated headliner, a replacement dashboard pad, an AM radio, and a digital clock. The two-spoke steering wheel frames a VDO horizontal-sweep 120-mph speedometer above gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. Approximately 4k miles are showing on the five-digit odometer, which has rolled over once, per the selling dealer. The 1.8-liter B18D inline-four was equipped at the factory with dual SU carburetors for a rating of 100 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque when new. The selling dealer reports replacing its water pump, battery, and engine oil. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Tools, road flares, and a work light accompany the car. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
