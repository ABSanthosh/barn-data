  "text": "If you held out when Demon 170s first made it to dealers, you can pick one up with a couple hundred miles and know that you saved tens of thousands February 2, 2025 at 19:17 by Stephen Rivers Prices for the Dodge Challenger Demon 170 are looking a lot more reasonable these days. These four-figure horsepower generators are trading hands for under $150,000 regularly. That figure is still well above what the company asked for one when it was brand new. When the Dodge Demon 170 hit dealer lots, the only thing more absurd than its 1,025-horsepower output was the shameless markups that came with it from numerous dealers. We saw it time and time again—some dealers had the audacity to ask nearly $400,000 for one. Fast forward to today, and reality has set in. Now, these cars are regularly changing hands for $150,000 or even less. These aren’t private sales only either. Here’s a dealer in Illinois selling a Demon 170 with just 161 miles for $149,995. Sure, that’s about $25,000 more than MSRP when new, but it’s a full $100,000 less than many dealers asked when the Demon 170 came out. More: VIN-Matched Dodge Demon Pair Sell For Less Than Some Paid For One Demon 170 This Demon 170 is sitting at a dealer in Florida, where they’re asking $149,900 for it. What’s impressive – apart from the performance, of course – is that it has just 268 miles on the odometer. Those willing to dig a little deeper can find dealers on Facebook groups or forums with even more attractive offers. Kramer DCJR is selling a Demon 170 for $145,000 with 818 miles on the odo, but those willing to do a little research online can find a salesman there offering that same car for $137,000. Auction sites offer potential savings too. The last Demon 170 to go up for auction on Bring A Trailer didn’t meet the reserve at $151,000. The last one to sell went for just $123,222. The last sale before that traded hands for $131,000. It had just 947 miles on the odometer, so it’s not exactly as if it was put up wet and left out to dry. Auction sites have also seen prices dip below dealer listings. The last Demon 170 on Bring a Trailer failed to meet its reserve at $151,000, while the most recent sale closed at just $123,222. Before that, another one traded hands for $131,000. It had just 947 miles on the odometer, so it’s not exactly as if it was put up wet and left out to dry. As you read this, a black Demon 170 with practically delivery mileage (just 16 miles) is up for auction on Bring A Trailer. With two days remaining, the current bid sits at a cool $123,000. We’ll see how much that sells for next week. Interested buyers can take comfort in knowing they’ve saved tens of thousands simply by letting depreciation do its work.
