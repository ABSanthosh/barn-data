  "description": "This 1976 Ford Bronco was acquired by the current owner in 2014. Refurbishment and customization work performed over the following two years is detailed below on records totaling nearly $90k, and involved modifying the body, refinishing the exterior in metallic blue, powder-coating the family-style roll cage, and adding a custom-fitted tan soft top, a Smittybilt winch, power-deployable side steps, and aftermarket bumpers. The interior was reupholstered in tan leather and outfitted with a widened rear bench seat, color-coordinated trim, satin billet-style accents, new carpeting, a woodgrain steering wheel, a lockable center console, a replacement gauge cluster, a heater, and a custom sound system consisting of a Huntington retro-style stereo with SiriusXM capability, a subwoofer, and Focal speakers. The bored and stroked 331ci small-block Ford V8 features Holley HP electronic fuel injection (EFI) and a custom-fabricated exhaust system, and is linked to an automatic transmission and a Dana 20 dual-range transfer case. The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Bilstein dampers and Skyjacker front springs and 18\" polished aluminum wheels with 35\" BFGoodrich tires, and utilizes power-assisted steering, a Hydroboost unit, front disc brakes,  and manually locking front hubs. This Bronco is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a New York title in the owner's name.",

The bored and stroked 331ci small-block Ford V8 features Holley HP electronic fuel injection (EFI) and a custom-fabricated exhaust system, and is linked to an automatic transmission and a Dana 20 dual-range transfer case. The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Bilstein dampers and Skyjacker front springs and 18″ polished aluminum wheels with 35″ BFGoodrich tires, and utilizes power-assisted steering, a Hydroboost unit, front disc brakes,  and manually locking front hubs. This Bronco is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a New York title in the owner’s name. The truck was repainted in metallic blue after it received a fiberglass cowl induction-style hood in addition to replacement rocker panels, doors, upper door frames, inner door tracks, door hinges, and door seals in 2016. The aftermarket bumpers were powder-coated in black, and Bushwhacker flares were affixed to the front fenders and the cut rear fenders. Exterior details include a tan soft top, a Smittybilt XRC 10 winch, hood pins, power-deployable side steps, and dual mirrors. The seller notes cracks in the finish on the hood. Eight-hole 18″ polished aluminum wheels are mounted with 35×12.5″ BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A KM2 tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, and it rides on a lifted suspension with Bilstein dampers and Skyjacker front springs. A Hydratech Hydroboost unit supplies power assistance for front disc brakes and rear drum brakes, and a dual-reservoir master cylinder has been installed. A replacement power steering pump was installed in January 2018, and the steering was serviced via the removal of a drop bracket and centering the front differential in July 2021. Work in April 2024 included replacing the front wheel bearings along with the front brake calipers, pads, and rotors. The front seats and the widened rear bench seat are trimmed in tan leather, and they are complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard pad, center armrest, transfer case shifter boot, and door panels. German square-weave carpeting lines the floors, and appointments include a heater, a lockable center console, USB charging outlets, a powder-coated family-style roll cage with three-point seat belts, and billet-style dashboard knobs and pedals. The subwoofer and the Focal speakers are linked to a Huntington retro-style stereo, which the seller tells us has SiriusXM satellite radio connectivity. The three-spoke steering wheel has a mahogany woodgrain rim, and it sits ahead of a replacement 100-mph speedometer encircled by an ammeter and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The speedometer was recalibrated in 2021. The five-digit odometer shows 4k miles, and the seller states the mileage is not accurate. Total mileage is unknown. The replacement 331ci Ford V8 is said to have been bored and stroked, and is equipped with a Holley HP electronic fuel injection (EFI) system, an electronic fuel pump, an aluminum radiator with an electric fan, and a dual Optima battery system. A replacement alternator was fitted in December 2017. The truck is equipped with a custom-fabricated exhaust system, and the muffler was cleaned and welded in June 2021. Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through an automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The rear main seal and flexplate were replaced along with a driveshaft U-joint in January 2018, at which time an aftermarket transmission oil pan was installed. The Dana 20 dual-range transfer case was re-sealed in July 2021. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
