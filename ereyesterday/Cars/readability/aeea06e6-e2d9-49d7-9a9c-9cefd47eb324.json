  "text": "The Corvette is priced at $41,000, which isn't cheap, but considering its performance, it could be a steal for someone February 5, 2025 at 19:57 by Brad Anderson The build is based on the chassis of a C5 but has C3 panels and many parts from a C7. Feeding the rear wheels is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V8 recently detuned (!) to 800 hp. Despite the drastic modifications made, the car remains street legal in the United States. The seller of this heavily modified Chevrolet C5 Corvette claims the next owner will “be the coolest kid on the block.” Given the sheer audacity of this build, they might actually have a point. Whether that’s a good thing or a sign of automotive sacrilege is up for debate. Some enthusiasts will love the aggressive, track-ready aesthetic, while others may need a moment to recover. At its core, this creation is a C5 Corvette, but it’s been draped in custom bodywork inspired by the C3. It looks a little like a creation you’d expect to see on the set of a Mad Max film, with a wild front fascia that includes a large splitter and pop-up headlights. But it’s when viewed from the rear that the car’s track-focused nature becomes immediately clear. Read: What Made Someone Pay $330,000 For A Run-Of-The-Mill C6 Corvette? It’s equipped with an adjustable rear lip spoiler, aftermarket taillights, and a dramatic carbon fiber diffuser. There are also plenty of parts from a 2017 C6 Corvette Z06, as well as adjustable coilovers and Ridetech sway bars. Without a doubt, the highlight of this crazy Corvette is the engine. It’s a re-built 6.0-liter LS V8 with two turbochargers, an MSD Airforce intake, a new throttle body, a high-flow fuel pump, and a KRC power steering pump. According to the seller, this V8 has been detuned to 800 hp. There’s no word on how much it delivers when the boost is turned up, but we suspect this thing is an absolute weapon. The engine is paired to a six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels. A look inside the cabin reveals that very few original Corvette parts have been retained. The interior has been stripped and rebuilt with Sparco seats, a Sparco steering wheel, a custom carbon fiber dashboard, and aftermarket gauges. Despite its extreme looks, the seller insists it’s street-legal. Whether it’s comfortable enough for actual road use is another matter, but let’s be real here, if you’re considering a Corvette like this, ride quality probably isn’t high on your list of concerns. If this wild ‘Vette is calling your name, you can check out the Marketplace listing for more details. The asking price? $41,000. Whether that’s a steal or a splurge depends on how much you value speed, uniqueness, and the ability to terrify your neighbors.",
