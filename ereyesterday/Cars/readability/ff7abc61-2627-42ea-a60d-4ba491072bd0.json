  "description": "The Packtalk Pro sits above the Packtalk Edge, which I have been using nonstop across three different helmets for the last three years, come rain or shine. The Pro uses the same form factor with its clever magnetic mounting system, and it also continues with the same intuitive button layout. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the Edge, which continues to work perfectly well, but Big Bad Bikes sent us this latest unit to see what’s new. There are essentially three significant updates you get here, two of which are enabled by the incorporation of a new chip. The first of these is a new crash-detection system. I’m glad to report that I haven’t tested this fully, but the theory is that it detects when you have had a fall and then calls a pre-selected number if you don’t disable the prompt within 30 seconds. You do need to have your phone’s location data running full-time for this to work, and that does take a toll on battery life. The second new feature is that the device switches off if you leave it lying stationary for a while. As someone who constantly forgets to turn the communicator off, I appreciate this smart feature. It also switches back on when you move the helmet, although this can be manually overridden. Finally, there’s the move to new 45mm JBL speakers, which aren’t a massive improvement over the already very good 40mm speakers in the Edge but do get noticeably louder. The rest is the same as before, including excellent noise cancelling, voice recognition and long battery life with a convenient quick charging capability. However, the Pro does come in a new black colour, which I think looks better than the grey Edge. Larger 45mm speakers are noticeably louder. At Rs 43,999, the Pro costs about Rs 6,000 more than the Edge, which is a reasonable increase when you think that just the 45mm speakers alone cost Rs 11,000 when purchased as an extra. At the same time, while the Pro’s added features are nice to have, I wouldn’t call them absolute necessities. Whichever one of these two admittedly expensive devices you end up picking, you will have what I rate as the best Bluetooth communicator out there.
