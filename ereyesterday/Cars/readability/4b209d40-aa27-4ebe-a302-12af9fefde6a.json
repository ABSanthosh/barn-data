The car has 3,700 kilometers (~2,300 miles), and power comes from a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and a trio of electric motors that drive all four wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It is further equipped with a 7.9-kWh lithium-ion battery, 20″ five-spoke forged wheels, a regenerative braking system with yellow-painted calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors, carbon-fiber exterior and interior accents, a suspension lift system, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a rear wing, a JBL sound system, adaptive headlights, parking sensors, front and rear cameras, and navigation. This SF90 Stradale was purchased new by the seller and is now offered with the owner’s manual, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration. The SF90 was designed by director Flavio Manzoni’s team at the Ferrari Styling Center and was introduced to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team. This example is finished in Verde Medio and has a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, side air splitters, side skirts, front bumper cover inserts, and front spoiler. Additional details include adaptive headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear cameras, and front and rear parking sensors. A Formula 1–inspired drag-reduction system utilizes active aerodynamics, a two-piece rear wing, and underbody vortex generators. The 20″ five-spoke forged wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. The SF90 features an aluminum chassis as well as a magnetorheological suspension. The electronic Side Slip Control (eSSC) system can distribute torque to all four wheels, while the electric traction control system (eTC) can deliver power to individual corners. The regenerative brake system is controlled via a brake-by-wire system that splits braking between the hydraulic system and the electric motors. Yellow-finished calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors are fitted at all four corners. A suspension lift system was optioned from the factory. The power-adjustable bucket seats are trimmed in beige Tradizione leather with Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Interior appointments include an electrochromic rearview mirror, a leather headliner, a JBL sound system, navigation, floor mats, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted carbon-fiber paddle shifters and is equipped with an engine-start button, a manettino driving-mode selector, and shift lights. The digital instrument cluster is complemented by a head-up display. The digital odometer indicates 3,700 kilometers (~2,300 miles), all of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter F154 FA V8 is paired with a trio of electric motors for a combined power output of 986 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. A 7.9-kWh lithium-ion battery pack is mounted between the engine and the carbon-fiber cabin bulkhead. Power is routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A plaque affixed to the front trunk lists the serial number, color scheme, and optional equipment. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
