  "description": "This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro coupe was the subject of a custom build over a decade ago that included refinishing the body in blue following custom bodywork that included smoothing the front valance and installing an RS-style front grille, a cowl hood, a painted rear bumper, and brushed taillight bezels and mirrors. The current owner commissioned the installation of an ATK Racing 383ci V8 in 2016, and the car is also equipped with an Edelbrock intake manifold, aluminum cylinder heads, an aluminum radiator, and coated exhaust headers. Inside, a custom center console and door panels are trimmed in black and accompanied by coordinated seats, an aftermarket steering wheel, aftermarket air conditioning, a Kenwood stereo, and Dakota Digital gauges. The car rides on a Hotchkis suspension kit with subframe connectors, and 18\" Rushforth wheels are mounted over four-wheel disc brakes. This modified Camaro is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with service records and a clean New Jersey title in the owner's name.",

The car rides on a Hotchkis suspension kit with subframe connectors, and 18″ Rushforth wheels are mounted over four-wheel disc brakes. This modified Camaro is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with service records and a clean New Jersey title in the owner’s name. The body was modified and refinished in metallic blue under prior ownership. Details include a shaved front bumper and side markers, smoothed front valance seams, an RS-style grille, a rear spoiler, a tucked and painted rear bumper, a cowl hood with hood pins, and aftermarket mirrors and taillight bezels with a brushed silver finish. The car rides on a Hotchkis suspension kit consisting of tubular front control arms, front coil springs, subframe connectors, and front and rear sway bars. It is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. Machine-finished Rushforth wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 275/40 rear Nitto NT555 tires. The cabin features a custom center console and door panels as well as front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in black vinyl. An aftermarket shifter and cupholders are installed in the center console, and additional equipment includes an aftermarket air conditioning system, a Kenwood CD stereo housed within a bowtie-branded bezel, and package shelf-mounted speakers. Dakota Digital gauges consist of a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, dual digital displays, and readouts for fuel level, volts, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 22k miles, which is said to be the mileage added since the gauges were installed in 2015. The 383ci stroker V8 crate engine was sourced from ATK High Performance Engines and installed in 2016. It is equipped with aluminum cylinder heads, an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a Quick Fuel Technologies carburetor, and an HEI distributor. An aluminum firewall cover panel is installed, an aluminum radiator is accompanied by dual electric cooling fans, and coated headers feed into a dual exhaust system. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a 10-bolt rear end. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
