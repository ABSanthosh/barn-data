Older vehicles, particularly from the 1930s, were not really designed for modern conditions. Road speeds are much higher than they were back in the day, plus there’s more traffic and everyone seems to be in a hurry, or worse – distracted by their phones.",

Simple upgrades like super-bright LED taillights, turn signals and electric windshield wipers can dramatically improve safety. A dual exhaust system can spice things up, adding an electric fuel pump helps prevent drivability issues with modern gasoline, and adding sound deadener can cut down on noise and heat intrusion for a more comfortable drive.AutoEsoterica host Craig Cole’s beautiful black 1936 Ford V8 sedan looks stock, but it’s really not. Over the years he’s made a range of minor upgrades, mostly invisible changes that have dramatically improved the enjoyability of this classic car.
