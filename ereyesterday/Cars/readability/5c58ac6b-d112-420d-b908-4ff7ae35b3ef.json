  "description": "This 2024 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was specified with a paint-to-sample Viola Purple Metallic exterior finish in addition to the $33k Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. The car features a customized aftermarket sound system and is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED-Matrix Design headlights, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, 20\" and 21\" center-locking wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior and exterior accents, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential. Having 765 miles, this 992 GT3 RS was purchased by the owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a window sticker, the owner's manual, a 2024 service record, two keys, accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",

The car features a customized aftermarket sound system and is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED-Matrix Design headlights, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior and exterior accents, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential. Having 765 miles, this 992 GT3 RS was purchased by the owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a 2024 service record, two keys, accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. The CFRP panels are finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave on Weissach Package-equipped cars. This example is finished in paint-to-sample Viola Purple Metallic and has LED-Matrix Design headlights, a rear fog light, GT3 RS decals, a backup camera, rear parking sensors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Black-finished lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear center-lock wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering, a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Race-Tex inserts, “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests, and contrasting stitching that extends to the center console, dashboard, steering column, and door panels. A customized aftermarket sound system comprised of a Focal P60 Limited Edition Utopia kit, a Helix V Twelve DSP Mk2 amplifier, a NAV-TV ZEN-V sound processor, and a Trulli TD10S 10″ subwoofer with a custom-built enclosure was installed in December 2024, along with sound deadening material. Additional appointments include carbon-fiber trim accents, a fire extinguisher, Porsche-branded floor mats, illuminated door sill guards, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The Race-Tex-trimmed steering wheel features a centering stripe and drive-mode selector dials, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 765 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) Plus. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche South Bay in Hawthorne, California, along with factory options and a total price of $329,920. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien on the car, and the current owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
