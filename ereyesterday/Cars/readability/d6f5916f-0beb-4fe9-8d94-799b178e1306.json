It is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. The car was factory optioned with forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, and a McIntosh stereo system. Additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. This Ford GT is now offered in Illinois by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title. The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 766 finished in Mark IV Red for the model year, and it is not equipped with racing stripes. Features include side tape stripes, Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are wrapped in Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 4,700 miles. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
