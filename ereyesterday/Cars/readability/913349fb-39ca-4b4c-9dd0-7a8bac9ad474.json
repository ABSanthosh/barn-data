As is always the case when we get a holiday during the week, we will post if there's breaking news or we find a reason to get some content online, but otherwise we're going to hunker down to avoid the cold and we'll be back at it on Tuesday. If you're, like us, off from work, enjoy it. If not, sorry. Either way, take a moment to reflect on what MLK stood for and what he did.We all can stand to learn from him.[Image: erwin_wirapratama/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.
