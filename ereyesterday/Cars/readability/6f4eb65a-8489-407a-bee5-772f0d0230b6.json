  "description": "The modern Triumph Bonneville T120 is a true sleeper. Its gentlemanly aesthetic follows the traditional Bonneville formula, but its rumbling parallel-twin motor kicks out 105 Nm of torque at just 3,500 rpm. It’s handsome and remarkably comfortable—and it’s not shy about getting down. This Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker from China’s Mandrill Garage is an entirely different beast. It’s shed the T120’s mild-mannered looks for a muscular vibe—one that, if we’re being honest, would make a fine addition to Triumph’s current model range. Based in Beijing, Mandrill is more than just a custom bike garage. They run a bar and restaurant too, flexing their creative muscles with everything from cocktails to clothing. Their eclecticism is reflected in their custom motorcycles, which typically feature contemporary lines, high-end finishes, and vibrant liveries—just like this T120.…",

Its gentlemanly aesthetic follows the traditional Bonneville formula, but its rumbling parallel-twin motor kicks out 105 Nm of torque at just 3,500 rpm. It’s handsome and remarkably comfortable—and it’s not shy about getting down. This Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker from China’s Mandrill Garage is an entirely different beast. It’s shed the T120’s mild-mannered looks for a muscular vibe—one that, if we’re being honest, would make a fine addition to Triumph’s current model range. Based in Beijing, Mandrill is more than just a custom bike garage. They run a bar and restaurant too, flexing their creative muscles with everything from cocktails to clothing. Their eclecticism is reflected in their custom motorcycles, which typically feature contemporary lines, high-end finishes, and vibrant liveries—just like this T120. “In terms of design, I wanted a classic flat tracker, but I also wanted it to be usable on the street,” says shop boss Luo Hao. “So I kept the front brakes, and installed lights and turn signals. The overall shape had to be as ‘standard’ as possible.” Mandrill achieved Luo’s vision by cleverly mixing and matching repurposed, aftermarket, and one-off parts. The fuel tank was transplanted from a Triumph Scrambler 900, creating a slimmer look while still accommodating a fuel pump. A traditional flat track tail section sits behind the tank, topped off with a seat pad that bears an embroidered Mandrill logo. A compact LED taillight is embedded into the rear lip of the tailpiece, with tiny LED turn signals attached to its sides. The right-hand side of the bike is dominated by a bespoke two-into-two titanium exhaust system, covered with more than enough heat protection to keep the rider’s leg from being roasted. The whole setup, including the heat shields, weighs just three kilos [6.6 lbs]—significantly less than the stock system. On the opposite side of the bike, a slanted rectangular side cover reflects the shape of the number board mounted over the mufflers. There’s more custom bodywork further forward, where new radiator shrouds host the front turn signals. According to Luo, advances in 3D printing made Mandrill’s job easier on this project. Some parts could be printed outright using a robust printable nylon, while others were prototyped out of resin before being CNC-machined out of aluminum, which helped eliminate much guesswork. The race-inspired headlight nacelle is one example. It uses a 3D-printed structure that houses a pair of Baja Designs lights, with a carbon fiber front plate to finish it off. Custom-made fork guards sit lower down. The cockpit features a set of wide Renthal flat track handlebars, mounted on pullback risers and fitted with 3D-printed switch-blocks. Mandrill also installed Brembo levers and a pair of svelte bar-end mirrors. A Motogadget Motoscope Tiny speedo is tucked below the bars, via a mount that’s stuck to the fuel tank. Moving to the engine, Mandrill swapped the covers out for a full set of ribbed items from Motone in the UK. The airbox was ditched in favor of a pair of bespoke air filters, made with aluminum housings and foam internals. The crew also installed a lightweight Lithium-ion battery that’s hidden behind the T120’s generous sump guard and features an on-off switch that helps to prevent drainage during long-term storage. Finally, the team tweaked the T120’s stance by swapping the 17” rear wheel out for an 18” hoop to match the front. Other upgrades include Öhlins rear shocks and Brembo brake calipers at both ends. Finished in a vivid paint scheme that vaguely recalls the Honda Rothmans liveries of yore, Mandrill’s Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker feels a lot like a factory special. If only… Mandrill Garage",

The airbox was ditched in favor of a pair of bespoke air filters, made with aluminum housings and foam internals. The crew also installed a lightweight Lithium-ion battery that’s hidden behind the T120’s generous sump guard and features an on-off switch that helps to prevent drainage during long-term storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker by Mandrill Garage\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/triumph-bonneville-t120-street-tracker-9.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nFinally, the team tweaked the T120’s stance by swapping the 17” rear wheel out for an 18” hoop to match the front.
