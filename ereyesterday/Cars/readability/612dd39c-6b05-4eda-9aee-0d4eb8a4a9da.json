  "description": "Audi has been on an electric onslaught in India with the e-tron models. The last RS was an EV in the form of the violent but silent RS e-tron. Now, though, the grapevine has it that Audi is considering entering the hot hatch segment with the baby RS – the RS 3. And not just that, Audi is expected to bring in the RS 3 in both hatchback and sedan forms as a double whammy for Merc’s baby rocket – the AMG A 45 S. The RS 3 packs in the legendary 5-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, over 400hp and a secret trick (find out in a bit) under its sleeve that transforms its character. We drive it in Spain to get a hint of what to expect next year. 2025 Audi RS 3 design At first glance, the RS 3 carries all the typical Audi cues, with straight lines and a serious look. The sharp LED headlamps feature four types of DRL themes, including a racy, chequered flag look to go with the character. The wide and gloss black hexagonal grille takes up a majority of the real estate up front, with air intakes on the aggressive-looking bumpers and some carbon-fibre bits to keep weight down. The profile (in this case, the sedan) looks sleek and superbly proportioned. Fans of the three-box design will appreciate the balance and subtle use of lines, and the 19-inch wheels do the trick and fit in very well. Wrapped around them are Pirelli P-Zero R tyres, which are standard, but one can also opt for the more track-focused TrofeoRs for best track performance. You’d also notice flared wheel arches that also feature vents within for better aero. There is carbon fibre on the ORVMs and door sill, too. 19-inch alloys and a low tyre profile. At the rear, the only shouty bits, pun intended, are the oval exhaust tips poking out. Wrapped around them is a gloss-black diffuser with some more carbon fibre. LED tail-lamps add a final touch of bling. There is also a carbon-fibre spoiler, and given that this is an RS, there is not a speck of chrome to be seen. You want bling? Stick to the As. 2025 Audi RS 3 interior and features Inside, the RS 3 is all about sportiness, thanks to a blacked-out interior that is bathed in Race-Tex and leatherette. It gets sports seats as standard, but Audi also offers carbon-fibre bucket seats (as seen on the test car here) as an option. The latter hold you tight in place and feel like a nice, warm hug. That said, while the support and bolstering are incredible, the cushioning has a softness that results in better comfort, too. More on that in a bit. Then, we have the steering that gets a flat top and bottom, along with dedicated buttons for Performance and RS modes. The steering-mounted controls are on a haptic touchpad, but thankfully, the centre console features proper physical buttons for basic controls. Carbon-fibre bucket seats are hugely supportive and also very well-cushioned. There is no dual-screen layout here like on the bigger Audis, just a basic 10.1-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and all the features you’d expect. The AC vents, media controls and auxiliary functions all have dedicated buttons that are very easy to use. There is also a sweet-sounding, high-end SONOS audio system, but nothing that can top the sweet and raspy exhaust note of the five-cylinder engine. In the back, the RS 3 struggles for room, especially if you measure over six feet. The kneeroom is at a premium, and while there is some space under the front seats for your feet, the short squabs rob away under-thigh support as well. The headroom is just about enough, and a hump in the centre prevents a middle passenger from sitting comfortably, thereby making it a four-seater realistically. There are AC vents and charging provisions, but you’d be comfy in the rear only for short trips. Not spacious in the rear: two adults can just about fit, and three would be very tight. The boot space in the sedan is a decent 321 litres, with 281 litres for the hatchback version. 2025 Audi RS 3 performance A 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbo-petrol engine with 400hp and 500Nm powers the RS 3, and while 400hp might seem low for an RS badge, the 1.5-tonne weight means the power-to-weight ratio is a healthy 255hp per tonne. 0-100kph takes just 3.8 seconds, and the top speed is locked at 250kph – strong numbers and a very impressive fact sheet, but the RS 3 is all about the experience from behind the wheel. The raspy exhaust of a five-cylinder is distinctive even when idling. But get going, and the sound just gets better and better as the needle climbs. On a race track in performance mode, the RS 3 can utilise a lot of that 400hp, but the real surprise is how adept the engine feels out on the streets. The 7-speed gearbox mellows down, the shifts are smooth, and the engine dials down the adrenaline; it can putter around with little drama. However, the strengths of the RS 3 can be found in corners. The 5-cylinder engine sounds glorious and has plenty of power.   2025 Audi RS 3 handling and ride quality When it comes to tech on the RS 3, Audi took their very own “VorsprungdurchTechnik” (progress through technology) very seriously indeed. It might seem like a basic job for a light car with a powerful engine, but hidden away is incredible tech that helps put all that power down. The RS 3 also holds the record in its class at the Nürburgring, with a time of 7 minutes and 33 seconds, which is obviously quicker than its predecessor. But more importantly, it is a whopping 15 seconds quicker than the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S. The reason? A new torque vectoring system, which allows for variable torque on the rear axle. Essentially, the power that goes to the rear wheels can be altered depending on which wheel needs it more. It uses data from the steering angle, throttle position, wheel-speed sensor and the handling gods to rotate the car better on its axis and absolutely negate any understeer. As the outside wheel gets more power, it brakes the inner wheel to avoid grip losses and gain better control. Apart from this complex Quattro system, there is something called “RS Torque Rear mode”, which sends nearly all of the power to the rear wheels and allows for controlled slides like a full-blown RWD car. It is similar to the Drift Mode you get on the A 45 S, but since the power goes mainly to the rear, it’s a lot more natural. Few cars are as fun to drive as the RS 3. You can hoon it around a track and also use it as a daily driver. While the tech for handling is impressive, the suspension is also responsible for a lot of the advancements. The RS 3 gets RS Sport suspension with adaptive dampers, which, in Dynamic mode, ensures the car is level and stuck to the tarmac for best traction. However, out on the road and cobbled streets, Comfort mode changes its nature and results in a relatively soft ride, with none of the typical harshness that you see from low-slung hot hatches or small performance sedans. This will be handy in India, where you can have the suspension in Comfort and the engine in Dynamic. But we’ll test that once the car makes it ashore. 2025 Audi RS 3 verdict and estimated price  Torque Rear mode powers solely the rear wheels and can induce drifts. Prices for the RS 3 are expected to range between Rs 85 lakh and Rs 90 lakh, and the fact that there will be two versions in the form of the hatchback and sedan is only music to our ears. After a plethora of silent EVs with fake sounds, a proper hot hatch comes as a breath of fresh air. But the RS 3 is more than just a fast and loud little car. It is a car that yearns to be taken out and driven. One exception for which you don’t mind waking up early, escaping the city and having a blast on a ribbon of tarmac. No matter how crazy EVs get with their sharp looks and AI-generated sounds, a 1-2-4-5-3 firing sequence will always have them on toast.

However, out on the road and cobbled streets, Comfort mode changes its nature and results in a relatively soft ride, with none of the typical harshness that you see from low-slung hot hatches or small performance sedans. This will be handy in India, where you can have the suspension in Comfort and the engine in Dynamic. But we’ll test that once the car makes it ashore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2025 Audi RS 3 verdict and estimated price \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Audi RS 3 Torque rear mode\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/2025-Audi-RS-3-torque-rear-mode.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"2025 Audi RS 3 Torque rear mode\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTorque Rear mode powers solely the rear wheels and can induce drifts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrices for the RS 3 are expected to range between Rs 85 lakh and Rs 90 lakh, and the fact that there will be two versions in the form of the hatchback and sedan is only music to our ears. After a plethora of silent EVs with fake sounds, a proper hot hatch comes as a breath of fresh air. But the RS 3 is more than just a fast and loud little car. It is a car that yearns to be taken out and driven. One exception for which you don’t mind waking up early, escaping the city and having a blast on a ribbon of tarmac. No matter how crazy EVs get with their sharp looks and AI-generated sounds, a 1-2-4-5-3 firing sequence will always have them on toast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-long-termer/audi-q3-sportback-long-term-review-21800km-report-433899\"\u003eAudi Q3 Sportback long term review, 21,800km report\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/porsche-taycan-audi-e-tron-gt-recalled-over-battery-fire-risk-433880\"\u003eAudi e-tron GT recalled over battery fire risk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/motor-sports-news/valley-run-2024-audi-r8-breaks-india-quarter-mile-record-433769\"\u003eThe Valley Run 2024: Audi R8 breaks India quarter mile record\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-433945\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-433945\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-433945\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-433945\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-433945\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-433945\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
