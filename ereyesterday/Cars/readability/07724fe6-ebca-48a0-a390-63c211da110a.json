  "description": "The TVS Jupiter scooter, first introduced as a 110cc model and then in a 125cc avatar, has seen sales of 76.49 lakh units till April 2025 (in April alone, 1,02,588 units were sold, up 33 percent year on year). Now, the 2-wheeler major has teased the latest iteration of its 125 scooter, which is due for a launch soon.  TVS has sold over 76 lakh Jupiters since the scooter’s introduction  The new model will likely feature a design language similar to the Jupiter 110 Jupiter 125 teaser details The current Jupiter 125 has a 124cc engine that produces 8.1hp and 10.5Nm TVS, on its model-specific Instagram handle, has released a couple of teaser images of the upcoming Jupiter 125, and it claims that the new scooter will sport a “bold new look” along with “Style, Power, Performance”. While only a few other details are known, expect the new Jupiter 125cc to up the ante in this segment, which has strong players like the Honda Activa 125, the popular Suzuki Access 125 and the Hero Destini 125. The current TVS Jupiter 125 packs a 124.8cc engine that develops 8.1hp and 10.5 Nm of torque, and it comes in three variants, with prices (ex-showroom Mumbai) ranging from Rs 88,496 for the base variant to Rs 99,100 for the top-end SmartXonnect disc-fitted one. There’s also a 110cc Jupiter, whose starting price is Rs 79 591. The company is also working on a Jupiter model that runs on CNG, which is expected to launch sometime this year.   TVS Jupiter sales figures The Jupiter registered its best-ever 12-month sales in FY25 – 11,07,285 units, up 31 percent year on year. Thanks to this stellar performance, the Jupiter accounted for 61 percent of TVS’ record scooter sales of 18,13,103 units in FY25 and 31 percent of the Indian scooter industry’s best-ever fiscal sales of 35,19,225 units. Jupiter’s highest monthly sales came in festive October 2024, at 1,09,702 units. In FY25, Jupiter maintained its position as TVS’ bestselling 2-wheeler, selling more than twice the number of Apache series motorcycles (4,46,218 units) or the Raider 125 (3,99,819 units), NTorq 125 (3,34,414 units) or XL 100 moped (5,01,813 units). Over the past 12 fiscal years, the TVS Jupiter has sold 75.4 lakh units, comprising 62 percent of the company’s scooter sales during the same period. While sales of the entry-level Jupiter 110 are steady, the demand for the Jupiter 125 is on an upswing. Also see: New Hero Vida electric scooters launching on July 1",
