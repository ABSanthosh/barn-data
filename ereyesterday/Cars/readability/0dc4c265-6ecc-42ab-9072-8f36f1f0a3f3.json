  "text": "The marketplace is your oyster and you have $50k burning a hole in your pocket March 8, 2025 at 19:20 by Stephen Rivers We all love to daydream about what car we’d want to buy, so today let’s do just that. The rules are simple: name as many (or as few) cars as you like, but don’t spend over $50k. Data suggests that the average price of a new car right now is just below $50,000. That means that in our little thought experiment, you have just enough cash to buy one “average” new car. That’s right, the goal today is to tell us what car—or cars, if you’re super frugal—you’d buy if someone generously donated a cool 50 Gs to your account right now. Our lead image is a great example of the top end of the spectrum and a cool car. The Alfa Romeo Giulia is about to turn into a tall fat crossover. If ever there was a time to bet on red and hope for the best, it might be on the last Giulia sedan to come with a full warranty. No, the 503 hp Quadrifoglio isn’t available at this price, but the base version will still do just fine while looking absolutely gorgeous, even if it lacks the grunt and soundtrack of the twin-turbo V6 of the QV. Read: 2027 Alfa Romeo Giulia Will Be A Crossover, Abandoning Its Sedan Roots Another option could be the new Ford Maverick with its updated platform that offers seating for five, a truck bed, available all-wheel drive, and an available hybrid engine for those who want excellent fuel economy. It’s rare that a car comes with this much flexibility and carries a price tag of beneath $50,000. The Maverick is one of those few. Each segment in the market typically has at least one car that falls into this range. Even Ford’s F-250 Superduty technically starts at below $50,000. Cadillac’s luxury sedans and at least three of its SUVs start below that mark too. Practical cars are even more approachable including mid-level versions of the Toyota Sienna, Kia EV6, and Mazda CX-70. Honestly, and nobody who knows me will be surprised by this, but I think for under $50,000, the best car for me is the Toyota GR Corolla. No, it’s not as luxurious or comfortable as many cars I’ve owned but it’s fun, it’s fast, and I love the way it drives. Look, we’ve only just scratched the surface. We haven’t even touched the used car market yet, which could open up a whole new world of possibilities, but we’ll leave that for another post. The truth is that we’ve only scratched the surface and we haven’t even mentioned the used car market, which we’re going to leave for another time. But for now, you’ve got $50,000 to play with for a new vehicle. So, what’s it going to be? A single, perfect car? Or are you going the two-car route—say, a base Mazda MX-5 for $30,000 and a $17,000 Mitsubishi Mirage to keep things practical? The choice is yours.",
