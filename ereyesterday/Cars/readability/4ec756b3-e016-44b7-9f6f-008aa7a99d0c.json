  "description": "Ather has updated its sporty 450 range of electric scooters with some new features and more range. Prices start at Rs 1.30 lakh for the 450S, then you step up to the mid 450X 2.9 at Rs 1.47 lakh and finally, you have the top 450X 3.7, which costs Rs 1.57 lakh.  450X 3.7 sees the smallest price increase 450X 2.9 sees biggest hike but now comes with 700W charger Two new colours on offer - brown and blue The updated Ather 450S now costs Rs 4,400 more than before and you now get a slightly faster 375W charger (in comparison to the older model which came with a 350W unit). This results in faster charging times in comparison to the previous model. Ather has also raised the price of the Pro Pacl on the 450S to Rs 14,000, which is one thousand rupees more than before. Most features on an Ather e-scooter come bundled in with the Pro Pack so this is worth bearing in mind.  Both variants of the 450X now get Magic Twist and Traction Control (both are adjustable with various levels) as well as two new colours. The 450X 2.9 has seen the biggest hike, at Rs 6,400, but Ather now sells this scooter with the faster 700W charger, which has almost halved the charging time.  The range-topping 450X 3.7 has seen a price increase of just Rs 2,000 and except for the new features and colours, it remains identical to the previous version. On this top variant, you have two levels of Magic Twist (Low and High), whereas on the lower 450X 2.9, you can only turn it off or have it on.  While the prices of both 450X variants have changed, the Pro Pack will cost you the same as before at Rs 17,000 and Rs 20,000, for the 2.9kWh and 3.7kWh variants, respectively.  There are also two new colours - Hyper Sand and Stealth Blue. The former is reserved only for the 450X, while the latter can be had on both the Ather 450s. To read our review of the updated 450X, you can tap HERE.
