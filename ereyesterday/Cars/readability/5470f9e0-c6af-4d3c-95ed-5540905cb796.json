Finished in Rosso Scuderia over black leather, it is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 mated to a six-speed transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. Additional features include 19″ Challenge alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a black convertible top, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, quad exhaust outlets, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, and a Bose sound system. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2022, this F430 is now offered in Texas with a window sticker, car cover, floor mats, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Delaware title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Scuderia and features a black convertible top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser. Blemishes are noted on the bottom left edge of the front spoiler near the scuff guard. The 19″ Challenge alloy wheels are mounted with 225/35 front and 285/35 rear Bridgestone Potenza tires that show 2008 date codes. Braking is handled by Rosso Scuderia-finished brake calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. The brake fluid was flushed in 2023. Black leather with contrasting red stitching covers the power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats and extends to the center console and door panels. Equipment includes air conditioning, drilled aluminum pedals, power windows and locks, and a Bose sound system. A stock-specification CD stereo head unit was installed under current ownership to replace a previously fitted aftermarket unit. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. The water pump, oil pump, battery, spark plugs, accessory drive belt, and air filters were replaced in 2023, at which time the power steering fluid was flushed and the air conditioning system was serviced. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The transaxle fluid was flushed in 2023. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Algar Ferrari of Philadelphia, and lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a total price of $247,563. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
