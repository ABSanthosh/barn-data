  "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a long, storied history with India with the first model officially launched almost 30 years ago. It has been going strong ever since and has been the bestselling Mercedes in India for years. Its popularity only grew with the introduction of the long-wheelbase V213 model in 2017. In its sixth generation now, the V214 E-Class is bigger, techier and promises the same chart-topping performance. We test the claim with the entry-level E 200. Mercedes-Benz E-Class exterior The new E-Class is longer, taller, and has a longer wheelbase than before, and as a result, road presence is considerable. Up front it gets LED headlamps in Merc’s latest design language, but the digital LED lights with projector elements are reserved for the top-of-the-line E 450. The star-studded grille with the huge Mercedes logo further adds the necessary bling, though its thick black surround seems at odds with the otherwise restrained and classy look. It doesn't scrape over large bumps, but you still need to be careful due to its long wheelbase. Over to the side, the added length gives it that much-needed limousine look, while the S-Class-like flush door handles are a techy touch. Like the new BMW 5 Series, the E-Class also gets 18-inch wheels, but, as the spokes stretch to the end of the rim, they feel bigger and don’t look as disproportionate as the ones on the BMW. The separated rear quarter glass is a nod to the Maybach S-Class. Gets 18-inch alloys like the 5 Series, but the Merc's look more proportional. At the rear, it gets LED tail-lamps with the tri-arrow design embedded and a healthy dose of chrome.  Mercedes-Benz E-Class interior The E-Class has also grown on the inside, both in terms of space and modernity. The front section is dominated by what’s called a ‘Superscreen’, which means the dashboard itself is made of three individual screens: the digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch main infotainment system and a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen. We’ve seen this cluster on new Mercs with a host of customisation options (although not as much as in larger Mercs), but the large centre screen is where most of the functionality is. So much so that even the AC vents are digitally controlled via the settings in the climate menu of the screen. Definitely a handful, but something that would mostly concern the chauffeur more than the owner seated in the rear, and luckily can be manually overriden. Moreover, HVAC controls are now exclusively in the touchscreen like the S- and C-Class, but less intuitively, require a two-step process to access. Dash dominated by Superscreen; passenger gets 12.3-inch touchscreen. What’s impressive are the seats that offer good room and support with the right amount of cushioning. The soft pillows help, but ventilation is sorely missed on hot days. Also, strangely, the Burmester sound system’s stunning 4D experience is exclusive to the front seats. The speakers inside the seats can be altered up to 10 levels, and at their maximum, are strong enough to double up as a massage function as well. Aesthetically, it gets a large open-pore wood panel for the centre console and soft-touch materials all around. What is a slight irritant is the cramped footwell with a cramped dead pedal – noticeable if you are someone with a UK12 foot size.  Burmester sound system's 4D experience exclusive to the front seats. In the back, space is even more generous than before. But it’s not just the sheer room on offer, the overall comfort is impressive as well. The seats, like at the front, are hugely comfy with the right amount of support and cushioning; however, the party piece is the recline that’s increased from 26 degrees to 36 degrees. And that's not all, the seat squab also features an extendable underthigh support for added comfort. Add to that the ‘Boss’ mode, which allows you to push the passenger seat all the way to the front, and you get enough room to sit as comfortably as you would in a lounge chair. It also features powered sunblinds for the rear windshield and windows with manual blinds for the rear quarter glass. AC performance was a sore point for the earlier version, but the four-zone climate control and the AC vents housed in the centre and B-pillars help cool the cabin much faster now. However, a command touchpad to control the infotainment screens would have been a cherry on top. The India-spec E-Class gets the ‘Chauffeur Pack’ as standard, which brings with it a foldable centre armrest for the rear with cup holders, a wireless charging pad and some storage space. Fold the armrest back and you’ll have a centre seat, but it’s far from comfortable due to the large centre tunnel hump. This makes the E-Class only an occasional 5-seater. Boss mode and 36-degree reclining seats mean it's as comfortable as a lounge chair. What does improve practicality, however, is the fact that you no longer have to sacrifice boot space with a spare wheel. The space saver now sits under the boot floor and results in a rather generous 510-litre boot. Mercedes-Benz E-Class performance The new E-Class comes with three powertrain options: the E 200 seen here with a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine, the E 220d with a 2.0-litre diesel and the E 450 with a 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine. In terms of performance, the 2.0-litre petrol engine makes 204hp and 320Nm but also features a 48V mild-hybrid setup that bumps up the power by 23hp under acceleration. That said, the response is linear and the surge in acceleration is gentle. Although it’s more responsive in Sport mode, it never feels too aggressive. Mated to the engine is a 9-speed automatic, which, thanks to the closely stacked gears, always ensures you are in the power band. The mild-hybrid setup aids in bottom-end response and the torque flattens out once you’re over triple-digit speeds. The engine is refined, but there’s a raspy exhaust note that seeps into the cabin past 3,200rpm; it is far from sounding coarse. 0-100kph is a relaxed 8.25 seconds but there is no dearth of pulling power during overtakes. Mercedes-Benz E-Class ride and handling While the performance might not be something to boast about, the focus of an E-Class is always comfort and ride quality. With 18-inch wheels and a soft suspension setup, the new E rides well and composed on smooth highways. However, over broken roads, especially at low speeds, there is a fair bit of movement inside the cabin, and it can thud over bad patches. That said, ground clearance is something you don't have to worry about much with the new E. Large speed bumps are well managed, and the car almost never scrapes its underbelly. Impressive, but you still need to be wary of the long wheelbase over some poorly built speed bumps, and cannot treat it like an SUV.  0-100kph takes 8.25 seconds, but there's no dearth of pulling power during overtakes. Handling manners are neutral with a light yet sharp and linear steering that aids manoeuvrability. You can tweak the response in the drive modes, but it remains a comfy cruiser and not a corner carver. That said, grip levels are good and body roll, despite the soft suspension, is only marginal. Mercedes-Benz E-Class price and verdict Priced at Rs 78.5 lakh, the E 200 is almost Rs 2 lakh more than its predecessor and a good Rs 5.8 lakh more than its arch rival, the BMW 5 Series, which is also available in long-wheelbase guise now. A comparison of the two is inevitable, but as things stand, the new E-Class – especially in this E 200 guise – has got a lot of things right. It gets the stately look expected of a limousine, plenty of tech to keep it modern for a few years, and an even more spacious and comfy rear seat than before. Yes, the ride isn’t the most comfy, but it's not a deal-breaker. It is a vast improvement over the previous version, which is a feat in itself. The real question though, is if it is better than the new BMW 5 Series, and we will find that out soon.  Also see: Next-gen Mercedes CLA previewed ahead of global debut Constant changes in EV taxation distort the market, says Mercedes India CEO",

That said, ground clearance is something you don\u0026#39;t have to worry about much with the new E. Large speed bumps are well managed, and the car almost never scrapes its underbelly. Impressive, but you still need to be wary of the long wheelbase over some poorly built speed bumps, and cannot treat it like an SUV. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class side pan\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-review-side-pan.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class side pan\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e0-100kph takes 8.25 seconds, but there\u0026#39;s no dearth of pulling power during overtakes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHandling manners are neutral with a light yet sharp and linear steering that aids manoeuvrability. You can tweak the response in the drive modes, but it remains a comfy cruiser and not a corner carver. That said, grip levels are good and body roll, despite the soft suspension, is only marginal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMercedes-Benz E-Class price and verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-mercedes-e-class-launched-at-rs-785-lakh-433142\" title=\"New Mercedes E-Class launched at Rs 78.5 lakh\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriced at Rs 78.5 lakh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the E 200 is almost Rs 2 lakh more than its predecessor and a good Rs 5.8 lakh more than its arch rival, the BMW 5 Series, which is also available in long-wheelbase guise now. A comparison of the two is inevitable, but as things stand, the new E-Class – especially in this E 200 guise – has got a lot of things right. It gets the stately look expected of a limousine, plenty of tech to keep it modern for a few years, and an even more spacious and comfy rear seat than before. Yes, the ride isn’t the most comfy, but it\u0026#39;s not a deal-breaker. It is a vast improvement over the previous version, which is a feat in itself. The real question though, is if it is better than the new BMW 5 Series, and we will find that out soon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/next-gen-mercedes-benz-cla-previewed-ahead-of-global-debut-433217\"\u003eNext-gen Mercedes CLA previewed ahead of global debut\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/constant-changes-in-ev-taxation-distort-the-market-says-mercedes-india-ceo-433202\"\u003eConstant changes in EV taxation distort the market, says Mercedes India CEO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-433240\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-433240\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-433240\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-433240\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-433240\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-433240\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
