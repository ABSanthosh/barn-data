  "description": "Mokka Electric gets nearly twice as much power as standard, plus a limited-slip 'diff Vauxhall has reimagined its GSe performance brand with a new version of the Mokka Electric that has nearly double the power of the standard car. Previewed by the Mokka GSe Rally prototype in May, the crossover’s arrival marks the relaunch of GSe, most recently used for the plug-in hybrid Astra GSe, as a badge for performance-honed fully electric cars. The Mokka is also a more serious proposition than the Astra, with substantially more power and extensive chassis modifications. Its new motor, which is shared with the Abarth 600e, the Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce and the new Peugeot e-208 GTi, puts out 276bhp and 254lb ft. That’s sent to the front wheels through a Torsen limitedslip differential, and it allows the Mokka GSe to hit 62mph from rest in 5.9sec. To cope with that significant uptick in performance, the GSe’s rear axle has been redesigned to add an anti-roll bar and tauter bushings. Together, these are said to increase the back end’s torsional stiffness by 189% compared with the regular car. The GSe also gets more heavily weighted steering, 380mm Alcon front brake discs with four-pot calipers and new dampers with hydraulic bump stops. The Mokka GSe rides on new 20in alloy wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport EV tyres, and it tips the scales at less than 1600kg. The brand has yet to disclose a range, but the e-208 GTi, 600e and Junior Elettrica Veloce all return around 200 miles between charges. For reference, the standard Mokka EV has a 247-mile claimed range from the same 54kWh battery used by the GSe. Visually, the new model is marked out by its neon yellow contrasting elements and new gloss black panels on its front and rear bumpers. Inside, it has Alcantara bucket seats and door cards, and the infotainment touchscreen features new displays including a g-force meter. Prices and delivery dates have yet to be confirmed, but a 600e with the 276bhp motor starts from £39,885, while the Junior Elettrica Veloce is £42,305. That suggests the Vauxhall could land in the high-£30,000s – possibly just undercutting the UK’s £40,000 luxury car tax threshold.",
