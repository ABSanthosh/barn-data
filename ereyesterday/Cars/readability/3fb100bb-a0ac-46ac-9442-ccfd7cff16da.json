  "text": "The muscle car sold for a premium over its original sticker price, though prices have dropped significantly from all-time highs 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Dodge built only 300 Black Ghost Challengers based on the Hellcat Redeye version. The barely driven 807 hp Hemi V8 muscle car recently traded hands for $120,000. The ‘Last Call’ versions of the Challenger, built by Dodge as a send-off to this popular muscle car, have the key traits that typically make them highly sought-after collectibles. However, recent auction results suggest that some models are more desirable than others. Enter the Black Ghost, a standout that seems to be earning its place as one of the more coveted versions. Read: This 1,300-Mile Challenger SRT Super Stock Sale Proves FOMO Is Over Dodge only built 300 units of the Black Ghost, which is based on the powerful Hellcat Redeye version of the Challenger. The original owner forked over $104,865 for the privilege of owning one, and while the market for these cars has cooled slightly over the past year, this particular Black Ghost recently sold for $120,000 on Bring a Trailer making its owner a tidy $15,000 profit. Dodge built the Black Ghost model as a tribute to the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T SE formerly owned by Godfrey Qualls, a legendary figure who street raced alongside Woodward Avenue in the 1970s. This particular Black Ghost was sold new to FCA itself and used as a marketing vehicle before being acquired by the recent seller last year. It was auctioned off with just 86 miles (138 km) on the clock, a clean Carfax report, and a Michigan title. Bring a Trailer Like all Black Ghost models, this Challenger comes in Pitch Black paint, complete with a white stripe across the rear. Under the hood, it packs the same 6.2-liter supercharged V8 found in the Hellcat Redeye, producing 807 hp and 707 lb-ft (965 Nm) of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission. More: Someone Scored A Barely Driven 717 hp Challenger Jailbreak For $17K Off MSRP Several other Challenger Black Ghost models have sold on Bring a Trailer in the past year. One with just 12 miles on the clock went for $161,500 last July, another fetched $162,000 in October 2023, and yet another sold for $190,000 a month before that. While this particular Black Ghost didn’t hit those heights, it still fetched nearly double what a Hellcat Jailbreak Last Call sold for earlier this April. It’s clear that these cars remain in demand, even if the prices are showing some signs of fluctuation. Bring a Trailer",
