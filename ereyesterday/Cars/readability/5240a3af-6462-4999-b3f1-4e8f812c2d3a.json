We pour our hearts, souls and wallets into our bikes, perfecting every detail of form and function, but when it comes time to pass it on to the next owner, too many of us are guilty of doing the bare minimum. When we choose to release a motorcycle from our clutches, it’s usually to fund the next bike, and that’s why all of this matters. As unique as your custom bike is, it’s worthwhile to put extra effort into the sale process—because it’s not just a motorcycle you’re selling—you’re selling your personality, your handiwork and your brand. Pulling out the right stops can mean the difference between selling a bike, and selling a riding experience. We’ve just cut the ribbon on the Bike EXIF Classifieds, home of the very best custom motorcycles and classics for sale worldwide. If you’re an EXIF regular and lust for the kind of custom bikes featured on this site, our classifieds will be the place to find them, and every bike featured in this write-up is available right now. In the spirit of leveling up your buying and selling experience away from the ‘Is this available’ nonsense we’ve become accustomed to, we’re serving up some quick tips for selling custom bikes. Consider it a guide for maximizing your ROI, because if you’re about to list, we know you’ve already got your eye on the next one. Nail Your Prep Before you bust out the camera and craft a listing, it’s vital to consider whether your bike is 100% ready to sell. Of course, we don’t always have the time to make everything perfect, but it pays to make sure your motorcycle is the best it can be, which means getting it cleaned up and addressing any issues. If your bike has seen use, ensure all your maintenance is up to date, and items that suggest neglect are taken care of—such as a dry loose chain. If you have the means to modify a motorcycle, you’re knowledgeable enough to identify the items that might spoil a sale. Remember, the condition of your bike is a reflection of your ownership, so put your best foot forward. Of course, that logic extends to cleanliness, and after all your maintenance is locked in, give your bike a thorough degrease, wash and polish. Get The Right Shots A picture says 1,000 words and a single photo might be enough to make or break the interest of a potential buyer. Remember this is more than a motorcycle you’re selling, it’s a custom vehicle that makes a statement, and good photography will speak volumes about the riding experience that you’re selling. To put it bluntly, a handful of vertical photos from your cell simply won’t do. Even if your photography experience is limited to switching your iPhone to portrait mode, there’s still a ton to be gained by putting extra effort into your photos. Refer to our Motorcycle Photography 101 Guide for quick tips on how to select a backdrop, light your subject and frame your shots, as the usefulness of these topics isn’t lost on cellphone photography. If you’ve given it your best effort, but find the tenets of basic photography are beyond you, don’t be afraid to phone a friend. Chances are good there’s someone in your extended circle who’s proficient behind a lens, and they’ll probably be thrilled to shoot something different and rad like your motorcycle. Photography is a founding principle of Bike EXIF, so we could really beat this subject into the ground. Quitting while we’re ahead, we’ll reiterate that good photography picks up where your description leaves off. Photos that convey speed, craftsmanship and unique style are subliminal messaging to buyers, reinforcing that a custom motorcycle is a lifestyle purchase instead of a generic piece of power sports equipment. Provide All the Information Besides photography, listing descriptions are another area where it’s easy to fall short. Provide all the information you’d want to know if you were considering buying the bike, and don’t even think about pulling that ‘message for more info’ crap. List it once, list it right, and you won’t have to answer the same questions multiple times. This is especially important with a custom motorcycle since you’re the only source for the information. List all the modifications and the parts used, and feel free to inject a little personality regarding the build and riding experience. Inspire confidence in your work by providing additional details, such as if the frame was TIG welded, the wheels were laced with stainless Buchanan spokes, etc. The more complete picture you can paint here will give buyers confidence in your work. The Price is Right Determining a price for a stock motorcycle is simple, just find comps in your area, and adjust for condition, mileage and specification. The same can’t always be said for your custom motorcycle though, and arriving at a realistic dollar figure can be hard when your blood, sweat and handiwork are on the line. Unless things really got out of hand, you probably have a rough idea of how much time and money you’ve spent building a motorcycle. It’s important to realize that every hour of work won’t directly correlate with another dollar, that’s why established shops build for clients so they’re paid by the hour. Until you get your name out there, your return might not be as good. We’re not paid to build bikes, but the right number is obviously somewhere in between the value of a stock bike and the value of your added investment. The market is going to determine that number at the end of the day, which can be a bitter pill in some instances. If you’re just cutting your teeth in the custom bike world, it’s important to realize that your stylistic changes may not add value for all buyers, so keep those stock pieces around. Is This Available? These four simple words form a phrase that’s the bane of existence for anyone who has listed something for sale lately. Where classifieds used to be more dedicated forums, be it Craigslist, eBay, Kijiji, and infinite others, things have changed since Facebook Marketplace launched back in 2016—now catering to over 3 billion monthly users globally. The Marketplace works, don’t get me wrong, but often, your listing starts to feel a bit like an NPC generator instead of a for-sale post. Missed appointments, insultingly low offers and dozens of ‘Is this still available?’ messages become the norm, and that’s all before you meet with a single tire kicker looking for a joy ride. With a specialty item like a custom motorcycle, it can be worthwhile to get your listing in front of a more knowledgeable audience—especially if you’re in a rural area. Listing your bike on classifieds with a global audience like ours may mean the difference between three interested parties and 30, and they may have deeper pockets as well. Who knows, your bike may even grab someone’s attention and secure future projects. On that note, I’ll conclude with one more plug for the new Bike EXIF Classifieds, live now with 11 custom motorcycles from shops like Cafe Racer Dreams, Powerbrick and Killer Custom. Our listings are open to big names like these, as well as aspiring home builders looking to establish a name. Be sure to check back regularly, as many of the motorcycles we feature may just become available, and you never know what obscure classics we’ll kick up.",

Inspire confidence in your work by providing additional details, such as if the frame was TIG welded, the wheels were laced with stainless Buchanan spokes, etc. The more complete picture you can paint here will give buyers confidence in your work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Bike EXIF Custom Motorcycle Classifieds\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/killer-customs-2.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Price is Right\u003c/strong\u003e Determining a price for a stock motorcycle is simple, just find comps in your area, and adjust for condition, mileage and specification.
