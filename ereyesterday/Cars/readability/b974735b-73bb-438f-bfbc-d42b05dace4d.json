  "description": "We rode this bike in Portugal alongside the new CFMoto 675s, and while it isn’t as dynamically impressive as those three-cylinder bikes, it excels at offering a huge amount of motorcycle at a frankly phenomenal price point. Priced at €6,900 in Italy, it costs less than a KTM 390 Adventure R in that market, yet it gives you a full-size adventure tourer experience that’s knocking on the doors of bikes twice its price. CFMoto 700MT engine and performance The engine is up to the task but not exciting Powering the 700MT is a 693cc parallel-twin that CFMoto says is a heavily reworked version of its older 650 engine – which itself was closely benchmarked to Kawasaki’s 650 twin. The company says that this new engine not only offers a better riding experience but also improved reliability. 693cc engine quick and tractable but not exciting. On the move, it’s not got that modern-day 270-degree crank charisma and is more of an old-school, gruff-sounding engine, much like the Kawasaki 650. But what it lacks in character, it makes up for in functionality. It’s tractable, flexible, and pulls cleanly through the rev range. There’s a noticeable thrum through the footpegs, but vibes at the handlebar are well-contained, even as you wind it up. Gear ratios are well spaced, and it never feels out of its element – whether you’re chugging through a roundabout in the third or cruising calmly at 120kph in the sixth. You can rev it out to extract the most of the 68hp/60Nm, but this motor is best enjoyed at a more relaxed pace, where you can effortlessly surf the midrange. CFMoto 700MT suspension and comfort Suspension doesn't have lot of travel but still feels composed We rode the 700MT through winding country lanes, and it proved to be an enjoyable companion at a relaxed pace. This is a machine that invites you to sit back, take in the scenery, and enjoy the journey. That relaxed nature is backed by solid ergonomics. The 800mm seat height is welcoming, especially for a bike of this size, though the seat is quite wide and shorter riders may still struggle to get both feet down. Cross-spoked tubeless wheels come as standard. The suspension setup offers only 150mm of travel, and it worked decently well on Portugal’s roads, but this most certainly isn’t an off-road bike. However, for long-distance tarmac touring and the odd rough patch or dirt trail, the suspension feels controlled and planted. It doesn’t float over bad roads like a plush ADV would, but it gets the job done with composure. Its overall identity is similar to the Kawasaki Versys, despite the more ADV-style looks with those spoked rims and the 19-inch front wheel. CFMoto 700MT weight and handling It is a heavy bike but still handles decently well The big downside is the weight. The 700MT looks big, and its weight matches this – 240kg as standard and 258kg with the three optional aluminium panniers fitted. That puts it firmly in full-size ADV territory and even heavier than BMW’s R1300GS. The 700MT is a properly heavy thing and weighs more than some full-size ADVs. From the saddle, the bike definitely feels large but the steering is light, and it’s easy to manoeuvre. What I did find interesting – and a little unusual – is how far the windscreen sits from the rider. It’s nearly three feet ahead, which means adjusting it on the fly takes a decent stretch, but the upside is that wind protection is excellent. It was cold and rainy during our test ride, and with the screen set high, the protection it offered was genuinely impressive. CFMoto 700MT features and quality The TFT display and cross-spoke wheels are premium touches The 700MT comes from a Chinese brand that is all about low-cost products, but you wouldn’t guess that from its features or build quality. Fit and finish is at a high level, the 5-inch TFT display has smooth animations and an intuitive layout, and the bike comes with switchable ABS basic traction control, adjustable suspension and tubeless spoked wheels. What it doesn’t get are things like a bi-directional quickshifter or cruise control, which is partly down to the fact that this bike has a cable-operated throttle. 5-inch TFT has a clean and functional interface. CFMoto 700MT India launch and expected price Remains to be seen if the 700MT comes here in the future The big question is whether we’ll get this bike in India, and there is no clear answer right now. CFMoto has already confirmed that the smaller, lighter 450MT will launch here first, and we already rode that bike in Hyderabad last month. But the 700MT? I’d argue it deserves a spot here as well for its big-bike vibe, real-world usability, and fantastic value for money. As with all these CFMoto bikes, questions remain around long-term reliability and after-sales support, especially in India. CFMoto has been building a strong reputation in Europe and Australia in this regard, and that’s a promising sign. But it will ultimately come down to how well their local partner’s (who has asked to remain unnamed for now) service network can support these bikes here. For now, though, the 700MT is another clear signal that modern-day CFMoto is here to play, and the competition should be paying close attention. Also See: CFMoto MT 700 video review",
