  "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs.

While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Tata Nexon CNG engine\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tata-Nexon-CNG-engine.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Tata Nexon CNG engine\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect.

While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTata Nexon CNG ride and handling\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight.
