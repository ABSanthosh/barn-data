  "description": "The Polestar 3 is here for 2025. It’s the brand’s first two-row crossover SUV . And it’s beautiful. Clean lines form the body, which tightly wrap around the chassis. Narrow, sinister looking headlights hang out on either side of a front wing incorporated to the top of the front fascia, with the Polestar logo mounted on top. You see a subtle front and less subtle rear fender flares baked into the body in profile, which make space for as large as 22-inch wheels. It’s hard to find something sharper without spending Lamborghini money.",

Narrow, sinister looking headlights hang out on either side of a front wing incorporated to the top of the front fascia, with the Polestar logo mounted on top. You see a subtle front and less subtle rear fender flares baked into the body in profile, which make space for as large as 22-inch wheels. It’s hard to find something sharper without spending Lamborghini money. This Launch Edition includes a 111-kWh battery and two-electric-motors, one for each axle. Each motor delivers equal power. Together you get 483 horsepower and 620 lb.-ft of torque to play with. It’s not slow. And it’s not the fastest version of the Polestar 3, the dual-motor performance pack raises those figures to 510 horsepower and 671 lb.-ft of torque. The 400 volt system will take a half-hour on a fast charger to charge from 10-80 percent. You need 11 hours to fully charge a depleted battery on a 220-volt charger. This Polestar 3 Launch Edition starts at $80,300. For the money, you get a slick, modern, and comfortable interior. It includes a nine-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 14.5-inch center display that runs Android Automotive OS. Unfortunately, Polestar aggressively removed buttons from the interior. Many controls rely on the touchscreen and a few seemingly basic things lie two or three layers deep in the system. Fortunately, you get three-zone climate control, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and a heated steering wheel. It’s truly beautiful inside and out.  Views on Vehicles focuses on new car reviews and news, presented by Robin Warner, a perennial car nut. The reason for the channel's focus becomes crystal clear when you look at Robin's experience. He spent five years of his adult life as an engineer: four years in traction and stability control calibration, and little over a year in vehicle dynamics. He also spent 15 years of his adult life as an editor at various magazines, including stints at Car and Driver, Road \u0026 Track and Autoweek.The TTAC Creators Series tells stories and amplifies creators from all corners of the car world, including culture, dealerships, collections, modified builds and more.",
