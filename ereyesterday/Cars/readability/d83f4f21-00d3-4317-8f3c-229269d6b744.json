  "text": "Pricing details for the new model will be announced at a later date 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The new GV60 will launch in Korea in Q1, Australia in Q3, but no timeline has been given for the US. Genesis has yet to announce detailed specifications about the new model. An enlarged 84 kWh battery pack like the latest Ioniq 5 and EV6 is likely. The Genesis GV60 – the Hyundai Motor Group’s most premium cousin to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 – has been updated before its global launch this year. The mid-life update for the electric crossover is relatively minor but does bring some new features that shoppers should welcome. No significant changes have been made to the overall shape and size of the GV60, and the alterations made to the front and rear fascias are hard to spot. Look a little closer, and you will notice that the front bumper is new and looks slightly sportier than the outgoing model. Genesis has also changed the front grille, positioning it slightly lower, re-shaping it, and making it smaller. The split headlights also feature the firm’s new Micro Lens Array technology. Read: Genesis Confirms GV60 Magma Launch For Next Fall The Korean brand has also crafted new 21-inch wheels for the GV60 and has now finished the fenders in the same color as the rest of the body, rather than black plastic as before. While this is only a smaller change, it makes the EV feel slightly more premium. The rear bumper also now matches the rest of the body, rather than being in a contrasting shade of silver. Making the interior of the new GV60 stand out is the firm’s new 27-inch Integrated Cockpit display that includes the infotainment system and instrument cluster, just like the facelifted GV70. Genesis has rounded out the changes with a newly designed steering wheel. Genesis has yet to announce market-specific details for the new GV60, nor has it confirmed powertrain or pricing details. The outgoing model had the 77.4 kWh battery pack as the original Ioniq 5 and EV6 models, but both of these have been refreshed and now come standard with an 84 kWh. In all likelihood, the GV60 will get this same enlarged battery. In certain markets, the current car is available in Standard RWD guise with 225 hp and 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) or as a dual-motor model with 429 hp / 483 hp with Boost Mode enabled. Similar power figures can be expected for the new car. Korean sales of the new GV60 will start later this quarter before it lands in other markets like Australia in Q3. Genesis hasn’t said when the updated EV will touch down in the US.",
