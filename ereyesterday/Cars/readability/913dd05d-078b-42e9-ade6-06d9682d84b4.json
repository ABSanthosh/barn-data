  "description": "This 1978 Lincoln Continental was modified in the style of a 1960s Batmobile during a project commissioned by the seller that was undertaken between 2013 and 2018. The work involved overhauling the 400ci V8 and three-speed automatic transmission, fitting fabricated fiberglass bodywork, bubble-style windscreens, and a custom interior, and refinishing the car in black with red bat graphics. Features include hooded headlight surrounds, batwing-style tail fins, an emergency beacon, and a siren in addition to a rear turbine-style vent, polished vertical stacks, and a power-operated hood and trunk lid. A touchscreen DVD stereo is mounted to the dash, and replica props include a bat phone, an anti-theft activator, a bat ray control lever, and a batbeam firing button. This Batmobile replica is now offered in Canada with clean Ontario registration in the seller's name.",

The work involved overhauling the 400ci V8 and three-speed automatic transmission, fitting fabricated fiberglass bodywork, bubble-style windscreens, and a custom interior, and refinishing the car in black with red bat graphics. Features include hooded headlight surrounds, batwing-style tail fins, an emergency beacon, and a siren in addition to a rear turbine-style vent, polished vertical stacks, and a power-operated hood and trunk lid. A touchscreen DVD stereo is mounted to the dash, and replica props include a bat phone, an anti-theft activator, a bat ray control lever, and a batbeam firing button. This Batmobile replica is now offered in Canada with clean Ontario registration in the seller’s name. The George Barris-designed Batmobile appeared in the 1960s television show Batman and was based on the 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car. This replica was built using the chassis of a 1978 Lincoln Continental sedan, and the custom fiberglass bodywork is finished in black with red accent stripes and bat graphics. Bubble-style windscreens are equipped front and rear, and other details include a sculpted hood, batwing-style tail fins, an emergency beacon, a rear turbine-style vent, rear parachute bags, and polished vertical stacks on the rear deck. The rear antenna is power operated, as are the hood and trunk lid. The seller notes stone chips in the paint. Five-spoke alloy wheels wear red bat emblems and 225/70 BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums, and the car rides on coil springs and air-adjustable rear shocks. The cockpit houses individual seats upholstered in black leather accompanied by bright trim and black carpeting. Features include a floor-mounted B\u0026M shifter, lap belts, a compass, a Code 3 siren system, and a Kenwood touchscreen DVD player. A bat phone is fitted to the center console, and additional prop equipment includes a detect-a-scope, a Geiger counter, a bat-ram control lever, an anti-theft activator, and an emergency bat-turn lever mounted on the overhead arch. The arc-style steering wheel is mounted on a black hub that has chrome trim and faux instrumentation. A 200-km/h GPS speedometer is positioned on the left, while AutoMeter auxiliary gauges are on the right. The digital odometer indicates 18k kilometers (~11k miles), which is said to be the number accumulated since the build was completed. True mileage is unknown. The 400ci V8 was overhauled during the build and is equipped with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, an open-element air cleaner, chrome Edelbrock valve covers, and dual electric cooling fans. The dual exhaust system features a crossover pipe and underside outlets positioned ahead of the rear axle. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a C3 three-speed automatic transmission that was overhauled under current ownership. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates.
