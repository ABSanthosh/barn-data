  "text": "I'd wager that most of us, regardless of where we sit on the political spectrum, don't want the government limiting our speed. To be clear, the bills proposed would, at least in theory, only foist these devices on repeat speed-limit violators, and perhaps only temporarily. Then again, it's not clear that the government won't force these devices on all new cars.So, on the surface, it might sound like those of us with lead feet need not worry unless we keep getting caught. But I still don't like the idea. I balk partly because there's a small chance that an emergency might require someone to put their foot down, and partly because I think there are other, better ways to punish those who flout the law. And while I generally think slippery-slope reasoning is a fallacy, I do wonder if the government would start off only slapping devices on true scofflaws before shifting to those of us who get nabbed for just a few MPH over.I also don't love the privacy implications. Not to mention most vehicles are electronically speed-limited by the manufacturer anyway.If you could guarantee that these devices would only apply to the truly deranged -- the illegal street racers, the drunks, and the truly reckless, I'd be less worried. And maybe I am being one of those paranoid cranks I usually make fun of and ignore. Still, this doesn't quite sit well with me. Can we slow down (pun intended) this legislation and address legitimate concerns while also punishing those who put lives in danger appropriately?I don't want to defend idiots driving 120 MPH plus and putting innocents at risk. I also don't want to see someone who owns a Miata and likes to exercise it every so often get punished too severely if he/she runs across Johnny Law too often.What say you?Sound off below.[Image: ozkan ulucam/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.
