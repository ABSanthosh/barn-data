  "description": "Kia India has confirmed that the upcoming Carens facelift will be called Clavis. Kia earlier said that the updated Carens will get a new suffix in its name, and be sold alongside the current MPV with a more premium positioning, similar to how Maruti has positioned the Ertiga and XL6. The Kia Clavis launch is slated for May 8, 2025.  Kia confirmed the 'Clavis' name today alongside a teaser video Kia Clavis will feature redesigned headlights and new connected tail-lights New Clavis may share its engine and gearbox options with the Carens Kia Clavis exterior details New three-pod headlights A Clavis teaser video was released today, showcasing the MPV with a new face, slimmer grille and redesigned headlights, which look in line with newer Kia cars. Though not much was revealed in the video, we expect the Clavis to get a new design for the dual-tone alloy wheels and the bumpers, as well as connected tail-lights (seen in a spy shot from before). Kia Clavis interior features expectations ADAS, 360-degree camera setup likely The current Carens is the only Kia model in India to not feature an ADAS suite, but the Clavis teaser showing a collision warning on the digital cluster suggests the updated MPV could finally get some level of autonomous tech. Apart from that, the Clavis top model may also add a 360-degree camera setup. Minor changes to the dashboard, switches, toggles and buttons are likely as well. Kia Clavis powertrain options May borrow Carens' petrol and diesel engines Image used for representation. The new Clavis is expected to share its powertrains with the current Kia Carens. These comprise three 1.5-litre engines: naturally-aspirated (NA) petrol (115hp, 144Nm), turbo-petrol (160hp, 253Nm) and diesel (116hp, 250Nm). The NA petrol engine comes only with a manual gearbox, while the turbo-petrol motor can be paired with either an iMT (clutchless manual) or DCT. Meanwhile, the diesel engine is offered with manual and torque converter automatic options. To know about the Kia Clavis price expectations and rivals, click here.
