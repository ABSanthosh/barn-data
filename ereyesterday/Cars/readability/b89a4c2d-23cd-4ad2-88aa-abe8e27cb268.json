  "description": "This 1947 Ford Super Deluxe convertible was rebuilt and modified in the 2000s with a repaint in metallic red and the installation of a boxed frame, four-wheel independent suspension and disc brakes, and a 302ci Lincoln V8, which was fitted with a Kenne Bell supercharger following the car's acquisition out of Oregon by the seller's late spouse in 2008. The interior was also re-covered in brown and tan vinyl upholstery since 2008, and the car is further equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission, a Vintage Air HVAC system, power-assisted steering, a tan soft top, a 12-volt electrical system, and 15\" steel wheels with Cadillac covers. This ’47 Ford street rod is now offered with partial build records and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller's name.",

The interior was also re-covered in brown and tan vinyl upholstery since 2008, and the car is further equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission, a Vintage Air HVAC system, power-assisted steering, a tan soft top, a 12-volt electrical system, and 15″ steel wheels with Cadillac covers. This ’47 Ford street rod is now offered with partial build records and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller’s name. The steel bodywork was repainted its current shade of metallic red during the initial build in the 2000s. Exterior details include a power-operated tan soft top, a power-operated cowl vent, halogen headlamps, LED taillights, dual side mirrors, dual exhaust outlets, and chrome bumpers and trim. Staggered-width 15″ steel wheels wear chrome Cadillac covers and are mounted with 205/75 front and 235/75 rear Coker Classic whitewall tires. Riding on Heidts independent front and rear suspension with front coil springs and rear coilovers, the car is brought to a stop by four-wheel disc brakes with inboard-mounted rear rotors. The Borgeson rack-and-pinion steering system is power assisted. The cabin houses two rows of bench seats that were reupholstered in tan and brown vinyl some time after 2008. Matching trim covers the door panels, brown square-weave carpeting lines the floors, and the interior has been further outfitted with a Vintage Air climate-control system, a 12-volt-converted Wonderbar AM radio, an analog clock, and front and rear lap belts. A Grant banjo-style steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color metal dashboard housing a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary displays for fuel level, oil pressure, amperage, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 4,500 of which were added during the ownership of the seller’s family; actual chassis mileage is unknown. The finished trunk compartment houses the vehicle’s battery behind a movable divider section. The fuel-injected 302ci V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1988 Lincoln Mark VII and fitted in this car during the initial build. A Kenne Bell supercharger was installed under the stewardship of the seller’s late spouse. Bright valve covers and ancillary components are installed along with a roller camshaft, Keith Black pistons, and ceramic-coated headers. A firewall from Bitchin’ Products also was adapted. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an AOD four-speed automatic transmission sourced from the same 1988 Lincoln as the engine. The frame has been boxed and the floors replaced. The car is titled under the number 941756961, which is displayed on the replacement tag pictured above. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
