This 991.2 GT3 is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with the owner’s manual, service records, a DME report, accident-free US and Canadian Carfax reports, and Ontario registration in the owner’s name. The 991 GT3 featured revised front and rear bumper covers when compared to the standard Carrera as well as a rear wing and dual center-exit exhaust pipes. This example is finished in Miami Blue and has bi-xenon headlights, window tint, and LED taillights. An indentation is located on the front hood, the windshield is chipped, and paint protection film has been applied to the exterior. Bronze-finished 20″ center-lock wheels were refinished in 2019 and are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over GiroDisc rotors, and the car is equipped with a front-axle lift system. A brake fluid flush was performed in June 2024, at which time replacement front brake pads were installed. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, Silver Gray seatbelts, contrasting stitching, and Porsche crests on the headrests. A roll cage has been fitted, and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management with navigation as well as a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, body-color trim, Porsche-branded floor mats, and cruise control. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer as well as a 350-km/h speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 28k kilometers (~17k miles), all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring. A DME report along with results of a compression test are provided in the gallery. The US Carfax lists at least one open recall. A Canadian Carfax report is provided in the gallery. The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
