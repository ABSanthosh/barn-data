  "description": "Smart #5 Summit gets a roof rack and side-mounted ladders Off-road-styled #5 electric SUV is by far Smart’s largest and most potent car yet UK deliveries of the Smart #5 – the brand's biggest car yet – will begin in October. An EV that will attempt to win over buyers of large SUVs with its hardy character, it will be underpinned by an 800V electrical architecture and major on in-car technology. It sits on the same Geely SEA2 platform as the smaller #1 and #3 crossovers. The #5 measures 4705mm long, 1920mm wide and 1705mm tall, which makes it a similar size to the new Peugeot 5008, although it’s not a seven-seater.  While retaining a lot of Smart’s modern design cues, such as concealed door handles and rounded edges, it differs from the rest of the line-up by swapping angular headlights and a singular light bar for a boxier, more rugged look.  One of the big changes comes inside, where dual 13in OLED infotainment touchscreens dominate the dashboard. It uses an evolved version of Smart's UX system and, like its siblings, it gets an animal avatar, this time a lion. Meanwhile, the driver has a 10.3in digital instrument cluster, an increase on the 9.2in equivalent in its sibling cars. Power figures haven’t been released yet, but details published by the Chinese government in June suggest that it will top out with a 637bhp dual-motor model using the Brabus nameplate. Five trim levels will be available: Pro, Pro+, Pulse, Summit Edition and Premium. Battery sizes, depending on trim level, range from 76kWh to 100kWh, with as many as 366 miles offered in its most efficient form. Top-end recharge speeds of 400kW yield a 10-80% fill in 18min. The Summit Edition is notable for bringing a variety of off-roading addenda inspired by the #5 concept, with four-wheel drive, a roof rack and a ladder mounted on the right-hand side of its body. It also gets five off-road driving modes, including settings for snow and mud. Prices are expected to start at around £40,000.",
