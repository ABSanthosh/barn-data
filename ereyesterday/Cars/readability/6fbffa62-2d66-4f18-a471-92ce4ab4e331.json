Additional details include carbon-fiber exterior and interior trim along with a surround-view camera system, navigation, Bang \u0026 Olufsen BeoSound Audio, and heated and ventilated seats. Acquired by the selling dealer in October 2024, this DBS Superleggera has 764 miles and is now offered with a photocopy of the window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, two fob keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The DBS shares its aluminum structure with the DB11 and features Superleggera-specific carbon-fiber bodywork including the front splitter, hood, fender louvers, trunk lid, and rear diffuser. This example is finished in Racing Green and features LED headlights, smoked LED taillamps, and quad-tip exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. Paint protection film has been applied to the full exterior, including the front splitter, rear diffuser, and trim. Optional forged 21″ twin-spoke wheels are finished in gloss black and wrapped in 265/35 front and 305/30 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. Stopping power is provided by black Aston Martin–branded calipers over carbon-ceramic discs at all four corners. The car is further  equipped with adjustable dampers and features GT, Sport, and Sport+ driving modes. The heated, ventilated, and 12-way-adjustable front seats feature Aston Martin logos on the backrests and are trimmed in Onyx Black leather that extends to the dashboard, center console, headliner, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Keyless Go with a crystal ignition button as well as a push-button gear selector, dual-zone automatic climate control, a surround-view camera system, parking sensors, Bang \u0026 Olufsen BeoSound Audio, and an 8″ display screen with navigation. The multifunction steering wheel is wrapped in leather and equipped with gearshift paddles. It fronts a 12″ color TFT LCD cluster with a central tachometer and a speedometer flanked by a pair of configurable displays. The digital odometer indicates 764 miles. The twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V12 was factory rated at 715 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a carbon-fiber driveshaft and a rear-mounted ZF eight-speed automatic transaxle with a limited-slip differential. The car is further equipped with Dynamic Torque Vectoring. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
