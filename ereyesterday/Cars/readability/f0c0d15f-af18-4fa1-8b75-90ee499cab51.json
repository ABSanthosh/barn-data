  "description": "After showcasing it at the Bharat Mobility Expo earlier in the year, Honda has launched the CB300F flex fuel model at Rs 1.70 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). This bike is mechanically identical to and costs the same amount of money as the regular CB300F.  Bookings open now, will be available at BigWing showrooms Gets an ethanol indicator on the display Available in two colours - red and grey There’s not much to differentiate the CB300F flex fuel and standard models. Both bikes have the same design, features, mechanicals and even cost the exact same amount. The differences boil down to the colours and a small change on the flex fuel bike’s display. The flex fuel CB300F can run on E85 fuel, which is a petrol-ethanol blend, containing up to 85 percent of the latter.  The standard CB300F can be had in red, grey and blue, whereas the flex fuel CB300F can only be had in red or grey. The flex fuel CB300F also gets an extra indicator on the dash to warn the rider in case the ethanol content in the fuel exceeds 85 percent.  Bookings for the flex fuel CB300F are open today, with the bike being available at BigWing dealers from the last week of this month. To give you a bit of backstory, the CB300F was first launched at a rather steep Rs 2.29 lakh after which poor sales forced Big Red to offer a Rs 50,000 discount, first temporarily and then revising the price of the bike altogether to Rs 1.70 lakh.
