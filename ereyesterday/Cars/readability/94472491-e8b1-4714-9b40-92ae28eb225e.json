  "text": "Those interested in an F-150 Lightning or Mustang Mach-E might want to take notice 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Ford is offering big deals on its electric vehicles late this year. That includes 0% APR on both the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E. It also includes free home charger installation and thousands off of sticker prices. As the year comes to a close, automakers are eager to make deals. Ford is no stranger to this game plan and it’s coming to market with some serious incentives. Not only will it agree to install a charger for those who buy or purchase some EVs, but it’ll stack discounts and financing deals onto that too. Here’s a breakdown of what to look for if you want an electric Ford. First and foremost, these deals all include Ford’s “Power Promise” that it launched earlier this year. That means that buyers or lessees will get a charger installed at their home (if applicable) included in the cost of the car itself. That on its own is already a big cost savings and is a major hurdle to overcome for many EV buyers. More: You Can Get A Tesla For Under $20K From Hertz, But You Probably Shouldn’t On top of that, InsideEVs points out that those who lease a Mustang Mach-E get up to $3,000 off in bonus cash. That can be combined with the $7,500 federal tax incentive to effectively lop off $10,500 from the price of a Mach-E—not to mention any additional state-level tax breaks. That’s a screaming deal on a mostly good electric vehicle. Those who prefer to buy the Mach-E still get a good deal. That includes 0% APR for 72 months and $5,000 in bonus cash. Notably, the Mach-E doesn’t qualify for the federal tax credit when bought. Nevertheless, buyers still get the free charger installation. On the F-150 Lightning side of the world, the pickup gets the same APR and bonus cash deal for buyers. In this case, that deal is only available to buyers who select the XLT and Platinum+ trim levels. Customers interested in leasing the truck get $3,500 in lease cash along with $3,000 bonus cash. In a market where several car brands are offering deals right now, these ones from Ford are competitive to say the least. Don’t forget that state tax incentives could add to these discounts too.",
