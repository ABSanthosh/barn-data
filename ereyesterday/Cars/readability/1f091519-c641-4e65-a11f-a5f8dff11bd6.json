Power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed F1 dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The current owner purchased the car in 2024 and it now has 104 miles. This 488 Spider “Force of Nature” series is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title in the owner’s name. The car was specified through Ferrari’s Tailormade program and is one of four in the “Force of Nature” series, with this example representing “earth.” It is finished in Dark Green Metallic with a Bianco Dreamline livery and was ordered with the optional carbon-fiber exterior package in Glossy Verde Bottiglia. Other exterior details comprise xenon headlights with AFS as well as a retractable hardtop and a vented deck lid. Clear paint protection film was applied in March 2022. The 20″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone tires. The car is equipped with an SCM-E magnetorheological suspension control system and an optional suspension lift system. Braking is provided by black-finished multi-piston calipers over ceramic-composite discs at each corner. The large Goldrake racing seats are upholstered in Peccary Beige leather with green Cavallini headrest embroidery and a black center stripe. Optional Glossy Verde Bottiglia carbon-fiber trim adorns the dashboard, center bridge, door sills, and door panels, and the car was ordered with two-tone floor mats with green 488 Spider embroidery. Amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation, and cruise control. A badge between the seats denotes this car as the “Earth” example in the “Force of Nature” series. The black leather-, Peccary Beige leather-, and Glossy Verde Bottiglia carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted carbon-fiber paddle shifters and features an engine-start button, a manettino driving-mode selector, and LED shift lights. Instrumentation consists of a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by multifunction displays. The digital odometer indicates 104 miles. The seller notes an illuminated TPMS warning light. The twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 was factory rated at 661 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque and is equipped with a sport exhaust system. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed F1 dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car was most recently serviced in August 2023, the process of which included replacing a belt and air filter as well as changing the oil. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Ferrari Maserati of Central New Jersey and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total suggested retail price of $550,802. A supplementary option list is also included along with a car cover, manufacturer’s literature, and service records. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
