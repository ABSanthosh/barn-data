  "text": "Published:  May 28th, 2025 It constantly seems like the V8 might be dying. Stellantis is slowly killing the Hemi, though like a horror-movie villain, it never quite dies. Electrification and technological advances involving internal-combustion engines with fewer cylinders are both factors that make us think the V8 will be relegated to only niche sports cars and a few trucks. Yet GM made news this morning that has us pausing. The General is going to drop almost $1 billion into a production line at its Buffalo-area plant. This line will built a sixth-gen V8 that will replace the current 5.3- and 6.2-liter engines.But if you read Chris's story, which you should, you'd already know that. You'd also already know that GM promises improved fuel economy and more power. Now I am thinking -- is the V8 not quite dead? Will improved tech keep these motors around, with fuel-economy that's more respectable? Or is this just GM recognizing that certain large SUVs and trucks still need big power, and electrification isn't yet the answer for those vehicles?

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”.

He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com.

More by Tim Healey Published May 28th, 2025 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation Depending on application, the existing V8 is no slouch in the mpg department...I easily get 30 plus on the highway. Even with the AFM inactive, solid 30s are still easily attainable. Pound on it and 15s are still attainable. If the demand is there, build them! Will Stellantis stick with the twin-turbo I-6 as its primary truck engine, following this announcement from GM? V8's simply aren't as good or as durable as their more modern equivalents.Stellantis is bringing back the HEMI because their customers make bad decisions and don't have the means to pay for something better. So everyone smart enough to buy a Hurricane doesn't want to be seen at a CDJRF dealership. Plus UConnect is the only ECU to have native breathalyzer support.The LS is such a versatile engine that it'll probably be the last domestic V8 around. The fact it's such a good crate engine means it's possible to put it in actually good vehicles, like the ones not made by General Motors.",
