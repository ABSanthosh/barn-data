  "description": "It has big boots to fill and talented rivals to face. Is it up to the task? Plush, mature and packed full of usable technology, the second-generation Volvo XC90 arrived as a serious statement of intent back in 2015, delivering performance, practicality, style and efficiency in a way that made it the definitive all-rounder in a segment brimming with talent.But it also landed at a tricky time for Volvo: the firm was still trying to find its feet after a takeover by Chinese car giant Geely, and any successor to the original XC90 needed to hit the ground running as the seven-seater had grown into one of the brand’s best-selling models.Volvo didn’t hold back. The XC90 got an all-new platform, complete redesign, electronic overhaul and revamped line of engines, accompanied by an upmarket interior in a bid to outdo the likes of the BMW X5, Land Rover Discovery and Audi Q7.The effort paid off, to such an extent that it’s still on sale today – albeit following some chunky updates over the past few years. But while the starting price for the latest version is a heady £64,000, you can grab yourself an early car for as little as £14,000.When we first road tested the XC90, we were impressed by its 222bhp four-cylinder turbo diesel.While it was down 500cc over the old five-pot, the oil-burner had more than enough gusto and was at the front of the class for throttle response.Acceleration was helped by the XC90 being leaner than cars like the Land Rover Discovery 4, which was 274kg heavier.We felt the performance was a little at odds with the slightly sluggish gearbox, though.In the main, it was easy to get along with, but when you asked for more oomph, the eight-speed gearbox was a little slow to respond. The ride was a mixed bag too. The standard car was by no means uncomfortable: it was just stiffly sprung for a Volvo – a side effect of which was that it could carve corners like the more dynamically inclined BMW X5.With air springs fitted, the XC90 was far more settled at higher speeds and soaked up lumps and bumps around town more confidently – more in keeping with the character you would expect.There was also the T6, a four-cylinder petrol that made 316bhp, and the tax-busting T8 plug-in hybrid, which had 401bhp, a 0-62mph time of 5.9sec and an EV-only range of 24 miles.If you don’t need the financial benefits of a plug-in, a diesel will deliver more than enough punch – especially the later 232bhp PowerPulse D5 – and reasonable fuel economy. You can expect around 36mpg.Volvo rolled out the subtlest of facelifts in 2019, adjusting the engine line-up in the process. The D5 was replaced by the 232bhp B5 and the T6 was dropped for the 247bhp B5P, both mild hybrids.Step inside and you were met with a cabin that was superbly crafted, well configured and easy to use, yet it was also plush and stayed true to Volvo’s minimalist Scandi-cool vibe.Pleasingly, the central 9.0in touchscreen was simple to operate, and a selection of physical buttons for some of the secondary controls meant the XC90 scored well in terms of usability.The rear of the cabin was impressively spacious, and the car’s boxy silhouette meant that third-row passengers had more than enough head room.Throw in the XC90’s huge, 775-litre boot and endless cubbyholes, and it made for a highly compelling large SUV.As premium seven-seaters go, the second-generation XC90 is right up there with the best, and now that the new model is on its way, you should be able to grab this crackerjack all-rounder for a reasonable price.",
