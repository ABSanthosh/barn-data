  "text": "Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks to the media before former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to vote at a polling station at Mandel Recreation Centre in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 5, 2024. Photo: CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP (Getty Images)Disgraced former mayor, lawyer and lackey Rudy Giuliani drove to his polling place this Election Day in the Mercedes-Benz 500SL formerly owned by actress Lauren Bacall. It’s the very same car he was supposed to have turned over as damages to the Georgia election workers he grievously wronged, but instead he hid the car somewhere in Florida. Suggested ReadingIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | JalopinionsOffEnglishSuggested ReadingWe’ve kept a close eye on the story of Bacall’s R107 Benz, because with a guy like Rudy Giuliani it was bound to get weird. And weird it got. Rudy was riding shotgun when he pulled up in the Benz to a polling place in Palm Beach, Florida, Tuesday afternoon. It’s the same Mercedes that Judge Liman ordered Giuliani turn over to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who had to flee their homes and suffered harassment following Giuliani repeatedly and publicly defaming the election workers. Giuliani also had to hand over many of his New York possessions, as well as his high-rise Manhattan apartment, in order to met the $148 million settlement with Freeman and Moss. However, when the women took possession of the $5 million apartment, they found it striped bare of anything valuable. Freeman and Moss are obviously not taking this lying down and Giuliani will be in front of a judge over the matter this week. From the Guardian: Giuliani, wearing a New York fire department hat and stars-and-stripes shirt, was pictured arriving at the polling site in Palm Beach on Tuesday in the passenger seat of the Mercedes SL500. He spoke to reporters but had no comment about the settlement.Caruso, in a court filing last week, denied Giuliani was being obstructive. “[He] is, and will remain, ready to comply” with Liman’s order, Caruso said – but claimed that Giuliani, who filed for bankruptcy last year, had not received information about how to deliver it, the Hill reported.Nathan said that claim was “misleading”. Giuliani’s spokesperson Ted Goodman, meanwhile, told the Hill in a statement that he “has made available his property and possessions as ordered” and that he had put a “few items” into storage over the past year.Anything else that was removed was related to Giuliani’s nightly livestreams, Goodman claimed, asserting it was therefore outside the settlement. A separate lawsuit over Giuliani’s Palm Beach apartment is ongoing.“Opposing counsel, acting either negligently or deliberately in a deceptive manner, are simply attempting to further bully and intimidate mayor Giuliani until he is rendered penniless and homeless,” Goodman said.“This is just another way that they’ve weaponized our once-sacred justice system. It should concern each and every American.”Ah, the party of personal responsibility. Giuliani defamed Freeman and Moss during his feverish search for cheating during the 2020 election. The civically minded mother-daughter duo were accused by Giuliani of tampering with votes, leading to Trump’s election loss. Showing up to vote for (we can safely assume) the same guy that you attacked innocent people for, in the car he was supposed to turn over to those innocent people, is just a particularly petty fuck you from Giuliani.",
