  "description": "Bookings for the updated Lexus LX 500d have officially been opened, with prices starting at Rs 3 crore (ex-showroom, India). Lexus will offer the new LX 500d in two variants - a standard Urban version and an off-road-centric Overtrail edition - but the flagship SUV will not get any petrol powertrains. This is also the second Lexus Overtrail model to launch in India, with the NX 350h Overtrail having debuted here in 2024. Imposing exterior design with large grille, 22-inch wheels, and more Cabin gets three displays, massaging seats, 4-zone climate control, etc. Engine options solely limited to 304hp, 3.3-litre twin-turbo diesel V6 Lexus LX 500d exterior design Thanks to its ladder-frame construction, the LX 500d has a tall and imposing stance. Up front, the distinctive Lexus spindle grille is flanked by large, angular headlights with L-shaped LED signatures, and the lower half of the fascia contains huge vertically-oriented air intakes. The LX 500d’s side profile features a massive glass area and 22-inch alloy wheels, and at the rear, the large connected tail-lamps and chunky cladding take prominence. LX 500d Overtrail gets several cosmetic changes The LX 500d Overtrail ditches the Urban variant’s chrome trim in favour of blacked-out elements throughout the body, such as on the grille, fog lights, roof rails, wing mirrors, door handles, etc.  It also gets smaller 18-inch matte grey aluminium wheels shod in higher-profile tyres, as well as an exclusive ‘Moon Desert’ colour option. Lexus LX 500d interior and features LX 500d buyers can opt to have the cabin upholstered in either tan or crimson leather on the dashboard, doors, and seats. There’s a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen atop the satin silver-wreathed centre console, underneath which there’s a 7-inch drive mode display, HVAC vents and controls, and more. The three-spoke steering wheel gets paddleshifters, and straight ahead, there’s an 8-inch MID display in the instrument cluster and a heads-up display. Feature-wise, the LX 500d is packed with goodies like front-seat massage functions, heated and ventilated front and rear seats, 4-zone climate control, wireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto, two 11-6-inch entertainment displays for rear passengers, a single-pane sunroof, 25-speaker 3D Mark Levinson sound system, and more. The SUV also comes with Lexus Connect Technology, which offers app-based features like remote start/stop and unlock, roadside assistance, find my car, vehicle health monitoring, etc. Safety is taken care of with an ADAS suite comprising blind spot monitoring, pre-collision system, lane departure and trace assist, safe exit assist, adaptive cruise control, and adaptive high beams, as well as 10 airbags, traction control, hill assist control, trailer sway control, and more. LX 500d Overtrail interior changes Much like the exterior, the LX 500d’s Overtrail variant sports some differences inside as well. The cabin gets a dark green ‘Overtrail Monolith’ colour scheme on the seats, dashboard, and doors, as well as black trim instead of satin silver in some areas. Lexus LX 500d engine and gearbox The LX 500d’s sole engine option is a 3.3-litre twin-turbo diesel V6 pumping out 304hp and 700Nm of torque, mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. In the dynamics department, the SUV gets all-wheel drive, active height control, a standard centre differential lock, and adaptive suspension. The Overtrail variant additionally comes with front and rear differential locks. Five drive modes can be selected on the LX 500d for varying conditions, namely Normal, Eco, Comfort, Sport S, and Sport S+. There’s also a Custom mode which allows owners to tweak the settings according to their preferences. Lexus LX 500d price and rivals The standard LX 500d Urban starts at Rs 3 crore, with the Overtrail variant commanding a premium of Rs 12 lakh over that. In India, the LX 500d goes up against the BMW XM, Mercedes-Maybach GLS, and Range Rover.
