  "description": "This 1946 Ford Deluxe coupe was refurbished around 2014 by its reported second owner with work that involved installing a 1951 Mercury 8BA 255ci flathead V8, repainting the body in metallic gray, fitting 1946 Ford Sportsman taillights, omitting the exterior trim, and retrimming the gray interior. Equipment includes a three-speed manual transmission, Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Edelbrock 94 carburetors, electric and mechanical fuel pumps, a 12-volt electrical system, dual exhaust, red-painted 15” steel wheels, hubcaps and trim rings, whitewall tires, a cowl vent, and lap belts. The seller purchased the vehicle in 2016 and subsequently converted it to PerTronix electronic ignition, rebuilt the carburetors, and replaced the coil, battery, starter, and mechanical fuel pump. In preparation for the sale, the radiator was serviced, the spark plugs were replaced, the oil was changed, and the brake shoes were adjusted. This modified Ford is now offered with partial service records, car-show awards, spare parts, an owner's manual, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Equipment includes a three-speed manual transmission, Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Edelbrock 94 carburetors, electric and mechanical fuel pumps, a 12-volt electrical system, dual exhaust, red-painted 15” steel wheels, hubcaps and trim rings, whitewall tires, a cowl vent, and lap belts. The seller purchased the vehicle in 2016 and subsequently converted it to PerTronix electronic ignition, rebuilt the carburetors, and replaced the coil, battery, starter, and mechanical fuel pump. In preparation for the sale, the radiator was serviced, the spark plugs were replaced, the oil was changed, and the brake shoes were adjusted. This modified Ford is now offered with partial service records, car-show awards, spare parts, an owner’s manual, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car was repainted in metallic gray during the aforementioned refurbishment. Taillights from a 1946 Ford Sportsman convertible were adapted, and the body’s external trim was not reinstalled. The side mirrors were replaced in 2021, and other features include a two-piece windshield, a cowl vent, a red-accented chrome grille, chrome bumpers, dual exhaust outlets, and a refurbished 1945/1946 California license plate. Blemishes in the paint are pictured in the gallery below. Red-painted 15” steel wheels feature bright hubcaps and trim rings and are mounted with 225/70 BFGoodrich Silvertown Radial tires. The brake lines have been replaced, and the brake shoes were adjusted in February 2025. The single row of bench seating is trimmed in gray upholstery, which carries over to other parts of the interior but with the addition of red piping. Appointments include interior lighting, lap belts, gray carpeting, door-panel armrests, vent windows, dual sun visors, and chrome dashboard trim. A period AM radio was installed in the dashboard under current ownership, although the seller has neither connected nor tested the device. The analog clock is inoperable. The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and an aftermarket wrap. Instrumentation consists of a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, charge status, and coolant temperature. A replacement speedometer was installed in January 2025, and photos of the current and previously installed odometers are provided in the gallery. The seller estimates having driven the car approximately 3k miles, and true mileage is unknown. The 255ci 8BA flathead V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1951 Mercury and was installed in this car in 2014. The engine is complemented by Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Edelbrock 94 carburetors, chrome air-filter covers, and a chrome alternator. A conversion to a 12-volt electrical system has been performed. An electric fuel pump that has a manual on/off switch works in conjunction with a mechanical fuel pump that was replaced in 2020. The seller converted the vehicle to PerTronix electronic ignition with a PerTronix Flamethrower coil in 2020. The carburetors were rebuilt and tuned in 2022. The battery, starter, and fuel filter also were replaced under current ownership. The spark plugs were replaced in November 2024, and the radiator was cleaned and repainted in January 2025 and the bottom hoses and the drain petcock were replaced. A list of the work conducted under current ownership is viewable in the gallery. The seller notes that the engine exhibits normal oil pressure on startup but that the oil pressure reads low at warm idle. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a column-shifted three-speed manual gearbox. The transmission fluid was replaced in 2019. The car is titled under the sequence 1GA237932, which aligns with Ford’s numbering conventions for 1946 and is visible in the photo above. You are not connected to real-time updates.
