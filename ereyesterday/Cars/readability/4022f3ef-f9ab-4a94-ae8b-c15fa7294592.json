It was acquired new by the current owner, who commissioned Shelby Parts and Restoration of Green Bay, Wisconsin, to install a Tremec TKO500 five-speed transmission and a 347ci stroker V8 with a forged rotating assembly, MSD ignition components, and four Weber 48 IDA carburetors. Additional details include FIA-style pin-drive wheels, disc brakes, QA1 adjustable front coilovers, Lucas headlamps, and a triangulated roll hoop in addition to English wool carpeting, a custom aluminum dashboard fascia housing restored 1960s-era Stewart-Warner instrumentation, iridium-tipped toggle switches, and Impact competition latch-and-link lap belts. This Cobra CSX7000 is now offered on behalf of the seller’s spouse with a Kansas title describing it as a 1964 Shelby Cobra. The fiberglass bodywork is finished in metallic blue with a red FIA-style stripe, period racing decals, and white #146 roundels, which is designed to emulate CSX2323, first raced at the 1964 Targa Florio. Additional exterior details include quick-jack bumperettes, Lucas tri-bar headlamps, a hood scoop, fender vents, wind wings, bullet-style side mirrors, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and custom side-exit exhaust pipes. FIA-style 15″ pin-drive wheels are secured with safety-wired three-eared knockoffs and are mounted with Avon tires measuring 215/70 up front and 245/60 out back. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with Shelby-branded calipers. Replacement QA1 adjustable coilovers have been fitted at all four corners, and the seller states the front and rear springs have been modified for a 1-inch lower ride height, which reportedly allows the rear suspension to go through its full range without binding. The low-back bucket seats are trimmed in black leather upholstery and are joined by color-coordinated English wool carpeting and an aluminum dashboard fascia. The driver’s roll hoop triangulates into the right footwell, and additional interior elements include a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, tinted sunvisors, iridium-tipped toggle switches, and Impact competition latch-and-link lap belts. The three-spoke steering wheel frames refurbished instrumentation including a clocked central Sun tachometer flanked by Stewart Warner auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, oil temperature, and fuel pressure. A 160-mph Stewart Warner speedometer is mounted on the right side of the dashboard, and the seller notes a hidden fuel level gauge is fitted. The five-digit mechanical odometer on the ’60s Stewart Warner speedometer shows 2k miles and was not reset when it was installed in this chassis, and the seller states that the car has been driven approximately 275 miles. A 14-gallon fuel tank has been installed in the trunk in addition to the car’s standard 13-gallon unit, both of which have individual filters and are drawn from through a Holley blue electric fuel pump. The front-hinged hood opens to reveal a 347ci stroker V8 that utilizes a cast Boss block with four-bolt mains fitted with a Forged Scat crankshaft and rods, forged 10:1 SRP pistons, Goodwin Competition stage 2 Dart cylinder heads, a Weber-specification camshaft, and COMP cams 1.6:1 roller rockers. The engine is further equipped with MSD ignition components, a Tilton oil pump and cooler, and four Weber 48 IDA carburetors with velocity stacks. The seller notes the engine has been built to run on 91-octane fuel. The radiator features an electric fan and a custom-fabricated aluminum shroud. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Tremec TKO500 five-speed manual transmission with a QuickTime SFI bellhousing, a McLeod clutch, a Kirkham billet clutch fork, bronze shift fork pads, and carbon synchros in addition to a rear differential equipped with 3.55:1 gearing. The chassis number CSX7073 shown above matches the VIN listed on the transferrable Kansas title, which carries an “Antique” brand and describes the car as a 1964 Shelby Cobra.
