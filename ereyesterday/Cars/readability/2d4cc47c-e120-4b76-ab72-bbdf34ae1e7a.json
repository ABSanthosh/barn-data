  "text": "Jeep is under new management after sales dropped more than 385,000 units in less than a decade 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier The revolving door of Jeep CEOs has spit out a new leader in the form of Bob Broderdorf. Alain Favey has been tapped to lead Peugeot, while Xavier Peugeot takes over at DS Automobiles. Stellantis’ bureaucracy has also been revamped to allow for “enhanced local decision-making.” Stellantis continues to shake things up following the departure of CEO Carlos Tavares as the company has appointed new heads of Jeep, Peugeot, DS Automobiles, and their Pro One commercial vehicles unit. The company has also taken steps to “simplify its organization,” which allows for more regional control. Starting with Jeep’s revolving door of executives, Antonio Filosa is out as he has more important things on his plate as Stellantis’ chief operating officer of North America. He’s being replaced by Bob Broderdorf, who has previously served as senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand for North America. More: Tim Kuniskis Returns As Ram CEO Following Executive Shakeup Stellantis went on to note “Broderdorf will head a new leadership team for the Jeep brand, merging North America and global operations into one group managing sales, operations, product, communications and marketing.” The company also announced that former Ram boss, Mike Koval, will become senior vice president and head of sales operations at Jeep. It remains to be seen if the changes will help, but Stellantis has driven Jeep sales into the ground with a series of missteps that include eliminating the Cherokee and hiking prices skyward. These and other mistakes have caused U.S. sales to drop from 973,227 units in 2018 to 587,725 units last year. That’s a staggering decline of 385,502 vehicles in less than a decade. Bob Broderdorf In Europe, Xavier Peugeot becomes CEO of DS Automobiles. He succeeds Olivier François, who is “continuing with other strategic missions within Stellantis.” Peugeot joined PSA Peugeot Citroën in 1994 and has held various titles over the years including Director of Peugeot Netherlands, Peugeot Product Director, and Head of Citroën Product. Speaking of Peugeot, Alain Favey has been named CEO of the French automaker. He spent 20 years at PSA Group, before leaving for Volkswagen and then Europcar Mobility Group. Favey replaces Linda Jackson, who has retired after 20 years with the company. Lastly, Anne Abboud has been appointed to lead Stellantis Pro One. More Regional Control, Tavares Successor To Be Named Soon Apart from personnel changes, Stellantis revealed their various regions now have “enhanced local decision-making and execution capabilities in respect of product planning, product development, industrial and commercial activities.” The company’s Corporate Affairs and Communications teams are also being combined to deliver “constant engagement with all its stakeholders.” There’s also a new Marketing Office, which promises to better support the company’s various brands. This includes through traditional advertising as well as global events and sponsorships. As for the biggest spot left unfilled, that’s Tavares former position as Stellantis CEO. However, the automaker said the search for a replacement is “well under way” and “will be concluded within the first half of 2025.”",
