  "text": "The Vistiq is making its way towards dealers with a $2,000 cash allowance March 24, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier The 2026 Cadillac Vistiq is headed to dealers and some are already offering discounts. The model starts at $77,395 but will apparently be offered with a $2,000 cash allowance. Power comes from a dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing 615 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque. Cadillac introduced the 2026 Vistiq last year and it’s set to arrive at U.S. dealerships this spring. Dealers are now preparing for its arrival and some are already offering discounts on the three-row electric crossover. While most seem to be sticking to MSRP, Cadillac of Las Vegas has three crossovers listed for $2,000 below sticker. It’s a similar story at Mount Kisco Cadillac in New York, which has their $80,215 Vistiq Luxury listed for $78,215. More: 2026 Cadillac Vistiq Packs Is A Three-Row Luxury EV With Blackwing Levels Of Power Looking deeper into the matter, it appears the EV will be launching with a $2,000 “Competitive Cash Allowance.” That’s a welcome discount, but it doesn’t make much of a dent as pricing starts at $77,395 before a $1,395 destination fee. That’s more than $50,000 cheaper than the Escalade IQ and the Vistiq comes nicely equipped with LED lighting units, an Illuminated grille, and 21-inch wheels. Buyers will also find a power liftgate, soft-close doors, and a panoramic dual pane sunroof. The interior echoes the Lyriq and sports a 33-inch curved display, a 23-speaker AKG audio system, and heated, ventilated, massaging front seats wrapped in Inteluxe upholstery. They’re joined by a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, and a power tilt/telescoping steering column. Customers will also find a wireless smartphone charger, a universal home remote, and a 126 color ambient lighting system. The Vistiq comes with a host of standard driver assistance systems including Super Cruise, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Rear Cross Traffic Braking. Other highlights include Blind Zone Steering Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, and an HD Surround Vision system. Power comes from a 102 kWh battery pack, which feeds a dual-motor all-wheel drive system developing 615 hp (459 kW / 624 PS) and 650 lb-ft (880 Nm) of torque. This enables the crossover to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.7 seconds and have a range of up to 305 miles (491 km). Michael Gauthier / Carscoops",
