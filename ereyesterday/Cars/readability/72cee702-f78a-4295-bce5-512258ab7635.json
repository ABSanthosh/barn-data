  "description": "This 1975 Maserati Bora is one of 564 examples manufactured during a seven-year production run and is one of approximately 275 built with power from a 4.9-liter DOHC V8. Chassis 916 was completed in April 1975 and was delivered new through Maserati Automobiles in Los Angeles. The car is said to have remained under ownership in California between the early 1990s and 2017 when it was moved to Florida and underwent a cosmetic refurbishment that included a repaint in Blu Ischia Metallizzato. A subsequent mechanical refurbishment included a rebuild and overbore of the engine and its four Weber carburetors. Additional features include a ZF five-speed manual transaxle, Bosch electronic ignition, a Citroën hydraulic system, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Campagnolo alloy wheels, and blue and black leather interior upholstery. This Bora was purchased by the current owner on BaT in May 2022 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Illinois with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, records, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner's LLC.",

Chassis 916 was completed in April 1975 and was delivered new through Maserati Automobiles in Los Angeles. The car is said to have remained under ownership in California between the early 1990s and 2017 when it was moved to Florida and underwent a cosmetic refurbishment that included a repaint in Blu Ischia Metallizzato. A subsequent mechanical refurbishment included a rebuild and overbore of the engine and its four Weber carburetors. Additional features include a ZF five-speed manual transaxle, Bosch electronic ignition, a Citroën hydraulic system, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Campagnolo alloy wheels, and blue and black leather interior upholstery. This Bora was purchased by the current owner on BaT in May 2022 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Illinois with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, records, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The Bora debuted in March 1971 featuring a wedge-shaped profile styled by Italdesign’s Giorgetto Giugiaro. Additional design elements include a brushed stainless-steel roof and A-pillars and hydraulically deployed pop-up headlights. Later Boras such as this car featured a rectangular vent panel on the front hood and rounded headlight bucket corners. European-style chrome bumpers have been fitted to this example in lieu of US-market impact bumpers, while lighting incorporates European-market taillights and US-market side markers. The car underwent a previous color change from its original Bianco Polo Park to Blu Ischia Metallizzato, which was retained during the repaint performed between 2017 and 2018. Additional work by Michaelian Restoration in Stuart, Florida, included reshaping areas of the floor pans, repainting the rear quarter louvers and front grille screens, and replacement of the headlight lift cylinders. Imperfections in the finish are shown up close in the photo gallery below. Campagnolo cast-alloy wheels were refinished in 2018 and wear chrome covers, while 215/70VR15 Michelin XWX tires showing 2014 date codes are mounted at each corner. A matching spare is secured in the rear compartment overtop the transaxle. The braking system utilizes a Citroën high-pressure hydraulic system acting on four-wheel ventilated discs. The cabin is upholstered in blue leather over the seats, door panels, and dash fascia, while black leather covers the console and firewall. Additional trim includes black flocked leather over the upper dash, black Wilton wool carpeting, and a white ribbed headliner. Adjustment of the seat height, steering column, and pedal box is handled via the hydraulic system. Amenities include power windows, a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, and air conditioning, the latter of which was overhauled with a replacement condenser and compressor in 2018. The system was recharged with R134a refrigerant in August 2019. The padded steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and an oil pressure gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 40k miles, approximately 170 of which were added under current ownership. A quintet of instruments to the driver’s right includes a quartz clock and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, fuel level, oil temperature, and voltage. The oil pressure warning lamp switch was replaced in October 2020. The mid-mounted 4.9-liter V8 utilizes an aluminum block, aluminum cylinder heads with hemispherical combustion chambers, and dual overhead camshafts on each bank. A rebuild performed by Specialty Car Solutions in Houston, Texas, in March 2019 included the installation of oversize-bore pistons and .010”-under main and rod bearings. The crankshaft was crack-checked and turned to .010” under, and the crankshaft timing chain sprocket, cam chain guides and tensioner, and exhaust guides and retainers were also replaced. The Weber carburetors were also rebuilt in 2019, and the distributor cap, rotor, and fuel pressure regulator were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transaxle with a hydraulically actuated clutch. The clutch disc, clutch plate, and throwout bearing were replaced in 2019, while the clutch cylinders were replaced in July 2020. The steering rack was rebuilt in November 2019.
