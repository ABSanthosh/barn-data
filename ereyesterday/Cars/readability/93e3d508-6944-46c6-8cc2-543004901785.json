  "description": "This 1953 Alfa Romeo 1900C Sprint is one of approximately 100 examples constructed with Pinin Farina coupe coachwork between 1952 and 1953. Chassis 01534 is noted to have undergone refurbishment work in Sweden in the mid-1990s before being exported to Japan. It later spent time in a Northern California collection and was the recipient of a mechanical refresh beginning in the late 2000s that included an overhaul of its twin-cam inline-four to a displacement of 1,975cc before changing hands via the selling dealer in 2014 and again in 2018. The car was purchased by a prior owner in 2020, and subsequent service involved a correction of its red paint along with a re-trim of its black leather interior. After being listed on BaT in October 2023, the car was fitted with a replacement steering box. Other modifications include a floor-shifted five-speed manual transmission, twin Weber carburetors, an oil cooler, an electric fuel pump, an electric cooling fan, updated front suspension components, bolstered seats, and exhaust cut-outs. It rides on 16” Borrani wire wheels and is further equipped with finned aluminum drum brakes, Marchal fog lamps, and a Nardi wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 1900C is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with service records, a tool kit, a handheld Marchal spot lamp, and a clean California title.",

The car was purchased by a prior owner in 2020, and subsequent service involved a correction of its red paint along with a re-trim of its black leather interior. After being listed on BaT in October 2023, the car was fitted with a replacement steering box. Other modifications include a floor-shifted five-speed manual transmission, twin Weber carburetors, an oil cooler, an electric fuel pump, an electric cooling fan, updated front suspension components, bolstered seats, and exhaust cut-outs. It rides on 16” Borrani wire wheels and is further equipped with finned aluminum drum brakes, Marchal fog lamps, and a Nardi wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 1900C is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with service records, a tool kit, a handheld Marchal spot lamp, and a clean California title. The 1900 was introduced in 1950 as Alfa Romeo’s first model with unitary construction, and variations of the chassis were supplied to independent coachbuilders beginning the following year. Using the short-wheelbase 1900 Corto chassis, Pinin Farina produced coachwork for both a cabriolet and fastback coupe variant. The coupe featured steel body panels just .7mm thick to assist in weight saving, while aluminum was utilized for the hood and trunk lid. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in December 2024. The winning bidder successfully completed the purchase and now the selling dealer is listing the vehicle on their behalf. This example is finished in red, and its lower nose panel was repaired and refinished in the early 2010s, at which time the scudetto center grille and front inlet “eyebrows” were re-chromed. A paint correction was performed under prior ownership, although stone chips are noted on leading surfaces, and the hood sits proud of the adjacent fender panels. Features include split chrome bumpers, yellow Marchal fog lights, and a driver-side mirror. Tape previously adhered across the headlights and has since been removed. A majority of the selling dealer’s photos date from May 2023. Borrani wire wheels were installed in 2011 and are secured by two-eared knock-offs. Michelin X tires measuring 5.50R16 and showing 2019 date codes are mounted at each corner as well as on a matching spare housed in the trunk. Stopping is handled by aluminum-finned hydraulic drum brakes that were fitted during the mechanical refresh under previous ownership. The steering box was replaced in 2024. The left-hand-drive cabin houses a pair of Zagato-style bolstered seats that were re-trimmed in black leather under prior ownership, at which time the seat support brackets were refinished and replacement black carpeting was fitted. Features include silver latch-and-link lap belts, a console-mounted shifter with a polished alloy knob, a lockable glovebox, and leather luggage straps over the rear shelf. An electrical cut-off switch has been added under the left side of the dash. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel sits ahead of a replacement instrument panel housing a 220-km/h speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring oil temperature, voltage, oil pressure, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 5k kilometers (~3,100 miles), and total mileage is unknown. The DOHC inline-four was overhauled by The Pit Stop in Brisbane, California, in the early 2010s with a displacement increase to 1,975cc, while a valve job was performed under prior ownership. Induction is through twin Weber 44 DCO carburetors, an Abarth intake manifold, and a FISPA air filter, while additional features include an oil cooler, an electric fuel pump, and an electric cooling fan. The fuel tank was replaced in 2011. The floor-shifted five-speed manual transmission was overhauled and installed under previous ownership in lieu of the original column-shifted four-speed unit. A welded area can be seen on the tail housing of the transmission. Suspension comprises an independent front setup, a live-axle rear with coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers all around. Updated front A-arms and Koni rear shocks were installed in the early 2010s, at which time the replacement rear differential was rebuilt and damage to the right front of the frame was repaired. The exhaust system is equipped with cut-outs, and a hole is visible in the rear muffler. Included in the sale are a corded hand-held Marchal spot lamp and a tool kit in a cloth roll.
