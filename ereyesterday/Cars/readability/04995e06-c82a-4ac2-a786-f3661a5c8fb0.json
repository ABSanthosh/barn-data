The winning bidder and a guest will receive a tour of the Hispano-Suiza factory in Barcelona, followed by a driving experience in the electric Hispano Suiza Carmen, either on the track at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya or on the road in Peralada. Styled by Barcelona-based Cero Design, the Carmen features carbon-fiber monocoque and bodywork, butterfly-style doors, and four AC electric motors powered by a 700-volt battery pack and producing a factory-rated 1,005 horsepower. The trip will continue north to the region of l’Empordà and the Michelin-key-winning Peralada Resort, where the winning bidder and a guest will experience lunch at the Cellar 1923 wine bar and restaurant. The two will also receive dinner at the Castell Peralada restaurant set within the walls of a 14th-century castle. The winner and a guest will also gain access to the McLaren paddock at the 2025 Spanish Grand Prix, which will be held between May 30 and June 1. The experience will include lunch each day at the McLaren hospitality unit and a tour of the McLaren garage, from which the winner and guest will have the opportunity to watch the race. The winner will also receive a race suit worn and signed by Oscar Piastri. At the conclusion of the auction, payment from the winning bidder will be made directly to the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. The winning bidder will choose the dates and time of the Hispano-Suiza and Peralada experiences, which are recommended to be scheduled near the time of the Spanish Grand Prix. Flights and other transportation, including between Peralada and the Spanish Grand Prix, are the responsibility of the winner, as are hotel accommodations during the Spanish Grand Prix.
