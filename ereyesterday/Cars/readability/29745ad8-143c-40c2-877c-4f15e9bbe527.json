Then, out of nowhere, a flash of light in the distance, followed by the unmistakable howl of a Ford twin-cam engine echoing through the trees. The headlights, six of them in total, including four huge auxiliary lamps, illuminate the road ahead. Before you know it, a Ford Escort rally car flies past you sideways, gravel spraying from its rear tyres. How could it get any more exciting? Well, imagine if it was your dad behind the wheel – just like it was for Daniel Zetterval from Sweden when he was a young boy. “My dad is my biggest influence,” Daniel says. “He started as a Ford mechanic at 16. He raced go-karts from a young age and got into rallying as soon as he got his licence.” Given that background, I can’t imagine Daniel ever straying from Ford. Brand loyalty runs deep, especially when passed down through the generations. If Daniel had ever shown up at home with an Opel, I suspect he might have been politely shown the door. The Mk1 Escort, of course, has a legendary status that long predates Brian O’Connor jumping over a bridge several hundreds of metres in the air. With historic wins in the Circuit of Ireland, the London to Mexico, and several RAC rallies, the humble Ford was bound to be successful in Europe. “My dad started in Mk1 Escorts, then got rid of them when the Mk2 arrived.” Daniel recalls that his father “started chopping up the Mk1s he had stored with an axe! Crazy considering what they’re worth today.” Though I suppose chopping up Escorts runs in the family if you look at the bodywork of Daniel’s car. The Mk1’s shell has been extensively modified, with period-correct ‘bubble’ arches crafted from custom moulds. “We got rid of around 70% of the original rusted metal and welded in a 6-point roll cage, as well as strengthening the chassis,” Daniel explains. “The arches and rear quarter panels are fibreglass, as was the bonnet until it snapped in the middle going 200km/h down the straight at Mantorp Park!” As per the race cars of this era, the chrome bumpers have been removed, and a chin spoiler has been added to the front for less lift at speed – with the added benefit of looking fantastic too. Inside the arches, you’ll find 15×8-inch Revolution Minilites wrapped in 225/45R15 Toyo Proxes R888R semi-slicks. Painted in Porsche Olive Green, this Mk1 is peak classic Ford for me. While the Mk2 may get the most love these days, the Mk1’s Coke-bottle shape and mini-muscle car look with its bulging rally arches holds a special place in my heart. The interior is a work of art, too. There’s a full roll cage alongside FIA-approved Cobra seats, while analogue Stack gauges have been fitted into the original dashboard, which has been flocked and modified. A Sparco steering wheel, Sparco harnesses, and a Coolerworx shifter keep Daniel connected to the driving experience. A helmet box always lives in the car, packed with the essentials: helmet, intercom headset, and driving shoes. As Daniel says, “I’m never not racing.” And when it comes to racing, this Escort can get down with the best of them. Originally fitted with a modest 1,300cc crossflow engine, the Mk1 now features the ultimate OEM+ upgrade for a classic European Ford: the legendary Cosworth YB. Stroked to 2.1 litres, with ZRP block internals and a race-spec cylinder head, the turbocharged inline-four punches well above its weight. The DOHC 16-valve’s head’s potential is maximised with ENEM camshafts, while a Garrett GTX3067R turbo provides the boost. The setup exhales through a custom 3.5-inch turbo-back exhaust system and a Big Apple rear silencer. Tuned through a MaxxECU Street engine management system, the engine makes a staunch 450hp. A BMW Getrag 6-speed gearbox, Quaife limited-slip differential and heavy-duty half-shafts in the Ford Atlas semi-floating axle – with a 4-link kit and Watt’s linkage – ensure the power is put down reliably. There are Bilstein front coilovers and GAZ rears, while stopping power is handled by Wilwood Superlite and Dynalite callipers all around, with separate Dynalite handbrake callipers out the back. Daniel’s favourite part of the car? “It’s the colour scheme. I had a vision of how it should look, and when all the pieces came together, they just fit perfectly.” “This car’s been through it all,” he laughs. “I’ve lost a wheel on a drive, had it hit while parked outside our garage. On its first track day, the bonnet cracked. And on the last track day, the engine caught fire!” Sadly, Daniel has faced more recent misfortune. “We had a big fire in our garage a few weeks ago. We lost seven cars, including our rally car and my next two projects – a Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth and a Mk2 Escort with a big Zakspeed body kit.”  I’d be devastated, but Daniel is focused on moving forward and improving the Mk1. To him, it’s never been just about the car; it’s about the bond forged with his father. “We started this Escort as a father-son project in 2013, basically as a way for him and I to hang out in the garage for two or three nights per week,” Daniel recalls. “Lots of beer and good conversation with the older guys.”  From watching his dad race through the woods as a child to building this incredible car together – of all the heartwarming stories I’ve shared, Daniel’s might take the crown.
