  "description": "The latest addition to our long-term garage is the TVS Apache RTR 310 and, unfortunately, the recent heap of launches and the Auto Expo left me with very little time with it. Due to this, I’ve only been able to clock a little over 100km on it. During that time, I used it for my commutes to work and a quick grocery run or two.  There’s no denying the Apache RTR 310 is a cool-looking motorcycle, forcing me to turn back each time I’ve parked it. While its design may seem a little too in your face and youthful to some, I’ve slowly taken a liking to it. My only gripe is with how busy the overall design can seem, and I would have appreciated a more minimalist approach towards stickering and branding.  The Apache RTR 310’s headlight offers excellent illumination, making night rides a breeze. This is one of the most tech-loaded Apaches one can buy and will require you to be a little tech-savvy to navigate its 5-inch TFT and the plethora of information on display. The RTR 310 has a total of five ride modes, dual-channel ABS, a TPMS, traction control and even cruise control, making it an extremely well-equipped motorcycle for its price. However, its 5-inch TFT can be quite tightly packed with information and, at times, a bit too overwhelming to keep track of on the go. While the seat offers good comfort, its slippery texture leaves you hunting for grip. The seat provides decent comfort, and I am grateful our unit isn’t equipped with the cooling seat option, as we found the hardware of that system to feel quite uncomfortable under the seat padding. The slightly raised pillion seat also provides great support when riding fast. I find that the tank and seat tend to feel slippery, leaving you rocking back and forth under hard acceleration or braking. Perhaps a set of tank grips could be added to omit this.  The reactive throttle means you have to be a lot more cautious and sensitive about your inputs. The majority of my commute is on highways, and this 310cc packs enough poke to keep it fun and engaging. I usually kept the bike in Rain or Urban mode, as these were the calmest modes on offer. But even so, the reactive throttle paired with the short gearing made the Apache RTR 310 almost over-eager and quite KTM-like in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Part of me is still getting acquainted with its snappy mannerisms, and hopefully, this is something that will start to grow on me as time passes. Michelin Road 5 tyres offer great traction, even on our concrete roads. Another thing that has impressed me so far is the immense grip from the top-quality Michelin Road 5 tyres, which provide excellent grip in both dry and wet conditions. I’ve had plenty of experience with these tyres in the past and look forward to clocking more miles on them. Also see: TVS Apache RTR 310 road test, review",
