  "text": "The tech giant known for building iPhones is entering the car game as a contractor, not an independent brand April 9, 2025 at 20:48 by Andreas Tsaousis Foxconn reportedly approached Nissan before the automaker entered talks with rival Honda instead. After merger discussions collapsed, Foxconn proposed an alliance with three major Japanese brands. The Apple iPhone maker says it’s ready to launch EVs but won’t use its name, only partner brands. We bet you’ve never heard of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chances are, though, that you’ve either heard or read about Foxconn, the Taiwanese tech giant that builds iPhones for Apple – and the former is its official name. Another thing you’re probably aware of, if you’ve been paying any attention to car-related news, is that tech companies are not content with making smartphones and laptops anymore and are actively engaging in the automotive business now that EVs have taken off. Which, in a way, makes perfect sense as traditional automakers are trying to outdo each other by offering lots of advanced tech in their new vehicles. Foxconn Ready To Build A Range Of EVs Since customers are more interested in things like advanced infotainment systems and electrification sort of levels the playing field between newcomers and established players in the car game, the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, and even Sony decided to take advantage of that. Foxconn recently made headlines as one of the parties interested in Nissan, which is in serious trouble. The Japanese company though would rather get in bed with fellow manufacturer Honda, but the proposed merger eventually fell through. Enter Jun Seki, a Foxconn top executive who also happens to be Nissan’s former COO after then CEO Carlos Ghosn was ousted from the company and prosecuted by Japanese authorities. Seki said that Foxconn already has what it takes to build a range of EVs. They will initially be manufactured in Taiwan and shipped around the world, but the company can also produce them locally to cater to each market’s demands. US-Market EVs Will Be Built Locally “It is right to make them in the market where they are sold”, Seki said according to Autonews. “But it is inefficient without a certain number of units, so we are making them in Taiwan now as a transitional measure.” This is a wise strategy, especially when it comes to the US, which is the world’s second biggest market after China. With Trump’s new tariffs shaking up the industry and making imported cars pricier than ever, forcing a number of established brands to suspend their shipments as they scramble to formulate a new strategy, a newcomer with no customer base has no choice but to manufacture its vehicles locally if it wants to be competitive. Foxconn already builds the Model C midsize crossover that’s sold its home market since December 2023 as the Luxgen N7. Its global expansion, though, will start with the Model B minivan that’ll be launched in Taiwan in the second half of the year and will be sold in Australia with the badges of a Japanese brand that’s believed to be Mitsubishi. However, in the fourth quarter it plans to import the Model C in the US for customers to try out, and in 2027 it will introduce the stylish Model D minivan. Teaming Up With The Japanese Would Be Ideal After the negotiations between Honda and Nissan ended, Foxconn reportedly proposed an alliance between itself, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi, touting its expertise in cutting-edge technology as a key advantage for the automakers’ future models. Seki admitted that Foxconn is working with Mitsubishi, but wouldn’t elaborate on the matter. He did, however, state that Japanese brands make for great partners due to their focus on quality. “Japanese carmakers are careful planners, and we understand that but are also very fast,” Seki said. “We can do things faster while understanding Japanese prudence.” Moreover, Seki made it clear that Foxconn won’t launch the EVs it will build under its own name. Rather, following the example of its electronics division, it will manufacture them for other brands, just like the iPhone, thus it won’t be seen as a competitor but a valuable partner.",
