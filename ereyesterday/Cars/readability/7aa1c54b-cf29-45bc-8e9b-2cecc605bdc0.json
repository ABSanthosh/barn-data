Ordered without a sunroof, the car is finished in black over black cloth upholstery and powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a G50 five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 17″ Cup wheels, M030 sport suspension, a fixed rear spoiler, fog lights, air conditioning, power-adjustable sport seats, and a Bluetooth-capable Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM) system. Work completed in April 2025 included resealing the camshaft housing, adjusting the valves, and replacing the valve cover gaskets in addition to servicing the brakes. This 964 RS America is offered in California on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a tire inflation kit, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The RS America was a lightweight derivative of the contemporary Carrera 2 and is distinguished from the base car by a revised fixed rear spoiler as well as RS scripts on the rear decklid and quarter panels. This example is finished in black and was ordered without a sunroof. Paint touch-ups have been applied to the rear quarter panel arches and rocker panels, and paint correction has been performed on the front fenders. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 17″ Cup wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires that were fitted in preparation for the sale. The factory M030 sport suspension features a larger-diameter front stabilizer bar and upgraded shock absorbers shared with the 911 Turbo. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated and cross-drilled discs with red-painted calipers, and service in April 2025 involved flushing the brake fluid as well as replacing the front discs and pads. The cabin features power-adjustable front sport seats trimmed in black cloth with leatherette sides. Amenities include air conditioning, RUF aluminum pedals, door pull straps, and a Bluetooth-capable Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM) system linked to Pioneer speakers. RS Americas were also equipped with a luggage shelf and enclosed storage compartments in place of the rear seats. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as a 180-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 15k miles, approximately 100 of which were added during current ownership. The 3.6-liter flat-six was factory rated at 247 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque. Service completed in preparation for the sale totaled approximately $7k and involved disassembling the engine to reseal the camshaft housing, adjust the valve clearances, and replace the valve cover gaskets and timing cover seals. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle. The owner’s manual is included in the sale, along with additional manufacturer’s literature, a tire inflation kit, a tool kit, and service records displayed in the gallery below. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Filed under: 964 You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
