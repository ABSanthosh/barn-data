  "text": "The F80 may have hypercar looks but it doesn't sound as good as its predecessors 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Despite the F80’s impressive specs, purists are still debating Ferrari’s choice to use a V6. Even if the hybrid V6 powertrain doesn’t sound particularly exciting, it still packs 1,184 hp. All 799 examples of the hypercar have already been claimed, each priced at around $4 million. The all-new Ferrari F80 hybrid hypercar made its premiere at the Finali Mondiali Ferrari event over the weekend at Italy’s famed Imola circuit. This was our first real opportunity to not only see but actually hear the F80 in motion. Ferrari is producing 799 examples of the F80, and unsurprisingly, every single one has already been claimed. Sure, that technically makes it a “success,” but let’s be honest—any flagship from Maranello sells out before the ink is dry on the press release. However, there’s still plenty of debate online about whether or not Ferrari was wise to fit its new halo hypercar with a twin-turbocharged V6 instead of its naturally-aspirated V12. Spoiler alert; this latest clip will likely only add fuel to the fire for those who argue that a V6 just doesn’t cut it for a car of this stature. Read: Why Ferrari Chose A V6 Over A V12 For Its Flagship F80 Hypercar During the event, the F80 took to the track alongside several of Ferrari’s finest modern-day racing cars, including the Le Mans-winning 499P. There’s no denying that it has eye-catching looks. However, it’s also very quiet. And that’s putting it generously. Ever since we learned about the F80 using a boosted V6, we were worried it wouldn’t sound the part and this clip confirms that’s the case. The engine sounds extremely muffled, and while the driver may not have been revving it through to the redline because of the wet conditions, it seems clear Ferrari has focused on performance with this engine, not passion. We now live in a world where Ferrari’s SUV, the Purosangue, sounds significantly better than its hypercar. Ferrari’s chief marketing and communications officer Enrico Galliera, recently said the F80 has a V6 instead of a V12 as the brand wanted to give it its highest-performing powertrain, rather than its most iconic engine. This particular video doesn’t just give us a good taste of the F80’s soundtrack, but also shows the massive adjustable rear wing in action. At rest, the wing neatly tucks away into the bodywork, but when the hypercar is pushed to its limits, the wing dramatically rises, towering over the vehicle to generate maximum downforce. It’s an undeniably cool party trick, even if the rest of the soundtrack leaves you wanting.",
