  "text": "Ford is planning a strategic shift as the automotive and political landscapes in the U.S. have jumped all over the map in recent times. The Blue Oval will look to extended-range EVs (EREVs) as a way to electrify future SUVs and pickups, including the Super Duty brand. EREVs aren’t really a new thing, as the Chevy Volt debuted around a decade ago with the tech, but there hasn’t been much movement with the configuration in the last few years. Ram will be the first back to market with an EREV, as the Ram 1500 Ramcharger is set to offer 690 miles of range when it arrives later this year. Ford’s new EREV models are still at least two years out.Though they won’t come until 2027, Ford’s move toward EREVs may help it reach profitability with its electric Model e division. Until then, the electric F-150 Lightning has sold well but failed to get anywhere near its gas counterpart’s meteoric sales numbers. Buyers have been skeptical of their range and capabilities, and none of the six on sale today come with what could be considered a reasonable price. Extended-range EVs rely on electric motors powered by batteries for propulsion, but they also have a gas engine that acts as a generator to recharge the battery. The internal combustion engine is not connected to a transmission or drive system, and EREVs charge just like any other EV.[Images: Ford]Become a TTAC insider.
