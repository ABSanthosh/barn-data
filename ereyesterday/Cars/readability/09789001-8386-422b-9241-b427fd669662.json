  "description": "The upcoming new-gen Maruti Dzire has been spied undisguised ahead of its launch, fully revealing its exterior and interior design. The spy shots revealed that the Dzire features significant changes not only over the outgoing model, but also the Swift that it is based on. New Dzire's design to be further distinguished from Swift To get new 82hp, 112Nm Z series engine Price reveal on November 11 New Maruti Dzire: exterior, interior design The compact sedan gets a completely new front-end design that features no resemblance to the new Swift launched earlier this year. It gets a large grille up front, flanked by sharp-looking rectangular LED headlamps. The new Dzire also gets redesigned fog lamp housing along with a chunky gloss black trim connecting the headlamps, with a chrome strip at the bottom. The upcoming sedan looks more mature than the outgoing model, thanks to the sharp styling elements.  The rear-end features Y-shaped LED elements in the tail lamps, with a chrome strip running across the tailgate connecting the two. The boot-lid features a spoiler-like hump, while the rear bumper features some contouring elements. The higher models will get diamond-cut alloy wheels. The interior shot confirms that it will use the same overall layout as the Swift, with a 9-inch free-standing touchscreen system and a new steering wheel. Features on offer will likely include a segment-first electric sunroof, an analogue instrument cluster with a 4.2-inch digital MID. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the new Dzire could even get ADAS – at least in the higher variants. New Maruti Dzire: powertrain  The new Dzire will be offered with the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine as the Swift that makes 82hp and 112Nm. It will also get a petrol-CNG option. A 5-speed manual gearbox will be standard, while the petrol variants will get an automatic gearbox option. Expect Maruti to commence bookings for the new Dzire in the coming weeks, with deliveries starting by around mid-November. Just like the current model, the new Dzire will take on the likes of the Hyundai Aura, Honda Amaze and Tata Tigor. Image source Also see: New Maruti Dzire launch on November 11",
