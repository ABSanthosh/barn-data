  "text": "Over 14 days, the car descended 19,035 feet and traveled more than 3,045 miles 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier A Hyundai Ioniq 5 has set a new record for the greatest altitude change by an EV. Over the course of 14 days, the car descended 19,035 feet to end 9.8 feet below sea level. The record was set in India and saw the Ioniq 5 travel more than 3,045 miles. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has set a new record for the biggest altitude change by an electric vehicle. The feat was organized by Hyundai Motor India and saw the EV descend 19,035 feet (5,802 meters). The trip started at India’s highest drivable point of Umling La in Leh Ladakh, which is 19,025 feet (5,799 meters) above sea level. Over the next two weeks, the car traveled to Kuttanad, Kerala, which is 9.8 feet (3 meters) below sea level. More: Hyundai’s American-Made Ioniq 5 Costs More But Goes The Extra Mile During those 14 days, the Ioniq 5 covered more than 3,045 miles (4,900 km). The car had to endure “challenging terrain and extreme climatic conditions” as well as multiple recharging sessions. Hyundai was unsurprisingly coy about the latter, but the US-spec Ioniq 5 has an EPA-estimated range of up to 318 miles (512 km). This suggests the car would have required at least ten recharges to accomplish the record, although the actual number is presumably higher. In a statement, Hyundai Motor India Managing Director Unsoo Kim said, “We are incredibly proud to see the Hyundai Ioniq 5 create history by achieving the Guinness World Record for the greatest altitude change by an electric car. This achievement is a testament to Hyundai’s unwavering commitment to innovation, technological excellence, and sustainability.” He added, “The Ioniq 5’s performance in such extreme conditions reflects its engineering prowess and durability.” Hyundai didn’t say much about the record-breaking car, but the 2025 Ioniq 5 features revised styling, beefier batteries, and a new NACS port. There’s also a rugged XRT variant that is distinguished by unique fascias and “digital camo” accents. They’re joined by a 0.9-inch (23 mm) lift and matte black wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires.",
