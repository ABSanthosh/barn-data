  "description": "This 1992 Land Rover Range Rover County spent time in North Carolina and Arizona before being acquired by the seller on BaT in September 2024. Work since then involved installing LED headlights, repairing the sunroof, and replacing the ABS hydraulic control assembly as well as various interior and air conditioning components. Finished in Westminster Gray Metallic, the truck is powered by a 3.9-liter V8 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. It rides on 16\" tri-spoke alloy wheels and is further equipped with fog lights, a receiver hitch, Winchester Gray Connolly leather seat upholstery, and a Kenwood head unit. This Range Rover County shows 198k miles and is now offered with service records, a Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Work since then involved installing LED headlights, repairing the sunroof, and replacing the ABS hydraulic control assembly as well as various interior and air conditioning components. Finished in Westminster Gray Metallic, the truck is powered by a 3.9-liter V8 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. It rides on 16″ tri-spoke alloy wheels and is further equipped with fog lights, a receiver hitch, Winchester Gray Connolly leather seat upholstery, and a Kenwood head unit. This Range Rover County shows 198k miles and is now offered with service records, a Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The truck is finished in Westminster Gray Metallic, and a replacement driver’s door exterior shell and front grille were installed under previous ownership. The roof and hood have been repainted, and LED headlights were retrofitted under current ownership. Additional details include a sunroof, mud flaps, and a receiver hitch. A March 2001 entry on the Carfax report notes that an accident with another motor vehicle was reported. Body-color 16″ tri-spoke alloy wheels with polished lips are wrapped in 225/75 BFGoodrich Trail-Terrain T/A tires. Front and rear stabilizer bars are fitted in addition to an Old Man Emu steering damper. The hydraulic control assembly for the four-wheel disc brakes was replaced in November 2024. The front seats are upholstered in Winchester Gray Connolly leather, which extends to the armrests. Appointments include a Kenwood head unit, a 120-watt sound system, and an analog clock. The headliner, driver’s seat bottom, and window motors were replaced under previous ownership, and the driver’s seat control, central locking, and heated seats do not work. Various trim pieces along with the air conditioning compressor, condenser, and receiver drier were replaced under current ownership, however, the seller notes that the air conditioning system and heater are inoperative. The two-spoke steering wheel frames a 130-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The fuel level gauge was repaired in December 2023, and the seller notes that various dash lights do not work. The six-digit odometer shows 198k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The 3.9-liter V8 was factory rated at 180 horsepower and 227 lb-ft of torque. The alternator, battery, ignition wires, and fuel level sending unit were replaced under previous ownership. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a two-speed transfer case with viscous coupling. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage report.
