  "description": "This 1987 Lamborghini Countach is one of approximately 610 of the 5000 Quattrovalvole variant produced between 1985 and 1988. The car wears a European-specification front bumper and taillights along with later \"1988.5\" side skirts and is finished in white over Bianco leather upholstery. It rides on white 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and is powered by a fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 linked with a gated five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work in 2023 and 2024 totaling over $114k involved performing paint correction, updating the air conditioning system, overhauling the four-wheel disc brakes, rebuilding the rear suspension, and replacing the flywheel and clutch assembly as well as adding an aftermarket exhaust system and test pipes. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this Countach 5000 QV is now offered in Illinois with recent service records and a clean Utah title.",

The car wears a European-specification front bumper and taillights along with later “1988.5” side skirts and is finished in white over Bianco leather upholstery. It rides on white 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and is powered by a fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 linked with a gated five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work in 2023 and 2024 totaling over $114k involved performing paint correction, updating the air conditioning system, overhauling the four-wheel disc brakes, rebuilding the rear suspension, and replacing the flywheel and clutch assembly as well as adding an aftermarket exhaust system and test pipes. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this Countach 5000 QV is now offered in Illinois with recent service records and a clean Utah title. Introduced as a prototype in 1971, the Countach was designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone with angular wedge-shaped styling and scissor doors. The car features a tubular steel space frame under aluminum bodywork as well as pop-up headlights, NACA ducts aft of the doors, and air intakes above the rear quarters. The 5000 QV model debuted in 1985 and utilized Kevlar front and rear deck lids. This example is finished in white and features a European-specification front bumper and taillights along with later “1988.5” side skirts. Updates in 2023 included adding fabricated front bumper grilles, installing Carello fog lights, replacing the taillights, fixing the turn signals, and repairing the V-shaped rear wing as well as repainting one of the fenders and performing paint correction. White-finished 15″ Ruote OZ wheels are mounted with 225/50 front and 345/35 rear Pirelli Cinturato P7 tires. Work in 2023 included replacing the brake master cylinder and hoses along with refinishing the wheels, while service in 2024 involved adding an electric brake-vacuum pump, overhauling the brakes, and rebuilding the rear suspension. The cockpit features fixed-back bucket seats upholstered in Bianco leather, which extends to the center console, lower dashboard, and door panels. Further details include a perforated headliner, manual-crank windows, and Lamborghini-branded pedal covers. A Bluetooth-capable Alpine stereo and amplifier was installed in 2023 along with Pyle speakers. Additional work at that time involved repairing the driver-side seatbelt as well as updating the air conditioning system to utilize R134a refrigerant. The leather-wrapped Raid steering wheel is paired with a dogleg-pattern gated shifter with a Personal knob. Jaeger instrumentation consists of a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline along with auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 22k kilometers (~14k kilometers). The Giotto Bizzarrini–designed 5.2L V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. It was factory rated at 414 horsepower. Service in 2023 involved the following: Repairing the water pump Rebuilding the alternator and starter Cleaning the oil cooler Replacing the spark plugs and wires Replacing two engine mounts Replacing the intake manifold and exhaust gaskets Replacing the driver-side fuel tank, pump, and filters Installing two silicon coolant hoses Setting the fuel mixture and idle An oil change was performed in preparation of the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the former of which is mounted in the middle of the car, ahead of the engine. Work in 2023 involved replacing the flywheel and clutch assembly in addition to repairing a transmission fluid leak and changing the transmission and differential fluids. An aftermarket exhaust system and test pipes were also installed at that time. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The current Utah title carries a “New Title” notation.
