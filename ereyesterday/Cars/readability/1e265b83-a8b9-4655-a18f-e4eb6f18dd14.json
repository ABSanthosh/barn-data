  "text": "Technical details about the new Kia EV4 will be announced later this month February 16, 2025 at 19:29 by Brad Anderson The new models join other existing Kia EV’s like the EV3, EV5, EV6, and EV9 SUV. Kia has yet to release any photos of the EV4’s cabin, but it should be similar to other Kia EVs. The company says the sedan and hatch versions will cater to different lifestyles of customers. Kia will lift the veil on its long-awaited all-electric EV4 on February 27 at the Kia EV Day event in Spain, but it’s actually revealed the car’s completed design a little early. Presented in sedan and hatchback guises, the Kia EV4 joins the company’s growing range of EVs and, like its siblings, has an unconventional and striking design that looks virtually identical to the original concept. Both the sedan and hatchback models have the same front fascia. This includes headlights and LED daytime running lights that run vertically up the nose, and a lower grille area that’s been blacked out. Read: Kia EV2, EV4, And PV5 Teased Ahead Of Feb 27 Debut The side profile of the sedan is perhaps the most interesting. Kia’s designers have seemingly taken inspiration from some of the most iconic supercars of all time, adopting a ‘long tail’ design that includes a slowing rear window and a large rear overhang. Combined with a glass roof and thick black C-pillars, the EV4 sedan looks unlike any other car in the Kia family. There’s plenty differentiating the sedan and hatchback versions of the EV4, too. For example, the sedan has vertical taillights not dissimilar to the headlights, whereas the EV4 hatchback has a slightly more appealing set of LED taillights and a light bar. The hatchback also ditches the long-tail design of the EV4 sedan for something a little more conventional and, in our eyes, something more attractive. It has a different pillar design and a smaller, more vertical rear window, as well as a rooftop spoiler. Both the sedan and hatch will also be available in GT-Line guise. This version includes distinctive 19-inch wheels and more dramatic front and rear bumpers. Kia has yet to release any images of the EV4’s interior, but it should feature a similar setup to other Kia EVs with a single widescreen panel housing the infotainment display and digital gauge cluster. “The Kia EV4 is a clear reflection of our commitment to rethink mobility, and expand the boundaries of what design can achieve,” the executive vice president and head of Kia Global Design, Karim Habib said. “By offering both saloon and hatchback variants, we are bringing to our customers, the unique experience of modernity and practicality that defines the Kia EV family, in a way that suits their varied lifestyles and needs.”",
