  "description": "BMW has discontinued two of its long-standing and only budget offerings– the G 310 GS and G 310 R. They were built in collaboration with TVS and first launched back in 2018. Both the G 310 duos were launched back in 2018 It was conceived as part of a joint venture between BMW and TVS BMW G 310 R and G 310 GS discontinued They were developed as part of a joint venture between BMW and TVS BMW Motorrad has discontinued the G 310 R and G 310 GS models due to the new OBD-2B regulations that came into effect on April 1, 2025, and because the bikes were at the end of their product life cycle. These models struggled to stay competitive against more powerful and feature-rich alternatives. The G 310 R and G 310 GS were part of a joint venture between TVS and BMW and served as entry-level bikes. Production of both stopped in January 2025. With generous year-end discounts, it’s unlikely there’s any unsold stock. While the G 310 R has been removed from BMW's website, the G 310 GS is still listed, indicating some remaining availability.  Moving forward, BMW will be actively offering only the G 310 RR, which is based on the TVS Apache RR 310 with BMW branding and livery. It continues to be powered by the same 312cc, liquid-cooled, single cylinder producing 34hp and 27Nm. This motor was part of the joint venture and post this discontinuation, this engine continues to live on in the TVS Apache RR 310, RTR 310 and the previously mentioned BMW G 310 RR. In the foreseeable future, BMW plans on launching the F 450 GS Enduro which was earlier unveiled at Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. Also see: Most powerful bikes under Rs 10 lakh",
