  "text": "POSTED 01/20/2025 We knew our first whiskey review wouldn’t resonate with everyone, but damn, the comments section would drive anyone to drink. I suppose that ship’s already sailed. If this is the first non-mechanized review you’ve read on Bike EXIF, let me get you up to speed. Whiskey Wednesday is a phenomenon that started after hours here at the Bike EXIF headquarters as a gathering of like-minded individuals. Bikes, cars and every form of mechanical banter make for engaging conversation, aided by moderately priced spirits and degrading sarcasm. We’re not pros with cellars full of exotics, but instead, regular guys who appreciate a neat glass and friendly trash talk. Today’s whiskey comes from a friend of a friend who donated a fresh bottle for the coveted WW review. A relatively new release from Brooklyn, New York’s Widow Jane Distillery, Baby Jane promises to be a creamy-smooth blended bourbon whiskey made from Widow Jane’s own proprietary corn. Sounds trendy, but is there any substance? Nose: The Corn Chronicles The aroma is unapologetically corn-forward, and the scent suggests a stronger ABV than you’re getting. Vanilla and caramel make brief cameos, but the profile remains one-dimensional. If you’re looking for complexity, keep sniffing—it’s not here. Palate: An Identity Crisis The first sip offers a wave of corn followed by caramel-sugary sweetness. The oak influence is faint. Somewhere mid-palate, the taste dives into vagueness with too many influences vying for their part. The finish was likely the most engaging part of the whole program, with allspice and a hint of anise leading you to the door. You catch split-second tastes of the fruit and pastry that Widow Jane cites, but it passes too quickly to be of note. The Verdict: Niche Over Substance Baby Jane feels like a triumph of marketing over mastery, but it’s important to remember that it sells for less than $50. It’s certainly drinkable and fueled our get-together until the bottle’s last drop, but more burn and complexity would make it a more memorable spirit. While that’s a fine line to walk, it just seems a bit undercooked. That said, I still wouldn’t turn down another glass. Cheers! Rating: 2.5/4 SHARE THIS ARTICLE READ NEXT",
