  "description": "The Aston Martin DBX SUV has received a new range-topping S variant that takes peak power output to 727hp, making it the most powerful non-electrified SUV, more than even the 725hp Ferrari Purosangue. This is also the first time Aston martin has applied the S badge on an SUV which typically has been used on its range of high-performance supercars. DBX S is powered by 727hp, 4.0-litre twin turbo V8 Gets new weight saving measures over the DBX 707 9-speed automatic gearbox has been tuned for more aggressive shifts Aston Martin DBX S engine and specs 0-200kph sprint time shaved by 0.3 seconds The new DBX S produces 20hp more than the aptly named DBX 707 with 707hp. It retains the same 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, but it has been reworked with larger compressor wheel diameters taken from the Valhalla. It has also been tuned for more “urgency” at the top end of the rev counter. The result is that 0-200kph now comes up in 0.3 seconds lesser, although the 0-100kph sprint time of 3.3 seconds has remain unchanged from DBX 707. The torque output of 900Nm has also remained unchanged. There’s also a new exhaust system that makes the V8 louder, the steering ratio is now 4 percent quicker and the turning circle has been trimmed by nearly half a metre. The variable all-wheel drive system and 9-speed wet-clutch automatic gearbox has been carried over from the DBX 707, although Aston Martin says the change-up points for the gearbox have been reworked to account for the wider rev range, and the downshifts in Sport and Sport+ modes are more aggressive. Aston Martin DBX S weight saving measures 47kg lighter than the DBX 707 The new DBX S doesn’t just come with a boost in power output, but it also sheds a significant 47kg of the DBX 707’s weight. This has been achieved with an optional carbon fibre roof that forgoes roof rails, and alone accounts for 18kg of the weight saved, apart from also helping lower the centre of gravity. There are also optional 23-inch magnesium wheels, which are 19kg lighter than the standard aluminium versions, and an optional polycarbonate honeycomb grille. The end result is a total kerb weight of 2198kg, which still isn’t particularly light weight by any measure. Aston Martin DBX S design and interior  Looks meaner, gets bespoke interior There are also a number of styling changes which include a new black grille design inspired by the DBS 770 Ultimate, a new front splitter, a reworked diffuser at the rear, and new side sills that help channel airflow around the side of the car. At the back, the twin exhausts tips on each side are now vertically stacked as opposed to the horizontal arrangement on the 707. Inside, there is a bespoke S design with a herringbone pattern on the seats and this is extended to the headlining if the carbon fibre roof is selected. Alcantara upholstery is standard, while semi-aniline leather and red seatbelts are optional. An optional 23-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins set-up is also offered. Aston Martin DBX S rivals The Aston Martin DBX S rivals the likes of the Ferrari Purosangue, Lamborghini Urus and the Porsche Cayenne Turbo. As already mentioned, it is more powerful than the naturally aspirated 6.5-litre, V12-powered Ferrari, but still leaves it short of rivals that use electrified powertrains, such as the 739hp Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid or the 800hp Urus SE.
