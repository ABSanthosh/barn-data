Now with 17k miles, it is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and is finished in Nero over Beige Tradizione leather upholstery. The car is equipped with 19″ split-spoke wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, carbon-fiber trim, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, parking sensors, power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, a Kenwood DVD head unit, and automatic climate control. This F430 is now offered with the owner’s manual, a service record, a car cover, two keys, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title in the seller’s name. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Nero DS (1250) and features xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking sensors, a carbon-fiber rear grille, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser. Blemishes around the exterior include a scratch on the right door and scrapes on the front lip and rear diffuser. The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S tires showing date codes from 2022. Braking is handled by yellow-finished brake calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors. The cockpit features power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats upholstered in Beige Tradizione leather along with a matching center console, doors, and carpeting. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests, automatic climate control, drilled aluminum pedals, power windows and locks, and an aftermarket Kenwood DVD head unit with flip-out screen. The removed CD stereo is included in the sale, and wear is noted on the driver-seat outer bolster. The three-spoke leather- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 17k miles, approximately 1k of which were added during current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential.
