  "description": "Entry-level Avenger is £1801 less than the rival Mini Aceman Stellantis brand's lone electric model gets big discounts to close the gap to the petrol version Jeep has slashed prices for the Avenger Electric, meaning the small SUV now undercuts rivals such as the Mini Aceman, Smart #1 and Volvo EX30 by a significant margin. The entry-level Longitude model now starts at £29,999, which is £5000 cheaper than previously. That’s £1801 less than the Aceman, £1951 less than the #1 and £2850 less than the EX30. It also puts it on a par with the new Ford Puma Gen-E, which starts at £29,995. The Avenger's middle-rung Altitude trim is now £31,999 (£4700 less than before), while the Summit range-topper is £33,999 (down by £4900). Asked by Autocar why the discounts had been introduced, Jeep parent company Stellantis said: \"This pricing adjustment makes the transition to an electric Jeep Avenger more accessible for customers, offering them an electric alternative without a significant price gap compared to an ICE Avenger model.\" The petrol Avenger is priced from £24,949. It’s possible that the move has also been made in order to stimulate greater demand for the Avenger Electric, as government-mandated EV sales targets ramp up in 2025. The UK's zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate dictates that 22% of any given car manufacturer’s new car sales must be electric, and the proportion will rise to 28% next year. Companies that miss their targets face fines of £15,000 for every combustion-engined car they sell over the allowed threshold. Autocar understands that Jeep’s current EV sales figures put it on track to meet the stricter 28% ratio next year, but only by a fine margin. Discounting the Avenger Electric – currently its only EV – will surely help the brand (and by extension Stellantis) meet that target more comfortably.",
