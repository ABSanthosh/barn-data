  "description": "Going from the small, zippy and city-friendly Maruti Suzuki Swift to the big, heavy and highway-friendly Jeep Meridian is quite the shift, but a dhaba dinner plan with a group of friends meant the Meridian was just what the doctor ordered. Or so I thought. As soon as I drove into the meeting point, I realised a problem. There were seven of us, and while the Meridian looks huge on the outside, once you start packing in people, it’s quite the squeeze. The second row flip-folded down with ease, but immediately after seeing the third row, the happy smiles on my friends’ faces turned upside down. We narrowed down the most slender and athletic of the group and pleaded and apologised profusely as they crammed themselves in the back. There was more apologising once they asked me to move the middle row ahead since the Meridian does not have that option. Yes, the second row is fixed. The 9-speaker Alpine system with surround sound is excellent. Three abreast in the middle row were relatively happier, though, and with all AC vents adjusted, we were ready to roll. To uplift the glum mood, I opened up the panoramic sunroof, where the middle row thanked their stars, and the last row prayed we would reach our destination fast. Powering the Meridian is the same 2.0-litre diesel engine from the Compass, mated to a 9-speed automatic gearbox. I hoped the Meridian, being a diesel, was easy on the wallet for the 200km round trip. What was immediately apparent was how adept it felt with a full load. A friend who drives a Fortuner daily could not believe how well the suspension fared. Sure, a Fortuner is no benchmark for ride, but the monocoque chassis of the Meridian really shines on flat roads. Also impressive is the steering that is light and breezy for such a large SUV. In the city, you feel almost no stress on the arms. Auto braking needs to be switched off each time you start the car. As we got out on open roads, the engine, which was growling every time I put my foot down, settled into a constant drone. It is disappointingly loud. The only way to mute the mill is by upping the Alpine audio system, which, by the way, is excellent. The bass and surround sound ensure a good listening experience, and calls are crisp and clear. The Meridian also gets ADAS, which, at least on the well-marked highway we were on, worked well. Thankfully, for the erratic city traffic, you can turn it off. Unfortunately, it cannot be set to default, which means each time you turn the car off and back on, you need to disable the system first, or it may surprise you by braking abruptly every time someone cuts you off. The 360-degree camera is lag-free and has great clarity even at night. Once we reached the dhaba, the third-row passengers scuffled out of the back and cracked their bones for some relief. “This is not a 7-seater” was the most repeated line I heard that night. On my way back, the late-night drive was calming, with the Meridian absolutely steamrolling every bump and bad section on the road, the AC working tremendously well, and the Alpine system helping passengers nod off to some soothing music. I realised the Meridian is a very good highway car, but as a 7-seater, it’s a hard sell. With kids, it would be better, but the best use case would be to fold down the rear seats and pack a whole lot of luggage in there. Because as a highway cruiser, it gets the basics right – a tried and tested diesel engine (though it’s loud), a very good audio system, exceptional ride over bad roads and plenty of features to make the drive easier and safer. Will I regret it once I get back to the city that has construction on already narrow roads? Or will I be unfazed and use the low-range gearbox while coming out of Bandra? I’d soon know. Tough door beading means that you need to shut doors with force.
