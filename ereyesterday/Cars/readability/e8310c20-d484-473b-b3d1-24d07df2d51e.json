Additional equipment includes the Stealth Pack, carbon-fiber Visible Body Structure, carbon-fiber Primary and Secondary Interior Components, a vehicle-lift system, carbon-ceramic brakes, dual-zone automatic climate control, 360-degree Park Assist, navigation, and a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system. This 720S has 9k miles and is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with build and service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The 720S utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded-aluminum subframe. Finished in Silica White, the car was optioned with the carbon-fiber Visible Body structure package. A 765LT front-end conversion and the following carbon-fiber components are installed: Front splitter Hood Louvered fenders Mirror caps Roof panels Door latches Door handles Side skirts Roof scoop Aero bridges Rear deck 765LT-style airbrake Exhaust shroud Kline Innovation carbon-trimmed exhaust outlets Rear bumper w/ side fins Rear diffuser Xpel Stealth (matte) paint protection film was applied to the painted surfaces while Xpel Ultimate (gloss) was applied to the windshield and carbon-fiber exterior components before the car received a ceramic coating. Gunmetal-finished LeMans-style forged wheels measure 19″ at the front and 20″ at the rear and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The suspension features a factory vehicle-lift system and is lowered on adjustable coilovers with 765LT accumulators and revised suspension software. Stopping power is provided by orange-painted multi-piston calipers over a carbon-ceramic rotor at each corner. The touring-size carbon-fiber Senna seats feature orange-finished borders, custom pads, and McLaren logos embroidered on the headrests. The carbon-fiber Primary Interior Components package was standard on 720S Performance models, and this car was optioned with the carbon-fiber Secondary Interior Components package. Carbon-fiber A-pillar trim and full-length door sills are fitted, and additional appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, a 750S rearview mirror, updated soft-close door latches, navigation, and a touchscreen infotainment system linked to a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system. The leather-wrapped steering wheel features carbon-fiber trim and paddle shifters. Instrumentation consists of a folding LCD screen that displays a speedometer, tachometer, trip functions, and vehicle information. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The suite of electronic driver aids includes 360-degree Park Assist. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, silicone turbo inlets, catless downpipes, a titanium x-pipe exhaust, and a Mega 3 Performance Stage 2 ECU calibration. Service performed in June 2024 consisted of changing the oil and replacing the fuel filter, charcoal canister, and air filters. The factory catalytic converters have been removed. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The front plastic undertray has a crack near the mounting point of the left front control arm.
