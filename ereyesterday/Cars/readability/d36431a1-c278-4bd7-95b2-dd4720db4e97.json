The car was imported to the US in 2023 before being purchased by the selling dealer on BaT in October of that year. Finished in Halcyon Midas Pearl over black leather upholstery, the car features a five-speed manual transmission, AP Racing brakes, 18″ alloy wheels, power windows, air conditioning, and a Pioneer stereo. It is said to have received replacement chassis outriggers as well as a clutch and cylinders under prior ownership along with a reupholstering of the dashboard and headliner leather. This Cerbera shows 58k miles and is now offered with a binder of service records and a clean Florida title. The Cerbera was introduced at the 1993 London Motor Show and was TVR’s first 2+2 as well as their first car powered by an in-house engine design. The fiberglass bodywork on this example is finished in Halcyon Midas Pearl and features fog lights, side marker lights, power mirrors, a heated rear window, and dual exhaust outlets with polished tips. The windshield seals were reportedly replaced in September 2023, and tinted taillights have been added. Rock chips are visible in gallery photos. Gray-finished 18″ alloy wheels feature TVR center caps and wear Goodyear Eagle F1 front and Bridgestone Potenza rear tires. The car is equipped with independent suspension, and braking is handled by yellow-finished AP Racing calipers with cross-drilled rotors up front and vented discs at the rear. The Cerbera was not offered with an anti-lock braking system or traction control. The right-hand-drive cabin features front and rear bucket seats finished in black leather with perforated inserts and yellow contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. The front bucket seats feature manually adjustable bolsters, and additional interior amenities include power windows, air conditioning, and a Pioneer stereo. The dashboard and headliner leather were reupholstered in September 2023, and the dashboard vent grommets were also replaced at that time. The two-spoke multifunction steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and a combination gauge for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and fuel-level gauge flank an air vent below the steering wheel hub. The six-digit odometer shows 58k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.2-liter AJP8 “Speed Eight” V8 was developed and built in-house by TVR and features all-alloy construction, a 75° bank angle, and a flat-plane crankshaft. Factory-rated output was 360 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Completed services under prior ownership are said to include an air and fuel filter replacement in July 2021 and fuel and coolant hose replacements in September 2021. A throttle body balancing service was reportedly completed in August 2023. Spark plug wire replacement was performed in September 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a BorgWarner five-speed manual transmission. The chassis outriggers were reportedly replaced on both sides under previous ownership in September 2021, and the clutch and cylinders are said to have been replaced in March 2022. The car has been fitted with an ACT Performance exhaust system. An oil leak is noted. The Carfax report shows no accidents. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
