It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and is equipped with an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, ceramic-composite brakes, a Burmester high-end sound system, 19″ and 20″ AMG Black Series forged wheels, and heated power-adjustable AMG Performance seats. The car spent time in British Columbia until it was brought to the US in 2024, and it now has 402 miles. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this AMG GT Black Series is now offered with the owner’s manual, a car cover, a clean US Carfax report, and a clean Washington state title. The Black Series features a revised front fascia with enlarged intercooler openings when compared to the standard AMG GT as well as an adjustable carbon-fiber front splitter, a two-stage rear wing with an electronically controlled center flap, and a carbon-fiber hood, roof, rear liftgate, front canards, side-skirt extensions, and front fenders. This example is finished in AMG Magmabeam Orange and is equipped with power-folding side mirrors, front and rear cameras, a rear diffuser, Parktronic, LED lighting, and quad exhaust outlets. The 19″ and 20″ black AMG Black Series forged 10-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires measuring 285/35 up front and 335/30 out back. The car features adaptive coilover suspension with driver-selectable modes, and Black Series equipment includes a carbon-fiber front anti-roll bar and chassis bracing. Stopping power is provided by ceramic-composite rotors with black-finished calipers and model-specific pads. A brake fluid flush was performed in August 2023. The cabin features heated power-adjustable AMG Performance seats trimmed in black Exclusive Nappa leather and Dinamica with orange stripes and stitching. Amenities include a Burmester high-end sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The AMG Performance steering wheel features an adjustable drive mode dial and frames a central configurable digital display. The digital odometer indicates 402 miles. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 features direct injection and dry-sump lubrication for a factory rating of 720 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. A plaque in the engine bay displays the signature of the engine builder, and the oil was changed in August 2023. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The car came equipped from the factory with a performance exhaust system. A car cover and the owner’s manual are included in the sale. The US Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and notes at least one recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
