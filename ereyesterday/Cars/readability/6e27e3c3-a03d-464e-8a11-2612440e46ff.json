  "description": "A heavily camouflaged test mule of the updated Suzuki Burgman has been spotted testing for the first time. The Burgman will likely feature a redesign and powertrain upgrade, similar to the new Access. Here’s what we can deduce. Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon Sports a different exhaust, suggesting some engine changes Currently priced between Rs 95,800 and Rs 1.16 lakh Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon; spotted testing The Burgman has largely remained unchanged since its launch in 2018 With this update, it is likely that Burgman’s design will see evolutionary updates, similar to the changes we saw on the 2025 Access compared to the previous model. The brake light on this Burgman test mule appears to be similar to the Avenis, but the spy shots reveal that the display has been carried over from the outgoing model. This update is likely to revise the design of the Burgman with some feature additions, just like Suzuki did with the latest Access.  It is likely that the updated Burgman will feature powertrain and chassis upgrades similar to those of the Access. One clue that the engine will see some revisions is in the different exhaust muffler on the test mule, which is quite similar to the latest Access.  The Suzuki Burgman was launched back in 2018; since then, this maxi-scooter has largely remained unchanged. It recently received an update to comply with the OBD2B norms and a new colour, but its overall design has remained unchanged. It is available in two variants: Street (Rs 95,800) and Street EX (Rs 1.16 lakh), where the latter gets a 12-inch wheel. It’s worth mentioning that before the 2025 Access was launched, spy shots of its test mule had been seen for quite a few months. Since this is the first time a spy shot of the updated Burgman has surfaced, its launch is likely some time away. When this updated Suzuki Burgman does launch, expect a small price bump in price over the current model. All prices ex-showroom, Delhi.
