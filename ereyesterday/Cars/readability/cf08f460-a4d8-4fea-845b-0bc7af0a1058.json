  "description": "This 1964 Porsche 356C is one of approximately 101 Carrera 2 \"GS\" coupes built on the final \"C\" iteration of the 356 platform between 1963 and 1965, and it left the factory on November 28, 1963, for delivery to its first owner in Lichtenberg, Germany, via Krauss of Nuremberg. The car was purchased in Italy in 2014 by its current owner, who imported it to the US and commissioned work including a mechanical refresh and a repaint in the original shade of Light Ivory. Power is provided by a replacement 1,966cc Type 587/1 four-cam flat-four that features a plain-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, and GT-style dual-throat Weber carburetors. Additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel disc brakes, Koni shock absorbers, a camber compensator, silver-painted 15” wheels, Marchal driving lights, green leatherette interior upholstery, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This Carrera 2 GS is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in Annville, Pennsylvania, with a copy of its Kardex, invoices from current ownership, and a clean Montana title in the name of the current owner's LLC.",

  "text": "This 1964 Porsche 356C is one of approximately 101 Carrera 2 “GS” coupes built on the final “C” iteration of the 356 platform between 1963 and 1965, and it left the factory on November 28, 1963, for delivery to its first owner in Lichtenberg, Germany, via Krauss of Nuremberg. The car was purchased in Italy in 2014 by its current owner, who imported it to the US and commissioned work including a mechanical refresh and a repaint in the original shade of Light Ivory. Power is provided by a replacement 1,966cc Type 587/1 four-cam flat-four that features a plain-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, and GT-style dual-throat Weber carburetors. Additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel disc brakes, Koni shock absorbers, a camber compensator, silver-painted 15” wheels, Marchal driving lights, green leatherette interior upholstery, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This Carrera 2 GS is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in Annville, Pennsylvania, with a copy of its Kardex, invoices from current ownership, and a clean Montana title in the name of the current owner’s LLC. The Carrera variant was introduced in 1955 with power from a derivation of the four-cam engine designed by Dr. Ernst Furhmann for use in Porsche’s competition efforts. In 1957, the Carrera offerings were divided into the racing-oriented GT and GS, or de Luxe, models, with the latter more luxuriously equipped for comfortable road use. The Carrera 2 was launched in late 1961 on the T6 platform and brought about a further displacement increase to two liters, while the introduction of the 356C in 1963 integrated ATE disc brakes and a revised suspension design. This example received a repaint by Rob Ida Concepts in Morganville, New Jersey, in its factory shade of Light Ivory (6404) in 2021. Replacement seals were fitted during the project, and body work involved repairing dents on the front trunk lid and right quarter panel as well as filling the front license plate holes. Features include body-color bumpers without guards, Marchal front driving lights, uncovered horn-grille openings, amber front side markers, a driver’s side mirror, twin decklid grilles, and a rear apron through which dual exhaust outlets pass. Silver-painted wheels are wrapped in 165HR15 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires, as is a matching spare secured in the front compartment. The 356C Carrera model shared the C platform’s conventional ATE disc brakes in lieu of the annular disc brakes utilized on the previous Carrera variant. A brake system freshening in 2015 included replacement of the hoses, repairs to the handbrake handle locking mechanism, adjustment of the master cylinder pushrod, and a fluid flush. Suspension incorporates Koni shock absorbers and a rear transverse camber compensator. The front suspension system was also rebuilt in 2015, and the steering box was adjusted. The cabin is trimmed in green leatherette over the front bucket seats, fold-down rear seats, door panels, and dashboard, while tan corduroy inserts have been added to the front seat surfaces. Additional features include gray square-weave carpeting, front lap belts, a lockable glovebox, a passenger-side grab handle, and a radio blanking plate. The VDM wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color dash that hosts green-letter VDO instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 250-km/h speedometer, a clock, and a combination gauge monitoring oil temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer has rolled over and shows 53k kilometers (~33k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The Type 587/1 flat-four carried over the quad overhead camshafts, plain-bearing crankshaft, and dry-sump lubrication of the previous version of Fuhrmanm’s powerplant, but featured a longer stroke for a displacement increase to 1,966cc. This example’s replacement engine is stamped with the number 97052, which corresponds with a Type 587/1, although the case carries a type number 587/2 casting associated with a GT engine. The engine was modified under previous ownership with GT-style Weber 46 IDM/2 carburetors, which were rebuilt with replacement brass floats and a switch from 42 to 40mm venturis during work performed by Jeff Adams at Speedsport Tuning in Danbury, Connecticut, in 2015. Additional work at that time included a valve adjustment, rebuilds of the distributors, the addition of MSD Street Fire CD units, the fabrication of replacement spark plug wires, repair of an oil leak around the distributor drive, and replacement of the spark plugs, oil hoses and lines, fuel pump, fuel lines, and generator wiring harness. Service between October and November 2024 included replacement of the valve cover gaskets and various other seals, cleaning and adjustment of the carburetors, and replacement of the MSD ignition unit, battery, and battery mounting equipment. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a dual-mount Type 741 four-speed manual transaxle, which was refreshed in 2015 with an updated selector shaft. Additional work at that time included the replacement of the main shaft seal, cross shaft bushings, clutch release fork bushings, and various gaskets. The Kardex lists the original color combination of Light Ivory over green leatherette with corduroy as well as delivery in Germany. Also noted is a 100,000-kilometer award assigned in 1967.
