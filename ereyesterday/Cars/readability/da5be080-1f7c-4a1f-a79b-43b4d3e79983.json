  "text": "The Italian marque's first and only SUV is part of a special, exclusive club thanks to its V12, but it's also extremely expensive 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Ferrari’s Purosangue is listed for over $300,000 more than its already steep MSRP. By comparison, it’s possible to find a low-mileage Lamborghini Urus for around $200,000. These Purosangues have asking prices exceeding even used Ferrari SF90 Stradales. Ferrari’s answer to the SUV craze is the Purosangue, a vehicle that seemingly exists just to give purists migraines and hedge fund managers something to fight over. But it’s also an SUV unlike any on the market. While there are plenty of others out there from high-end brands, including Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Porsche, the Purosangue is the only one sold with a 6.5-liter naturally-aspirated V12. That mechanical flex alone might explain why the first few examples to hit the used car market in the United States are listed for prices well in excess the SUV’s already eyebrow-raising MSRP that starts from around $400,000. Now, just months into its production, we thought it would be a good idea to check out the classifieds. And sure enough, we found five 2024 Purosangues available for immediate delivery in the US. Of these, four of these are listed by Limited Spec Automotive in Miami, Florida, while the fifth is being sold by Lamborghini Broward in Davie, Florida. More: Ferrari Dealer Sues Customer For Flipping His Purosangue SUV Three of the four Purosangues in Limited Spec’s inventory each have an eye-watering asking price of $699,980. That’s roughly $300,000 more than the super SUV’s original starting price, although it’s safe to say that very few, if any, customers actually paid the base $400k MSRP without adding at least a few of the many available options. One of the trio is painted black and has 200 miles (320 km) on the clock, another is finished in gray and has been driven 210 miles (338 km), while a red example is also up for grabs with 23 miles (37 km) under its belt. Images: Limited Spec Automotive Interestingly, the black and gray examples have been available from the dealer since late August but have yet to sell. The red one has been for sale since early October. A fourth Purosangue landed in Limited Spec’s lot this month. It’s painted in a beautiful shade of blue and has been driven 109 miles (175 km). It’s the most affordable one available, with a $679,980 price tag. Lamborghini Broward hasn’t publicized the asking price of its Purosangue, but it’s painted in Rosso Dino and has 359 miles (578 km) on the odometer. The dealer is undoubtedly hoping to sell it for a hefty premium over the original MSRP. More: See The Ferrari Purosangue In Stunning New Photos Look, we get it – the Purosangue is undeniably cool. But paying nearly $700,000 for an SUV borders on the absurd. That price is particularly insane when you consider a new 2025 Lamborghini Urus starts at a touch over $240,000. There are also several Ferrari SF90 Stradales available for less than $600,000, and while it’s not as practical as the Purosangue, it is significantly quicker. Nevertheless, the resale market speaks volumes about what this car represents: a shiny, absurd, and over-the-top status symbol. And honestly, isn’t that exactly what Ferrari does best?
