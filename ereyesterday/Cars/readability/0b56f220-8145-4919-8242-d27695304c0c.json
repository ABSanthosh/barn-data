  "description": "We’ve had the Skoda Kodiaq in India before, but never the sporty RS version. That, however, is set to change with the arrival of the second-generation model. The regular Kodiaq will launch here in the April quarter, and the RS version will likely arrive by October, but unlike the regular Kodiaq, the RS will come in as a CBU import, meaning it will be pricey. Skoda Kodiaq RS exterior design and engineering (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq is less SUV-like than before, but you won’t mistake it for an estate. Segmented grille DRL is exclusive to the RS version. The Skoda Kodiaq – named after the Kodiak bear – was first unveiled in 2016, with the second generation coming in late 2023. It’s built on the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform, a derivative of the previous car’s MQB platform. The new car has grown 60mm longer but is about 10mm lower, giving it a more elongated stance. But while it is less SUV-like than before, you won’t mistake it for an estate. The RS version stands out with a blacked-out grille, lower bumper air intakes and a cool-looking segmented DRL that runs between the grille’s slats and extends into the headlight daytime running lamps (DRLs). Like the standard car, the headlamps are split LED Matrix units. Kodiaq RS comes with exclusive 20-inch alloy wheels Alloys are designed with aero efficiency in mind. Exclusive to the RS are two 20-inch alloy wheel designs with red brake calipers, black cladding around the wheels, and black accents on the lower sill, wing mirrors and the B, C and D pillars. At the rear, the tail-lights have a cool split and mirrored look, the lower half extending into a reflector bar across the boot lid, with Skoda’s lettermark replacing the logo. The rear windshield is topped by a deep spoiler and flanked by fins that are finished in black. Skoda says these aid airflow around the car, helping reduce the drag coefficient of the new-gen Kodiaq from 0.31 to 0.28. Skoda Kodiaq RS interior space and comfort (rating 8.5/10) Interior space is plenty and its comfortable too inside the Skoda Kodiaq RS There’s loads of space all around; the rear legroom and headroom are impressive. The inside is an all-black affair, from the headliner to the carpets. You can choose between suede or leather trim on the sports seats, dashboard, door pads and centre armrest, but only in one colour – black. And what really sets it off is the lively contrast from the red stitching all around the cabin. The 3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in perforated leather looks neat, with RS badging at the bottom. It’s nice to hold and has the familiar and easy-to-use scroll wheels. Skoda has put the extra length to good use. There’s ample headroom at the front and rear, and even with the front seats set rearward for taller passengers, second-row occupants will have plenty of legroom. This can be adjusted further, given that the second row slides and reclines. Like the previous car, the new Kodiaq can also be had as a 7-seater, with the third row stowing away neatly in the boot floor. Our car was the 5-seat variant, so we’ll reserve judgement on the third row, but the boot space is enormous. Without the third row, boot space is a massive 910 litres, and even with it in place, there’s 340 litres. There’s also a spare tyre and a space for the cargo cover beneath the floor. Most of my time was spent driving, but having inspected the second row, it seemed comfy enough despite the 40:20:40 split, which sometimes tends to make the individual seats too small. The front sports seats on the RS are really nice, and the bolstering held me nicely in place during some spirited driving in the hills. Skoda Kodiaq RS performance and refinement (rating 7.5/10) The Kodiaq RS is not firecracker quick but it’s just enough to justify an RS badge 2.0 TSI is a happy cruiser and can deliver strong acceleration, but you can feel it working hard. The Kodiaq RS packs the VW Group’s familiar 2.0-litre TSI engine. This unit also powers the regular Kodiaq, but under the hood of the RS, the output is bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm. Incidentally, the power is identical to the Octavia RS, which has the same engine, but the torque is 30Nm more here. The output is enough to propel the Kodiaq RS’ 1.8-tonne mass from 0-100kph in 6.3 seconds, which is plenty quick for what is also a genuine family SUV. Drive it sedately, and the Kodiaq RS is happy to cruise steadily all day with the engine nicely relaxed. And, should you need a quick overtake, mashing the throttle will drop a few gears, giving you momentum quickly enough. The 7-speed DSG gearbox did trip up occasionally while trundling through some low-speed traffic. In Sport mode, the shifts are quick, and the engine is kept nicely on the boil, so overtaking at any point is very quick and easy. Engine is aurally enhanced with artificial soundtrack The engine note does sound nice, but it’s enhanced with what Skoda calls Dynamic Sound Boost, which augments the car’s real exhaust note with an artificial soundtrack. Skoda Kodiaq RS mileage (rating 6/10) The Skoda Kodiaq RS fuel efficiency will not be very high, expect a single digit range only. We didn’t get to test the mileage of the Kodiaq RS in Croatia but given the engine’s output, the car's 1.8-tonne weight, and the fact that you can feel and even hear the engine working hard, don’t expect fuel efficiency to be impressive at all. Skoda Kodiaq RS ride comfort and handling (rating 7.5/10) In comfort mode, there is some float, but in all other areas ride and handling is good in the Kodiaq RS The body does roll in corners, but Sport mode tidies that up nicely. Putting down the RS’ power is an 4x4 driveline with impressive grip. We had some snowy weather, and driving to a mountain ski resort over wet roads, I always felt confident and was able to maintain a good pace. The RS has adaptive dampers, and in Sport mode, they do a good job of keeping body roll in check. What’s nice is that the ride does not get lumpy. In fact, I found myself using the firmer damper setting even on highway stretches, as in Comfort mode, there’s some body float over undulating surfaces and lean in corners. There’s a variable-rack steering, which adjusts the ratio for less steering input around bends. These systems often corrupt the feel, but that’s not the case here, with Kodiaq RS’ steering providing enough weight and precision. Skoda Kodiaq RS features and safety (rating 8.5/10) You can expect the Kodiaq RS to be well-equipped The all-black interior looks sporty, and vibrant red stitching is plenty but not overdone. The touchscreen is a new 13-inch unit that’s slick to use. Equipment-wise, there are all the expected bits, including 3-zone climate control, a 10-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel and a free-standing 10-inch infotainment screen or an optional 13-inch unit like we had on our test car. India-spec model should come with sunroof What was not on our test car was a sunroof, but given the popularity here, expect the India model to get one. Being a Skoda, the Kodiaq packs in a lot of ‘Simply Clever’ bits, like specific storage spots for the key fob and phones and even a handy little duster to wipe the touchscreen clean. You can expect the India-spec car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. Skoda Kodiaq RS price and verdict (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq RS isn’t a wild child, it’s a family SUV with a nice sporty side to it. If everything goes according to plan, Skoda says we can expect the Kodiaq RS in India by October, and, importantly, local manufacturing is a possibility later on. So, while its everyday sibling could be competitively priced, the RS will most definitely not be, as it will come in as a CBU for now. Expect an asking price of around Rs 60 lakh, which is wading into traditional luxury-brand territory, and for some, that would seem like a lot of money for a Skoda. But the Kodiaq RS does a lot to entice you to look past all that. There’s a massive amount of space all around and the option of three rows of seats. It’s comfortable and rides well, and you can expect the India car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. So, it’s got ‘family SUV’ off pat. But what about the sporty side that the RS badge promises? It’s not light and nimble for sure, but it’s plenty quick in a straight line, and the 4x4 drivetrain gives you ample grip in corners. Plus, the engine sounds fun. So, for that money, then, there really is nothing quite like it.

In Sport mode, the shifts are quick, and the engine is kept nicely on the boil, so overtaking at any point is very quick and easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eEngine is aurally enhanced with artificial soundtrack\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe engine note does sound nice, but it’s enhanced with what Skoda calls Dynamic Sound Boost, which augments the car’s real exhaust note with an artificial soundtrack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSkoda Kodiaq RS mileage (rating 6/10)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Skoda Kodiaq RS fuel efficiency will not be very high, expect a single digit range only.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t get to test the mileage of the Kodiaq RS in Croatia but given the engine’s output, the car\u0026#39;s 1.8-tonne weight, and the fact that you can feel and even hear the engine working hard, don’t expect fuel efficiency to be impressive at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSkoda Kodiaq RS ride comfort and handling (rating 7.5/10)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIn comfort mode, there is some float, but in all other areas ride and handling is good in the Kodiaq RS\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Skoda_Kodiaq_RS_Driving.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe body does roll in corners, but Sport mode tidies that up nicely.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePutting down the RS’ power is an 4x4 driveline with impressive grip. We had some snowy weather, and driving to a mountain ski resort over wet roads, I always felt confident and was able to maintain a good pace. The RS has adaptive dampers, and in Sport mode, they do a good job of keeping body roll in check.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s nice is that the ride does not get lumpy. In fact, I found myself using the firmer damper setting even on highway stretches, as in Comfort mode, there’s some body float over undulating surfaces and lean in corners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a variable-rack steering, which adjusts the ratio for less steering input around bends. These systems often corrupt the feel, but that’s not the case here, with Kodiaq RS’ steering providing enough weight and precision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSkoda Kodiaq RS features and safety (rating 8.5/10)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eYou can expect the Kodiaq RS to be well-equipped\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Skoda_Kodiaq_RS_Interior.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe all-black interior looks sporty, and vibrant red stitching is plenty but not overdone.

Being a Skoda, the Kodiaq packs in a lot of ‘Simply Clever’ bits, like specific storage spots for the key fob and phones and even a handy little duster to wipe the touchscreen clean. You can expect the India-spec car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSkoda Kodiaq RS price and verdict (rating 7/10)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Kodiaq RS isn’t a wild child, it’s a family SUV with a nice sporty side to it.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf everything goes according to plan, Skoda says we can expect the Kodiaq RS in India by October, and, importantly, local manufacturing is a possibility later on. So, while its everyday sibling could be competitively priced, the RS will most definitely not be, as it will come in as a CBU for now. Expect an asking price of around Rs 60 lakh, which is wading into traditional luxury-brand territory, and for some, that would seem like a lot of money for a Skoda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Kodiaq RS does a lot to entice you to look past all that. There’s a massive amount of space all around and the option of three rows of seats. It’s comfortable and rides well, and you can expect the India car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. So, it’s got ‘family SUV’ off pat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what about the sporty side that the RS badge promises? It’s not light and nimble for sure, but it’s plenty quick in a straight line, and the 4x4 drivetrain gives you ample grip in corners. Plus, the engine sounds fun. So, for that money, then, there really is nothing quite like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-skoda-kodiaq-review-big-7-seat-skoda-suv-for-big-money-435123\"\u003e2025 Skoda Kodiaq review: Big 7 seat Skoda SUV for big money\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-skoda-octavia-rs-review-all-the-car-youll-ever-need-434697\"\u003e2025 Skoda Octavia RS review: all the car you’ll ever want\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-435121\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-435121\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-435121\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-435121\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-435121\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-435121\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
