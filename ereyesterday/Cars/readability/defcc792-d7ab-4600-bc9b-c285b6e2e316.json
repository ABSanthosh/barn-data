  "text": "Mazda withdrew from the American truck market over a decade ago, but that doesn’t mean they stopped making pickups that Americans would love.The Mazda BT-50 arrives for the 2025 model year with a handful of major updates that Americans would love but unfortunately, Mazda bowed out of the American truck competition in 2011. Even then, however, Mazda’s truck wasn’t really a Mazda. The Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series (dubbed 'Mazda Truck' following 2002) rolled off the same Ford assembly line in Minnesota.While the 2025 Mazda BT-50 won’t be coming to the United States, the midsize truck is available in plenty of countries that appreciate its capability. The latest model arrives with updates that range from style to tech.2025 Mazda BT-50 arrives with refreshed stylingThe Mazda BT-50 already sported a design that rivals American pickups, and the latest updates add a touch of versatility and ruggedness. The 2025 model boasts unique LED headlights and a new radiator grille and bumper, complete with an air curtain that increases aerodynamic efficiency. Red Earth Metallic, Geode White Pearl, and Sailing Blue Metallic bring the total available paint colors to seven.The tailgate features an updated ridged design with new LED taillights complemented by a large Mazda logo. The 2025 model year-exclusive alloy wheels further add to the rugged design created by the truck's bodylines. Put it all together and you get a tougher, more powerful stance that’s indicative of the BT-50’s off-road capability.“Forming an integral part of our Mazda model range here in Australia, the BT-50 has set the tone as a versatile, ready-for-anything vehicle that suits a variety of customer needs whether it’s as a trusty work companion or an enabler for life’s passions,” said Vinesh Bhindi, Managing Director of Mazda Australia.An updated interior makes the Mazda BT-50 more user-friendlyInside, the Mazda BT-50 includes a completely new infotainment system with integrated touch switches located below the nine-inch touchscreen display. A seven-inch multi-information display includes new content and enhanced connectivity. The display is also customizable and pairs well with the center touchscreen.2025 Mazda BT-50 InteriorMazdaThe center display is designed to provide crucial, and, frankly, interesting, information about the BT-50, including the real-time vehicle steering and tilt angles. Connectivity comes standard, with wireless Android Auto joining Apple CarPlay for the 2025 model year. USB-C sockets come standard as well.Materials throughout the cabin have also been updated, with the door trims, console lid, and dashboard trim coming in either brown or black leather. Higher trims feature leather seat trim with synthetic suede and the BT-50 moniker stitched into the headrests. As for safety, the 2025 Mazda BT-50 comes with Traffic Jam Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Braking, and Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control. A USB port located near the rearview mirror comes standard and is an ideal solution for simple plug-and-play dashcams.The Mazda BT-50 won’t be coming to the United StatesWhile the Mazda BT-50 could be a true competitor to the likes of the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger, the midsize truck won’t be coming to our shores anytime soon. A 25% tariff on light trucks was set up in 1964 by Lyndon B. Johnson and has yet to be repealed. Dubbed the ‘Chicken Tax’ due to its origins, a response to tariffs on United States chicken, foreign trucks began to steadily leave the country.2025 Mazda BT-50 RearMazdaMazda worked around the tax in its truck’s final generation by striking a deal with Ford. Unfortunately, the Japanese automaker lost its momentum, as the Mazda Truck was simply a rebadged Ford Ranger. As a result of the drop in popularity and profits, Mazda chose to withdraw from the American truck segment for good. The 2025 Mazda BT-50 arrives with a 3.0-liter turbo-diesel four-cylinder engine that generates 188 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. The midsize truck can tow up to 7,700 pounds and is based on the Isuzu D-Max. Starting at AUD 35,520, or around USD 23,000, the Mazda BT-50 is a competitively priced truck that could drastically undercut American competitors.Final thoughtsThe 2025 Mazda BT-50 is a truck that could offer true competition to American models and spur innovation, so it’s a shame we won’t see it here. With refreshed styling and new standard tech, the BT-50 is a great value for a midsize pickup.A USB port near the rearview mirror is a convenient feature that’s slowly becoming more in demand as dash cams grow in popularity. With its off-road capability and upscale interior, the Mazda BT-50 is a great truck for off-roading in the Australian Outback.",
