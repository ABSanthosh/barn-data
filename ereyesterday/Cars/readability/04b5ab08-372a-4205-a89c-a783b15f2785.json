  "description": "The French brand's budget SUV is more value than cheap and can be had with seven seats Citroen is going all-in on affordability. When it launched the new C3 it was hailed as the new-age affordable car to take the supermini crown. The axing of the Ford Fiesta had left a suitable hole that it was looking to fill. Now, its big sibling, the C3 Aircross, has arrived, with the same value positioning but with added practicality.This second-generation crossover lands once again in the B-SUV segment. It is positioned as one of the cheapest propositions available, starting from just over £20,000 while kitted with a generous level of equipment. Only the Dacia Duster, in bare-bones Essential form, undercuts it at £18,000.The Citroën’s low price, as with the smaller C3, is partly down to Stellantis’s new cost-saving architecture called ‘Smart Car’ – the new model makes the switch from the PFA1 platform, which dates back to the Peugeot 206. The C3 Aircross line-up opens with Plus spec from £20,240 – £2500 more than the smaller C3 – and rising to £25,740 for the Max trim; here you’ll find luxuries like heated seats. Unlike other Citroën models, no basic You! trim is offered in the UK, although its value standing suggests it could be added in the future.",

  "text": "Like the exterior, it’s a similar story inside, with our Max trim test car’s funky split dashboard that’s centered around a 10.25in touchscreen.  Naturally given the C3 Aircross’ value positioning, there is plenty of cheap plastic to be found, but Citroen has done a good job to lift the ambience. There are some nice looking materials such as the sofa-like fabric on the dashboard, however it does feel a tad cheap to the touch. There’s also ambient lighting and there are labels dotted around with inspirational slogans like “be cool/have fun”. The latter are a bit corny, but it adds a touch of fun to the cabin. The touchscreen, although it’s supposedly new, feels rather last-generation and having to adjust the media volume via the touchscreen is impractical. It’s odd that a volume knob has been left out because elsewhere, there are physical switches and buttons, including for the heating and ventilation and to turn off the speed limit warning (which is far from infallible). Instead of a traditional driver’s display, the information is projected onto a bar just underneath the base of the windscreen. It’s a neat solution that’s reminiscent of the old C4 Picasso, and it works better than the i-Cockpit in most Peugeots because the display is positioned high enough that you can easily see it over the small, square steering wheel. The C3 Aircross has one more ace up its sleeve: it can be had with seven seats. At just 4.39m, it is the shortest seven seater on the market. Opting for the seven-seater version (a £765 option on Max trim) reduces the boot space from 460 litres to 330 (still 20 litres more than the C3 supermini) with the third row down, and the third row is obviously very tight, but it is quite a rare feature. Having said that, at £18,295 the Dacia Jogger is more commodious and cheaper still.",
