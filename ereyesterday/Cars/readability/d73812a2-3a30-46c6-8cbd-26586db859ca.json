  "text": "What's The Best Way To Remove Tree Sap From Your Car? ruli amrullah/Shutterstock When looking for a place to park your car, some of us appreciate a little shade. Nothing ruins leather seats faster than UV rays, and entering a hot and stuffy car is no one's favorite activity. Unless a parking garage is nearby, our next best choice is to park under a tree. And yet, these same trees that offer shade harbor a silent killer: tree sap (insert b-track scream). This goo may seem harmless, but once it bonds to the clear coat of your car, it can penetrate the paint, and then we have a rust problem to deal with. Tree sap and bug poop can both ruin your car, and luckily, it's not that hard to remove tree sap (or bug poop). There are actually a number of easy ways to remove tree sap from your vehicle before it becomes a problem. Most of these solutions are household items, so you don't need to worry about running to the store and waiting for that sap to harden. Then it's a nightmare to remove. gadiel img/Shutterstock Before you try any of these methods, be sure to spray your car down with some water to avoid any dirt or debris. This can scratch up your car and cause more damage when scrubbing off the tree sap. A microfiber cloth can be a handy tool to keep your car protected when rubbing it down. Anyone with a first aid kit usually has hydrogen peroxide or isopropyl alcohol on standby, also known as rubbing alcohol. We want to use isopropyl alcohol with a 70% or lower concentration because a higher concentration can damage the clear coat of your car. As a preventive action, mix a 1:1 ratio of isopropyl alcohol and water. Dip a small cloth into the mix and place it on the tree sap. Let it sit for a few minutes, and the tree sap will rub right off. Hand sanitizer also works well here. Drizzle some onto the sap and let it sit before wiping it off. No rubbing alcohol? If you like to bake, it's time to break out the baking soda. Mix a little baking soda and water together to form a thick paste. Now all we need to do is apply the paste to the tree sap and let it sit. Wait a few, and then, gently rub the area to remove the tree sap. Another good method is soap and water. If you get to the tree sap before it hardens, then giving your car a good wash with a microfiber cloth is all you need. Like this article? Check out our other car cleaning hacks.",
