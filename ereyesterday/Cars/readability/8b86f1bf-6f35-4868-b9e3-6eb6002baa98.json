The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and is finished in black over black leather. Features include bi-xenon headlights, a sunroof, Parktronic, Distronic adaptive cruise control, 19″ AMG wheels, a power rear-window sunshade, Keyless Go, an electronic trunk closer, heated and ventilated multi-contour front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround sound system, a trunk-mounted CD changer, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. This C215 CL65 AMG is now offered in Pennsylvania by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title. The pillarless coupe body is finished in Black (040) and features AMG-specific lower bodywork. Additional equipment includes a sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, power-folding and heated side mirrors, an electronic trunk closer, Parktronic parking sensors, and quadruple exhaust outlets. The two-piece 19″ AMG wheels feature anthracite-finished spokes and are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires that show 2022 and 2023 date codes. Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and an Electronic Stability Program (ESP) were standard equipment, and braking is handled by AMG-branded calipers mounted over cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The heated and ventilated dynamic multi-contour AMG front sport seats are upholstered in black leather and feature position memory and a massaging function. Additional appointments include Keyless Go, a power rear-window sunshade, Distronic adaptive cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround sound system, a trunk-mounted CD changer, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The leather- and wood-trimmed four-spoke steering wheel frames AMG-branded instrumentation consisting of a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 36k miles. The twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 is equipped with a carbon-fiber cover and was factory rated at 604 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed AMG SpeedShift automatic transmission with Touch Shift. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
