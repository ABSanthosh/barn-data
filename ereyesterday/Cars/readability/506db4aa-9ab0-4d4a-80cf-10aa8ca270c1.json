It is hosting big reveals from Lanzante, Hyundai, MG and plenty more besides, as well as an array of debuts from Aston Martin, BMW and Honda. Below is our guide to the most important cars at this year's Festival of Speed. Alpine A110 R Ultime Production of the Alpine A110 ends next year and this is its last hurrah. The Ultime's 345bhp output – 49bhp up on the existing R – pushes beyond the limit of the original car’s gearbox, so a new six-speed unit has been swapped in. Swathes of carbonfibre feature elsewhere, cutting its weight to 1120kg, and it also gets an aggressive aero set-up. It’s priced from £276k and just 110 will be built, so its participation in the Festival of Speed might just be your only chance to see one being driven to its limits. Everything you need to know about the Alpine A110 R Ultime Alpine A290 Rallye The rally-ready version of Alpine’s electric hot hatch gains a limited-slip differential, bigger brakes and a hydraulic handbrake. There’s even an exterior speaker for the enjoyment of spectators.  Everything you need to know about the Alpine A290 Rallye Alpine A390 Alpine’s Porsche Macan challenger will make its British debut at the Festival of Speed.

Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Vantage S BMW M2 CS BMW’s junior sports car gets the Competition Sport treatment, gaining 50bhp more than the regular M2 and packing a generous 479lb ft.

Customer deliveries will start at the end of the summer.
