  "text": "Mar 24, 2025 8:00 PM EDTLamborghini's tremendous growth is hard to ignore Every year since around 2011, Lamborghini has proudly proclaimed “record-breaking deliveries,” with the brand finally cresting 10,000 units sold globally in 2023. It may not be surprising, then, to learn that 2024 was the brand's crowning achievement—so far—and saw it not only shatter records for deliveries but also revenue and, most importantly, profit. Over 800 million euros in profit According to Lamborghini's press release, the automaker managed to break several different records in 2024 “despite challenging conditions.” The landmark accomplishment is arguably the 835 million euros in operating profit—the highest ever for the automaker. Lamborghini also managed to crack an important revenue milestone: over 3 billion euros in revenue. The 3.09 billion euros Lamborghini made in revenue marks a 16.2 percent increase compared to last year, while the 835 million euro figure represents a 15.5 percent rise. That's not bad when you consider the year prior also saw exceptional growth. Relative to 2022, the 2023 fiscal year saw Lamborghini's revenue grow by 12.1 percent and operating profit expand by 17.8 percent. With 10,687 vehicles delivered—just 575 more than last year—and a 27 percent operating margin, it's fair to say the Italian automaker is doing pretty well. Of course, until you start looking at what the guys over in Maranello are doing. Ferrari managed a 28.3 percent operating margin while moving 13,752 units. That marks a fractional increase in units while still delivering over six billion euros in revenue. Apparently, it's a pretty good time to be a car manufacturer in Italy. Lamborghini has more than doubled their sales volume since 2017 As we said, Lamborghini loves telling people it's another record-breaking year, but that's easy to say when you sell a relatively small number of cars every year. Regardless, the brand's progress is truly remarkable, considering that less than a decade ago, Lamborghini delivered 3,815 cars globally. Coincidentally, 2018 marked the release of the brand's Urus SUV. Lamborghini moved 1,761 units of the SUV in its first year, and in 2021, the Urus accounted for over half the brand's deliveries. In fact, 2021 saw Lamborghini deliver twice as many SUVs as its next best-selling offering, the “entry-level” Huracan (5,021 Urus, 2,586 Huracan). Final thoughts Despite how you may feel about the House of Sant'Agata Bolognese's most recent exploits in the SUV segment, it's very difficult to argue with the results. Not to take away from what is an exceptional lineup of supercars, but the Urus has singlehandedly propelled Lamborghini to new heights. There's still a long way to go for the Bull to catch the Prancing Horse, but with numbers like these, the Italians may agree that second place is far from a consolation prize.",
