Still, we haven’t forgotten rad projects like the All4 Racing, the John Cooper Works Rally, and the John Cooper Works Buggy. While those were competition cars built by the German racing team X-Raid, this Canadian-market Cooper S is a private effort.Listed on Bring a Trailer, the pint-sized hatchback has been transformed into a capable off-roader with a suspension lift kit. It rides on 15-inch wheels wrapped in meaty Maxtrek Mud Trac tires that fill out bulging fenders with flared arches. Like many serious off-road builds, it even features a snorkel. The list of mods is extensive, including everything from auxiliary lights to a roof rack. It even has rock sliders, something rarely seen on a MINI.This unusual first-generation modern Cooper S further stands out with an aftermarket front bumper that improves its approach angle. Inside, the black leather front seats have been sourced from a John Cooper Works model. Under the hood, the supercharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine has been rebuilt, as has the six-speed manual transmission. Remember, though, it’s still front-wheel drive, so don’t expect it to outclass a Land Cruiser or Defender on tough trails.Painted in Dark Silver, the high-riding MINI is located in Blaine, Washington. It has covered 224,787 kilometers (139,676 miles) and is currently listed at $4,000, with bidding open until tomorrow. The seller offers it at no reserve and notes visible dings and blemishes on the body, which is unsurprising for a 22-year-old car converted for off-road use.MINI could learn a few things from creative custom builds like this and consider launching a rugged version of its own. The Countryman, rather than the tiny three-door hatch, would be a more suitable candidate and could appeal to a growing niche of enthusiasts looking to do some light off-roading.Source: Bring a Trailer",
