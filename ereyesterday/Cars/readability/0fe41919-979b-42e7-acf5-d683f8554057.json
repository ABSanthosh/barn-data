  "description": "This 1969 Ford Mustang was originally built as a 302-powered SportsRoof, and it was modified as a custom commission for MLB pitcher Jack Morris at a claimed cost of over $400k. The customized body is mounted on a chromoly frame with an integrated roll cage, and it has a Heidts independent front end and a four-link rear end with a Panhard bar as well as coilovers all around. The car rides on staggered modular BBS wheels and has four-wheel disc brakes, and power is from a Roush-built Ford V8 with a Dart aluminum block, Wiseco pistons, Eagle connecting rods, AFR 225 heads, and a Holley carburetor. Claimed to produce over 600 horsepower, it is linked to a six-speed manual transmission and a Ford 9\" rear end with an Eaton Truetrac differential and 4.11 gears. Inside are bucket seats, harnesses, custom upholstery, air conditioning, and a Hurst shifter. Following completion of the build, the car was a finalist in the Goodguys Muscle Machine of the Year selection for 2012. Acquired in 2020 by its current owner, a retail Arizona dealer, this modified Mustang is now offered on their behalf with build documents and a clean Arizona title.",
