Finished in Interlagos Blue Metallic, the car is further equipped with a carbon-fiber roof, a CSL-style trunk lid, and a Vorsteiner front bumper cover and rear diffuser along with 18″ HRE Fall-Line R43 wheels, Brembo brakes, AST coilovers, custom headers, and Supersprint exhaust components. The cabin features Sparco SPX bucket seats as well as a CAE shifter, an Alcantara-trimmed steering wheel, and drilled metal pedals. Acquired by the seller in 2021, this E46 M3 has 89k miles and is offered in California with an owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean South Dakota title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Interlagos Blue Metallic (A30) with Shadowline trim, and the seller states that it has been fitted with a Vorsteiner V-CSL front bumper cover, a Lang Racing carbon-fiber roof, a CSL-style trunk lid, a Vorsteiner carbon-fiber rear diffuser, and N15 Design hood vents. Additional details include a front tow strap, a carbon-fiber front splitter, LED tail lights, and quad exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the roof according to the seller. The 18″ HRE Fall-Line R43 wheels are mounted with 245/40 front and 275/35 rear Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R5S tires. Modifications noted by the seller include a Brembo GT brake kit, a Rogue Engineering front strut brace, AST 4200 coilovers, Vorshlag camber plates, and Motorsport Hardware wheel studs and lug nuts. A pair of Sparco SPX bucket seats with carbon-fiber backs have been added to the cabin, and additional interior details include a CAE shifter, drilled metal pedals, a Harman Kardon sound system, automatic climate control, and an Alcantara-trimmed shift boot and center armrest. There are dead pixels in the infotainment display and the Alcantara headliner is sagging. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features M-color stitching and frames a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 89k miles, approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is said to have been modified with a Schrick 288/280 camshaft set, an Evolve carbon-fiber airbox, Dinan throttle bodies, Ferrea Racing valves, BE rod bearings, and a Besian Vanos upgrade. The seller states that the motor has been resealed and the alternator has been replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Rogue Engineering rear shock mount reinforcements were installed in 2010 according to the seller, who notes that the car is equipped with AKG Motorsport rear subframe bushings and a rebuilt differential with 4.10:1 gearing and ARP bolts. Custom headers and Supersprint exhaust components are also said to be installed. The Carfax report notes at least one open recall. The vehicle cannot pass a California emissions test in its current configuration, therefore it cannot be sold to an in-state private party buyer. You are not connected to real-time updates.
