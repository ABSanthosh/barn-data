  "description": "Honda 0 Series prototypes, an SUV and a sedan, were showcased at the 2025 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, United States. These models are the first of seven EVs built on an all-new platform. Both will be launched in North America next year before arriving in other markets such as Europe. A 0 Series compact sedan is also due by 2030 New Honda EVs will get Level 3 ADAS suite 0 Series platform uses a thin battery for more interior room Honda 0 Series SUV The SUV is based on the Space Hub concept that Honda showed at CES last year. The prototype SUV appears slightly shorter than the sedan, with an upright design for the windscreen aimed at maximising interior space. However, its squared-off rear section looks MPV-inspired. Honda has yet to disclose its technical specifications.  Honda 0 Series sedan The Japanese automaker previewed the 0 sedan as a concept during the 2024 CES event. The latest prototype looks identical to that concept in both exterior and interior designs. Honda claims these EVs’ platform houses an around 8mm thinner battery than rivals for improved interior room. The 0 Series sedan will source power from an 80-90kWh NMC battery with an estimated range of over 482km. A larger battery pack, likely to be 100kWh, will also be offered.  Honda 0 Series ASIMO OS, Level 3 ADAS The company also announced that it has developed ASIMO OS, which will be responsible for all the key vehicle systems in 0 Series models. ASIMO is a nod to the humanoid robot that Honda introduced in 2000. The OS will manage ECUs for vehicle systems, such as autonomous driving, driver aids and in-car infotainment, and support over-the-air (OTA) updates. The Japanese brand claims that the 0 Series EVs will be Level 3 ADAS-enabled, allowing the driver to take their hands off the wheel in certain situations. Overseas, Honda previously had a model called Legend, which featured a Level 3 ADAS suite. Honda 0 Series powertrain All 0 Series models will be offered with RWD and AWD powertrains, which will use new compact e-axle motors. Entry-level variants will get a 244hp motor on the rear axle. Initially, top-end versions will offer a combined power output of around 488hp. Also, see: Skoda Enyaq facelift revealed Mahindra BE 6 top variant priced at Rs 26.90 lakh",
