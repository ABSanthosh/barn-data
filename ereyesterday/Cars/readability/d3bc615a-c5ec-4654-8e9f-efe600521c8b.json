  "text": "Sporting stylish looks and plug-in hybrid power, Audi appears to have a winner on its hands April 28, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Audi is putting the finishing touches on the next-generation RS5 sedan and Avant. The models will replace the RS4 and feature a new plug-in hybrid powertrain setup. The high-performance variant features a unique front end and distinctive exhausts. Audi unveiled the redesigned A5 and S5 last summer, and now they’re gearing up to introduce the range-topping RS5 and RS5 Avant. As part of the preparations, prototypes were recently spied undergoing testing on the Nürburgring. Dressed in swirly camouflage, the high-performance models follow in the footsteps of their S5 counterparts. While the front end largely carries over, there are some notable changes including a lightly revised bumper with larger air intakes. The lower intake also trades honeycomb mesh for a larger “X” pattern. More: 2026 Audi RS5 Avant Plugs Into The Future Of Performance The most noticeable difference resides out back as there’s a dual exhaust system with massive tips. They’re integrated into a unique bumper, which features a small diffuser as well as vertical elements. We can also see new reflectors that have a horizontal layout. The changes don’t end there as the RS5 features front fender vents as well as sportier side skirts. More notably, there’s a side-mounted charging port that hints at the model’s plug-in hybrid powertrain. Baldauf Audi has been tight-lipped about details, but rumors have suggested the model could use a version of the RS4’s twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6. It produced 444 hp (331 kW / 450 PS) and 443 lb-ft (600 Nm) of torque, which enabled the wagon to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 4.1 seconds before hitting a limited top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). The plug-in hybrid system would deliver a big boost and enable the model to battle the Mercedes C63 S E Performance. The latter uses a plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a rear-mounted electric motor, a 6.1 kWh battery pack, and a 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system. It gives the car a combined output of 671 hp (500 kW / 680 PS) and 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of torque. Aside from the high-tech powertrain, we can expect a beefy braking system and a sport-tuned suspension. They should be joined by a familiar cabin with an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.5-inch infotainment system, and an available 10.9-inch front passenger display. SHProshots",
