Powered by a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, the truck is finished in Aintree Green Metallic over Arabica leather upholstery. It also features a rear access ladder, a receiver hitch, parking sensors, an electronic air suspension, 20″ Style 510 alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated rear seats, third-row seating, a Meridian sound system, a rearview camera, and navigation. The sunroof motor was replaced in preparation for the sale. This LR4 indicates 94k miles and is offered on dealer consignment in Wisconsin with a clean Carfax report and a clean District of Columbia title. The truck is finished in Aintree Green Metallic and features a black grille and side vents along with a rear access ladder, a split tailgate, a receiver hitch, front and rear parking sensors, and a rear window wiper. Aftermarket window tint film has been applied to the windows and a Discovery 4 rear badge has been applied. The sunroof motor was replaced in preparation for the sale. Close-up images of exterior blemishes are provided in the gallery. Black-finished 20″ Style 510 alloy wheels wear Cooper Discoverer AT3 tires that were mounted in June 2023. Braking is handled by ventilated discs at each corner, and the truck is equipped with an electronic air suspension, a Terrain Response system, All-Terrain Dynamic Stability Control, Hill Descent Control, and Hill Start Assist. Arabica leather covers the heated and power-adjustable front seats and the second-row bench seat, while the center and door armrests are trimmed in Almond leather. Walnut woodgrain trim accents the cabin, and appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, keyless entry, push-button start, a center console cooler, a Meridian sound system, a rearview camera, navigation, and third-row seating as well as heated outboard second-row seats. A replacement cabin air filter was installed in October 2024. The left-rear window does not roll down. The heated steering wheel frames a 145-mph speedometer, a central digital display, and a tachometer. The digital odometer indicates 94k miles, approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership. The supercharged 3.0-liter AJ126 V6 was factory rated at 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Service under previous ownership included repairing the wiring harness and replacing the DMTL pump, water pump, rear coolant manifold, coolant outlet pipes, battery, and one fuel injector. The air filter was replaced and the oil was changed in October 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The transmission shifter was replaced in September 2022. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
