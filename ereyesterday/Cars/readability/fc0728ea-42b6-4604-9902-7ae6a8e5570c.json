  "text": "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again June 2, 2025 at 20:32 by Michael Gauthier Ford is recalling thousands of vehicles that weren’t properly fixed in previous recalls. Two separate issues impact the Ford Transit as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Corsair. Both are related to bad software updates, so customers will need to return to dealerships. Ford’s recallathon is inching closer to record breaking territory as the automaker has issued 59 recalls this year. To put that number into perspective, second place Volkswagen has only had 15. The latest round of recalls impacts 6,733 vehicles due to two separate issues. However, it’s recall redux as both campaigns target vehicles that were “repaired incorrectly” in previous recalls. More: Ford Warns Thousands Of Drivers Something Could Fall Off Their Truck Kicking things off is a recall that targets 3,227 Lincoln Aviator and Corsair crossovers from the 2020-2023 model years. They’re equipped with a Revel audio system that was previously fixed incorrectly. According to the National Highway Safety Administration, the correct software update may not have been installed on the vehicle and this means the original recall condition may still exist. That’s a problem as the seat belt warning system may provide an audible signal for less than four seconds, when the driver’s seat belt is not buckled and the vehicle is started. This isn’t exactly an earth-shattering issue, but the models fail to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. While an investigation found 94.2% of vehicles had the correct software installed, a few slipped through the cracks. They’ll now be addressed as dealers will install updated audio control module software. Recall number two focuses on 3,506 Transits from the 2022 and 2023 model years. It’s a similar problem to the one mentioned above as the vans didn’t have software installed correctly, but were recorded as having the repair completed. As a result, the original issue remains. In this case, the instrument cluster may not properly illuminate gauges or show warning messages or lights. This runs afoul of regulations, so the vehicles are getting recalled again. The heart of the problem appears to be software for the 4.2-inch cluster display and a software tool that did not upload the correct software to the vehicles in question. As a result, they’ll need to return to the dealership to get the right software installed.",
