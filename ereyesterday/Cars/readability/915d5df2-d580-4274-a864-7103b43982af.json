Power is supplied by a 351ci Ford Cleveland V8 equipped with Edelbrock cylinder heads, MSD ignition, and a Holley carburetor. The car is finished in silver and black over black vinyl and is equipped with a ZF five-speed manual transaxle, tubular headers, an aluminum radiator, polished 17″ Campagnolo wheels, Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes, a front spoiler, pop-up headlights, quad exhaust outlets, a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. This Pantera GTS was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered in Washington with a Deluxe Marti report, service records, factory literature, and a clean California title. The Pantera’s bodywork was designed under the direction of American designer Tom Tjaarda. This example is finished in silver and black and was repainted during the aforementioned refurbishment. Features include GTS-specific fender flares and Pantera GTS script along the sides along with a front spoiler, pop-up headlights, black front and rear impact bumpers, and quad exhaust outlets. The polished 17″ Campagnolo wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot tires. The car rides on a four-wheel independent suspension with Koni shocks, and braking is handled by power-assisted Wilwood discs at each corner. The cabin was reupholstered during the refurbishment and houses bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl. Interior equipment includes a gated shifter, air conditioning, shoulder belts, and power windows. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a Veglia 200-mph speedometer and 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for amperage, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure are stationed in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 14k miles. The mid-mounted 351ci Ford Cleveland V8 has been modified with a Holley carburetor, Edelbrock Performer cylinder heads, Ford Racing valve covers, MSD ignition, and tubular headers. Cooling is via an aluminum radiator with dual electric fans. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed manual transaxle. The Deluxe Marti report lists the factory colors, options, and production statistics. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
