  "description": "At the Osaka Motorcycle show earlier this year, Honda had shown a new concept called the CB1000F as a new neo-retro offering from the brand, styled to mimic the design of UJMs (Universal Japanese Motorcycle) of the past. Now, the company has teased the reveal of another concept, the CB1000F SE, ahead of its reveal at the famous Suzuka 8 hours race in Japan, slated to be held on August 1-3. Honda CB1000F concept is a neo-retro roadster CB1000F SE variant teased ahead of debut, has a small fairing Both concepts share engine with CB1000 Hornet SP sold in India Honda CB1000F concept: will it go into production? CB1000F shares engine and main frame with CB1000 Hornet. The original CB1000F concept (pictured below) had a round headlight, classically styled body panels, a stepped, single-piece seat, and an upswept exhaust muffler – all design elements seen on UJMs of yesteryear. The CB1000F SE concept that has been teased appears to build on that platform, but has a small bikini fairing. That the two concepts share a large part of their fundamentals, is of little doubt.  When Honda showcased the CB1000F concept earlier in March, there were strong hints that this concept would turn into a production model down the line. It used Showa suspension, Nissin brakes and a rolling chassis that was more or less in production-spec guise. To recap, the CB1000F shares its engine and main frame as well as some components with the CB1000 Hornet supernaked (whose SP variant is sold in India). Just like Kawasaki did with the Z900 and Z900RS or Suzuki did with the GSX-8S and GSX-8T, Honda will differentiate the CB1000 Hornet and the CB1000F primarily through its style. The main visual difference between the chassis on the existing CB1000 Hornet and the CB1000F concept is the rear subframe. While on the Hornet, the subframe is a sharply raked one with a small pillion seat (like a Kawasaki Z900), the CB1000F uses a near-flat subframe which accommodates some neo-retro bodywork and a stepped single piece seat (like a Kawasaki Z900RS). As of now, engine specifications remain under wraps. It remains to be seen if Honda will simply give the CB1000F a different tune to suit its more relaxed character while retaining the same engine fundamentals or if it will make more comprehensive internal changes. Honda will reveal the CB1000F SE concept at the prestigious Suzuka 8 hours race in Japan in the coming weeks, with more information set to trickle in. If it does go into production, the CB1000F will be one of the handful of Japanese four-cylinder motorcycles to have a retro design. Also See: Yamaha India big bike plans delayed but still on",
