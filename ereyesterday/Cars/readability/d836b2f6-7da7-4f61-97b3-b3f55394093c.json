  "description": "Mercedes-Benz will launch the new AMG CLE 53 in India by late 2025, Autocar India can confirm. The AMG CLE 53, unveiled in December 2023, gets styling upgrades and a boost in performance over the E 53 coupe it replaces. Mercedes also sells the CLE 53 AMG convertible in international markets, but it is yet to be ascertained which one is headed to India. CLE 53's top speed can be increased to 270kph with Driver's Package Gets a 449hp, 600Nm, 3-litre twin-turbocharged engine Will rival the BMW M2 Competition Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 design The AMG brings with it a Panamericana radiator grille and LED headlamps with sleeker Daytime Running Lamps. There's a large air intake below the grille to increase airflow. There are smaller air intakes on either side, and a long bonnet and raked windshield add to the stance. Along the sides are flared wheel arches, which make the track wider than the standard CLE's by 58mm and 75mm at the front and rear, respectively. As for alloy wheels, there will be 19 and 20 inchers on offer, the latter being an optional upgrade. The two-part LED tail-lights are connected but do not get a light bar. There are quad exhausts – two on each side – integrated into the rear diffuser. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 features There’s an AMG Performance flat-bottom steering wheel with touch control buttons. It also gets a 12.3-inch driver’s display, which sits next to the third-generation MBUX-powered 11.9-inch potrait-oriented touchscreen. It also gets 64-colour ambient lighting, over-the-air (OTA) software updates, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Burmester sound system and a wireless charger. The CLE 53 AMG also gets rear-wheel steering that turns in the direction of the front wheels up to a maximum of 0.7 degrees at speeds of over 100kph. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 performance, expected price The performance-focused CLE borrows the ‘M256’ 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six mill from the E 53 sedan, coupled to a 48V mild-hybrid system. Combined output is 449hp and 560Nm, and you get an additional 40Nm torque boost with the Overboost function. This power is sent to all four wheels via a 9-speed gearbox. The AMG CLE 53 does 0-100kph in 4.2 seconds and maxes out at 250kph; the top speed goes up to 270kph with the AMG Performance Package. The AMG CLE 53 Cabriolet takes 0.2 seconds more to reach 100kph, owing to the additional weight. For reference, the BMW M2 has a sprint time of 4.2 seconds (manual) and 4 seconds (automatic). As for pricing, we expect the AMG CLE 53 coupe to have a price tag of around Rs 2 crore.
