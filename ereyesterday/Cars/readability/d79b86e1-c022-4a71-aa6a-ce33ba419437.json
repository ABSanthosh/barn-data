  "text": "Many custom bike builders develop a signature style over time—but that style is often attached to one particular make, model, or era of motorcycling. Then there are craftsmen who can apply their distinct art to any canvas, without compromise. Kengo Kimura of Heiwa MC is one such artisan. Based in Hiroshima, Kimura-san is one of the leading lights in the Japanese custom scene. His custom bikes are recognizable for their elegant tapered silhouettes, and the way each part harmonizes with the next. Most of his projects use older models as donors, but he’s just as adept at modifying new bikes—as evidenced by this handsome 2024-model custom Triumph Scrambler 900. What’s remarkable is how much Kengo’s been able to manipulate the modern Triumph to suit his vision. The British marque has done well to keep the Scrambler 900 looking rather tidy out of the box, but it still packs a hefty amount of electronic doohickies. There’s a lot to clean up—and one wrong move could turn the bike into a very stylish (and expensive) paperweight. That hasn’t stopped Kengo though. Thanks to his deft handiwork, this neo-retro scrambler could easily pass for a vintage machine. As you’d expect, there are a lot of handmade parts in play. Kengo removed all of the Triumph Scrambler 900’s bodywork, replacing it with custom aluminum pieces. The design starts with a generous front fender, mounted on hand-bent stays, before continuing through to a svelte fuel tank and a tracker-style tailpiece. Kengo’s first big challenge was accommodating the Triumph’s bulky fuel pump in such a small space. To get around it, he instead housed the pump in a second aluminum reservoir, situated under the seat. The lack of side covers puts more clever craftsmanship on display—starting with the Scrambler 900’s new bespoke subframe. Kengo hacked the original unit off, before welding mounting points to the main frame and fabricating a bolt-on section that looks better than factory. Keen eyes will also notice the lack of Triumph’s traditional twin-rear-shock arrangement. Kengo lengthened the stock swingarm, shaved off its original shock mounts, and added a brace that doubles as the lower shock mount. An Öhlins shock connects the swingarm to a custom upper shock mount. A set of rare Italian-made Forcelle forks do duty up front, held in place by custom-made aluminum yokes. A small headlight floats between the yokes, hung from a handmade brace that echoes the design of the front fender stays. Cross-braced Renthal handlebars sit further back, fitted with ProTaper dirt bike grips. Kengo has somehow managed to navigate around the modern Triumph Scrambler’s can BUS system, reducing the dashboard to a small Motogadget speedo with a pair of basic switches. A slim LED taillight, and discreet LED turn signals, round out the lighting package. Kengo also fabricated a new sump guard, sprocket cover, and radiator guard. (The latter includes a housing for the ignition barrel, situated low down on the left-hand side). Heiwa’s Triumph is finished off in a bewitching light grey livery from Shakin’ Speedgraphix, complete with dark grey accents and silver leaf striping. The upholstery comes courtesy of Ya.Seat.Custom in Bangkok, and the marvelous twin exhausts are Kengo’s doing. If you’ve been aboard a Triumph Scrambler 900, you’ll know that it’s fairly compact in stock form. But Kengo’s managed to make it look even skinnier, and a heck of a lot classier. As we’ve come to expect from Heiwa, there’s not a single thing we’d change—other than the name on the title. Heiwa MC | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Kazuo Matsumoto",
