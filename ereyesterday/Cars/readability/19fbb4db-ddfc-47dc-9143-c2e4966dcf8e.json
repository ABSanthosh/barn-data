  "description": "Tesla has taken the wraps off its all-new product: the long-awaited robotaxi. This vehicle, christened the Tesla Cybercab, gets a design inspired by the popular Cybertruck and comes with the brand's latest autonomous driving tech. It is set to enter production by 2027. The Cybercab project has been in the works for years as part of Elon Musk's bold plan to transition Tesla from a pure car firm to a robotics manufacturer. Tesla Cybercab gets a two-seater interior Gets minimalistic styling inside out No powertrain details revealed so far Tesla Cybercab: what exactly is it? Musk has confirmed that production of the unique Cybercab will begin before 2027. The vehicle will have no steering wheel or pedals, meaning production can only start once all regulatory approvals are in place. Like other Tesla models, the Cybercab gets a minimalist interior layout, with seating for two and a large centrally mounted screen that controls almost all functions, similar to the Model 3 and Model Y. On the outside, the Cybercab gets a single full-width LED light bar similar to the Cybertruck, giving it an equally futuristic look. It shares design elements, creases, and wide rear shoulders with other Tesla models like the Model Y in particular. Unique butterfly doors mark a first for any Tesla vehicle. At the rear, there’s a large boot, but like the Cybertruck, the Cybercab lacks a rear window. It also gets full wheel covers, which Tesla says help with extracting more range. As of now, the brand has not revealed any details about the powertrain or specifications. Tesla earlier hinted on entering the Indian market, but there hasn’t been much progress on that front as of now.
