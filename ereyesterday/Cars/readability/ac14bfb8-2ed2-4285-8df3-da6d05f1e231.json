  "text": "MICHAEL SIMARI|CAR AND DRIVERThere are plenty of good two-row mid-size SUVs to choose from today. So many, in fact, that it can be tough getting a handle on what's out there. Models in this segment provide a combination of interior space and utility without being truly huge and unwieldy, and their fuel-efficiency numbers are a little more palatable than full-size options.We've selected three popular entrants in this crowded class to help you cross-shop them. Here, we'll look at how 2025 models of the Chevy Blazer, the Honda Passport, and the Nissan Murano stack up in terms of specs and pricing.Powertrains As part of a big 2025 update, the Murano saw its former V-6 and continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) replaced by a more modern powertrain. In place of the old 3.5-liter six is Nissan's turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder featuring variable compression and variable displacement. The VC-Turbo, as it's marketed, makes 241 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Backing it is a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission that behaves much more civilly than the CVT. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available as an option.Honda's Passport still has a 3.5-liter V-6 underhood, providing a smooth 280 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque. The sole transmission offered is a nine-speed automatic, and a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system is standard. A new Passport is coming for 2026; it uses a version of the corporate V-6 powertrain paired with a 10-speed auto.Michael Simari|Car and Driver2024 Honda Passport TrailSport. Honda2026 Honda Passport TrailSport.The Chevy Blazer offers a rare amount of choice in this segment, with two available powertrains. The standard offering is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 is optional and brings considerably higher output: 308 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. Both engines mate with a nine-speed automatic transmission and come with a choice of standard front- or available all-wheel drive. Chevrolet also offers the Blazer EV, which, despite the shared name, is really a separate model of a similar size.Fuel EconomyDespite its new efficiency-focused powertrain, the 2025 Murano merely matches the 23 mpg combined fuel-economy number of last year's V-6-powered model, with 21 city and 27 highway numbers for both the front- and all-wheel-drive versions.The more rugged Honda Passport doesn't fare as well. Its V-6 returns 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway in EPA testing.The 2025 Blazer's two powertrains' fuel-economy ratings line up well with their competitors in this set. The four-cylinder model is rated at 22 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway with front-wheel drive, while all-wheel drive drops the highway figure slightly, with ratings of 22 city and 27 highway. Opt for the V-6, and the front-drive Blazer manages 19 city and 26 highway in EPA tests, while the all-wheel-drive V-6 version has the same highway rating and is close behind for the city at 18. In Car and Driver's 75-mph highway fuel-economy test, an all-wheel-drive V-6 Blazer returned 24 mpg.Interior and CargoAll three of these contenders provide seating for five people in two rows. Unlike some other mid-sizers, the Blazer, the Passport, and the Murano do not offer an available third row. Passenger space in the Nissan favors the first row, with 44.3 inches of legroom up front and 36.3 in the rear. The Chevy and Honda offer more balanced accommodations with about 41 inches up front and an identical 39.6 in the rear.The Passport is by far the winner when it comes to cargo volume with all seats up. It offers a generous 41.2 cubic feet, while the Nissan comes in at 32.9 and the Chevy at 30.5. Fold down the second row, and the rankings are as follows: 77.7 cubic feet in the Passport (77.5 for the Black Edition trim), 64.2 in the Blazer, and 63.5 cubes in the Murano. These are all respectable numbers, but the Honda has an obvious advantage for those who want to maximize stuff-carrying abilities.Michael Simari|Car and Driver2024 Honda Passport. Nissan2025 Nissan Murano.TowingEach of these options offers enough trailer-towing capacity for light recreational use—think a pop-up camper, small watercraft, or a utility trailer. The Passport is rated for a 5000-pound trailer, while 2.0-liter Blazers can handle 1500 to 3250 pounds, depending on equipment, and the V-6 versions can handle 1500 to 4500 pounds. The Murano offers just 1500 pounds of trailering, so it's not quite the lifestyle vehicle the others are.PriceThe least expensive of these three is also the least powerful—a Blazer 2LT with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter engine starts at $36,795, while an all-wheel-drive version tacks on $2700. Going for the V-6 Blazer requires $44,395 for a front-drive RS model, and adding all-wheel drive to that version runs an extra $2900.The 2025 Murano SV FWD comes in at $41,860, with an all-wheel-drive version just $1000 more. The Honda Passport EX-L starts at $43,850, but remember that everything in that lineup comes with all-wheel drive from the start, making the Passport a bit less expensive than a V-6 Blazer.Ever since David was a wee Car and Driver intern, he has kept a spreadsheet listing all the vehicles he’s driven and tested. David really likes spreadsheets. He can parallel-park a school bus and once drove a Lincoln Town Car 63 mph in reverse. After taking a break from journalism to work on autonomous vehicles, he’s back writing for this and other automotive publications. When David’s not searching for the perfect used car, you can find him sampling the latest in gimmicky, limited-edition foodstuffs.",

These are all respectable numbers, but the Honda has an obvious advantage for those who want to maximize stuff-carrying abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-embed=\"composite\" data-lazy-id=\"P0-18\" data-node-id=\"20\"\u003e\u003cdiv size=\"medium\" data-embed=\"body-image\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"2024 honda passport\" title=\"2024 Honda Passport\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1500\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-honda-passport-101-66290bb116d57.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.920xh;0,0.0233xh\u0026amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-honda-passport-101-66290bb116d57.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.920xh;0,0.0233xh\u0026amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-honda-passport-101-66290bb116d57.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.920xh;0,0.0233xh\u0026amp;resize=980:* 1120w\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-honda-passport-101-66290bb116d57.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.920xh;0,0.0233xh\u0026amp;resize=980:*\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-theme-key=\"photo-credit-figcaption\"\u003e\u003cspan data-theme-key=\"photo-credit-creditor\"\u003eMichael Simari\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e|\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCar and Driver\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003e2024 Honda Passport. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv size=\"medium\" data-embed=\"body-image\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"2025 nissan murano\" title=\"2025 Nissan Murano\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1500\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-nissan-murano-128-6762fcf33ebd9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9166666666666666xh;center,top\u0026amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-nissan-murano-128-6762fcf33ebd9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9166666666666666xh;center,top\u0026amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-nissan-murano-128-6762fcf33ebd9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9166666666666666xh;center,top\u0026amp;resize=980:* 1120w\" src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2025-nissan-murano-128-6762fcf33ebd9.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9166666666666666xh;center,top\u0026amp;resize=980:*\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-theme-key=\"photo-credit-figcaption\"\u003e\u003cspan data-theme-key=\"photo-credit-creditor\"\u003eNissan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003e2025 Nissan Murano.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"towing\" data-node-id=\"21\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTowing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"22\"\u003eEach of these options offers enough trailer-towing capacity for light recreational use—think a pop-up camper, small watercraft, or a utility trailer. The Passport is rated for a 5000-pound trailer, while 2.0-liter Blazers can handle 1500 to 3250 pounds, depending on equipment, and the V-6 versions can handle 1500 to 4500 pounds. The Murano offers just 1500 pounds of trailering, so it\u0026#39;s not quite the lifestyle vehicle the others are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"price\" data-node-id=\"23\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"24\"\u003eThe least expensive of these three is also the least powerful—a Blazer 2LT with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter engine starts at $36,795, while an all-wheel-drive version tacks on $2700.

David really likes spreadsheets. He can parallel-park a school bus and once drove a Lincoln Town Car 63 mph in reverse. After taking a break from journalism to work on autonomous vehicles, he’s back writing for this and other automotive publications. When David’s not searching for the perfect used car, you can find him sampling the latest in gimmicky, limited-edition foodstuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
