Whichever path you choose, there’s another question worth considering; how do you treat patina? Must every last nut and bolt shine, or must the machine wear its history with pride? “I personally live on both sides of the restored versus patina conversation,” says Mike Watanabe, co-founder of Union Motorcycle Classics. “I have pristine bikes and patina bikes that I relate to regularly. I also have a nice Porsche 912 and a Patina 356. I find a place for both philosophies—on two wheels or four.” Mike runs Union Motorcycle Classics together with Luke Ransom, out of an old barn in Nampa, Idaho, USA. True to his word, the shop produces bikes on both sides of the equation—from polished restomods to classics that are dripping with patina. But they put considerable effort into ensuring that their latest project, a vintage Ducati 250, would fall into the latter camp. The project kicked off when a client brought 1965-model Ducati 250, and commissioned a restomod similar to another Ducati 250 that Union had completed a few years ago. Drawing inspiration from the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, Mike had a clear plan for the build. The petite Ducati single was rolled into Union’s workshop and stripped down to a rolling chassis. Luke started poring through the engine and original Dell’Orto carb to bring everything up to par. A new electronic ignition system was installed too. Meanwhile, Mike had a challenge ahead of him. The brief called for a handful of changes to the stock Ducati, but he didn’t want to risk putting new parts on the well-worn donor bike. So he tapped every resource he could to find parts with their own patina. “I found an original paint Ducati Diana tank that had some work done around the fuel taps,” Mike recalls. “That red tank set the tone for the rest of the bodywork. EBay provided a modified Ducati front fender in red.” The front number plate, clip-ons, and top yoke are all parts that were factory options on the Ducati 250 in the 1960s. Mike also managed to track down a set of 18” Ducati wheels, plus a center stand, chain guard, and rear-set pegs from the Bologna factory. The exhaust header and muffler are also up-cycled parts. Mike’s next task was to finish off the bodywork with new parts, without ruining the bike’s aesthetic. He started by ordering a new fiberglass rear fender from Glass From the Past, before aging it to match the rest of the bike. The seat is completely bespoke, with upholstery by Interior Revolutions over a fiberglass base. The Ducati’s subframe was tweaked to support (and raise) the new seat, before being finished off with a pair of side covers that Union had made for a different build, many years ago. Mike also welded on new mounting points for the bike’s rear-set foot pegs. The only brand-new parts on the bike are a replica tacho drive, the chain, and a reproduction tachometer from Veglia. As we’ve come to expect from Union Motorcycle Classics, this Ducati 250 is as adorable as it is alluring. According to Mike, who has affectionately named the bike Dirty Diana, it’s also “a riot to ride.” There’s a twist in this tale though. Although the bike was originally ordered by a client, it’s now being given away in a sweepstakes to benefit a charity that helps underprivileged children in Thailand and Cambodia. You can enter here for as little as $25, with all funds raised going towards food, shelter, education, and medical care for these kids. “The person who commissioned the build is a regular customer with a stable of Italian singles,” Mike explains. “He decided to pare down his collection and wanted help selling some of his bikes. I wanted to purchase this little wabi-sabi gem for myself—then I thought about the need for a fundraiser bike.” “I struck a deal with the owner to purchase the bike at a price well below market value, with the condition that it be used for the sweepstakes. In its own way, this little red wabi-sabi Ducati 250 is doubling down to do good.” Union Motorcycle Classics | Facebook | Instagram",
