I know some of y'all get access to new cars and/or interesting used cars on a regular basis. You work for dealers or auto shops or have a collection or access to a friend's collection. Maybe you just rent cars a lot for business or personal travel. Whatever the case, let us hear it.By the way, we're not done with best/worst for the year -- we'll have a deeper look at staff picks next week.Anyway, you know what to do.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published December 27th, 2024 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation The Nissan Note w/e-POWER series hybrid I had as a rental last summer. The default driving mode felt like you’re driving a car stuck in the second gear with jerky acceleration and overly aggressive regen. Alternative mode had zero brake regen (no blended brake option) so a little better but mileage suffered. Still the mode of choice. A high-pitched and discordant sounding three pot that’s constantly at full buzz even at stop and go traffic. The car really needed a bigger generator. Suspension is probably meant to be “sporty” but rear end bottom out too easily, even on the marble smooth Japanese roadways. My cars are old with a lot of miles and run on gasoline and have too many cylinders and boring C and D pillars and plenty of headroom and the grilles are restrained and there are buttons and knobs on the dashboard so I guess to summarize they are not trendy and not European and much less advanced than a Subaru and so I guess they aren't very good. I try not to drive new cars because I would just feel worse about my life. Plus my 'mechanic' is kind of old and set in his ways lol. Maybe if I flew on more of those super Boeing aircraft I would get to be in more rental cars, that would be amazing, based on everything I read, but I usually just drive everywhere. Ooops internet time is up, talk soon.",
