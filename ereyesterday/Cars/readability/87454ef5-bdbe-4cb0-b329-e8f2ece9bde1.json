You’re going nowhere in a hurry in the city of Angels. This weekend, Los Angeles may see some of the worst traffic its seen in a long time thanks to a bunch of events happening at once.Suggested ReadingIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | JalopinionsOffEnglishSuggested ReadingFrom October 25-26, LA will see a number of events happening either at the same time, or right after each other. Things kick off on the evening of the 26, when the Dodgers face the New York Yankees in game one of the World Series at Dodger Stadium. Later that same night, the Lakers face the Phoenix Suns at the Crypto.com Arena downtown. Over at USC’s Coliseum, the Trojans will be facing off against Rutgers. Mind you, all these events will be happening mere miles from each other; the Coliseum is just six miles from Dodger Stadium for instance. Things don’t stop there.Over in Inglewood, the SoFi Stadium will host two high school football games and just a half mile from that, Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour is having a concert at the Intuit Dome. Just over a mile from there, the Electric Light Orchestra is having a concert at the Kia Forum.In anticipation of all these events, LA’s ABC 7 reports city officials announced they’re coordinating to help make things go smoother for everyone. Mayor Karen Bass said she’s coordinating with agencies like the LAPD for help with traffic and safety.“Ahead of the World Series tomorrow, we’re working to make sure the city is safe, that traffic is minimized, and that visitors and Angelenos alike are able to enjoy the many attractions, culture, food and neighborhoods that make L.A. an iconic international destination,” Bass said Friday during a news conference at City Hall.Bass is also advising people to take advantage of public transit. As Bass points out, it’s both cheaper and helps to ease up traffic on local freeways. “...there is a fast, easy and affordable way to avoid all the traffic, which is to go LA Metro,” she said.Seriously though if you live in the area and aren’t going to these events, avoid it at all costs. Speaking as a Southern California native, it will take you hours to get home, especially if you live inland; it can easily be a three or nearly four hour trek.",
