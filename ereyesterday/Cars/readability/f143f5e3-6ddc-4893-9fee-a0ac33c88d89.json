  "description": "Update to seven-seat SUV follows similar changes made by JLR to the Defender and Discovery ranges Land Rover has updated the Discovery Sport again, following changes to the larger Discovery and the Defender. The middle-rung Dynamic SE and range-topping Dynamic HSE trims have been replaced by new grades named Landmark and Metropolitan, while the entry-level S has become the Dynamic S. There are also new option packages aimed at visits to the beach, road trips and snowy weather. The Landmark is distinguished by a mountain-range logo on its treadplates and projected by its puddle lights. It brings kit including a sliding and reclining second row of seats, a panoramic glass roof and a 3D camera for manoeuvres in tight spaces. The Metropolitan, identifiable by its silver front grille, builds on the Landmark's specification with the addition of 14-way adjustable heated and cooled seats, a 14-speaker Meridian sound system and 20in alloy wheels. The Dynamic S meanwhile receives visual tweaks including a gloss-black finish for the wheel arches, lower body siding and front grille. The powertrain line-up remains the same as before: mild-hybrid four-cylinder diesel engines with outputs of 160bhp and 201bhp; and a petrol-engined plug-in hybrid with 265bhp and 36 miles of electric-only range. Prices start at £45,440 for the Dynamic S with the lesser diesel engine and reach £59,545 for the Metropolitan PHEV.",
