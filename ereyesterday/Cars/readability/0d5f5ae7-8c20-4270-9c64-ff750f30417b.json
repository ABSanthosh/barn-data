  "text": "HomeNewsAuthorities rescued 163 workers living in inhumane conditions, prompting BYD to sever ties with its construction partner.Brazilian authorities have halted construction of a BYD electric vehicle (EV) factory in Brazil’s Bahia state after rescuing 163 Chinese workers from what they described as “slavery-like conditions.” The workers were employed by Jinjiang Construction Brazil Ltd., a subcontractor hired to build the plant for the Chinese EV manufacturer.The Labor Prosecutor’s Office reported that workers were subjected to dire living conditions, had their passports confiscated and 60% of their wages withheld. Following the report, BYD terminated its relationship with Jinjiang Construction and vowed to safeguard subcontracted workers’ rights.On Friday, Brazilian authorities suspended the issuance of temporary work visas for BYD. In their report, the Labor Prosecutor’s Office said that workers were being brought to Brazil irregularly and were victims of human trafficking.A pattern of exploitationThe investigation uncovered numerous labor abuses, including overcrowded accommodations with inadequate facilities. One dormitory reportedly had only one bathroom for 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. daily to prepare for a 5:30 a.m. departure to the worksite.Living conditions for workers at BYD construction site.Brazil Labor Prosecutor's OfficeOther allegations included wage withholding and unreasonable cost deductions. Workers who resigned before completing six months of work left without pay because the company would deduct the cost of airfare to and from Brazil. One individual suffered an accident after working 25 consecutive days. Authorities have shut down the accommodations until they meet regulatory standards.BYD reviewed conditions weeks before site closureIn a statement, BYD said that it had conducted a “detailed review” of the working and living conditions at the site in the past few weeks and requested on “several occasions” that Jinjiang Construction make improvements.Living conditions for workers at BYD construction siteBrazil Labor Prosecutor's OfficeBYD expressed regret over the situation and emphasized its commitment to Brazilian labor laws and workers’ rights. “BYD Auto do Brasil reiterates its commitment to full compliance with Brazilian legislation, especially with regard to the protection of workers’ rights and human dignity,” said Alexandre Baldy, senior vice president of BYD Brazil. The company has relocated workers to hotels and promised to protect the rights of subcontracted workers.Li Yunfei, a spokesperson for BYD, was far more critical of the Labor Prosecutor’s Office report. In a statement posted Thursday on his Weibo social media site account, the spokesperson wrote “In the matter of smearing Chinese brands, smearing China, and attempting to undermine the friendship between China and Brazil, we have seen how relevant foreign forces maliciously associate and deliberately smear.”Final thoughtsThe Bahia plant is slated to open next year, but it’s not clear if the current construction halt will change that. Brazil is a significant market for BYD, with over 66,000 electric and hybrid vehicles sold in the country this year. However, worker abuse casts a shadow over the company’s operations and raises questions about its oversight of subcontractors.For BYD, rebuilding trust with Brazilian authorities and the public will be critical as it moves forward with its ambitious plans in South America.",
