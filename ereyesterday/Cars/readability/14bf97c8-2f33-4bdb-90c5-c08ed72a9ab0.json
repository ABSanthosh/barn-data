  "text": "An aftermarket exhaust system has also been added to the 6.5-liter V12 May 21, 2025 at 21:14 by Brad Anderson This Lamborghini Revuelto looks like a concept car, but it’s a very real creation. Key upgrades include a massive rear wing and an aggressively styled rear diffuser. The heavily customized supercar was recently listed for sale at nearly $780,000. Even when an Italian supercar like the Lamborghini Revuelto already looks like it escaped from a designer’s unfiltered imagination, you can count on aftermarket tuners to turn dial it even further. Creative Bespoke has done exactly that with this particular Revuelto. And while some might be into it, the result leans more Mansory than Modena. That’s not exactly a compliment, by the way. In building this Raging Bull, Creative Bespoke clearly approached this Revuelto with one goal in mind: make it louder, flashier, and as unapologetically over-the-top as possible. For starters, the whole thing is painted in a blinding shade of green, which might actually glow under moonlight. It’s not subtle. Then come the custom body pieces, most of which are rendered in carbon fiber for maximum visual drama. Read: This Just Might Be Lamborghini’s Craziest Color Yet While there’s little doubt that Lamborghini will tweak the car’s body and aerodynamics with subsequent variants, perhaps including an SV and SVJ, it should be able to come up with something a little more tasteful. Up front, this car includes an extended splitter that’s been paint matched to complement the rest of the body. Below the headlights, you’ll find even more green accents, just in case you forgot what color the car was. A redesigned hood features large air extraction vents and carbon fiber gills along the sides. Aero fins are bolted to the front splitter and mirrored behind the front wheels, creating the visual equivalent of shouting. Other changes include new side skirts and a set of black and green wheels from Brixton Forged. Found at the rear, is a massive wing with supports that sit on either side of the engine cover. The rear fascia has also been overhauled with new diffuser strakes that double as red LEDs. A catback exhaust has also been added. Sold Before the Carbon Cooled Surprisingly, the Lambo didn’t stay on the market long. After Creative Bespoke finished the build, it was listed for $779,800, which is about $170,000 over the Revuelto’s base price. Questionable styling choices aside, it seems someone was more than happy to pay the premium. Well, what can we say. There’s clearly no shortage of wealthy folks lining up to spend extra just to make their Lamborghini look like it went twelve rounds with a carbon fiber warehouse, and came out second best.",
