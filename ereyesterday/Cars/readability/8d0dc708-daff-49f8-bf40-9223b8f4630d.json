  "description": "We drove the Audi RS Q8 Performance in Spain a few months back, and after sampling it in the city, on the highway, and a few hot laps around a racetrack, it was clear that it is simply brilliant in almost everything it does. Now, it has finally arrived on home soil and has been launched at a price of Rs 2.49 crore. While the price bump is not much, performance has surely taken a big leap. So, does it do enough to carry the ‘perfect performance car for India’ tag? Audi RS Q8 Performance exterior design 23-inch wheels Subtlety is what you get with almost every car with the four rings; however, this RS Q8 takes things up a notch. The chilly red paint pops and makes heads turn and highlights the lines and curves. Add the optional 23-inch wheels, especially in this shade that gets a tinge of gold, and it is clear that this Audi does not want to lie low in a crowd. LED Matrix headlamps get customisable daytime running lamp signatures. The rear gets big oval tail pipes that stand out, and LED tail-lamps that stretch end-to-end. Also, while its competition peppers their performance models with badges all over, the RS Q8 gets only one red rhombus at the rear. Audi RS Q8 Performance interior design While you can make the exterior dramatic, you can’t do much with the interior. Sure, thanks to the Q8 and its luxuries, quality levels are excellent, but there isn’t enough done for the RS badge. You get red stitching for the seats, seat belts and headrests, and the ambient lighting gets three colour options – green, blue and grey. The steering is round and simple – the chunky flat-bottom one we like is an optional extra – and the seats, although sporty, are soft and comfortable. They do get heating, ventilation and massage options. Although quality levels are excellent, the interior lacks drama. There is no dedicated physical RS button but you do get a fair bit of customisation options once you dig into the touchscreen. Also, since it is based on the Q8, there is no dearth of space in the rear and three adults can be seated in comfort. Big boot, no spare wheel It gets a sizeable boot as well, but you do miss a spare wheel. So those big 23 inchers will have to be looked after. RS Q8 Performance has a boot capacity of 605 litres.   Audi RS Q8 Performance engine and gearbox 640hp and 850Nm Powering the RS Q8 Performance is the same 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 as before but it now makes 640hp and 850Nm. The 40hp bump is the result of increased boost pressure, repositioning of the catalytic converter and a lighter sports exhaust. Sounds gibberish? Just know that at no point will you feel its lugging over two tonnes. 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 produces 40hp more than before.   0-100kph in 3.6 secs Acceleration is rapid with 0-100kph coming up in just 3.6 seconds, and it goes on to hit a top speed of 250kph (limited). Remove that, and you can stretch it to 305kph. The numbers and sense of speed are both incredible but the most adored feature will be the exhaust note. In an age of spacecraft sounds from electric motors, a good ol’ V8 rumble is music to the ears. Drive modes change character The drive experience can be altered based on the drive mode, with Dynamic giving you the best performance. However, the RS Q8 has always been liked for its duality, and in Comfort mode, you can see why. The engine is subdued, the suspension is softened, the steering loses most of its heft and it almost becomes a regular Q8. There is also an individual mode to customise the setting to your taste and an ‘All-road’ mode for some trail driving. The drive modes help bring out the duality in RS Q8's nature.   Extra 90mm of ground clearance The RS Q8 Performance also gets an ‘Off-Road’ mode that raises the suspension to its maximum and adds an extra 90mm to the ground clearance. It provides interesting data on the screen, too. But, who in their right mind will take an RS Q8 out into the wilderness? Audi RS Q8 Performance ride, handling and braking While you can clear small boulders thanks to its form factor, the most it will ever see is a dug up city road, and for that, the suspension is commendable. In Comfort, the hard edges from low-speed bumps are absorbed well, and while you do move about in the cabin, it isn’t a jarring experience. The movement is less over dusty trails and at moderate speeds and the ride is much better compared to its rivals. The ride quality is commendable, especially in comfort mode. Master of corners Where the RS Q8 Performance truly shines is in the corners. The level of grip from the Quattro sport differential and the massive tyres makes it impossible to feel nervous behind the wheel. It can carry much higher speeds into corners and you can exit totally stable with full power. Then there is active roll stabilisation – it uses a motor between the axles that disconnect the two halves in a straight line to reduce side-to-side movement, but link them up as soon as the corners arrive. This ensures stability as the chassis is controlled via electronics to stay as flat as possible. On a winding mountain road, the RS Q8 feels more like a hot hatch and not a big heavy SUV, and that is its biggest win. Grip is impressive around corners, thanks to Quattro sport differential and massive tyres.   Carbon ceramic brakes are standard fitment The rapid power delivery and high-speed cornering is backed by solid braking power – 420mm carbon ceramics up front and 370mm ones at the rear are standard fitment on the RS Q8 Performance. Sure, they take a tad longer to warm up than conventional steel brakes, but once up to temperature, there is superb brake bite and absolutely no fade after a hot downhill session. Audi RS Q8 Performance price and verdict Rs 2.49 crore before options At Rs 2.49 crore, the RS Q8 Performance is one hell of a performance car. Sure, by the time you tick some options and ensure you have a one-off that number will be over RS 3 crore, but it’s not a bad price for what it offers. With its loud and powerful engine, striking exterior and incredible driving manners, it’s got all the makings of a perfect supercar; however, the Q in its name makes it the perfect supercar for India.
