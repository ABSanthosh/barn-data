  "text": "Northvolt's financial troubles could zap future EV plans for both Porsche and Audi 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Northvolt’s bankruptcy could disrupt electric vehicle timelines, including models from Audi and Porsche. A report suggests the upcoming Porsche 718 EV could be delayed by battery issues and/or a powertrain problem. Audi’s PPE-based electric vehicles are also reliant on Northvolt batteries, but backup suppliers mitigate risks. In a major setback for Europe’s push to cut reliance on Chinese battery suppliers, Swedish battery maker Northvolt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US last month. The move is aimed at restructuring its debt and securing new funding. While the process is expected to be completed by early next year, the company has said it will be business as usual for the time being. Behind the scenes, however, Handelsblatt is reporting that several automakers may have to delay future models due to problems at Northvolt. The upcoming all-electric Porsche 718 replacement is rumored to be one of the victims and it might miss its intended launch of late next year. More: Porsche 718 Boxster EV Shows More Details As It Nears Production When reached for comment, a spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the rumor. Instead, they told the publication they can’t comment on supplier issues. While Porsche is staying tight-lipped, it appears the company is heavily dependent on Northvolt batteries and their high energy density. This is important for sports cars as they’ll enable weight savings through the use of smaller battery packs. Interestingly, it appears the electric 718 is also facing other issues. In particular, an unknown “component in the drivetrain” is said to be causing problems and this, alone, could also result in a delay. Porsche isn’t the only one that could be impacted as Audi also has a deal with Northvolt. Their batteries will be used to power models based on the PPE platform including the A6 e-tron. However, Audi is also sourcing batteries from CATL and LG. This means the situation isn’t critical and the A6 e-tron wasn’t even slated to use Northvolt batteries until later. That’s fortunate as it means the company might be able to secure a new contract with another supplier, if needed. A lot of the blame is being placed on Northvolt founder Peter Carlsson, who ‘stepped aside’ as CEO following the bankruptcy. Rumors suggest he brought the “worst parts of Tesla’s corporate culture” to his new job and this resulted in “unrealistic schedules” as well as “overambitious goals.” That led to problems and BMW pulling out of a multi-billion dollar contract. It remains to be seen how everything will shake out, but European automakers are understandably nervous.",
