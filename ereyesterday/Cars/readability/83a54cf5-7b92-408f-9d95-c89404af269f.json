  "text": "The hottest version of the new CLA could feature three high-tech motors and more than 500 hp May 13, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier The 2026 Mercedes-AMG CLA has been spied wearing less camouflage than ever before. The high-performance sedan has a unique front bumper and an active rear spoiler. Reports have suggested the car could have a tri-motor powertrain with more than 500 hp. The new Mercedes CLA EV hasn’t even launched in many regions outside of Europe, including North America, yet development is already well underway for the upcoming AMG variant. As a debut nears, the camouflage is starting to come off and reveal more about the high-performance model. Starting up front, we can see a unique front bumper with large intakes. They’re joined by a new central opening, which features a unique mesh pattern. Additional details are hard to make out, but the model has a fully enclosed grille as well as starry headlights. More: Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 Could Be A 500+ HP EV With Fake V8 Sounds The styling makeover continues with sportier sides skirts and lightweight wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The latter are backed up by a beefy braking system, which sports red calipers up front. We can also see what appears to be AMG-specific badging on the front fender. The rear end doesn’t look too remarkable at first glance, but a closer inspection reveals an active spoiler. We can also expect a modified bumper and diffuser to help distinguish the AMG variant from the regular model. SHProshots Spy photographers didn’t get a good look inside, but the cabin should have a minimalist interior with a sport steering wheel and a handful of special touches. We can also expect a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14-inch infotainment system, and a 14-inch front passenger display. Mercedes has been tight-lipped about powertrain details, but previous reports have suggested the car will have axial flux motors developed by Mercedes’ Yasa subsidiary. There could be a total of three motors altogether, giving the car a combined output in excess of 500 hp (373 kW / 507 PS). Also: The New Mercedes CLA EV Can Only Use 800V DC Fast Chargers That should put it in direct competition with the Tesla Model 3 Performance, which delivers 510 hp and a 0-60 mph time of 2.9 seconds, along with a top speed of 163 mph (262 km/h). Rumors have also suggested the AMG variant will have a unique battery pack and a “V8 Mode.” The latter reportedly replicates the sound of a roaring V8, as even Mercedes appears to be acknowledging that’s what people actually want.
