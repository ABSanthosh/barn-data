It is finished in Grigio Silverstone over Cuoio leather with black Alcantara inserts and is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 mated to a six-speed F1 automated transaxle with an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The car is further equipped with Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, yellow-finished brake calipers, and 19″ split-spoke wheels as well as power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. This F430 is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the owner with manufacturer’s literature and a clean California title in the name of the owner and their business. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Grigio Silverstone and wears Scuderia Ferrari fender shields. Xenon headlights, side air intakes, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser are further details. Split five-spoke 19″ wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires measuring 235/35 up front and 295/35 at the rear. Braking is handled by yellow-finished brake calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors. The seller reports that all four tires were recently replaced. The power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats are upholstered in Cuoio leather with black Alcantara inserts, which extends to the door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals and carbon-fiber sill plates as well as a CD stereo, automatic climate control, and power windows and door locks. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 4,900 miles, approximately 2,200 of which have been added during current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. An entry on October 27, 2021, notes a 2,270-mile reading and is followed by another line item on the same date showing a 4,540-mile figure. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates.
