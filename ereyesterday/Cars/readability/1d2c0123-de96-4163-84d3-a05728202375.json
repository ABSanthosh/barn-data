  "description": "Chinese firm Great Wall Motor follows up Ora electric supermini with mid-sized hybrid crossover The Haval Jolion Pro is now on sale in the UK – which will probably come as a surprise to you, so quietly has this Chinese brand arrived. To be fair, it isn’t technically a brand here (unlike in Australia, where incredibly it outsold Volkswagen in 2024). Instead, it’s a sub-brand of GWM, like Ora, which makes the 03 electric supermini – previously known in infamy as the Funky Cat.So to be clear, GWM is the brand, and Ora and Haval models are set to be joined in UK showrooms by more of their Chinese siblings in due course. All went quiet on the Wey front long ago, but perhaps you might fancy a Tank or a Poer…?Yeah, GWM’s marketing strategy is confused. Or maybe the blame for that lies with International Motors, the Brummie firm that also handles UK imports for Isuzu, Subaru and Xpeng.But either way, we’re here to find out whether the Jolion Pro is a car that can speak for itself.",

Verdict Not irredeemable but doesn’t really impress in any regard, even if it does heavily undercut established rivals. GoodCheaper than rivals to buyBadOutshone by rivals in every area DESIGN \u0026 STYLING Pros Exterior doesn't look bad At 4470mm long and 1625mm tall, this is a medium-sized crossover that compares with the likes of the Kia Niro and Suzuki S-Cross.It’s being sold exclusively with a powertrain that comprises a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine with a meagre 94bhp and an electric motor with a healthier 147bhp.A two-speed transmission switches the system between series and parallel hybrid modes, while the battery is 1.8kWh.Pricing starts at just £23,995, undercutting those aforementioned rivals by £5000 – even though the long list of standard kit includes a 7.0in digital dial display, a 12.3in touchscreen, parking sensors, a 360deg camera, LED headlights, an electrically adjustable driver’s seat, adaptive cruise control and all of the ADAS.Weirdly not DAB radio, though. But you can use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto for that. INTERIOR Pros Materials don't feel nasty The interior is actually a fairly pleasant place to be. None of the materials feel nasty and there’s plenty of space in both the front and back.There are even some buttons, albeit not as many as I would like, given that the infotainment menus aren’t the easiest to navigate. Its graphical style looks outdated as well.Much more problematic is the boot capacity: a scant 255 litres, compared with more than 400 litres in all of its hybrid crossover rivals. ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE Pros Mode switching isn't clunky Cons Not the most aurally refined Those rivals are notably better to drive too. The Jolion Pro’s two power sources can provide a decent amount of punch and play together nicely, but the engine makes you pay for heavier throttle inputs with a loud, hairdryer-esque whirring. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING Pros It does in fact have a ride, and indeed handling... Cons ...but neither of them are very good It’s not hard to overwhelm the grip limits of the Kumho rubber.The ride is always busy as well, jostling you around on scruffy surfaces and thunking through potholes. And nor does the chassis offer either feelsome steering or confidence-inspiring handling. MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS Pros There's no dashboard button to lock it into EV mode Cons Rival hybrids offer notably better fuel economy My test drive wasn’t long enough for any reliable learnings about fuel economy, but plenty of other cars don’t need electrical assistance to achieve its official 47.0mpg, while the MG ZS Hybrid+ offers 55mpg. VERDICT Verdict Not irredeemable but doesn’t really impress in any regard, even if it does heavily undercut established rivals. GoodCheaper than rivals to buyBadOutshone by rivals in every area It’s coincidental, I’m sure, but the Jolion Pro in essence feels like a Subaru Crosstrek without the off-road excellence – the one thing that really justifies choosing a Subaru these days.Ergo it’s mediocre at best in every area. It may be cheap, and its rivals may not be jaw-droppers, but the satisfaction of life with a superior product would surely be worth the extra outlay.
