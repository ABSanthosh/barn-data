  "description": "Bucking the trend of rushing into SUVs, Tata Motors will launch its Avinya luxury electric brand with a Sportback and follow that up with an SUV. Speaking to Autocar India at Auto Expo 2025, Martin Uhlarik, head of Global Design at Tata Motors, said, “The Avinya concept we showcased two years ago is a manifesto, but it will be the first product to launch and will be a Sportback – a 5-door, very low and very dynamic.”  The description is similar to what the first concept was all about, and Uhlarik says the design of the Sportback \"is finished in the design department, and the car will arrive next year.\" Uhlarik also described it as a 'real brand builder,' indicating that the focus for Tata Motors is to grab eyeballs with its first product and set the tone and shape of its new luxury electric brand. While the car may sport a non-mainstream body style, our sources indicate that the company plans a production run of an appreciable 24,000 units per annum. Luxury SUV to follow  Following the Avinya Sportback will be an SUV based on the Avinya X concept shown at this year’s Auto Expo. Uhlarik described it as a ‘brand pillar’, possibly signifying its larger potential given its more traditional SUV body style. Our sources tell us that the SUV will sit near the top of the five currently planned Avinya models, with a 3-row version occupying the top step. All cars, including the Sportback and SUV, would be built on JLR’s EMA platform. Our sources tell us that beyond these three products, the company is also working on two more body styles: a smaller SUV around the 4.4-metre mark and a larger 4.9-metre luxury UV, similar to the Volvo EM90 MPV.
