  "description": "It has been over two years since Triumph launched its all new Tiger 1200 in India and the company has now rolled out an updated version in our market. Focus on improved refinement Reduced seat height options The new Tiger 1200 was a big departure from the older model in its shift from the previous super smooth three cylinder motor to a more gruff T-Plane configuration. Like with the Tiger 900, this T-plane three cylinder engine was more characterful with a more torquey nature, but it brought increased vibrations. Triumph’s first big updates for its 1200 Tiger are mostly around improving refinement and comfort. The 1,160cc engine produces the same 150hp and 130Nm, but it receives changes to the crankshaft, alternator and balancer shaft, besides some engine calibration changes. Triumph says that these changes have resulted in smoother low rpm torque delivery. An updated clutch is also said to enable a smoother selection of first gear.  While Triumph says that engine changes have reduced vibrations, the standard GT Pro and Rally Pro also get the damped handlebars and risers from the Explorer variants. The seats have also been reprofiled with a flatter shape to liberate more space for the rider. An accessory low seat reduces the position by 20mm, taking it down to 830mm on the GT Pro and 855mm on the Rally Pro. A new Active Preload Reduction feature is now available across the range which reduces the rear suspension preload as the Tiger 1200 slows to a stop, lowering the seat height by up to 20mm. The GT Pro and GT Explorer models will now have more cornering clearance, thanks to repositioned footpegs that have been moved higher up and closer in towards the bike. Prices have risen marginally by around Rs 19,000, with the Tiger 1200 range now starting at Rs 19.39 lakh ex-showroom for the GT Pro. The Rally Pro starts at Rs 20.38 lakh, while the Tiger 1200 GT Explorer costs Rs 20.88 lakh and the Rally Explorer costs 21.88 lakh.  Also see: 2024 Triumph Tiger 900 GT review: Better but not perfect Triumph Tiger Sport 800 revealed, likely to replace Tiger 850 Sport",
