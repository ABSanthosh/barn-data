It is finished in Structural Blue over Amalfi White and blue leather and is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a power-retractable blue soft top, an adaptive variable suspension, 21″ forged wheels, Triple-Beam LED headlights, a head-up display, navigation, a Mark Levinson audio system, and heated and ventilated front seats. Acquired by the seller in 2022, this LC500 is now offered in Virginia with a Zero Halliburton luggage set, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Structural Blue and features a power-retractable blue soft top. Additional details include Triple-Beam LED headlights, auto-dimming and heated side mirrors, a blind-spot monitoring system, a rearview camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Close-up photos of the paintwork and trim are presented in the gallery. Polished 21″ forged wheels have black accents and are mounted with 245/40 front and 275/35 rear Bridgestone Potenza S001L Run-Flat tires. The car rides on an adaptive variable suspension, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with ventilated rotors and Lexus-branded calipers. The 2+2 cabin features heated and ventilated 10-way power-adjustable front seats upholstered in Amalfi White and blue semi-aniline leather as well as Inspiration Series-branded carbon-fiber sill plates. Additional amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, a wind deflector, a head-up display, an analog clock, a 13-speaker Mark Levinson surround sound system, and 10.3″ touchscreen infotainment with navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. A label affixed to the left door jam identifies this LC500 as #24 of 100 Inspiration Series models produced for 2021. The heated leather-wrapped steering wheel features magnesium paddle shifters and frames a central tachometer, a digital speedometer, and supplementary displays. The car is equipped with driving aids such as a pre-collision system, dynamic radar cruise control, and lane-keep assist. The odometer indicates 2,800 miles, approximately 1,900 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8 was factory rated at 471 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in November 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with an Active Sport exhaust system. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Germain Lexus of Naples, Florida, and shows factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $121,105. A Zero Halliburton luggage set and service records will also accompany the car. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
