  "text": "Besides the Ioniq 9, we can expect to see the Volkswagen Tiguan as well as the facelifted Kia EV6 November 13, 2024 at 19:24 by Michael Gauthier The Los Angeles Auto Show kicks off next week and it looks like we can expect debuts from Fiat, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Porsche, and Volkswagen. Highlights are slated to include the Hyundai Ioniq 9 as well as the US-spec Volkswagen Tiguan. They could be joined by the facelifted Kia EV6 as well as a special edition Fiat 500. With the SEMA Show firmly in the rearview mirror, we can turn our attention to the Los Angeles Auto Show. It kicks off on November 21 and will feature a handful of debuts. While most automakers are keeping details under wraps, a schedule suggests we can expect news from Fiat, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Porsche, and Volkswagen. There may also be some debuts from other Stellantis brands – perhaps the facelifted Ram 2500 and 3500 – but that remains unclear. More: Hyundai Ioniq 9 3-Row EV Shows Production Front End In New Teaser Hyundai will use the show to introduce the Ioniq 9, which has been spied and teased countless times already. The three-row electric crossover will debut at 12:10 pm ET and be joined by the Initium concept. Sister company Genesis will also have a debut at the event, though they’ve remained tight-lipped about what it will be. Volkswagen’s debut is rumored to be the US-spec Tiguan, which will have a lot in common with the Tayron that was introduced in October. However, at the time, the automaker said the “U.S. Tiguan will receive the long-wheelbase setup of this model” as well as unique sheet metal, equipment, and powertrain options. Euro-Spec VW Tayron The other introductions are more mysterious, but Fiat will presumably introduce a special edition 500. However, the company has previously said the Grande Panda is “being studied” for North America, so maybe we’ll get a surprise. Over at Kia, we could see the updated EV6. That remains to be seen, but the facelifted model made its global debut in May and its Korean counterpart, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, will arrive at U.S. dealers before the end of the year. There’s less certainty about Ford and Porsche, but the Blue Oval recently introduced the redesigned Expedition and facelifted Bronco Sport. Porsche could show the new Taycan GTS or perhaps another version of the facelifted 911.",
