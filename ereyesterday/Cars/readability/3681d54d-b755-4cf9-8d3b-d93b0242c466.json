  "text": "Tesla is now offering an interior upgrade for the new Model 3 and Model Y that was previously limited to the Model Y Launch Series. For a couple hundred dollars, the manufacturer will install charcoal “vegan suede” along the top of the dashboard. The option is a recent addition to the online Tesla Shop and will be installed at Tesla Service Centers. Pricing is set at $250 in the United States or $345 if you’re using Canadian money. Interestingly, the option seems to have launched in Canada shortly before making its way to the U.S.Tesla is promising a factory-grade component that should match the rest of the interior perfectly. The manufacturer described it as changing “the aesthetic styling of your dashboard with a refined look.” With the company’s interiors being notoriously minimalist, this may be a nice way of adding some character while giving it a more-cozy vibe and dash of luxury. It may not technically be a premium material. But faux/vegan suede (or Alcantara) has become synonymous with luxury and performance vehicles as it gradually replaced authentic leather suede. As an added bonus, the material will reflect less light back against the windshield — likely improving forward visibility under certain conditions. While you could absolutely install something like this yourself with a little patience, most would be hard pressed to do it for cheaper than Tesla is asking. There are numerous aftermarket companies offering faux suede kits, some of which cover even more of the vehicle’s interior. However, not all kits are created equal and the time commitment for installing them would likely cancel out any money saved by installing at home. If you’re someone who truly enjoys the idea of tackling that particular modification or just wants to see more fake suede in more places, do your own thing. But we expect most interested parties to simply have Tesla jazz up the interior themselves. Frankly, the only real drawback are claims that vegan suede produces a surplus of microplastics as the material breaks down. But this is hardly something that’s limited to any singular manufacturer and an issue that may be overblown without there being a surplus of long-term studies to back up those assertions. Regardless, this is probably a smart move from the perspective of the manufacturer. The material itself isn’t particularly expensive, particularly when bought in bulk, allowing Tesla to pre-cut and ship the requisite pieces to service centers to be installed by someone who has had some practice. Our guess is that it’ll see a fair number of takers, helping to pad the automaker’s profit margins. [Images: Tesla]Become a TTAC insider.
