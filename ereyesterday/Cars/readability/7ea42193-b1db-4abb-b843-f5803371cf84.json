It is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Bianco Avus over Sand leather upholstery. Equipment includes a black convertible soft top, 19″ Challenge alloy wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, carbon-ceramic brakes, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, Capristo exhaust headers, power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, navigation, a wind deflector, a Bose sound system, a gated shifter, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. This F430 Spider has 15k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, a battery charger, a Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Bianco Avus and features a power-retractable black soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a carbon-fiber rear grille insert, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser. The right-inner taillight was replaced in 2021, at which time the mechanism for the soft top was adjusted. An accident in October 2008 is noted on the Carfax report, which also lists an inspection for prior damage in an October 2014 entry. The bumper covers were refinished under current ownership. The 19″ Challenge wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 285/35 rear Continental ExtremeContact tires showing 2013 and 2014 date codes. Braking is handled by yellow-finished brake calipers fitted over carbon-ceramic rotors. The power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats are upholstered in Sand leather. Black leather covers the dashboard, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, navigation, a wind deflector, a Bose sound system, a gated shifter, and power windows and locks. The interior buttons were refinished under current ownership. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 15k miles. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. Capristo exhaust headers have been fitted, and the vehicle was most recently serviced at Ferrari Ft. Lauderdale in March 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Algar Ferrari of Philadelphia along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total suggested price of $256,815. The Carfax report notes the aforementioned damage and inspection. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
