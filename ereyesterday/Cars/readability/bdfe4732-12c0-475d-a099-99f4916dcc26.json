Equipment includes a Howell fuel-injection system, 15″ aftermarket wheels, a bikini-style soft top, a receiver hitch, and an aftermarket swing-out spare tire carrier. Now showing 160k miles, this CJ-7 was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is offered with service records and a clean Colorado title. The truck has been repainted tan with Renegade-style decals, and equipment includes a bikini-style soft top, a receiver hitch, and an aftermarket spare tire carrier with a high-lift jack and jerry cans. The 15″ aftermarket wheels are mounted with 31×10.5″ General Grabber tires. Braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The front bucket seats wear tan aftermarket covers. Appointments include an aftermarket center console, Pyle speakers, and a roll bar. The truck is not equipped with a stereo. The steering wheel fronts an 85-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, voltage, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 160k miles. The 258ci inline-six is equipped with a Howell fuel-injection system and an aftermarket camshaft. A fluid drip is noted. Power is routed to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a Richmond limited-slip rear differential. The clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel were replaced approximately 1k miles ago, according to the selling dealer. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
