The Honda 0 Series SUV concept is here - and it looks set to change its maker forever. Everything from its platform and body to the way it's manufactured is brand new, and its on-board technology is totally unlike anything we've seen before - even from a company that has been making humanoid robots since 2000. That being said, this is an electric SUV that is trying to compete in a hugely crowded market space, therefore it has to be exceptional if it's to win your attention.
