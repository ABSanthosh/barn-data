  "description": "Jeep has revealed the first official images of the next-gen Cherokee ahead of its full debut later this year. Marking the return of the Cherokee nameplate - discontinued in 2023 after a decade-long production run - the SUV will slot between the Compass and Grand Cherokee in Jeep’s global line-up. New-gen Jeep Cherokee breaks cover with new design language Hybrid powertrain confirmed for the new Cherokee; petrol and EV versions likely coming too Jeep will fully reveal the new Cherokee later in 2025, with global launch set for 2026 New Jeep Cherokee design details The new-gen Cherokee adheres to Jeep’s latest design language - also seen on the recently-revealed third-gen Compass. Up front, the new Cherokee gets the hallmark Jeep seven-slot grille, flanked by large rectangular headlights with extended sections for the indicators. The front bumper features an abundance of black plastic cladding, with an air dam at the bottom and silver inserts on either side. Moving to the side reveals new alloy wheels, more plastic cladding, ‘Cherokee’ lettering on the front doors, and a blacked-out roof and pillars. Jeep has not released any images of the new Cherokee’s rear end, but it’s expected to prominently feature a large rectangular light bar, much like that of the latest Compass. Interior and features yet to be fully revealed Jeep also looks to be saving interior shots of the new Cherokee for the SUV’s full reveal later in the year. Despite that, the Cherokee expected to include a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, three-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel, all-digital instrument cluster, and a recessed touchbar for the climate controls. New Jeep Cherokee powertrains Hybrid setup confirmed The new Cherokee leverages Stellantis’ new STLA Large platform, which allows for hybrid, petrol, and all-electric configurations. Jeep has only confirmed a hybrid powertrain for the Cherokee right now, with precise details under wraps. Pure-petrol and EV versions will likely join the Cherokee line-up as well. The latter powertrain could share its mechanicals with the Wagoneer S electric SUV - a 100kWh battery, dual-motor setup. However, the output will expectedly be lower than the Wagoneer S' 600hp. Coming to the petrol Cherokee, it could use a version of Jeep’s 3.0-litre ‘Hurricane’ twin-turbo inline-6 engine, which develops 548hp and 707Nm in its most potent state of tune. New Jeep Cherokee launch details Launching in 2026 for overseas markets As mentioned previously, the new Jeep Cherokee will be fully unveiled later in 2025, with global market launches expected to begin in 2026. An India launch for the new Cherokee is unlikely. Also see: Jeep Wrangler Willys ’41 Edition sold out in India Jeep Compass Sandstorm Edition launched at Rs 19.49 lakh",
