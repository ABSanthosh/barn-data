  "text": "GM believed it had purged all faulty door strikers but some stock had been retained at a warehouse in Mexico 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Chevy has issued a recall for 2025 Blazer and Equinox EVs due to defective door components. Weak door strikers may fracture, potentially causing doors to open unexpectedly during driving. GM initially recalled several vehicles for the same fault in December 2023 but has now expanded it. Hundreds of 2025 Chevrolet Blazer, Blazer EV, and Equinox EV models a part of a recall across the U.S. over a critical safety issue: doors that could unexpectedly open while driving or during a crash. Safe to say, having your doors swing open mid-commute isn’t exactly a feature anyone’s asking for. The good news? GM reports that none of these vehicles have left dealership lots yet. GM has confirmed that the vehicles in question were fitted with door strikers sourced from Brano Group A.S., which were not properly heat-treated to meet the carmaker’s hardness specifications. The result? These strikers could crack under pressure, allowing the doors to swing open when you least expect it, significantly raising the risk of injury to anyone inside. Read: 2024 Chevy Blazer EV And Other GM SUVs Recalled Over Unexpected Door Openings A total of 731 vehicles in the U.S. are affected by the recall. That breaks down to 513 Blazers built between August 30, 2024, and September 6, 2024, 215 Blazer EV models from the same production window, and 3 Equinox EVs manufactured between September 4, 2024, and September 5, 2024. If you’ve got one of these on order, you might want to double-check that delivery date. Chevrolet was first alerted to a potential issue on September 6, 2024, when a quality engineer at GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico saw a door striker fracture during routine side door adjustment. This isn’t GM’s first rodeo with faulty door strikers on these models. Back in late December 2023, the Blazer, Blazer EV, and Equinox EV were also recalled over the same issue. At the time, GM thought that it had purged all of the faulty door strikers from their supply. However, it turns out not all of the suspect stock was removed from a warehouse used by the Mexican plant, leading to the installation of several hundred faulty strikers in new vehicles. Fortunately, GM is not aware of any field incidents related to the defect. None of the 731 affected vehicles in the U.S.—nor the additional 124 units in Canada and Mexico—have been delivered to customers yet. Dealers have been instructed to replace all four side door strikers and attaching bolts with new properly treated parts before these vehicles ever reach showrooms.",
