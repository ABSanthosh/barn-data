This 992 GT3 Touring was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered in New York with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in paint-to-sample Superior Red Metallic and was optioned with the Touring Package in Black, which added black window trim and rear Porsche lettering as well as a revised decklid with a mesh grille and a retractable rear spoiler in place of the raised wing found on the standard GT3. Additional details include LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, a rear fog light, a backup camera, rear parking sensors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Goodyear tires. Stopping power is provided by dimpled and ventilated discs at each corner, and the car is equipped with rear-axle steering. A brake fluid flush was performed in July 2024. The Exclusive Manufaktur Leather Interior features heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats trimmed in Bordeaux, while black leather covers the upper portions of the dashboard and door panels. Carpeted floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management infotainment with navigation, a Bose sound system, illuminated door sill guards, aluminum pedals, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual adjustable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 1,100 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. An oil change was performed and the spark plugs were replaced in July 2024. The window sticker shows factory colors, options, and a total price of $204,160. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
