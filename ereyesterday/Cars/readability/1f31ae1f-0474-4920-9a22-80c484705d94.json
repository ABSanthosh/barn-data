  "description": "This 2024 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was purchased new by the owner and was ordered with approximately $87k in options, some of which include a paint-to-sample Olive Green exterior finish, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, and the Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. The car has 767 miles and is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential. The aftermarket inserts have been fitted to the door panels and carbon-fiber full bucket seats, and the car is further equipped with LED headlights with PDLS, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, 20\" and 21\" forged lightweight magnesium wheels, a front-axle lift system, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management. This 992 GT3 RS is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with the owner's manual, a build sheet, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the current owner's name.",

This 992 GT3 RS is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with the owner’s manual, a build sheet, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the current owner’s name. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. The CFRP panels are finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave on Weissach Package-equipped cars. This example is finished in paint-to-sample Olive Green, and additional details include LED headlights with PDLS, rear parking sensors, a rear fog light, a backup camera, Exclusive Design taillights, auto-dimming mirrors, puddle light projectors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Paint protection film and a ceramic coating have been applied to the body, per the seller. Bronze-finished lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear center-lock wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with black-finished calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering, a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The door panels and carbon-fiber full bucket seats have received aftermarket patterned inserts, and the black leather-trimmed seats feature “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests and green stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, steering column, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, ambient lighting, Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a centering stripe and drive-mode selector dials, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 767 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) Plus.
