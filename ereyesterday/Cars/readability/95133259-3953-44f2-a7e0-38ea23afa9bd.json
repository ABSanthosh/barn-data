  "description": "For the 911 GT3’s 25th anniversary, Porsche has updated the hardcore model’s exterior and added more options. It’s also said to offer a “more exhilarating” drive.  Updated 911 GT3’s gearboxes get shorter final drive ratio Gets new Matrix LED headlights, larger front air intake The updated Porsche 911 GT3 gets mechanical tweaks that include revised cylinder heads, sharper camshafts from the GT3 RS, improved oil coolers and new throttle valves that enhance flow. It also complies with the latest emission norms in markets abroad as it gets two particulate filters and four catalytic converters. Porsche claims the 911 GT3 will still deliver “a gripping soundscape”. The flat-six still produces 510hp and 450Nm, still revs to 9,000rpm and still sends power via either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearboxes. In manual form, the claimed 0-100kph time is 3.9 seconds, while with the automatic, that shortens to 3.4 seconds. However, both gearboxes have had their final drive ratio shortened by 8 percent. Porsche has also tuned the dampers to improve control over bumps and kerbs. Further, the anti-dive system has been tweaked to reduce forward pitch while braking even more. The updated 911 GT3 Touring, which does not get that large rear wing and is more road-focussed, get optional rear seats. This requires the fitment of carbon-fibre front seats with a folding backrest, to provide access to the rear seats. Two-seater Touring models can still be specced with plusher 18-way adjustable sports seats. The optional rear seats on the Touring. Subtle updates can be seen on the front and rear, which include new Matrix LED headlights, a larger front air intake, and some aero elements for more downforce. While there’s no word on when the updated 911 GT3 will come to India, Porsche does have the previous 911 GT3 RS on sale here, priced at Rs 3.5 crore, ex-showroom, India.
