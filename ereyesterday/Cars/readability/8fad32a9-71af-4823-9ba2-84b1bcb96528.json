It is finished in red over black vinyl and powered by a replacement 1.6-liter flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a black canvas top, a black vinyl tonneau, 15″ steel wheels, bullet-style side mirrors, nerf bars, Marchal driving lamps, headlight grilles, bucket seats, and a Bursch exhaust system. This Speedster is now offered on behalf of the late owner’s estate with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Indiana title. The car was repainted in red in 2013 after media blasting the underside and repairing rust in the body panels. The car is equipped with aftermarket sealed beam headlights, aftermarket turn signals and brake lights, bullet-style side mirrors, nerf bars, Marchal driving lamps, and a tinted windshield. The tonneau cover has been refurbished and the unrestored top and side curtains are included in the sale along with removed parts such as headlight guards, side window rails, and the front bumper. Close-up photos of the paintwork are provided in the gallery. The 15″ ventilated steel wheels wear chrome hubcaps and were mounted with 165-series Coker Classic whitewalls in 2013. The car has been fitted with a Zims front disc brake conversion, and service in 2020 included resealing the drive pins and replacing the rear axle seals and rear brake shoes. Noted issues include seeping at the rear wheel bearing seals, a leak from the brake master cylinder, and a loose steering sector shaft and front sway bar link bolt. The fixed-back bucket seats and dashboard were reupholstered in black marine-grade vinyl in 2008. The carpets have also been replaced. Seatbelts were installed in 2015, and the shift lever, lock-out plate, and left door latch were also repaired. The driver’s seat does not latch completely. The two-spoke steering wheel frames a central 6k-rpm tachometer, a 120-mph speedometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil temperature and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 71k miles. The seller notes that the gauges were rebuilt and recalibrated in 2015. The replacement 1.6-liter flat-four was installed in 2013 and is equipped with a YNZ wiring harness. A Dansk fuel tank and sending unit have also been installed. Service in 2020 included changing the oil and replacing the distributor cap. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. A Bursch exhaust system is installed and there is a crack in the piping. A Porsche Certificate of Authenticity is included in the sale. As are spare and removed parts. Photos of the entire collection are provided in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates.
