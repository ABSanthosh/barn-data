  "text": "Last month, the 63rd edition of Salone del Mobile, colloquially known as Milan Design Week, filled the Fiera Milano Rho exhibition center with works from the world’s best design houses. Names like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Dior, and Hermès were among those represented, as the event showcased everything from furniture to classic, contemporary, and conceptual product design. One particularly curious installation featured a Royal Enfield Flying Flea electric bike, transformed into a bona fide two-wheeled sculpture by Los Angeles–based multidisciplinary artist Mattia Biagi. The custom scene constantly flirts with the concept of motorcycles as works of art. But this project took a no-holds-barred approach to that idea, with Mattia treating the pint-sized Flying Flea FF.C6 as a literal canvas. If you’re not familiar with Flying Flea, it’s Royal Enfield’s all-electric sub-brand. The FF.C6 is its debut model, inspired by the World War II-era Royal Enfield Flying Flea, which was air-dropped alongside paratroopers. It combines vintage styling—like a forged aluminum girder-style fork—with modern elements like an electric drivetrain and LED lighting. This particular Flying Flea FF.C6 retains its chassis, drivetrain, and running gear. But it’s dressed in a smorgasbord of captivating handmade pieces, straight out of Mattia’s imagination. Originally from Ravenna, Italy, Mattia cut his teeth in fashion houses like Jean Paul Gaultier, Armani, and Valentino, before coming under the mentorship of the renowned interior and furniture designer Giulio Cappellini. His work—which includes interior design, furniture, sculpture, painting, and more—is highly sought after. (Oh, and he’s a motorcyclist too.) Mattia’s vision for the Flying Flea involved sculpting parts out of a variety of natural materials that are significant to him. Enamored with the bike’s forged aluminum frame, he carved a new faux fuel tank out of travertine to embed in it. Travertine is a type of limestone that Mattia’s been fascinated with since his childhood, most notably used in the construction of the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain. The design mimics the contours of a parachute (a nod to the Flying Flea’s lineage), while the material’s imperfect open-pore texture creates an organic vibe. At the back of the ‘tank,’ set against the flowing fins of the Flying Flea’s magnesium battery case, are a pair of black stone side covers. Ceramics were also a big part of Mattia’s culture growing up, so he felt compelled to introduce them into his project. A pair of handmade clay pieces adorn the girder fork legs, with a matching belt guard fitted at the back. Employing playful forms and traditional glazed finishes, these items add a splash of color to the otherwise autumnal build. For the front and rear fenders, Mattia drew inspiration from the ‘Miss Blanche’ chair, created by the iconic Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. Leaves were cast in clear resin to symbolize life, growth, and renewal. The front unit is attached to the forks, while the rear flows from the back of a hand-carved walnut seat. With a specific design in mind for the headlight, Mattia traveled to Murano in Italy, famed for its glassmaking. There, he worked with an experienced glass-blower to create the light’s mind-blowing new lens. The taillight is another traditionally made glass piece. One more material was used in the Flying Flea’s construction—brass. Mattia created a pair of brass grips using molds of his hands, along with a pair of complementary brass foot pegs. Dubbed ‘Motototem,’ Mattia’s Flying Flea artwork broke cover at Salone del Mobile with the support of Royal Enfield’s Custom World program. Much like the bikes that RE Custom World commissions, it’ll now do the rounds at various events—although you’re probably more likely to see it at an art exhibition than a motorcycle show. As for us, this is one motorcycle we’d happily park in our living room instead of our garage. Bravo, Mattia. Source: Flying Flea",

There, he worked with an experienced glass-blower to create the light’s mind-blowing new lens. The taillight is another traditionally made glass piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more material was used in the Flying Flea’s construction—brass. Mattia created a pair of brass grips using molds of his hands, along with a pair of complementary brass foot pegs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Motototem Flying Flea art bike by Mattia Biagi\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flying-flea-art-bike-5.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nDubbed ‘Motototem,’ Mattia’s Flying Flea artwork broke cover at Salone del Mobile with the support of Royal Enfield’s Custom World program. Much like the bikes that RE Custom World commissions, it’ll now do the rounds at various events—although you’re probably more likely to see it at an art exhibition than a motorcycle show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for us, this is one motorcycle we’d happily park in our living room instead of our garage.
