  "description": "Plus Six successor (pictured) retains classic styling cues... Flagship sports car will use a new aluminium platform and BMW-sourced turbocharged six-pot engine The successor to the Morgan Plus Six will be called Supersport - and the flagship sports car will be revealed on March 11. The news was confirmed today by the British car maker in a social media post with TV personality Richard Hammond (see below). First pictures of the car were shown last month. These revealed it as a rakish coupé, melding the classical styling of the Plus Six and its four-cylinder Plus Four sibling with elements of the Aero cars that bowed out in 2018. Notably, it has a long, sloping tail, similar to that on the Aeromax. Morgan said the new flagship uses a new platform evolved from the Plus Six's current bonded-aluminium structure and that it too will use a BMW-sourced turbocharged six-cylinder engine. The Plus Six’s departure will be marked by the Plus Six Pinnacle, which is limited to just 30 examples and adopts design cues from the striking Pininfarina-styled Midsummer that was unveiled in 2024. The Worcestershire-based firm will also use the £96,995, 3.0-litre straight-six-powered Pinnacle to demonstrate its expanding bespoke programme, which offers “almost limitless” options. The Supersport will arrive later this year as a two-seat sports car that forgoes use the traditional ‘wing silhouette’ of today’s four-wheeled Morgans.   NEWS: We are excited to announce that our forthcoming flagship model, the new Morgan Supersport, will be officially unveiled on March 11th.Hosted by Morgan owner @RichardHammond, the reveal event will take place in the workshops at our Pickersleigh Road factory (1/2) pic.twitter.com/UqtzAACqT1 — Morgan Motor Company (@morganmotor) February 24, 2025   The best-selling four-cylinder Plus Four – which has recently been outselling the Plus Six by roughly two to one – will be left to continue the brand’s traditional vintage styling, which started with the 4/4 back in 1936. Morgan has previously signalled its interest in producing a model that advances its vintage look into what design chief Jonathan Wells calls “the jet age”. For the new flagship, it seems more likely that Morgan will use lessons from the limited-edition Midsummer to produce a considerably more exclusive and upmarket model, clearly differentiated from the Plus Four, that will justify higher prices and more interest in the firm’s bespoke programme. Some people inside Morgan have been calling for this move for some time as rivals take similar approaches, Autocar understands. The BMW engine used by the Plus Six currently makes 335bhp but is thought to be reliably capable of considerably higher outputs. Even at its current power rating, the Plus Six can hit 60mph from rest in 4.2sec and exceed 160mph. Extra power, perhaps as much as 380bhp, could easily lift performance further towards supercar levels. Q\u0026A: Matthew Hole, Morgan's managing director How would you describe Morgan’s priorities? “We need to continue broadly in the direction we’re travelling. But we have recently seen the success of Midsummer, our limited-edition project with Pininfarina, and I’d say we definitely need more of that. I have also had three years working with Jon Wells and his amazing design team, and I reckon they need to be unleashed a bit more on things you might not have expected.” Does that mean different-looking Morgans in future? “There’s definitely space out there for new models that don’t look the same as the Morgans of old – as long as we also meet the expectations of our traditional customers: that’s one reason we’re keen to maintain and expand our coachbuilding skills. Our cars’ underpinnings have come a long way, but there’s catching up to do with some of the exterior. Coachbuilding allows you a lot of flexibility. Do we need more high-tech Morgans?  “We’re in no hurry to dump a lot of forward-facing technology into the cars, especially if it doesn’t add to the analogue driving experience. We’ve been doing mostly subtle mechanical stuff, like enhanced ride and handling. We’ll probably continue on that line.”",
