  "description": "Royal Enfield Project Delta is a union of vintage design with modern engineering. The brand has teamed up with ‘Purpose Built Moto’ to create a custom Super Meteor 650 inspired by the 1940s-50s era of motorcycling as well as the Super Meteor 700 and the Flying Flea from World War II. Royal Enfield Project Delta features a hardtail-style frame This prototype features hand-shifted gears and solid-mounted bars. It features modern 650cc parallel twin with 1940s styling Project Delta Super Meteor 650 based one-off vintage motorcycle Project Delta is a reimagining of the Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650, drawing inspiration from the vintage motorcycling era of the 1940s and 1950s. This custom build by ‘Purpose Built Moto’ showcases a fusion of modern engineering and classic aesthetics. The motorcycle’s frame has been extensively modified to echo vintage hardtail styling, while incorporating modern updates such as an in-frame oil cooler and a monoshock conversion. The handcrafted girder fork and spoked wheels, 23-inch front and 19-inch rear contribute to the period-correct look. The brand claims that the slim peanut tank takes inspiration from the 1952 Super Meteor 700. The hand-shifted gears, solid-mounted bars, and girder fork are a hark back to the bikes of the 1940s. Project Delta features a bespoke paintwork of black, gold, and cherry red that is Art Nouveau-inspired. The Project Delta is a modern day iteration of a pre-world war II bike hence, it features the same 648cc, air and oil cooled, parallel twin motor producing 47hp and 52Nm.  Even though Project Delta looks like a great collector’s piece, It’s a prototype and will not see the light of day ever. Although it’s interesting to see manufacturers go the extra mile with special prototypes. Also see: Royal Enfield sets up Flying Flea brand for EVs",
