  "description": "Can an MK8.5 makeover return the Golf R to the top of the fast hatch heap? Engineers at VW’s go-faster R division must be tired of wrestling with the law of diminishing returns. So composed and complete was their high performance reworking of the MK7 Golf that they’ve struggled to make any big gains since, either through that car’s facelift or its subsequent transformation into the current eighth generation machine.Now there’s another mid-life refresh for the Wolfsburg wonder wagon and, once again, VW has elected to not really mess with a winning formula. There's a dash more power, some visual tweaks, some revised coding for the driver modes and a couple of choice new options, but essentially the latest Golf R is much the same as its predecessor.Either way, against a legislative backdrop that makes it harder than ever to make these sorts of cars, it's hard not to admire the brand's commitment to the hot hatch cause. Of course the German brand arguably invented the go-faster family car genre, but with GTE, GTI and GTI Clubsport sharing showroom space alongside the R, it's clear VW has got a severe case of the pocket rocket virus.In many respects the Golf R could have an easy path to success, what with the fact many of its rivals are either long dead and buried (Ford Focus RS), not long for this world (Honda Civic Type-R) or exist in a more upmarket and pricier orbit (Mercedes-AMG A35). However, it's fair to say that VW dropped the ball in the transition from MK7.5 to MK8 Golf, with quality and usability taking a dive in particular. So, can the MK8.5 redress the balance?",

  "text": "Despite the 12bhp uplift in power (torque is unchanged at 310lb ft), the venerable EA888 turbocharged 2.0-litre feels much as it did before. Almost lag-free, it doles out satisfyingly elastic performance as it pulls hard and smoothly from idle all the way through to the 6800rpm cut-out. Combined with the total traction transmission it makes the Golf a clinically efficient point-to-point machine with the sort of easily accessible pace that delivers slingshot corner exits and stress-free overtakes. Outright urge is as strong as you'd expect, with VW claiming 4.6 seconds for the whizz-bang 0-62mph sprint and a top speed pegged at an electronically limited 155mph.  Our Black Edition test car also featured the R Performance Package (usually a £1,950 option on the standard version) that raises the top speed to 168mph (and adds a ‘Drift’ mode, natch).  Also available is featured is lightweight and wallet crippingly expensive (£3,315) Akrapovic exhaust that’s promises to give the Golf greater voice, especially if you press hold the start button for at least a second and a half without touching brake pedal to initiate a theatric flare of revs to 2500rpm once the engine churns into life. One for those neighbours you can’t abide, perhaps?Even so, when fired-up in this manner the Golf still lacks the instant aural drama of the old Audi RS3, or even the, admittedly much pricier, Mercedes-AMG A45. There’s a greater baritone than before, but the R remains a fast hatch that would rather let others play the peacocking game. That said, the sound actuator that pumps synthetic engine noise into the engine has been given a more gravelly delivery, the synthetic nature of which won't be to all tastes. Thankfully it can be switched off through the enhanced driver mode set-up that offers greater customisation and even a new Eco mode that softens the throttle response and serves-up earlier shifts from the seven-speed twin-clutch gearbox.The eager engine is matched to a seven-speed DSG (there’s no manual) that shuffles cogs quickly and decisively. Better still, in the raciest driver modes the transmission now holds gears when in manual mode, refusing to shift-up when you hit the limiter. It can still get wrong footed at low speeds, especially when pulling onto a roundabout or out of a junction, but in all other situations it performs with snappy precision - although we can't help feel a pang of sadness that there's no six-speed manual option to inject a little extra driver involvement.The brakes, too, are up to snuff. With ventilated 357mm front and 310mm rear discs, there is strong stopping ability even after repeated blows during track use. There's little too much bite at the top of the travel, which means a delicate touch is required, but past that point pedal feel is good, providing the driver with confidence when wiping off speed in a hurry.",
