  "text": "And for just $12,000 plus shipping, this unique custom car could be yours 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers This custom car blends design elements from Toyota, Ford, Nissan, and Bugatti into one. It’s priced at just under $12,000, but it will likely require shipping to your location. Wherever it goes, this unique build is guaranteed to turn heads and spark curiosity. What happens when someone can’t choose between a Bugatti, a Ford GT, and a Nissan GT-R, but only has room for one car in the driveway? Apparently, they build this. The seller behind this bizarre custom creation has decided that blending their favorite cars into one vehicle is the only logical solution. What’s wilder is that under the sheet metal and what we assume is fiberglass, you’ll find a Toyota. Yes, you read that right. This is a 1998 Toyota Celica, although the listing offers very little info about the engine. We do know, though, that it has a manual transmission and a mere 37,500 km (23,301 miles) on the clock, which is nice and all, but honestly, it’s the body that steals the show here. Read: Is This Mk4 Toyota Supra With Ferrari Taillights And Lexus Headlamps Too Ugly To Love? Despite the somewhat questionable origins, the bodywork here is surprisingly clean given the description. Pop-up headlights flank a huge Bugatti-esque grille with what almost appear to be slight nods to the latest Toyota Supra up front. “The rear of the car features Ford GT-style tail lights and what appear to be exhaust ports blended into the center of the rear bumper. It’s tough to tell if they’re functional, but the finish appears excellent. The entire car is littered with ducting and vents that may or may not be functional. They are on the rear decklid and bumper, on the hood, and behind the door skins. The cabin is equally wild. The steering yoke, yes, you read that right, appears to have a quick disconnect, and the upholstery is a mix of dark red and black. It’s tough to say for sure, given the low-quality photos, but all four seats appear to be Recaros. Those interested in the creation can pick it up for a cool $11,872 based on the exchange rate for Moroccan Dirhams at the time of writing. Oh yeah, that’s the big catch here. This car is for sale in Morocco, which might explain it a little bit. The nation, and particularly Marrakesh, is infamous for its supercar and hypercar culture. The streets are full of high-end, exotic vehicles, making this bizarre creation just one more oddball in a sea of over-the-top rides. If you’ve ever wanted to get the look of a Bugatti without the price tag, this could be your ticket to turning heads. Considering that this car is over 25 years old, it’s technically legal to import it to the U.S. and even to Canada. Would you take a flyer (literally and figuratively) on this custom creation? We’ve certainly seen cars that weren’t as well-finished. Let us know in the comments below. Photos Avito",
