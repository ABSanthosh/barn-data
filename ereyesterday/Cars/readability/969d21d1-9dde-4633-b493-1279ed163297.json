  "text": "We’ll have to wait and see whether Xpeng offers chrome or matte purple wraps on the production P7 June 4, 2025 at 20:38 by Brad Anderson New P7 sedan features scissor doors, carbon-look trim, and up to 586 horsepower. Chrome and purple-wrapped prototypes spotted testing on public Chinese roads. Full debut scheduled for Guangzhou Auto Show with launch expected in Q3 2025. China’s booming EV market isn’t short on drama, and with new models launching at breakneck speed, it’s hard to keep up. One of the latest arrivals poised to shake things up is the refreshed Xpeng P7, which looks ready to challenge the wildly popular Xiaomi SU7. Recently uncovered in official photos from the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the P7 has now been showcased in new photos and also spotted on the road with two flamboyant wraps. Xpeng is expected to officially launch the P7 in the third quarter of this year, giving it enough time to iron out any kinks the new car may have. The automaker has left no stone unturned in overhauling the design of the updated P7, so much so that it barely resembles the outgoing model. Whether or not that’s a good thing will be up to the market to decide. Read: Xpeng’s New Sports Sedan Packs More Power Than Expected Clearly, Xpeng wants to make a statement with the new car. One prototype recently spotted on the streets by Weibo users features a mirror chrome wrap that extends not only across the bodywork but also to the rear window and wheels. A second prototype snapped on the road has a matte purple wrap and also rocks aerodynamic wheel covers. While we doubt Xpeng will actually sell the P7 with exterior finishes like this, we wouldn’t put it past the brand. The outgoing P7 ‘Wing Edition’ is offered in a bright shade of green, akin to what you’d expect to find from the color palette of an exotic brand like Lamborghini. Bright colors aren’t the only exotic car influences of the new P7. It will come equipped with Lamborghini-inspired scissor doors, though it’s not clear yet if these will be offered on all trims or only the flagship model. Additionally, recent photos have shown that the wing mirrors and front air vents can be optioned with a forged carbon fiber design. Whether that’s real carbon or just an aesthetic wrap hasn’t been confirmed, but it does add some extra visual flair to the EV. The updated P7 isn’t just about show. It brings performance upgrades too. Entry-level models will come with a 363 hp rear-mounted motor, while the dual-motor version adds another 223 hp up front. That gives the all-wheel-drive variant a healthy 586 hp, which should make for some genuinely quick launches. Buyers won’t have to wait long to see it up close. The P7 is expected to make its official debut at the Guangzhou Auto Show on November 20.",
