Following it are a Harley XR1000 flat tracker, a Sportster bobber from Gas\u0026Retro, and a spicy Harley Electra Glide Big Twin chopper from the USA. Yamaha XS650 by Mike Dodd Two years ago, Mike Dodd of Auckland, New Zealand found himself in possession of a 1982 Yamaha XS650. But there was a small hiccup—it was a complete basket case. Seeing as the bike was already in a thousand pieces, Mike thought the skinny and light XS would be the perfect candidate for a Japanese-style chopper. The back half of the frame was cut off before Mike welded on a hardtail section from TC Bros and neatened up the frame’s neck gussets. The rear wheel was polished and re-laced to the stock hub with stainless spokes, while the twin leading shoe drum brake hub from a Suzuki T500 was paired with a 21” Akront rim up front. It’s hooked up to a set of lengthened forks with Harley internals and a custom fork brace. Custom-made handlebars (with internal wiring) were matched to new levers and Vans x Cult grips. A Lowbrow Customs ‘P-Nut’ tank was bolted on after Mike had relocated the fuel cap to the highest point on the tank to squeeze every drop of fuel in. A Daytona speedometer was mounted at the base of the fuel tank to keep the bars clean. There are Purpose Built Moto turn signals all around, and a slick tail light mounted on the custom sissy bar. With the rear fender painted gloss black, we’re glad to see Mike chose a wild purple metal flake for the tank. The seat was upholstered by Midnight Upholstery, and sits above an electronics box that houses the battery a Purpose Built Moto control unit. The Yamaha XS650 engine was reassembled with new rods, a trued and welded crank, high-compression pistons, and a hotter cam. The capacity was bumped to 700 cc, the valve springs were upgraded, and Mike ported the head. The clutch boss was machined to accommodate an extra friction plate. A set of Mikuni carbs throw fuel into the engine, while hot gasses exit through a handmade stainless steel exhaust system. As Mike squeezed the build into his spare time, the whole process took two years of painstaking effort. From the shores of Japan to the land of the long white cloud, we’re stoked that Mike stuck to his guns. [Mike Dodd | Images by Brad Longworth] Harley-Davidson XR1000 by Laurel Classics Cade Carradine spent his youth dreaming of large-capacity V-twins and always knew that one day, he’d have his own. So when an opportunity to build himself a road-going Harley Davidson XR750 arose, he jumped at it. Armed with an old Chevrolet diesel truck and a healthy dose of stick-to-itiveness, he eventually found everything he needed. First up, Cade miraculously got his hands on a genuine Harley-Davidson XR750 factory racing frame from 1977. The chromoly frame was all there, but the rear had to be straightened—which he didn’t discover until after the frame was nickel-plated and the engine was in. The 43 mm forks are from a Yamaha R6, with twin single-piston Brembos and Barnes brake discs paired with Sunstar rims and fresh flat track rubber. The fork clamps are from Banke Performance, and the headlight is an ex-Chicago police cruiser spotlight that has been ingeniously modified to fit. The Flanders handlebars are equipped with KustomTech levers, Renthal grips, and small rectangular mirrors, mounted down low. The XR750 tank was matched to a Scott Parker replica seat unit, with custom upholstery by Christine LePera. Pacman Jack McCann painted the bodywork a brilliant Chevrolet Super Sport blue and laid down the custom XR1000 vinyls. A lot of attention was given to the engine. The engine cases and cylinders are from a 1984 model Harley and increase the capacity to 1000 cc. Alloy XR750 cylinder heads from Branch Flowmetrics were paired with matching XR750 rocker boxes, and there’s even an electric starter. Twin 38 mm Mikuni carbs on custom mounts feed fuel into each cylinder, with twin Supertrapp exhausts snaking their way out of the left-hand side of the bike. The rear set footpegs are from Storz Performance, and the frame’s rear was slightly modified to accept a pair of Öhlins shocks. Sitting pretty on a fresh set of flat track tires, this is one of the best Harley street trackers we’ve ever seen. And, incredibly, this is Cade’s first ground-up custom motorcycle. We can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.

Martin’s bike (the Softail) was put under the knife at Gas\u0026Retro, and the project went so well that Marko then asked Žiga to lend him a hand with his Sportster. The Sportster had already had a few things done by another custom builder—but it was a bit rough around the edges. Žiga agreed to clean it up and make it look a little more modern. The Sporty was disassembled and its frame sent off for blasting and painting. A pair of gold fork stanchions were installed to contrast against the chunky black 16-inch wheels. A short fender, LED headlight, and custom bikini fairing were added to the front end. Gas\u0026Retro installed a full suite of Motogadget bits, including the speedo, keyless ignition, bar-end turn signals, glassless mirrors, grips, and push-button switches. The master cylinder, clutch lever, brake calipers, and rotors all came from Beringer. A set of black crash bars was bolted on, complete with yellow lens PIAA spotlights; a modification we most definitely approve of. The Sportster 48 tank, bikini fairing, and bobbed rear fender were painted in an outlandish black and grey lightning bolt livery by Žiga’s mate, Erik Smrdel. Erik also laid down bright yellow and racing numbers over the side covers, which pair well with the Öhlins rear shocks and the custom Alcantara seat. The 1,200 cc engine was stripped down and rebuilt with fresh gaskets, seals, Screamin’ Eagle camshafts, and a K\u0026N air filter. The EFI system was ripped out and replaced by a simple Mikuni carb, hidden by a carbon air filter cover. The exhaust system is custom and terminates in an Akrapovič muffler. A handmade license plate holder, and three-in-one LEDs from Kellermann, sit out back. The number 77 is Marko’s racing number, and seventy7 is the name of Marko’s new art design studio. In the three years since Žiga, Martin, and Marko first met, they have become good mates and even race scooters and supermotos together. With plans to build a custom Porsche 356 on the horizon, we’re sure Gas\u0026Retro and the Mihael brothers will team up for another bike soon. [Gas\u0026Retro | Images by Rok Plešnar] Harley-Davidson Evo by Death Co. Choppers In the two years that Dan Dellostritto has been running Death Co. Choppers, he’s built over 30 Harley Sportster choppers using frames from The Gasbox. So when The Gasbox developed a new frame for Harley Big Twins, they quickly got a prototype frame into Dan’s hands. Starting with the eponymous Big Twin frame, the prototype was constructed to accept a five-speed gearbox, with a 32-degree neck that is 3” taller than stock. The frame is also built with Frisco tank mounts and includes a horseshoe oil tank. A 1990 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide FLHTC Classic donated its 1,340 cc engine to the cause. It’s fitted with an S\u0026S Super E carb and a set of MCM slash-cut drag pipes. An Ultima 2” open belt primary was fitted, along with high-mid foot controls from Maindrive Cycles. The 2.1-gallon Frisco tank (painted by Wren Compton) sits nice and high on the frame. Tall Taco Bars from Zombie Performance wear Biltwell Inc. grips, a 1FNGR clutch lever, and a mirror from Pangea Speed. The seat is from Wilder Factory, and the taillight is from JEGS. A set of 19F/16R mag wheels were bolted on and wrapped in Shinko Classic 240 tires. The 39 mm forks are six inches longer than stock, locking down that signature chopper style. The rear fender is from Lowbrow Customs, and Unity Manufacturing supplied one of their Tuff Rotors to be squeezed by a Wilwood caliper out back. Even though Dan’s made Sportsters his hallmark, there’s no denying he’s knocked this Big Twin chopper out of the part. If Death Co. Choppers keep pumping them out looking this clean, things might change.

Choppers\u003c/strong\u003e In the two years that Dan Dellostritto has been running Death Co. Choppers, he’s built over 30 Harley Sportster choppers using frames from The Gasbox. So when The Gasbox developed a new frame for Harley Big Twins, they quickly got a prototype frame into Dan’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting with the eponymous Big Twin frame, the prototype was constructed to accept a five-speed gearbox, with a 32-degree neck that is 3” taller than stock. The frame is also built with Frisco tank mounts and includes a horseshoe oil tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/death-co-choppers-big-twin-5-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Harley Big Twin chopper with The Gasbox frame by Death Co.
