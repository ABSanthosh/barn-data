  "description": "Hyundai’s Creta iVT is a hot favourite of our long term fleet, and that’s down to how convenient and fuss-free a companion it is. Here to give a taste of another flavour of the Creta is the N Line. A 160hp turbo-petrol engine, dual-clutch transmission, and tweaked steering and suspension promise a more involving driving experience, something I, its custodian, have a good few months to make the most of. However, for me, this version of the Creta appeals first and foremost for the way it looks. Its larger 18-inch rims alone uplift the stance successfully, and then there’s the rest of the N Line trimmings. The sportier bumpers, side skirts, roof spoiler and red detailing add up to give the Creta N Line genuine visual distinction among the sea of ‘ordinary’ Cretas. The iVT looks plain vanilla when standing alongside. N Line-specific details add greatly to the look. I like what Hyundai has done with the interior, too. The all-black treatment with red highlights works to bring in some sportiness to the ambience. The N Line-specific steering is also great to hold, and even the metal finish to the pedals is a detail not lost on me. For the full effect, I’ve made the Sport screen (carbon-fibre look) the default layout for the digital instruments. I’m not entirely satisfied with my seating position though. The digital screen and centre touchscreen are positioned a touch low for my liking. Oh, and the absence of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto was an irritant during my initial days with the Creta. A Rs 99 wire did help get past the issue, but I’d rather not have my phone plugged in for more time than required. Crisp cameras and multiple views are a boon. Our N Line is in top-spec N10 form and the goodies on board are being put to, well, good use. Front seat ventilation is a hit with everyone who experiences it, and I like the sound from the Bose sound system. I’m no audiophile but there is enough depth to the sound to satisfy my ears. What I really appreciate are the cameras. The front view camera is very handy in judging parking space, and the blind view monitors are a boon, too. Camera resolution and performance are impressive and better than what you get in many pricier cars. Exhaust note should have been jazzed up for the N Line. We’re in the thick of the festive season as I file this report, which means traffic is at its yearly worst. Forget about letting the 160 horses under the hood loose, getting into fourth gear is an achievement on my daily commute these days. The stop/start driving means the dual-clutch gearbox has to work overtime, and it’s not particularly a fan of frequent shifts at low speeds. There’s the occasional delay and the odd jerky shift at other times. The Creta iVT offers a far smoother experience in the same environment. The N Line can be had with a 6-speed manual, too, but it’d be too committed a choice for my kind of driving. The other thing? The N Line’s larger 18-inch wheels also manifest in a busier ride. You feel more of the surface below, and it’s not quite as pliant as other Cretas on 17-inch rims. There’s more weight at the steering, too – great when you’re on a twisty road, not so much when you have a tight parking to work your car into. Low-speed city driving has taken its toll on economy. What’s also pinching a bit is fuel economy. I’ve been averaging all of 7.9kpl but my 10km round trip through choc-a-block traffic doesn’t let the engine have it easy at any point. The real-time figure improves dramatically (upwards of 10kpl) over late night drives on emptier roads. I would have liked more background music on said drives from the exhaust. The twin tip exhaust is just for show and sound levels are no higher than a regular Creta, which is a shame. I intend to end the year with a few weekend getaways, and the plan is to select routes with some good driving roads as well. I’ll keep you posted on my learnings on those. Initial impressions are of being with the best looking Creta, but not necessarily the best Creta per se.
