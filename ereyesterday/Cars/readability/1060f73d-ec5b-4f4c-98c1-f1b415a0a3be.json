The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 was modified with a Mega 3 Performance engine tune and a titanium exhaust system. Further equipment includes a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle, carbon-shelled Senna seats, 20 and 21″ Vossen forged wheels, Velocity AP springs, a RYFT carbon-fiber front splitter, and a 765LT rear spoiler and suspension accumulators. This 720S was purchased by the seller in 2022 and has 11k miles, and it is now offered with a copy of the window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The 720S utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded aluminum subframe, and this example is finished in Ludus Blue. The car was optioned with the Carbon Fiber Packs 1, 2, and 3, and further carbon-fiber components include the tonneau cover, engine cover, exhaust cover, rear diffuser, aero bridges, front canards, and side skirts. Additional features include a RYFT carbon-fiber front splitter, a retractable electrochromic glass hardtop, and a 765LT active rear spoiler. The exterior components are covered in Xpel Ultimate Plus protective film. The 20 and 21″ Vossen forged wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The car has been modified with Velocity AP springs and 765LT suspension accumulators. Stopping power is provided by Azores Orange-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The removed suspension springs will be included in the sale. The carbon-shelled Senna seats, which feature Ludus Blue accents, were installed under current ownership. The car was optioned with a carbon-fiber rear section and the carbon-fiber secondary interior components package. Features include 360-degree Park Assist, a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, and a 750S-style rear-view mirror. The steering wheel is mounted to a power-adjustable column and features carbon-fiber trim and paddle shifters. Instrumentation consists of a folding LCD screen that displays a speedometer, tachometer, trip functions, and vehicle information. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 utilizes a flat-plane crankshaft and dry-sump lubrication. Modifications include a Mega 3 Performance engine tune and a titanium exhaust system with a 200-cell catalytic converter. An oil change was performed in July 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to McLaren Chicago in Illinois, factory equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $417,910. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.
