  "description": "This 1957 Jaguar XK140 roadster was refurbished in 1977 and was acquired out of Richland, Washington, by the seller's father in 1982. The car was kept in Idaho for years, and the seller inherited the vehicle in the early 2000s and relocated it to Arizona before returning it to Washington in 2006. The replacement 3.4-liter inline-six is paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Finished in gray over blue leather, the car features a black soft top, 16\" wire wheels, dual SU carburetors, a Nardi steering wheel, and adjustable seats. This XK140 OTS is now offered with records dating back to 1977, an owner's manual, an electric-fan kit, a car cover, and a clean Washington title in the seller's name that lists the model year as 1957.",

  "text": "This 1957 Jaguar XK140 roadster was refurbished in 1977 and was acquired out of Richland, Washington, by the seller’s father in 1982. The car was kept in Idaho for years, and the seller inherited the vehicle in the early 2000s and relocated it to Arizona before returning it to Washington in 2006. The replacement 3.4-liter inline-six is paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Finished in gray over blue leather, the car features a black soft top, 16″ wire wheels, dual SU carburetors, a Nardi steering wheel, and adjustable seats. This XK140 OTS is now offered with records dating back to 1977, an owner’s manual, an electric-fan kit, a car cover, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name that lists the model year as 1957. The car is said to have been repainted in 1977 in a color-matching Dove Gray. The removable black soft top has been replaced, and other features include a two-piece windshield, bright trim, fender-mounted dual side mirrors, dual exhaust outlets, rear bumperettes, and a full-width chrome front bumper with overriders. The windshield-wiper motor has been replaced, although a windshield-washer pump is not fitted. The seller notes chips and wear in the paint as well as wear to the soft top. Chrome-finished 16″ knock-off wire wheels are mounted with Pirelli Cinturato tires measuring 185SR16. A spare is stored under the trunk floor. The braking, steering, and suspension systems were refurbished around 2006, and the wheels were replaced. The adjustable seats have been retrimmed in blue leather. Interior appointments include blue carpeting, a cabin heater, a passenger-side grab handle, and door-panel storage pockets. The left leather door pull is frayed, and wear is noted on the leather around one of the knurled fasteners on the dashboard. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation consisting of a reverse-sweep 6k-rpm tachometer, a clock, a 140-mph speedometer, and an ammeter alongside gauges for oil pressure, water temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 5k miles, which is believed to have been accrued since the 1977 refurbishment, and approximately 2,500 of which were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown. The tachometer has been rebuilt and the cable replaced. The 3.4-liter inline-six has been replaced. In 2006 the cylinder head was rebuilt and the engine-bay wiring was replaced. The fuel system was refurbished in 2015 by rebuilding the dual SU carburetors and replacing the fuel pump, lines, filter, tank, and gauge sender. The engine number is depicted above. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Corrosion is noted on underbody components. The car was featured in an advertising campaign for Chico’s women’s wear in the mid-2000s. The above photo of a print ad from the campaign will accompany the vehicle, as will service records dating back to 1977. The car’s chassis number falls within the range for a left-hand-drive XK140 roadster built in 1954, although it is titled as a 1957 model. Paperwork in the gallery below shows that the car was registered as a 1957 model as early as 1981. The Washington title carries a “Reprint” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates.
