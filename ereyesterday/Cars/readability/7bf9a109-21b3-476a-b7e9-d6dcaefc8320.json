  "description": "BYD has recently been busy registering new design patents in India. While the September filing pertained to the Bao 3 EV, it was followed by the Denza N9 PHEV in October. Notably, this comes ahead of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January 2025, in which BYD has confirmed its participation. However, official communication from the Chinese brand over the presentations of these two EVs is yet to come.  Denza is a luxury new energy vehicle (NEV) brand owned by BYD Bao 3 is manufactured by Fangchengbao, an off-road-focused subsidiary of BYD BYD India’s current line-up has BYD eMAX 7, Atto 3 and Seal electric cars BYD Denza N9 BYD-owned Denza is a luxury new energy vehicle (NEV) brand headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Sitting on a 3.1-metre-long wheelbase, the N9 runs 5.2 metres long, which is Mercedes GLS territory. The Denza N9 is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), as per the listing on China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology website.  The N9 PHEV is powered by a combination of ICE and EV powertrains. Combustion duties are handled by a 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine that generates up to 206hp. Further, N9’s electric setup makes a 924hp combined output from a front-axle motor and two motors for each rear wheel. Its 47kWh blade-cell battery is good for a range of 165 kilometres. There is an all-electric N9 with a similar three-motor setup with a maximum of 965hp on tap. BYD Bao 3 The Bao 3 electric SUV is built by BYD’s Fangchengbao off-road-focused subsidiary. Based on the Super 3 concept car, the 4.6-metre SUV will be slotted above the Atto 3 (4.4 metres). Bao 3’s front (149hp) and rear (299hp) electric motors are designed to simulate a four-wheel drive (4WD) setup. It has a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.9 seconds and maxes out at a top speed of 201 kph. A separate design patent for the SUV with a roof-mounted carrier was also registered here by BYD. BYD’s presence at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo will be marked by its existing electric vehicle line-up and other NEVs. Stay tuned to find out if the BYD Denza N9 and Bao 3 will make it to the expo next month.
