  "text": "Matt P. wrote today about a dragstrip Down Under that has banned EVs over fire-safety concerns. This, to me, is a mild bummer since some EVs can be darn fast in a straight line. Maybe not a ID.Buzz, but what about a Mustang Mach-E GT? The Kia EV6 GT? A Hyundai Ioniq 5 N? And so forth and so on.As the EV market grows, some buyers will want to take them to the track.That said, the fire-safety concerns are real. There's no evidence to suggest EVs catch fire more often than ICE vehicles, but when they do, the fires are hard to put out. So, how should tracks proceed?To be clear, I think larger tracks that are used to hosting the occasional IndyCar/NASCAR/IMSA race will be fine. Road America, Watkins Glen, Laguna Seca and the like will be fine. So, too, will dragstrips that host NHRA events. They probably have enough resources on hand to handle an EV fire during the local \"run what ya brung\" night.But smaller tracks, I am not so sure. So, what say you? Should tracks prevent EV owners from driving on them? Or is it irrational fear of a new technology? Or something in between?Sound off below.[Image: Kia]Become a TTAC insider.
