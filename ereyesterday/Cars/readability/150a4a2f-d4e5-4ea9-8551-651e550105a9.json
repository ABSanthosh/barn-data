  "description": "Get ready to meet your hero cars! The Modern Classic Rally is back, and the 2025 edition will be held on March 1 and 2 at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, in Kalina. The event will consist of a static display on Saturday, March 1, followed by a drive across Mumbai on Sunday, March 2, with over 80 of the most alluring modern classics expected to be in attendance. Be there! Modern Classic Rally 2025 tickets Tickets for the exclusive static display are available for the first time. This year’s event will also be special. For one, a whole raft of cars never seen on display are expected to descend at this landmark event. And, for the first time, enthusiasts and car lovers will be able to purchase a limited number of tickets to attend Saturday’s static display. Yes, sign up early by using the link below and you can join us for an unforgettable day of celebrating the cars that helped shape the golden age of motoring. What are modern classic cars? What makes modern classics so desirable is that they are true enthusiast cars. But what are modern classics? Simply put, a modern classic falls somewhere between a modern car and a traditional classic. Consisting of cars that are between 10 and 50 years old, modern classics also include younger cars that have left their mark in fields such as performance, styling or luxury.  Another way to look at modern classics is to view them as poster cars; the ones we’d put up on our walls. As cars today become increasingly more complex, with digital tech and automated systems turning them into bots, it’s the modern classics' analogue experience that is fast becoming more and more popular. And it’s not just popularity, modern classics are fast turning into the most valuable genre of cars worldwide, outpacing both traditional vintages and classic cars. The 2025 edition has sports cars, supercars, performance sedans, SUVs, limos, luxury cars, and more. This year’s rally will have everything from sports cars and supercars, to performance sedans, SUVs, limos and luxury cars. When asked what makes modern classics so special, Autocar India editor Hormazd Sorabjee explains that it is “the mechanical appeal and purity of design that makes them so utterly desirable. And they are also the perfect digital detox for car lovers in today’s world.” Curator Perseus Bandrawalla said, “Modern Classics are much more than a hobby – they are a way of life. Yes, they are about the iconic cars, sure, but they are also about communities and shared experiences. You don’t just buy into modern classic ownership, you also buy into a lifestyle.” Modern Classic Rally 2025 classes explained There are four classes for the 2025 event.   This year’s show has four classes. The first is imported cars made between the mid-sixties and 2004, and includes some cars assembled in India using kits. The second class has cars manufactured from January 2005 to December 2010. This class also has cars assembled in India using kits. The third class has luxury cars manufactured in India, including high performance models manufactured from January 2005 to December 2014. The final class – Contemporary Classics – are quintessentially collectible sports or luxury cars, which, though not classified by their age, are generally around five to seven years old. Can’t wait to see all the icons line up together and tell the story of the golden age of motoring. See you there.
