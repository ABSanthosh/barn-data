  "text": "Attendance figures have fallen by nearly 500,000 people in less than a decade February 5, 2025 at 19:11 by Michael Gauthier The Detroit Auto Show only attracted 275,000 visitors last month. That’s down nearly half a million people in less than six years. The 2025 show was disappointing as there wasn’t much besides two new Fords. The Detroit Auto Show used to be a can’t miss event, but its return was barely worth mentioning. The Ford Mustang RTR and Mustang GTD Spirit of America were introduced ahead of the event, leaving the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards as the only worthwhile news on media day. Needless to say, it wasn’t worth attending and we openly questioned whether or not the Detroit Auto Show was dead. We’re getting a resounding answer today and it’s time to break out the defibrillator as the event is on life support. More: Is The Detroit Auto Show Dead? While organizers tried to put a positive spin on things, the numbers are truly terrible. Over the course of 11 days, just 275,000 people attended. As The Detroit Free Press noted, that pales in comparison to the 774,179 people who attended in 2019. That’s a staggering decline, but the show didn’t release attendance figures during the COVID era. As a result, it’s hard to judge how much the lackluster lineup and a return to January impacted things. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops Despite the awful attendance, organizers proclaimed it was “one of the largest auto shows in the U.S.” However, the numbers aren’t much to brag about as the former Motor City Jewel barely beat the 2024 Chicago Auto Show, which had a shorter 10-day run that attracted nearly 260,000 guests. The lackluster showing isn’t much of a surprise as most automakers have decided Detroit isn’t worth the effort. As a result, dealers, four indoor tracks, and randomness – including the Army, Marines, and the Polish Investment and Trade Agency – helped to fill up the leftover space in Huntington Place. This didn’t stop officials from proclaiming the show had a “true energy” and a “robust lineup of vehicles.” While that’s enough to make your eyes roll, the event had an estimated economic impact of up to $370 million. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops Organizers also said there were 34 brands on display as well as nearly 500 vehicles. However, the latter figure appears to include “150+ modified, personal vehicles” that were shown in partnership with Modded Detroit. While it’s easy to write the show off as a major disappointment, the Charity Preview raised $1.7 million for six children’s charities. That’s good news, although the show’s future looks far from bright if things don’t improve. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops",
