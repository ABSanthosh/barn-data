  "description": "The Lamborghini Temerario has been launched in India barely 9 months after its international debut at Monterey Car Week in August last year. Priced at Rs 6 crore before options, the Temerario is Lambo’s successor to the Huracan. 800hp V8 engine combined with 3 electric motors Temerario weighs 1,715kg (dry weight)  Interior similar to Revuelto Lamborghini Temerario engine, performance, specifications New V8 engine is claimed to be most powerful in a production car Lamborghini Temerario specificationsEngine4.0-litre twin-turbo V8Power800hp at 9000-9750rpmTorque730Nm at 4000-7000rpmElectric motors power150hp + 82hp + 82hpTotal maximum power920hpTotal maximum torque800NmGearbox8-speed dual-clutch auto0-100kph (claimed)2.7sTop speed (claimed)Over 340kph Unlike its predecessor, which came with a naturally aspirated 5.2-litre V10 engine, the Temerario is powered by a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine with 3 electric motors. The turbo-petrol engine alone produces 800hp and 730Nm and has the turbochargers mounted between the two cylinder banks. Another highlight of this engine is that it revs all the way up to 10,000rpm; Lamborghini claims it is the most powerful and highest-revving V8 engine ever installed in a production car. Of the three electric motors, a 150hp, 300Nm unit is mounted in the 8-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, while the other two – axle-mounted motors producing 82hp each – draw power from a 3.8kWh battery. The Temerario’s total system output is 920hp and 800Nm of torque. The brand claims a 0-100kph time of just 2.7 seconds and a top speed of over 340kph. The 3.8kWh battery can be charged via an AC charging port (up to 7kW in 30 minutes), through regenerative braking, or directly from the V8 engine. While the Temerario is an all-wheel drive model, it is the first Lamborghini to feature a drift mode. It also gets drive modes – Citta (FWD, fully electric), Strada, Sport and Corsa – and is equipped with 410mm aluminium disc brakes with 10-pot calipers on the front wheels and 390mm discs with four-pot calipers at the rear; Lambo claims a 100kph-0 stopping distance of 32 metres. Lamborghini Temerario exterior design, platform Alleggerita (‘lightened’) package brings weight down by 25kg  The Temerario uses an all-aluminium spaceframe that is said to improve torsional rigidity by 20 percent while keeping weight in check. Lambo’s junior supercar tips the scales at 1,715kg (dry), though a track-focused Alleggerita (‘lightened’) package brings that down to 1,690kg as it comes with a carbon fibre rear wing and wheels and a unique bumper treatment. It’s unlikely that the Temerario would be mistaken for anything other than a Lamborghini, as there are clear inspirations derived from its predecessors, the Huracan and Gallardo, along with new bits that are reminiscent of the Revuelto, specifically the hexagonal motifs. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fibre options, as well as numerous aero-based design elements, which are said to make the new supercar 103 percent more aero-efficient than the Huracan Evo, and 158 percent more when equipped with the Alleggerita pack. Lamborghini Temerario interior and features Interior takes inspiration from Revuelto On the inside, the Temerario is quite similar to the Revuelto, with Lamborghini’s typical fighter jet-themed cabin and plenty of hexagonal motifs. The interior features a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a central floating 8.4-inch touchscreen display and a slim 9.1-inch display for the front passenger. Lamborghini says comfort has been a big focus; 6ft 5inch drivers can wear a helmet and fit with ease, says the Italian marque. The 18-way power adjustable ‘comfort’ seats come with heating and ventilation, and there’s also onboard telemetry, a dashcam, and augmented reality navigation. Lamborghini says the Temerario also has more luggage-carrying capacity than the Huracan. Lamborghini Temerario rivals Temerario priced higher than Ferrari 296 GTB and McLaren Artura In India, the Lamborghini Temerario goes up against the Ferrari 296 GTB (Rs 5.4 crore) and McLaren Artura (Rs 5.1 crore). All prices, ex-showroom, India.
