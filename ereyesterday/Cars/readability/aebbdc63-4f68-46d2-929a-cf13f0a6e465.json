SUMMARY/TRANSCRIPT[0:00] Beautiful window here. Ooh, I love this. I don’t know if you remember the old Westphalias — they had flaps. Aha, yeah, yeah. You'd turn the knob and then the flap would open. This is just a single button, like this. Like that. Oh, cool. Ooh, oh yeah — cool.[0:23] Hello, welcome to another episode of the VW ID Talk Podcast. We’re here in Seattle, in front of the VW University, with Dilip. Hello! And his beautiful ID Buzz. All right, so let’s get inside. Okay. And let’s talk. That sounds good.[8:09] Beautiful window here. Ooh, I love this. I don’t know if you remember the old Westphalias — they had flaps. Aha, yeah, yeah. You'd turn the knob and the flap would open. This is just a single button, like this. Like that. Oh, cool. Very cool.[8:25] Right here you can refill the washer fluid, so probably nothing complicated. Yeah. Do you want to check it? I'm not quite sure how to open it. Yeah, I think there’s a lever by the driver’s side. Maybe this one? Yeah, there you go.[8:43] And here are the guts of the ID Buzz. Ooh, nice and clean. Yeah, nice and clean. So we’ve got washer fluid — what else would I need to fill? Washer fluid, and probably if you’re jump-starting the car, here’s the negative terminal. I'm not sure where the positive is.How many electric vehicles have you had? I've just had this one. And this is for your service department — to service the fluids or the AC gas. That's it? That's it. So there’s really nothing to worry about.[9:13] Do you want to check out the back? Yeah, let’s check out the back.[9:16] This is the beautiful logo. Here’s the 360 camera. This lights up at night here in the US. It does? Yeah. Is it true that in Europe it doesn’t? They had some strange limitations. It looks beautiful at night. It does look beautiful. Maybe we can drive over to the shadow there and take a look.[9:33] Do you want to check out the back? Yeah, let’s check the back.[9:38] You're right. Here we go. Oh, it’s coming up. I did see some videos — you have to be careful of the door. Oh, yeah, I see. But you can probably set the maximum height. Oh, is that true? Yeah, with the open button.You’ll be my own service tech whenever I have a question. So you can stop it, and if you press and hold, it will memorize the height.Here’s what we’ve got with this.[15:04] Thank you so much for showing us your beautiful new bus. We wish you many happy miles, Dilip. Thanks for watching, everyone. Please subscribe so you don't miss the next episode. And thank you. Bye.",
