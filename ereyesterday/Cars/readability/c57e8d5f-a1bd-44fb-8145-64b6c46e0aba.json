  "text": "What is “Red Label” ?During the tail-end of the 20th century, performance sub-brands were few and far between. BMW offered a few “M” models, Audi played around with the “RS” name with the RS2 Avant, outsourcing much of its development to Porsche, and AMG — which was an engineering firm independent from Daimler-Benz until 1999. However, fast-forward to the present day, and it seems almost every manufacturer has cooked up a clever name, or sequence of letters, that indicates to buyers that a certain model is “the fast one”. The idea of the performance sub-brand has spread far from its European roots, as seen in Cadillac’s “V” series, Toyota’s “Gazoo Racing (GR)” models, and Hyundai’s “N” performance lineup.In addition to the globalization of the performance sub-brand strategy, buyers have seen the increased dilution of these sub-brands into quasi-meaningless badges that signify even the most minor of performance-enhancing upgrades. In today’s market, it is possible to purchase a Mercedes-Benz CLA250 4MATIC with an “AMG Line” package. As ridiculous as this may sound when compared to the brand’s ethos only a few short decades ago, there is sound reasoning for these decisions from a marketing perspective. The “AMG” name means something to buyers, and one would be hard-pressed to spot a Mercedes-Benz in public these days that is not equipped with the “AMG Line” package. The same can be said for almost every other premium automaker, from BMW’s liberal use of the letter “M” throughout its lineup, Jaguar’s “R-Dynamic” designations, and Audi’s “S-Line” packages.So, if this strategy has proven itself worthy amongst premium-brand automakers, why has Lincoln, in their gradual fading into cultural meaninglessness, not given it a shot?The following renders depict a glimpse into the possibility of a Lincoln performance sub-brand, entitled “Red Label”, in contrast to the “Black Label” prestige lineup. Accompanying each render is a description of its hypothetical performance enhancements, such as powertrain options and other drivetrain features, as well as a strategy for Lincoln to make the most effective use of these models within the current market climate, detailing not only potential rivals but also what characteristics would ensure the competitiveness each model. Each visual render has been created using generative text-to-photo artificial intelligence software, employing official Lincoln press images as canvases.Lincoln Navigator Red LabelLincoln Navigator Red Label Striking audiences with its tidy new facelift, the updated 2025 Lincoln Navigator is a perfect suitor for the “Red Label” treatment, which would place it directly in the line of fire of Cadillac’s Escalade V. In order to aptly defend itself, the Navigator will need to stockpile all that it can from Ford’s parts-bin arsenal.At the heart of its operation would sit the brutal beast that is the Predator V8, Ford’s supercharged 5.2L V8, found in the Mustang Shelby GT500, which produces 760HP and 625 lb-ft of torque in its current form. For its application in the Navigator, it would likely employ a tune that focuses the power plant’s efforts more towards low-end torque to compensate for the increased weight compared to the Mustang. However, its boundless might and distinct exhaust note would be retained. The 10-speed automatic transmission from the standard Navigator would route the excessive power to all four wheels but would need to operate in a state of tune more akin to the Mustang GT, hitting those upshifts hard and appropriately rev-matching downshifts.Cadillac understands that it has a winner on its hands with the Escalade, which has vastly dominated the Navigator culturally and in terms of sales success. As Lincoln’s brand image has faded in favour of Cadillac’s more extroverted appeal, the Escalade’s retention of its signature V8 engine is often cited as a reason for its success over the Navigator. Reuniting the Navigator with its V8-powered roots would serve as an excellent reminder to buyers that the Navigator’s underpinnings are top-notch and could reignite Lincoln’s perception as a powerful symbol of success.Lincoln Aviator Red LabelLincoln Aviator Red LabelLincoln’s Aviator, in its current form, is something of a squandered asset in Lincoln’s arsenal. Unlike its Cadillac competitor, the XT6, the Aviator benefits from a longitudinally mounted drivetrain, resulting in superior handling dynamics and greater up-market buyer appeal. However, its available powertrains are relatively lacklustre compared to its German foes, failing to effectively capitalize on Ford’s investment into its chassis development, at least in terms of excitement. Where Cadillac relies on its brilliant CT5-V Blackwing to showcase the brand’s performance engineering potential, the ability to integrate that same level of performance in a crossover, a body-style with a much greater contemporary demand, could see far greater commercial success for Lincoln.Additionally, in seeing the death of the mighty Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and impending doom of Jaguar’s glorious F-Pace SVR, the “Red Label” Aviator would serve as the only remaining crossover on the market to offer the definitive driving experience of a supercharged V8. Thanks to its reduced weight compared to its body-on-frame SUV big brother, the supercharged 5.2L V8 could also operate in a similar state of tune as the Shelby GT500, producing around 760HP and 625 lb-ft of torque and routing that thrust to all four wheels through its 10-speed automatic transmission, thus offering the added bonus of a power bump compared to the aforementioned discontinued offerings, which produce 707HP and 567HP, respectively.Lincoln Nautilus Red LabelLincoln Nautilus Red LabelWhereas the Aviator benefits from a longitudinal drivetrain, the Nautilus unfortunately does not. Despite this setback when compared to its potential rivals, the Audi SQ5, Mercedes-AMG GLC 43, and BMW X3 M40i, the Nautilus still has the potential to outshine its classmates by focusing on being the more liveable choice rather than attempting to out-perform on the track. The Nautilus benefits from its larger proportions compared to its aforementioned competitors, which results in superior cargo space and cabin comfort. Lincoln’s reputation for plush pleasantry has not been diminished in the updated Nautilus, and its signature “Perfect Position” 24-setting massage seats and Active Noise Control features would be retained in the “Red Label” variant in order to offer a significantly more comfortable experience compared to its sport-focused competitors.Of course, being a performance-oriented model, the Nautilus Red-Label must still be able to hold its own on the road. Seeing as the Nautilus shares its platform with the China-only Ford Edge L, the twin-turbocharged 2.7L EcoBoost V6 from the ST variant of its predeceasing generation seems to be the optimal powertrain choice due to its compactness. Placed under the hood of the discontinued Edge ST, this power plant produced 335HP and 380 lb-ft of torque – numbers that would place the Nautilus “Red Label” in the same class as its performance variant competitors as is, but Lincoln could surely benefit from uncorking some extra power in the top end to give it a leg up. Power would be delivered to all four wheels through Ford’s Intelligent All-Wheel Drive system and an 8-speed automatic transmission in an aggressive state of tune.Lincoln Zephyr Red Label (Sedan)While the prospect of Lincoln re-entering a traditional car into its North American lineup remains unlikely, a sedan still remains within its Chinese offerings. The gorgeous Lincoln Zephyr, built by Changan Ford China, provides a compelling foundation for a reasonably-affordable premium sport sedan. Although the Zephyr’s 2.0L EcoBoost 4-cylinder produces a healthy 243HP and 277 lb-ft of torque, it’s unlikely that the sedan would steer many buyers away from the similarly priced Nautilus in North America in its standard form.That being said, Lincoln could take a page out of Volkswagen’s playbook, who discontinued the standard Golf in North America after the 2021 model year, but still offers its performance variants, the GTI and Golf R, due to their enthusiast appeal. The precedent set by Volkswagen in this decision proved that while standard Golf buyers preferred the increased ride height of VW’s similarly priced crossover offerings, buyers of the performance variants valued the more agile hatchback. Thus, the case could be made for Lincoln to offer the Zephyr in the North American market exclusively as a “Red Label” variant, using a similar powertrain setup to the aforementioned Nautilus “Red Label”. This would see the use of the twin-turbocharged 2.7L EcoBoost V6 with power and torque figures in the mid-300s, offering a dazzlingly styled and massively comfortable alternative to the Audi S4, BMW M340i, and Mercedes-AMG C43.Lincoln Zephyr Red Label (Estate)As sedans have progressively fallen out of fashion in favour of crossovers throughout the past decade, station wagons have made somewhat of a comeback, as they combine both the enhanced cargo space and practicality that buyers appreciate in crossovers with the more desirable handling dynamics of traditional cars. An estate variant of the Zephyr “Red Label” could be a bold but potentially rewarding move for Lincoln, as many enthusiasts lament the exclusion of performance-oriented wagons such as the Mercedes-AMG C43 Estate, Audi S4 Avant, and BMW M340i Touring from being offered in the American market. Adding the Zephyr “Red Label” estate to Lincoln’s lineup would offer consumers an alternative body-style to sway them away from German competitors who continue to hold out on American buyers.Lincoln Mark LT Red LabelEnthusiasts often groan about the disappearance of the factory “street truck”, pickup trucks stuffed with high-performance engines, sticky tires, and stiffened suspensions, sold right out of dealer showrooms. In recent years, these trucks have been replaced with off-road focused performance variants, such as the Ford F-150 Raptor and the RAM 1500 TRX. However, most never encounter much rough terrain, as the prospect of scratching up a six-figure truck doesn’t always sit well with owners. The Lincoln Mark LT could call the TRX’s bluff, trading out off-road capability for a high-end interior and road-friendly suspension. This would also mark the return of the beloved Lincoln pickup truck, a niche offering, seen in the Blackwood and Mark LT models, that fused the durability and practicality of the Ford F-150 with the plush comfort of a Lincoln, with the added bonus of stuffing a 700HP+ supercharged 5.2L Predator V8 under the hood.BONUS: Lincoln Mark IX (Coupe \u0026 Cabriolet)While the possibility of Lincoln offering a 9th iteration in its legendary line of land yachts is slim, the idea makes for an interesting hypothesis. In its 7th and 8th generations, the big Lincoln coupe shared its platform with the Ford Mustang (and Mercury Cougar), allowing for superior handling dynamics compared to the front-wheel drive Cadillac Eldorado and enough brute force to out-accelerate the Lexus SC400.The contemporary landscape for the market segment the Lincoln coupe once belonged to is admittedly scant, but alas it remains as a playing field for brands to offer attainable halo cars. Lexus continues to play here with their LC500, and Jaguar used its F-Type to retain its sporting image through an era of mediocre crossover and sedan offerings. Lincoln could benefit from employing a similar strategy in offering an “affordable dream car” in a potential Mark IX and could use the same recipe as seen in the past to achieve this. Using the contemporary Mustang platform, albeit likely stretched out for a longer wheelbase, paired with the highest-output variant of the Coyote 5.0L V8 (similar to the use of the DOHC variant of the 4.6L Modular V8 in the Mark VIII), found in the “Dark Horse”, power figures would sit at 500HP and 418 lb-ft of torque. With performance comparable to its potential Lexus competitor, the Mark IX would lean further in the direction of comfort, offering a four-seat cabin layout and enough cargo capacity for 3-4 sets of golf clubs, and position itself in Lincoln’s lineup as an attainable, brand image boosting, flagship coupe. What could Red Label accomplish?For Lincoln and the Ford Motor Company in general, establishing a performance sub-brand under the Lincoln name would give the manufacturing titan an opportunity to emphasize its capabilities and offer exciting, cost-effective alternatives to German rivals who have successfully taken advantage of this approach for many years. Whereas Cadillac has successfully pivoted away from cushy, baby-boomer oriented land-yachts to athletic performers that give German rivals a serious run for their money, Lincoln took on the Japanese premium brand approach, and its sales have followed suit. While Lexus remains an anomaly, Acura and Infiniti have seen sales struggles in recent years akin to Lincoln, thanks in part to outdated products and uninteresting options. By establishing a Red Label performance sub-brand, Lincoln could remedy its image and trickle down performance innovation throughout its regular lineup over time, ultimately adding some zest.",

Although the Zephyr’s 2.0L EcoBoost 4-cylinder produces a healthy 243HP and 277 lb-ft of torque, it’s unlikely that the sedan would steer many buyers away from the similarly priced Nautilus in North America in its standard form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat being said, Lincoln could take a page out of \u003ca href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/\"\u003eVolkswagen\u003c/a\u003e’s playbook, who discontinued the standard Golf in North America after the 2021 model year, but still offers its performance variants, the GTI and Golf R, due to their enthusiast appeal.
