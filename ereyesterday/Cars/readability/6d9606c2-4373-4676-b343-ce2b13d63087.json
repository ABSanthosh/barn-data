  "text": "Chrysler's practically dead, but there's hope for the future 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier The winners of Stellantis’ latest Drive for Design Contest have been announced. Ryan Panizzoli’s Chrysler Quantum took first and he’ll be given an internship with Ram. Felix Bucaro and Owen Bronson also earned praise for their Airstream and 600 studies. Stellantis’ latest Drive for Design Contest kicked off earlier this year and asked high school students to create the Chrysler vehicle of their dreams. Less than 30 eligible students participated, which is a shockingly low number, but the winners have now been crowned. Top honors went to 11th grader Ryan Panizzoli from Michigan. He envisioned the Chrysler Quantum, which is billed as the pinnacle of innovation and sophisticated design. It draws inspiration from luxury vehicles from the 1930’s and features a long hood as well as a floating roof. The teen also imagined the car would use quantum computing and have optic fibers integrated into the body.

He’ll also get an Apple iPad Pro and Apple Pencil as well as an invitation to serve as a student judge at the EyesOn Design car show in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. 11th grader Felix Bucaro, from Wisconsin, took second place with his futuristic Airstream. The fighter jet-like car features a retractable canopy and body as well as a central driver’s seat that is flanked by two rear passengers. There’s also aircraft-inspired steering and blade-like taillights. Third place went to 11th grader Owen Bronson from Michigan. His Chrysler 600 celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Chrysler Six and is a futuristic sports car. Little is known about it, but the model vaguely recalls the Firepower concept from 2005. While Bucaro and Bronson miss out on the internship, both will receive an iPad Pro and Pencil as well as a virtual networking opportunity with the Stellantis design team. They’ll also be invited to judge the aforementioned car show as well as be given a scholarship to the Transportation Design summer program at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit.",
