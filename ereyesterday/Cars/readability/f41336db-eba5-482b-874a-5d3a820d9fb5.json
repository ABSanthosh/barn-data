  "text": "With roughly 2.7 million people living in Brooklyn, New York, the serendipitous tale of this BMW R100R café racer stands out as something truly extraordinary. It all began when Tobias van Schneider—a German multi-disciplinary designer living in Brooklyn—spotted a custom BMW R80 on the street. Enamored, he nabbed a photo of it and sent it to a friend. That friend happened to be the founder of Myth Motor, Matias Corea. Matias immediately recognized the bike and knew its creator—Argentine-born Sebastian ‘Seba’ Achaval, who works under the moniker ‘oneYedeer.’ Matias connected Tobias and Seba, and the idea of ‘The Escape Machine’ was born. Initially working with a running 1984 BMW R80ST, Tobias and Seba started hashing out ideas. “Anyone familiar with me knows I’m passionate about my work,” says Tobias. “Every project must be a designed object, an art piece, a unique concept that performs as beautifully as it looks.” “I imagined something that wouldn’t feel too fabricated. It had to be handmade, something with charm, something with a unique personality and road presence. Teaming up with Seba marked the beginning of a beautiful project and friendship.” During this initial planning phase, Seba learned of Tobias’ pristine 1989 Mercedes-Benz 190E. Finished in a warm metallic grey, the Merc’s angular lines, blocky elements, and distinctive rear spoiler triggered a thought; what if those elements could somehow be translated to the BMW? “The proposal to use a Mercedes color on a BMW was unconventional, but we embraced the creative tension,” says Tobias. Seba started by upgrading the BMW R80ST’s front end, not knowing that it would soon be swapped out for a more suitable donor. Using a conversion kit from Cognito Moto, he transplanted the forks and brake calipers from a 2018-model Honda CBR1000RR, matched to a 17” rim and Galfer rotors. The swap gave the front end a more muscular appearance with the benefit of better handling—but it left the rear end hopelessly outgunned. Designed for a skinny 18” wheel, the R80’s swingarm wasn’t going to accommodate a sufficiently wide rear wheel without serious modifications. To solve the problem, Seba and Tobias got their hands on a 1993-model BMW R100R, chosen for its paralever swingarm and 140-section 17” rear wheel. Rather than perform a rear-end swap, the guys decided to use the whole R100R, so that they could benefit from its bigger engine, too. Within hours of laying hands on the bike, Seba had transplanted the R80ST’s upgraded front end. It was around this time that Matias once again joined the conversation. Matias knows old boxer motors inside out—and, with extensive experience riding them overland, likes to build them tough and reliable. Despite the R100R’s low mileage and fair condition, Matias tore into the engine to identify any weak points. In went new piston rings and con rod bearings, plus a full complement of gaskets and seals. The rear main seal was refurbished, the oil pump was cleaned and inspected, and the timing chain, crank nose seal, and clutch were all replaced. Matias also installed a new starter motor from EME, which provided more cranking power, less weight, and less battery draw. The carbs were rebuilt and re-jetted, and the airbox was swapped for pod filters. Finally, Matias overhauled the transmission and installed a custom cooling system. Meanwhile, Seba continued fabricating the BMW’s new bodywork, flitting between sporty café racer concepts and the design language of Tobias’ late-80s Merc. The brief called for a solo seat, so Seba designed a slim, retro-futuristic tail section with integrated LED lighting. The boxy component was welded together from sections of laser-cut steel, before being finished off with seat foam and Alcantara upholstery. Seba also fabricated a custom subframe to support the new tailpiece, basing it on a central backbone with triangular reinforcements. The foot controls were then moved to the OEM passenger peg mounts to create a more focused riding position. Another friend, Marlon, was roped in to help create the BMW’s blocky 3D-printed fairing. Mounted on custom-made brackets, it’s equipped with the rectangular headlight from a 1980s Jeep Wrangler. Behind it, a built-in dashboard houses a stylish Motogadget speedo. Under the hood, the bike was rewired around a Motogadget controller and an Antigravity battery. The cockpit sports fully adjustable billet aluminum clip-ons, fitted with upgraded controls, Motogadget switches, Rizoma reservoirs, and braided hoses. Robbie Nigl at Peach Pit Painting was responsible for laying down the Mercedes-Benz paint job. Look closely, and you’ll notice that the bottom edge of the fuel tank has been finished in black. Tobias wanted to create a visual split in the design, so everything below the line was treated with satin black finishes. Final touches include a Mondaine timepiece, embedded in the top yoke, and bronze tank emblems by jewelry designer Ashley Keeper. Pipe wrap on the BMW’s two-into-one-into-two exhaust system adds a rough-hewn touch to the otherwise slick boxer. Two years after spotting that BMW R80 on the street, Tobias’ Escape Machine was finally brought to life. And judging by his response, we’d say that Seba, Matias, and everyone else that worked on the project, nailed it. “The finished motorcycle represents more than just a custom build—it’s a philosophical statement about breaking traditional boundaries in automotive design,” says Tobias. “By merging Mercedes-Benz aesthetic elements with BMW mechanics, Seba created something entirely new while respecting both brands’ heritage. The bike maintains its clear identity as a BMW airhead, but with an unexpected twist that only those with a keen eye for design might fully appreciate.” House of van Schneider | oneYedeer | Myth Motor",
