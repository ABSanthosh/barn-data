Chassis 12897 is said to have remained with the original owner in Canada through 2020 before being brought to the US. The car is finished in Rosso over Panna leather and powered by a 5.2-liter quad-cam V12 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Further equipment includes pop-up headlights, scissor doors, and 15″ OZ Racing multi-piece wheels along with a gated shifter, electronic climate control, and an Alpine stereo. Now showing 6k kilometers (~4k miles), this 25th Anniversary Countach is offered by the selling dealer in Illinois with an owner’s manual, a collection of luggage, and a Montana title. Originally penned by Marcello Gandini, the Countach’s bodywork was updated by Horacio Pagani for the 25th Anniversary edition of the model that debuted in 1988. Further details include carbon and Kevlar body panels, gradually inclined air intakes with longitudinal fins, and revisions to the front fascia, engine cover, and sills when compared to earlier models. This example is finished in Rosso and features a body-color, US-specification front bumper. The bodywork is mounted over a tubular steel space frame and incorporates pop-up headlights and integrated fog lights along with NACA ducts aft of the scissor doors. The 15″ OZ Racing multi-piece alloy wheels are wrapped with 225/50 front and 345/35 rear Pirelli P-Zero Asimmetrico tires. The Countach features a fully independent suspension with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers as well as four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. The cockpit houses power-adjustable bucket seats trimmed in Panna leather with red piping, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the center console, lower dashboard, and door panels. Further appointments include electronic climate control, power windows, and power-adjustable side mirrors as well as black-finished sill guards with 25th Anniversary logos. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is paired with a dogleg-pattern gated shifter featuring a reverse lockout. Jaeger instrumentation consists of a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline along with auxiliary gauges, and a VDO digital clock sits to the left of the Alpine AM/FM/CD head unit. The six-digit odometer shows 6k kilometers (~4k miles). The Bizzarrini-designed 5.2-liter V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Revised intakes on the 25th Anniversary Countach allowed for the radiators to be mounted vertically for improved cooling. Output was factory rated at 420 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer tells us that the car underwent a full service in 2020. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the former of which is mounted in the middle of the car, ahead of the engine. A collection of four brown leather bags will accompany the car along with a US-market owner’s manual. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported.
