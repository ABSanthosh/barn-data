  "text": "Iowa has passed a bill that prohibits people from issuing formal complaints about nearby racetracks. House Bill 645 is designed to protect racing venues from being subject to legal actions pertaining to noise and nuisance claims.While perhaps not as famous for its technical racing as its corn production, Iowa does have the asphalt-laden Hawkeye Downs and Iowa Speedways. But the state is absolutely loaded up with dirt tracks — including the historic Hamilton County Speedway, high-banked Boone Speedway, sprint-car focused Knoxville Raceway, Winneshiek Raceway, Stuart International Speedway, Maquoketa Speedway, Mason City Motor Speedway, and others.Needless to say, if you like oval tracks (especially of the dirt variety) Iowa has you more than covered. But possessing a fair number of venues catering to motorsports has apparently resulted in a surplus of noise complaints from the neighbors. Those will soon not be an issue, as the new law is supposed to come into play at the start of July, after being signed by Governor Kim Reynolds.According to The Drive, Iowa’s state senate and house of representatives passed HB645 unanimously. Most of the support came down to legislators expressing concerns that pressure from new housing developments potentially undermining one of the state’s biggest sources of tourism. In fact, the bill focuses specifically on the new neighbors and leaves the old timers alone. Residents that predate the racetracks can actually still file formal complaints, whereas the individuals who moved in after the fact cannot. While there was some pushback made by a few developers vying to build near tracks, automotive businesses focused on racing or the aftermarket were in broad support of the bill. From The Drive: The bill was unsurprisingly supported by the Specialty Equipment Manufacturers Association (better known as SEMA) as well as the Performance Racing Industry group.“Iowa’s race tracks are more than just entertainment venues; they are economic engines that support local businesses, create jobs and generate substantial revenue for the state,” PRI said in a press release. “This immunity is essential for the ongoing operation and advancement of these venues.”Iowa Speedway in Newton hosts national competitions such as NASCAR’s Cup and Xfinity Series as well as IndyCar, though it’s far from the state’s only track. There are plenty more short ovals—dirt and paved—where racers are running on any given weekend. But of course, HB645 is even more crucial for those smaller venues where fans support grassroots motorsport and local businesses.Despite an increasing number of racetracks instituting decibel limits, noise and nuisance complaints have actually increased in recent years. Laguna Seca is probably the most famous, due to the fact that the developers are actually trying to use the complaints to permanently shut that circuit down in a bid to raise land value. Certain municipalities have passed laws similar to Iowa in an effort to combat the trend. However, plenty of small and large tracks continue to face problems. There’s actually a drag strip near me that has allegedly started to come under fire as more homes are being built nearby. That said, complaints haven’t even been limited to racing venues. Over the last few years, counties across America have begun launching all kinds of initiatives designed to combat noise pollution that target vehicles deemed too noisy. It has certainly been happening everywhere I’ve ever lived, including Michigan’s Oakland County (where the Woodward Dream Cruise is held annually) and New York (which has a dedicated hotline that lets people tattle on loud cars and motorcycles). As it’s typically the squeaky wheel that gets the grease, nobody ever hears from residents who don’t seem to mind. Meanwhile, the local authorities are more than happy to enforce the new rules because they’ll come with fresh fines opening up the door for revenue. It certainly wouldn’t be popular with everyone and there are certainly modified vehicles you’d probably not want to hear idling in the garage next door. But car people and race fans would presumably welcome more legislation telling people to mind their own business.",
