It is finished in Titanium Silver Metallic over black Nappa leather and is powered by a 4.9-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a color-matched removable hardtop, a black soft top, 18” split-spoke wheels, xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable sport seats, a six-disc CD changer, a Harman Kardon sound system, navigation, and air conditioning. This Z8 is now offered by the selling dealer with a window sticker, a coffee table book, the owner’s manual, a battery tender, a first-aid kit, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Z8 features bodywork designed by Henrik Fisker with inspiration from the BMW 507 roadster, and the aluminum body panels are mounted over an aluminum spaceframe. This example is finished in Titanium Silver Metallic (354) and features include a black soft top, xenon headlights with washers, front fender air extractors with BMW roundels, polished mirror caps, dual exhaust outlets, and neon taillights and turn indicators. Finish imperfections are noted on the hardtop, and photos in the gallery detail scratches on the front bumper cover. The 18” split-spoke wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza RE040 tires. The four-wheel disc brake system is equipped with Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), and additional features include Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and All-Season Traction (ASC). The cabin features black Nappa leather upholstery that extends from the heated power-adjustable seats to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Amenities include a six-disc CD changer, navigation, a Harman Kardon sound system, leather-wrapped roll hoops, air conditioning, and cruise control. The hardtop’s headliner is sagging. The banjo-spoke steering wheel features silver trim within a leather-wrapped rim. Centrally mounted instrumentation includes a 155-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer with an integrated analog clock, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The SRS alert is illuminated. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles. The 4.9-liter S62 V8 was shared with the contemporary E39 M5 and features double-VANOS variable valve timing for a factory-rated output of 394 horsepower and 368 lb-ft torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Wyoming Valley Motors in Larksville, Pennsylvania, along with factory colors, equipment, and a total retail price of $134,295. The sale also included a coffee table book, the owner’s manual, a BMW-branded Motorola cell phone, a battery tender, a first-aid kit, and a tool kit.
