  "text": "You'd be hard pressed to find a 350Z that makes as much as an impression as this one July 12, 2025 at 21:01 by Brad Anderson Nissan 350Z listed in Japan with a full Toyota GT 86 front fascia swap. The widebody kit and wheels create a dramatic exterior transformation. It’s being auctioned with 67,000 miles and starting bid of around $4,700. We love the first-generation Toyota GT 86 here at Carscoops. It proved itself to be one of the best bang-for-your-buck sports cars at the time of its launch in 2012 and is still heaps of fun to drive. However, we don’t love the 86 so much as to overhaul the front end of a Nissan 350Z (ed’s note: an even better sports car, if you ask me) to make it look like a Toyota, as the owner of this car has done. This weird 350Z is currently up for sale on Yahoo! Auctions in Japan and does have some things going for it. For starters, the glistening shade of metallic purple looks amazing, and the flared wheel arches aren’t too shabby either. However, as often happens in the tuning scene, once someone starts modifying a car, it can be difficult for them to stop. Read: Want A Nissan Z That Looks Like A Maserati And Porsche Had A Baby? Gone is the standard fascia of the Nissan and in its place sits the front of a GT 86. This includes the headlights, fog lights, bumper, and grille. The owner has then affixed a bright red splitter and matching red side skirts. Then there are the wheels. Although they sit nicely within the fenders, the candy apple red finish doesn’t complement the purple paint. The bronze-painted brake calipers don’t suit the car either. The rear half is perhaps even crazier than the front. A lowered rear window has been fitted alongside a large lip spoiler on the decklid. There is then a huge rear wing with uprights that affix directly to the rear bumper. A new diffuser has also been added. Extensive work has also been done on the cabin. There are a pair of new carbon fiber bucket seats wrapped in bright red leather, which look fabulous. The red leather then extends across the door panels, dashboard, transmission tunnel, and steering wheel. Housed within the trunk are tanks for the adjustable air ride suspension. According to the listing, the car has covered roughly 109,000 kilometers, or about 67,000 miles. The starting bid is set at 691,000 yen, which translates to around $4,700 at today’s exchange rate. Whether it’s a great deal or just a curiosity depends on your taste, and how far you’re willing to go in the name of standing out from the rest.",
