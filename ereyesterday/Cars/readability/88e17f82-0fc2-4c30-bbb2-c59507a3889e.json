  "text": "Spy shots reveal the new 911 halo model which could develop over 700 hp thanks to hybrid assistance May 14, 2025 at 20:21 by Chris Chilton A Porsche 911 GT2 RS prototype has been spied at the Nurburgring. The extra-wide track weapon will get a turbocharged hybrid flat-six. Rumors suggest the RS will make over 700 hp and cost almost $500k. With its wild scoops and spoilers, track-focused chassis and a screaming 518 hp (525 PS) flat-six, the Porsche 911 GT3 RS is a world away from an entry-level Carrera and is the daddy of the 911 family. But not for long, because Porsche is about to make even it look mild by resurrecting the mighty GT2 RS. These spy shots show a prototype of the new 911 flagship testing at Germany’s Nurburgring and the roads around it, and right away you can see that it’s much wider than even the GT3 RS. The front fenders look just like the ones on that model, but extend much further outwards, and the rears feature riveted arch extensions. Related: Porsche’s New Flagship Could Be Raging New 911 GT2 RS The mods give a strange look because the prototype seems to be running a stock GT3 RS track width, meaning the wheels look lost on the arches. But by the time the GT2 RS makes its debut we can expect those fenders to be flush with an even fatter set of forged rims to provide even more grip and traction. It’ll need all the help it can get in that department, because Intel suggests the new GT2 will feature a hybrid-assisted, turbocharged flat-six engine that produces over 700 hp (710 PS). Sure, plenty of supercars make more horsepower, but that’s almost 200 hp (203 hp) more than the GT3 RS generates, and the latter is the fourth-fastest car around the Nürburgring with a time of 6:49.33. The second-fastest remains the old GT2 RS with the optional Manthey performance kit, which did the job in 6:43.30, and even five years later is still only kept off the top spot by the much more powerful and more expensive AMG One’s 6:35.18 time. But while the new GT2 RS will still look inexpensive next to multi-million dollar hypercars like the AMG One, it sounds like it’ll be significantly more expensive than the old car, which had an MSRP of $294,450 in 2019. A screenshot allegedly from a German dealer selling a configuration for the 992 GT2 RS showed a €450,000 ($504,000) price, and suggested it would be on sale in 2026. Images: Baldauf, SHProshots",
