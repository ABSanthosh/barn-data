  "description": "“The Vision 7S concept (showcased at the Auto Expo) will come to India in production-spec in 2027,” confirmed Petr Janeba, Skoda India brand director, in a conversation with our sister publication Autocar Professional. This concept will spawn a three-row SUV and go into production overseas in 2026, and recently, a camouflaged test mule was spied in Sweden. This concept debut's the Skoda Modern Solid design language The central touchscreen can rotate between portrait and landscape orientations Skoda first showcased the Vision 7S concept in 2022, and this concept debuted the brand’s Modern Solid design language. Skoda Vision 7S: Modern Solid exterior design The prototype featured flush door handles, and continued with the concept's long, sloping roofline. However, much of the design features have been toned down, including the pronounced door sills. Overall, the SUV appears to be more slab-sided than the concept. At approximately 4.9 metres in length, the car is around 250mm longer than the Enyaq, making it Skoda’s largest electric SUV yet. Skoda Vision 7S: interior, features While the prototype's interior hasn't been seen yet, the concept gets an oval-shaped steering wheel. Its dashboard is devoid of buttons and houses a large rotatable touchscreen (similar to BYDs). The concept was only a 4-seater, but the production-spec model can be expected with both 5- and 7-seater configurations. The concept also used sustainable materials like leather-free upholstery, which could make its way to the production model. Skoda Vision 7S: battery size, range Skoda showcased the Vision 7S concept with an 89kWh battery pack, with a claimed WLTP range of over 600km. Skoda claims that the production-spec model will support fast charging of up to 200kW. While powertrain details remain unclear, the SUV may offer both rear- and all-wheel drive options with outputs similar to the Enyaq facelift.
