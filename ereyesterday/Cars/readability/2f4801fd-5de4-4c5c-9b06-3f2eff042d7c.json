  "description": "BMW’s M performance division has revealed the first set of camouflaged images of the M3 electric prototype (codenamed: ZA0), and it looks inspired by BMW’s Neue Classe Vision Concept showcased last year. Notably, this follows sightings of the standard i3 Neue Klasse sedan in November. BMW plans to expand the Neue Klasse line-up with models like the M4 EV and iX3 M by 2028, catering to a range of performance needs. Neue Classe is BMW’s grounds-up EV architecture   M3 EV has a much sportier stance than the regular i3 sedan It may arrive with an AWD system BMW M3 EV exterior design Up front, the M3 EV gets double-barrel lights surrounding the low-slung signature kidney grille and a very clean looking bumper that’s devoid of aggressive cuts and creases. In profile, the overall silhouette resembles the concept’s three-box design. Wider wheel arches, M design bits like flared fenders and sportier alloy wheels set it apart from the standard i3 Neue Klasse sibling. It also seems to sport a much lower stance, which could be due to a sportier suspension. A sloping rear roofline and big boot are also reminiscent of the concept.   BMW M3 EV powertrain, specs Though BMW hasn’t confirmed specifications, media reports suggest the base M3 EV could deliver up to 670hp, with more powerful variants potentially on the way. Earlier, BMW had hinted at a quad-motor setup making over 1,300hp, but we believe that power output is likely for models higher in the line-up. BMW Neue Klasse platform The electric-only platform is designed to support structure-integrated batteries from 75-150kWh. These in-house developed cylindrical cells also allow for fast charging speeds reaching 270kW. BMW stated that they are 20 percent more energy dense than the prismatic cells used in their previous EVs. Both RWD and AWD setups will be supported and can handle a variety of electric motor configurations. The first model built on the Neue Klasse platform will debut in H2 2025, paving the way for five additional models by 2030. BMW-owned Mini will also utilise this architecture.
