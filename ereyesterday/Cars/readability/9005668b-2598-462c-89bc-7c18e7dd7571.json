  "description": "Ford's compact SUV has topped the UK sales rankings for the second year in a row The Ford Puma has been crowned the UK's best-selling car of 2024, topping the charts for the second consecutive year ahead of other hot-selling rivals.  According to data supplied by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Ford's compact SUV outsold the Kia Sportage and the Nissan Qashqai, making it the most popular new car on UK roads.  Ford sold 48,340 Pumas, although Kia was close behind, shipping 47,163 Sportages. Nissan finished in third and fourth place with the Juke and Qashqai respectively, while the Tesla Model Y rounded out the top five.  While the Model Y didn't quite reach the top spot, it was the UK's most popular electric car, with the American brand selling 32,862 units - almost double the total of the second-placed Audi Q4 E-tron.  Overall, 2024 was a reasonably positive year for the UK car industry, with new car registrations almost reaching two million units, rising 2.6% year on year.  But which cars join the Puma, Sportage and Qashqai in the UK's best-selling cars top 10?  See the full list below, with data from January to December 2024.  Best-selling cars in the UK in 2024 1. Ford Puma – 48,340 units It's official: the Ford Puma is the UK's best-selling car of 2024. Why is it so popular? The Puma appeals thanks to its engaging driving dynamics and attractive pricing, plus it has the option of a hot Puma ST variant. It may not be the Fiesta we all know and love, but it’s a good, capable alternative nonetheless. It even outsold the Ford Transit and Transit Custom vans, which is no mean feat. There's also the electric Ford Puma Gen-E on the way, which we're equally excited about.  Read our Ford Puma review 2. Kia Sportage – 47,163 units The Kia Sportage had a good year in 2023, finishing fourth in the UK sales charts, and it's having an even stronger showing in 2024, ending the year in second place. Consistency is key for this family SUV, which entered its fifth generation at the tail end of 2022, sporting an eye-catching design, on-trend powertrains and compelling value for money. Read our Kia Sportage review 3. Nissan Qashqai – 42,418 units The Nissan Qashqai was the UK's best-seller in 2022, but it has since been outpaced by rivals, finishing in second in 2023 and third in 2024. That said, it's still extremely popular and continues to appeal to buyers here with its excellent practicality. The British-built family crossover's appeal has also no doubt been bolstered by the addition of electrified powertrains for its third generation.  Read our Nissan Qashqai review 4. Nissan Juke – 34,454 units The Nissan Juke remains a popular car among UK buyers, having finished 2023 in fourth place - a rise of four positions compared with 2023.  The small SUV went on sale with a brand-new design in 2020, and then a facelifted version arrived in the middle of last year, along with hybrid power for the first time. Read our Nissan Juke review 5. Tesla Model Y – 32,862 units The Tesla Model Y has popped in and out of the top 10 throughout the year, but it finished 2024 as the UK's best-selling EV and the only one in the top 10.  A small update in 2024 brought a new battery, which seems to have contributed to the crossover overcoming a sales slump. A bigger update is coming next year, introducing revised styling in line with the Model 3 saloon and an overhauled interior. Read our Tesla Model Y review   6. Volkswagen Golf – 32,370 units The Volkswagen Golf isn’t quite as popular as it once was but it’s still a top pick for drivers on the hunt for a good all-round family hatchback or estate. In fact, it's slowly creeping its way back up the charts, now sitting in fifth place. This could be a hugely important time for the Golf, which has just gone on sale in facelifted 'Mk8.5' form.  The German stalwart has been kept fresh with a wide-reaching technology update, a design revamp, a more powerful GTI and a longer-range plug-in hybrid so it could climb higher still.  Read our Volkswagen Golf review  7. Hyundai Tucson – 32,174 units The Hyundai Tucson is one of the UK’s most popular SUVs, having regularly appeared in the top 10 in 2024. It was renewed in 2021 with a fresh front end that featured a unique, eye-catching lighting arrangement. Its plush interior and range of electrified powertrains are also attractive propositions for many Brits. Read our Hyundai Tucson review 8. MG HS – 30,270 units The MG HS offers class-leading value for money, and it entered a second generation this year, putting it in line for even more mainstream success in 2025 and beyond. Available with a petrol engine or a more frugal plug-in hybrid, the family crossover also comes with good levels of equipment as standard, including a 10.1in touchscreen, a 360deg parking camera and smartphone mirroring.  Read our MG HS review 9. Volvo XC40 – 30,202 Volvo's compact SUV offers a premium feel for a reasonable price point, and it has steered clear of offering the same interior as the new EX30 and the EX90.  It still looks great to our eyes, and there are few models out there that can match it for dynamics, comfort and functionality.  It's wonderfully polished on the road and seriously easy to live with, so it's no surprise to see the model's continuing popularity.  Read our Volvo XC40 review 10. Volkswagen Polo – 27,674 Despite its price (and size) increasing over the years, the Volkswagen Polo is still a brilliant small car. It's comfortable, refined, well-built and spacious, while also offering some of the best economy rates in the class. The latest version is the best to drive yet and is packed with technology. But how long will it stick around for? That we're not sure of, so make the most of it before it goes the way of the Ford Fiesta.  Read our Volkswagen Polo review",
