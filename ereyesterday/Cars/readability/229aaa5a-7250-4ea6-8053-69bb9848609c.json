  "text": "It costs more than a Bentley Bentayga, but it's hard to put a price on awesome April 24, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Land Rover Classic has introduced a new Defender V8 Soft Top restomod. It’s based on the 2012-2016 Defender 90 and features a 405 hp V8 engine. Customization options include 49 paint finishes and bespoke interior choices. Summer is right around the corner and Land Rover Classic has just unveiled the ultimate beach accessory – the Defender V8 Works Bespoke Soft Top. While that’s quite a mouthful, the model oozes old school charm. Set to become the first Defender Soft Top in nearly a decade, the vehicle is based on a Defender 90 that was originally produced between 2012 and 2016. Once a donor vehicle has been found, it’s “comprehensively enhanced and reengineered.” More: Land Rover Brings Back Classic Defender V8 With A Modern Twist Since this is essentially a light retromod, there aren’t many changes worth mentioning. However, the model features a bespoke canvas roof that is available in Black, Dark Khaki, Navy, or Sand. Land Rover said the “side and rear sections can be unzipped and rolled‑up for open air driving while retaining a degree of protection from the elements.” They also noted extra tie‑down points have been added to help keep the roof secure at highway speeds. Customers looking for something more minimalist can opt for the available Bikini roof. It’s offered in the same colors, but only protects front‑seat occupants. Speaking of options, buyers are presented with 49 paint finishes. If they don’t find one to their liking, they can use the Works Bespoke match‑to‑sample color service. Clients can also customize an assortment of other details including the grille, door handles, and bonnet script – among other things. 16-inch steel wheels with mud‑terrain tires are standard. However, customers can get larger 18-inch alloys in either Black or Limestone. Customization extends to the interior, where there are five monotone and eight two‑tone leather options ranging from Liberty Blue to Garnet. Clients can even get a custom surfboard rack or an onboard wine cooler. Power is provided by a 5.0-liter V8 that produces 405 hp (302 kW / 411 PS) and 380 lb-ft (515 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to an eight‑speed automatic transmission and a standard all-wheel drive system with a two‑speed transfer case. This enables the model to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 5.6 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 106 mph (171 km/h). Speaking of performance, Land Rover Classic has improved the driving experience thanks to beefier Alcon brakes and a revised suspension. The latter features Eibach anti‑roll bars, Bilstein dampers, and revamped spring rates. UK pricing starts at £195,000 ($260,170) before local taxes. That’s nearly £50,000 ($66,730) more than the new Defender OCTA and buyers will only get a one‑year unlimited mileage warranty.",
