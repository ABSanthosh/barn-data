  "description": "After teasing them earlier in the week, Honda has launched the E-Clutch variants of the CB650R (Rs 9.60 lakh) and CBR650R (Rs 10.40 lakh). Both variants are Rs 40,000 more expensive than their standard counterparts.  CB650R, CBR650R E Clutch are very similar to standard models E Clutch system adds 2.8kg to kerb weight Both bikes available in two colours - red and black Honda CB650R and CBR650R E Clutch models launched Both bikes weigh 2.8kg more than the base model The Honda CB650R and CBR650R are identical to the standard bike, save for its innovative clutch system, which allows the rider to make gearshifts, come to a halt, and take off from a standstill without operating the clutch. The clutch lever isn’t omitted on these E-Clutch variants, and the rider can take manual control whenever they choose to. The standard versions of the CB650R and the CBR650R as well as their E-Clutch variants are both powered by the same liquid-cooled, 649cc inline four-cylinder engine, producing 95hp at 12,000rpm and 63Nm at 9,500rpm. The 6-speed gearbox and its ratios are the same between the bikes, and the only difference is in how you operate it. The rest of the chassis and the feature-set too on the E-Clutch bikes is identical to the standard versions and the only difference is in terms of weight. The E-Clutch system adds 2.8kg to the total weight.  Both the CB and the CBR are available in two colour options - black and red - and bookings are open for the two E-Clutch Honda 650s now. Currently, the CB650R and CBR650R E Clutch variants are one of very few bikes in India available with an ‘assisted’ clutch system, the only other being the BMW R 1300 GS models.  Also See: Honda CB650R vs Triumph Trident 660 comparison",
