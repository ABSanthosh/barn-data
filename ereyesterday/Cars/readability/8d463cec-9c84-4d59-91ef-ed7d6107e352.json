It also has a carbon-fiber MonoCell II chassis, an extruded-aluminum rear subframe, adaptive damping, staggered-diameter forged wheels, and carbon-ceramic brake rotors. The vehicle was registered with one owner before it was acquired by its current owner in 2021, and it has 8k miles. This 600LT is offered on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s literature and accessories, a clean Carfax report, and an Iowa title. Silver-finished elements of the body were wrapped in matte gray three years ago, per the selling dealer. Additional details include LED headlights, carbon-fiber front fender louvers, dihedral doors, and top-exit exhaust outlets. The gloss-black 19″ and 20″ forged wheels are mounted with 225/35 front and 285/35 rear Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. A front-axle lift system, McLaren Adaptive Damping, and carbon-ceramic brake rotors are additional elements. The touring-size racing seats are trimmed in Jet Black and Scoria Grey leather with contrast stitching, and the cabin has soft-close doors, McLaren Orange seatbelts, carbon-fiber door sill finishers, and a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system. Mounted on a power-adjustable column, the Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a configurable digital instrument cluster, and the driver is aided by parking sensors, a rearview camera,  and Launch Control. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles, ~3,500 of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 features dry-sump lubrication and was factory rated at 592 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed SSG dual-clutch automatic transaxle. An oil change was completed in January 2025. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien on the vehicle, and the lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
