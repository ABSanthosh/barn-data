Power is provided by a replacement 1,720cc flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, and the car has been refinished in silver over burgundy leatherette. It rides on lowered suspension with Koni shocks and chrome 15x5.5\" wheels, and the interior houses a roll cage, Speedster-style bucket seats, latch-and-link lap belts, and a Nardi steering wheel. Additional equipment includes a Bursch stinger-style exhaust, a dual brake master cylinder, and an exterior battery cutoff switch. This 356B coupe is now offered with the owner's manual, a tool kit, service manuals, a car cover, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Power is provided by a replacement 1,720cc flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, and the car has been refinished in silver over burgundy leatherette. It rides on lowered suspension with Koni shocks and chrome 15×5.5″ wheels, and the interior houses a roll cage, Speedster-style bucket seats, latch-and-link lap belts, and a Nardi steering wheel. Additional equipment includes a Bursch stinger-style exhaust, a dual brake master cylinder, and an exterior battery cutoff switch. This 356B coupe is now offered with the owner’s manual, a tool kit, service manuals, a car cover, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The Reutter-built body was finished from the factory in black and was repainted silver in the mid-2000s following the completion of body work. The chrome was also refreshed at that time, and a prior repair on the left front fender was addressed. The bumpers have been removed while further modifications include a battery cutoff switch, a bullet-style side mirror, Pegasus and roundel decals, and pop-out polycarbonate rear windows. Scratches, touchups, and other imperfections are shown up close in the gallery. The chrome 15×5.5″ steel wheels are mounted with Dunlop DZ102 tires measuring 195/55. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner, and a dual master cylinder has been added. It rides lower than stock on Koni shocks with a negative-camber rear suspension and a 19mm front sway bar. The cabin houses Fibersteel Speedster-style front bucket seats upholstered in burgundy leatherette, and interior appointments include latch-and-link lap belts, a roll bar, and a fire extinguisher. Beige squareweave carpets and a replacement headliner were installed in the mid-2000s. Heater components have been removed and a radio blanking plate is fitted. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel frames green-letter VDO instrumentation that was overhauled by North Hollywood Speedometer, including a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles, which the seller states is not accurate. Approximately 11k miles were added under current ownership, and total mileage is unknown. The replacement flat-four was reportedly sourced from a 912 and installed under prior ownership. The seller states that the engine was fitted with big-bore 1,720cc cylinders and pistons in December 2019, while the dual Solex carburetors were overhauled in September 2023. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. A Bursch stinger-style exhaust has been added. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
