  "text": "Tesla owners have always faced problems, but things could be getting worse due to Elon Musk 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier With Elon Musk becoming more political and divisive, Tesla owners are feeling the wrath. Drivers are sharing stories of getting flipped off, sworn at, and having their vehicle vandalized. Tesla owners have often been the target of EV hate, but now there’s a political aspect too. Electric vehicle adoption is slowly climbing, but a number of people are still opposed to them. Others downright hate EVs and go out of their way to ‘punish’ owners. This can range from ICEing chargers to simply unplugging cars. Both are childish and annoying, but some people are more destructive as we’ve seen numerous Teslas getting keyed. More: Activists Project ‘Heil Tesla’ Onto Musk’s Own German Gigafactory While Teslas have been a target for years, things appear to be getting worse as the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, has transformed into a divisive, attention seeking, lighting rod that appears to like Nazi salutes and the far-right. If that wasn’t bad enough, he’s hitched his wagon to President Trump, who was already a deeply divisive figure. This has left Tesla customers in a pickle and a member of the Cybertruck Owners Club recently expressed concerns about being the victim of a “hate crime.” A number of people chimed in sharing tales of getting keyed and having a tire slashed. Others mentioned being sworn at or being targeted by aggressive drivers. While some of this could be unrelated to them owning a Tesla, there appears to be valid concerns about vandalism. Furthermore, a Cybertruck owner recently whined to Business Insider that she’s sick of people flipping her off. She claimed the “general public thinks my truck is a political statement,” so they take out their anger on her. She went on to say, “It’s like driving a Cybertruck makes me a target for adults’ opinions about Musk.” While it does indeed suck for owners, there are countless alternatives to driving a Tesla. That being said, don’t mess with someone’s vehicle.",
