  "description": "Ducati has unveiled yet another special edition based on the Panigale V4 S. The Panigale V4 Lamborghini marks the third collaboration between these famed Italian brands. Just like previous Lamborghini editions, this, too, is limited to 693 units worldwide. The bike gets exposed carbon fibre components with a special livery At 185kg, it weighs 2kg less than the V4 S on which it is based 63 Panigale V4 Lamborghinis have been reserved for Ad Personam owners Ducati Panigale V4 Lamborghini details Limited edition Ducati is the third Lamborghini inspired model  Ducati has previously unveiled two models in collaboration with Lamborghini – the Ducati Diavel 1260 Lamborghini and the Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini. Now, the Panigale V4 Lamborghini is the third collaboration between these two renowned Italian marques. This Panigale V4 Lamborghini is also the third special edition after the Panigale V4 Tricolore and Panigale V4 Tricolore Italia to be based on the 2025 Panigale V4 S. 630 units have been allocated for buyers worldwide For starters, this special edition is limited to 630 units worldwide. In addition to this, there will be 63 more units reserved for Lamborghini Ad Personam owners who can customise their Panigale V4 Lamborghini to match their Revuelto. Customisation is not only limited to the livery but also extends to the seat, brake calipers, logos, wheels and Plexiglas – all of this coupled with a colour-matched rear paddock stand.  The other 630 units come with a unique black and green livery with the number ‘63’ commemorating the year Lamborghini was founded – 1963. The livery is inspired by the same design as that of the Lamborghini Revuelto Ad Personam. The brand claims that the tail section and winglets have also been inspired by the lines of the Revuelto supercar.  Gets 2.5hp more than the standard Panigale V4 This special edition bike comes with exposed carbon fibre at the fairing, tail section, front and rear mudguard and exhaust cover. The special componentry just doesn’t end there. The motorcycle also gets a homologated Akrapovič titanium under-belly exhaust with a carbon-fibre tip, giving it a 2.5hp boost compared to the Panigale V4 range. At 185kg (wet weight, no fuel), the weight has been reduced by 2kg compared to the V4 S. Another special touch is the billet aluminium plate at the steering head bearing the bike’s unique identification number. This information is also displayed on the TFT dash during start-up. The bike continues to use the same Euro 5+ compliant, 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, producing a slightly higher 218.5hp at 13,500rpm and 122.1Nm (up by 1.2Nm) at 11,250rpm. This engine comes mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Also see: Ducati Desmo450 MX revealed: A new segment for Ducati",
