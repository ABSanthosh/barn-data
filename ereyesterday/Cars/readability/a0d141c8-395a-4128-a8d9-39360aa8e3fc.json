Offenders include the Jeep Wagoneer, Honda Prologue, and Ford Bronco Sport. Some things in car design make you stop and ask, “Wait, seriously?” Rear wipers don’t usually make the list, but once you notice one that looks wildly out of proportion, it’s hard to unsee. Take this Honda Prologue, for example. At first glance, everything seems fine, until your eyes land on the rear window and spot what might be one of the smallest rear wipers we’ve seen. It’s so tiny it barely qualifies as functional. And that got us thinking, what other vehicles are out there sporting hilariously undersized rear wipers? Read: These Concept Cars Were So Bad You’re Glad They Never Made It As it turns out, the Prologue seen in this photo shared by a Redditor is far from the only car that has a wiper so small it can only clean the tiniest section of the rear window. Unsurprisingly, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, which shares its underpinnings with the Honda, appears to be equipped with exactly the same wiper as the Prologue. The reasoning behind these comically small wipers is relatively straightforward. Both the Prologue and Blazer EV feature tall beltlines and narrow rear windows. Fitting a longer, centrally mounted wiper would mean it would smack into the spoiler hanging over the top of the glass. So instead, manufacturers opt for a short blade mounted low, which can clear only a small portion of the glass without interference. But Honda and Chevy aren’t the only ones skimping on rear wiper real estate. Look at the rear of a new Jeep Grand Cherokee L, or a Wagoneer, and you’ll find that they, too, have very small rear wipers, despite having relatively large rear windows. It’s a similar story with the Ford Bronco Sport. In all of these cases, the rear wiper looks far too small for the vehicle and is only capable of cleaning a tiny part of the window. There’s got to be a better way to handle this. And thankfully, some automakers seem to agree. As it turns out, there is. Both the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage have rear wiper blades that actually mount to the top of the rear window and are hidden beneath the rear spoiler. It’s a small change that makes a big difference in execution and aesthetics. So, what other cars have you seen that take the idea of a rear wiper and shrink it down to toy-like proportions? Because once you start noticing them, you’ll see them everywhere. that wiper so comically small byu/Synfinium inHonda Lead photo Reddit/u Synfinium",
