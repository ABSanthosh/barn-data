  "text": "Take classic styling, add in a modern chassis and you end up with this cool creation 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers Unique fusion of classic Chevelle styling with modern Camaro performance and technology. Over 2,000 hours spent crafting custom fiberglass body reinforced with carbon fiber. Cabin retains original 2015 Camaro luxuries including heated seats and infotainment system. There’s no shortage of modern cars awkwardly slapping vintage aesthetics onto contemporary platforms, often ending up with something that feels more like a tribute band than the real deal. But for those who actually want modern convenience wrapped in unmistakably classic design, there are rarer, far more thoughtful creations out there. Like this one; a completely unique blending of a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS and a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro. Body swaps aren’t all that uncommon these days, but in most cases, the entire body itself ends up grafted onto a different chassis. Here, though, the approach is a bit more precise. Instead of a wholesale swap, the builder selectively borrowed key panels from the Chevelle. The hood and grille are the most immediately recognizable, giving the car a distinctly vintage face without losing the Camaro’s core structure. Read: YouTuber Builds Ferrari F40 From Scratch With Original Body Panels, DIY Chassis And A V12 The rear end follows the same philosophy, while all four fenders feature subtly updated proportions to better match the Camaro’s underlying platform. According to the auction listing, the builder devoted over 2,000 hours to shaping the body panels by hand, using fiberglass reinforced with carbon fiber – a time-intensive process that goes well beyond a simple bolt-on job. Selective Styling Meets Modern Performance Of course, part of the point in building something like this is that it doesn’t lose any of the luxuries of a modern car. Under the hood, it keeps the stock 6.2-liter V8, which Mecum lists at 426 hp, despite this particular car running an automatic gearbox. That’s notable because Chevrolet said at the time that automatic cars would only make 410 hp. Either way, it’s a decent amount of power. The convertible roof still functions and the cabin is almost all 2015 Camaro. That means the next owner will get heated and ventilated seats, a centered infotainment system, modern air conditioning, and more. Some factory features like the old-school-style gauge cluster fit right in with the spirit of this entire project. The builder did add two notable touches to the cabin to tie everything together. First, the headrests are from a Chevelle. Second, so is the rearview mirror. That kind of attention to detail is something that the next owner will no doubt appreciate. Those interested in this unique creation should check out Mecum’s 2025 Glendale event. It begins on March 18 and continues through the 22nd. This particular car goes over the auction block on Friday, the 21st. You can check out the full listing here if you’d like to see more. Photos Mecum",
