  "description": "This 1958 Lancia Aurelia B20 GT is a right-hand-drive coupe that was completed on May 8, 1958, as one of an estimated 3,900 examples built during an eight-year production run. Chassis 3980 is said to have been exhibited at the 1958 iteration of the Turin Motor Show, and it remained registered in Italy for some time before making its way to the US in 2024. Finished in black over beige cloth and tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 2.5-liter V6 paired with a column-shifted, rear-mounted four-speed manual transaxle. It rides on metric steel wheels and is further equipped with a Weber 40DCL6 carburetor, a de Dion rear axle, and hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units. Recently acquired by the current owner, this Series VI B20 is now offered on dealer consignment with a FIVA identity card, Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine, and a clean Arizona title.",

Chassis 3980 is said to have been exhibited at the 1958 iteration of the Turin Motor Show, and it remained registered in Italy for some time before making its way to the US in 2024. Finished in black over beige cloth and tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 2.5-liter V6 paired with a column-shifted, rear-mounted four-speed manual transaxle. It rides on metric steel wheels and is further equipped with a Weber 40DCL6 carburetor, a de Dion rear axle, and hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units. Recently acquired by the current owner, this Series VI B20 is now offered on dealer consignment with a FIVA identity card, Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine, and a clean Arizona title. The Aurelia debuted at the 1950 Turin Motor Show as the first series-produced car with a V6 engine and was manufactured in six series through 1958. Featuring bodywork by Pininfarina, the Series VI coupe incorporated a chrome strip down the bonnet along with quarter vent windows. This example is finished in black and equipped with Carello headlights, dual side mirrors, pop-out rear quarter windows, and turn indicators located below the polished rear bumper. Grille-mounted plaques from Automotoclub Storico Italiano and KCA Restauro Auto d’Epoca can be seen in the gallery, the latter of which is dated 1989. Silver-finished metric steel wheels wear polished hubcaps and are mounted with 165R400 Michelin radial tires. The Series VI Aurelia features an independent front sliding pillar suspension and a rear de Dion rear axle setup with a Panhard rod and leaf springs. Stopping power is provided by hydraulic drums with inboard rear units. The right-hand-drive cabin houses front seats and a rear bench trimmed in beige cloth with tan leather sides accompanied by a color-coordinated headliner and door panels. Brown rubber linings cover the floors, and further details include a heater, a column shifter, a locking glovebox, and a radio blanking plate. A wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a body-color steel dashboard housing a Jaeger 5,500-rpm tachometer and 220-km/h speedometer with an inset clock and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 22k kilometers (~14k miles), approximately 200 kilometers of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The 2.5-liter B20 V6 features an aluminum block, sump, and cylinder heads as well as a single Weber 40DCL6 carburetor. Power was reduced for the sixth series GT, while torque was increased to offset the greater weight of the later car. An oil change was performed in anticipation of the sale. Engine number 5396 is shown above, which is noted on the Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine displayed below to be the factory engine number. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a rear-mounted four-speed manual transaxle. The car is further equipped with a dual exhaust system. The Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine lists the original colors and production date as well as the factory identification numbers. A FIVA identity card is also included in the sale.
