Showing 25k miles, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, Bilstein dampers, 18″ multi-piece Rotiform CCV wheels, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, power-adjustable front sport seats, a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 930 Turbo coupe is offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with a copy of the window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The car is finished in black and features a sunroof, headlight washers, a rear spoiler, tinted windows, a rear window wiper, and black stone guards ahead of the rear wheels. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Black 18″ multi-piece Rotiform CCV wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires that have 2017 and 2019 date codes. Bilstein dampers are fitted, and braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The power-adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in black leather and are complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 25k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer states that the spark plugs were recently replaced, and the car passed a California emission test in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle. A copy of the window sticker lists initial delivery to Meister Porsche in Garden Grove, California, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $54,798. Manufacturer’s literature will accompany the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The car is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California.
