  "description": "Prior and Cropley talk all things design with one of the world's best car designers Julian Thomson is one of the world's best car designers and if you don't know the name, you'll know his cars. As Lotus's chief designer he designed the Elise and at Jaguar Land Rover created the LRX concept, which went on to become the Range Rover Evoque. But most of Thomson's career has been spent in advanced design and that's where he finds himself now, at General Motors' new advanced design centre Europe.  Why does GM need a European design centre and what will it do? Join Steve Cropley and Matt Prior as they put these questions and many more to one of the world's most eminent car designers.",
