The signature vaned grille has grown in size and feeds more air to the V12. Additionally, two fin-shaped bonnet scoops help in channelling the air. As for the illumination bits, the front boasts of  Vantage-like sweptback LED headlights, while the rear ones form a unique pattern. The latest Vanquish Grand Tourer retains its two-door coupe silhouette; however, it is longer now as the distance between the A-pillar and the front wheel has been extended. The carbon-fibre side strake on the fenders has also become larger and blends well with the doors and the new 21-inch forged wheels wear bespoke Pirelli tyres. That being said, the bulky rear wheel arch and the sloping roofline look are similar to the second-generation Vanquish. 'Shield' with the Aston Martin lettering. The Vanquish features quad exhaust tips and an aggressive-looking diffuser with central and outer blades for stability at high speeds. With the new car, Aston Martin has also added a width-wide ‘Shield’ panel, which bridges the tail-lights and can be had in either body colour, gloss black or carbon-fibre finish. 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish interior and features Physical switches and buttons are retained. Compared to the previous model, the two-seater’s interior has been completely redesigned and looks similar to the current crop of Aston Martins. Its 10.25-inch touchscreen gets Apple CarPlay (wireless) and Android Auto (wired), and a similar-sized driver’s display runs on Aston Martin’s new software stack. What has not changed are the physical controls for audio and climate control, as well as the gearbox’s manual mode button.  Most of the cabin is finished in Alcantara and the seats feature a new quilted design. The Vanquish also offers a fixed glass roof (for the first time) but buyers can opt for a carbon fibre one too. A 1,170-watt, 15-speaker Bowers and Wilkins sound system is also offered.
