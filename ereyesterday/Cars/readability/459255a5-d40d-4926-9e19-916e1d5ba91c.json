The new “Gen6” 800-volt architecture developed by that Mini's parent firm is claimed to be a “huge leap forward” in terms of technology compared to what is offered in current generation EVs. This includes an increase in range and charging speeds, while the cost of making cars is reduced. Starting in September with the next-generation BMW iX3 – which morphs from the Vision Neue Klasse SUV concept – it will be rolled out across all BMW, Rolls-Royce and Mini EVs from their respective next generation models.

The configurability of the new platform means single-motor cars can only be had with a powertrain on the rear axle. This is because the main Electric Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) is the only one offered by the Group with an integrated gearbox, and this exclusively sits between the rear wheels. BMW Group engineers told Autocar at the launch of the platform that there are currently no plans to develop an EESM to be used on the front axle, and only the new small asynchronous motor (ASM) – which doesn’t house a gearbox – will be fitted there. BMW models have long been developed with a rear-drive focus. One of the reasons for this decision is because a rear-wheel-drive setup is “better for dynamics”. As such, the platform can only support rear- or all-wheel-drive setups in either single-, dual-, tri-, or quad-motor configurations.
