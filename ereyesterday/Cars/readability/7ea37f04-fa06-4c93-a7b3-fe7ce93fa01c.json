  "description": "Kia has confirmed it will take the wraps off its long-awaited Tasman pickup truck on October 29 at the Jeddah International Motor Show in Saudi Arabia. The Tasman will be Kia’s answer to popular models such as the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger and Volkswagen Amarok. The company has also released new teasers previewing the vehicle in production-ready form. Kia Tasman is likely to sit on a ladder-frame platform It will come with a 2.2-litre turbo-diesel engine Expected to go on sale in Australia first The latest teasers confirm a squarish-looking pickup with a boxy silhouette, rounded edges and an upright nose. The front fenders are pronounced, and the headlamps are stacked vertically, like in other Kia models such as the Carnival MPV. There’s also a horn-like trim piece above the grille connecting the bumper with the hood. The Tasman has a dual-cab setup and a standard bed that will be similar in size to its rivals, the Ranger and Hilux. Its ground clearance seems to be competitive as well. While it is not yet clear, the Tasman will most likely sit on a ladder-frame architecture that used to underpin the now-discontinued full-size Mohave SUV. It will have off-road gear, but it remains to be seen what type of setup Kia goes with.  As for the engine, the Tasman will pack a 2.2-litre, 199hp, four-cylinder turbo-diesel unit that’s seen in some other Kia models. There are talks of a larger, 3.0-litre V6 turbo-diesel as well, which may be offered at a later stage. Upon debut, the Tasman will initially go on sale in Australia, followed by markets such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South Korea, and some African countries. For India, Kia recently launched the new Carnival and the EV9, and it will introduce the Syros SUV, the Carens facelift and the Carens EV next year.
