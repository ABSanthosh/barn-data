Finished in GT Silver Metallic over black leather with Deep Sea Blue Race-Tex inserts, it is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is further equipped with the Weissach, Light Design, and Chrono packages as well as LED headlights with PDLS, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, Satin Indigo Blue-finished 20″ forged magnesium wheels, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. This 718 Cayman GT4 RS has 763 miles and is now offered in New York with a window sticker, a car cover, two keys, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The 718 GT4 RS features lightweight rear glass, vented front fenders, additional upper intakes, and a larger swan-neck rear wing when compared with the contemporary 718 GT4. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, intakes, side mirror housings, and wing. This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System as well as auto-dimming mirrors with an integrated rain sensor, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, dual exhaust outlets, carbon-fiber window triangles, clear side markers, and blue vinyl wrap applied to portions of the front splitter and rear wing. The body has received paint protection film, and the left door control unit was replaced in October 2024. The windshield has a chip, and blemishes are noted on the front splitter. Satin Indigo Blue-finished 20″ forged magnesium wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. A front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory as were Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with Deep Sea Blue Race-Tex inserts, “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, Deep Sea Blue seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, Burmester speakers, a fire extinguisher, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The optional Light Design Package added LED lighting in the overhead console, door handles, door storage compartments, footwells, and vanity mirrors. The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and JQ Werks shift paddles. It fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 763 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.0L flat-six was factory rated at 493 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. An Antigravity battery has been fitted. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and the car is equipped with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a mechanically locking differential. A Cargraphic exhaust valve controller and Akrapovič over-axle pipes have been installed. The car cannot pass a California emissions test, therefore it cannot be sold to a California private party buyer. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche Riverside in California, along with factory colors, options, and a total price of $219,610. Removed components, a car cover, two keys, the owner’s manual, and service records are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
