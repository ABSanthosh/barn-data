  "description": "This right-hand-drive 1951 Allard J2 was delivered new to New Zealand with special instructions that it was required for race car driver George Smith, who would campaign the car in the early 1950s. It would then be owned by private individuals and held in various collections before it was acquired by the seller’s father in 1979 as an incomplete project. A subsequent refurbishment circa 1980 involved repairing and repainting the alloy bodywork, re-trimming the seats in gray cloth, and installing a 331ci Cadillac V8 equipped with a triple-carburetor setup. The car was then campaigned in vintage racing events in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, and a Toyota-sourced five-speed manual transmission was installed following an accident in the 2000s. Equipment includes a louvered hood, a luggage rack, driving lights, 15” wire wheels, a de Dion rear end, and four-wheel disc brakes with inboard-mounted rears as well as a removable roll bar, soft top, and side skirts. A non-running Ford flathead V8 equipped with Ardun overhead-valve cylinder heads is included in the sale. This Allard J2 and display engine are now offered in New Zealand by the seller on behalf of the owner with a 2006 FIA Historic Vehicle Identity Form certificate, a SOVREN registration form, historical documents, magazines featuring the car, a tonneau cover, an aero screen, and New Zealand registration.",

This Allard J2 and display engine are now offered in New Zealand by the seller on behalf of the owner with a 2006 FIA Historic Vehicle Identity Form certificate, a SOVREN registration form, historical documents, magazines featuring the car, a tonneau cover, an aero screen, and New Zealand registration. Chassis J2088 was ordered in April 1951 on behalf of race car driver George Smith, who drove it in various competition events in New Zealand until 1953. It was then owned by a series of dealers and private owners before Rob Boult acquired the car in 1979 in a state of disassembly and without an engine. Initially finished in maroon, the alloy bodywork was repaired by Ray Larsen of New Zealand before a repaint in red circa 1980. The car was driven in vintage racing events in New Zealand, Australia, and the US after the refurbishment. Following a crash in the 2000s, the car was again refurbished and refinished in its current livery. Modifications and equipment are described in handwritten notes provided in the gallery. Exterior details include a removable roll bar, soft top, and side skirts as well as a louvered hood, headlight guards, driving lights, and side-mounted spare wheels. The plastic window on the soft top has yellowed. Rust on the luggage rack and dings on the fender guards are shown up close in the gallery along with paint chips and cracks around the car. Chrome 15×6” knock-off wire wheels are retained with two-eared spinners and mounted with 205/70 Goodyear Assurance tires. The car is outfitted with a de Dion rear end, and braking is handled by four-wheel discs with inboard-mounted rears as well as a dual master cylinder and servos. The right-hand-drive cockpit houses two-place seating trimmed in gray cloth and black vinyl, and red Willans harnesses are fitted for each occupant. Black carpets line the lowered floors. The banjo-style steering wheel fronts an engine-turned dashboard fascia housing a mixed set of instruments including a 140-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 51k miles, approximately 30k of which have been added under current ownership. The speedometer is inaccurate. The 331ci Cadillac V8 was installed during the aforementioned refurbishment and has been moved ahead in the engine bay. Induction is through triple Rochester carburetors. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Toyota R154 five-speed manual transmission. The differential is fitted with a 3.54:1 gear set. Initial purchase documents indicate that the car left the factory equipped with an Ardun engine. A Ford flathead V8 display engine equipped with Ardun overhead-valve cylinder heads was acquired by the seller’s father in 1982 and is included in the sale. The seller states that the engine has not run under current ownership. The car has been featured on the covers of New Zealand Classic Car and Classic Driver. Copies of both magazines will accompany the car, and the articles are presented in the gallery. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its registration, which serves as the ownership document in New Zealand. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
