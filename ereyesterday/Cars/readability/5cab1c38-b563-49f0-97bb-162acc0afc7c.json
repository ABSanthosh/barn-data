  "text": "Gear up with our in-depth analysis of the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958—your ultimate buyer's guide to adventure on wheels. Toyota's longest-running nameplate, the Land Cruiser, has been reborn with a modern twist. The Land Cruiser was one of the most popular vehicles in Toyota's arsenal for almost six decades but when sales started to lag in the mid-2010s, the writing was on the wall. In 2021, the Land Cruiser was discontinued. Flash forward three years, and in 2024, the Land Cruiser was reborn with a smaller cabin and frame and redesigned with retro styling. It returns yet again for 2025, so let's take a look at its base trim, the Land Cruiser 1958, named as such in honor of the SUV's first-ever model year. 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958ToyotaThe 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958 keeps its design but changes trim levelsAs most design changes were made in 2024, the lineup will see no revisions this year. However, the Land Cruiser 1958 is now the base trim and one of only two trims in the lineup. The 2024 model year featured the First Edition as the base trim, but that model has been discontinued and the 1958 is now the lower trim of the two (the eponymous Land Cruiser model is the second and top trim in the lineup.) The 1958 is priced at $57,900, just $500 more than the previous model year. The Land Cruiser 1958's design calls back to its past brethrenThe 1958's exterior design is an homage to the FJ25 model, with its classic round headlights, cloth seats, and old-school logo. This retro design recalls the Land Cruiser's past aesthetic while maintaining a modern sensibility. Those forward-thinking elements are particularly evident in the 1958's interior tech.Despite a small 8-inch touchscreen, the infotainment system remains user-friendly with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities. A six-speaker stereo, six USB-C charging ports, a 2,400-watt AC inverter, and a three-prong outlet are also standard. Optional upgrades included onboard Wi-Fi, a wireless charging pad, and a 14-speaker JBL stereo system.All of the 1958's controls, including climate controls, are intuitive and easy to reach for front-row occupants. The interior is comfortable, with plenty of adjustment range for both the seat and the steering wheel. The backseat can be a little cramped for taller adults with long legs, but headroom remains ample.Toyota is also forward-thinking in terms of safety technology with a number of standard features including lane-keeping assistance, adaptive cruise control, and proactive driving assistance, meaning it \"reads\" the road ahead to adjust your speed to curves and traffic.2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958ToyotaA hybrid powertrain brings impressive performance to the Land Cruiser 1958The Land Cruiser 1958's heartbeat lies in its hybrid powertrain, designed to deliver both reliability and performance across various terrains. This smaller engine, a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder, replaced the 1958's naturally aspirated V8 in 2024 and generates 326 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque. The i-FORCE MAX hybrid system is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a four-wheel-drive system, making it fun to tackle challenging terrain. While its ground clearance is not as high as some of its competitors, it's still exceedingly capable off-road, and you can make your way down the trail with confidence. 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958ToyotaFuel economy could be better, but the smaller engine mileage is an improvement over the V8Mileage in the Land Cruiser 1958 with its smaller hybrid system crushes the former V8's numbers. The 1958 now gets 22 mpg/city, 25 mpg/highway, and 23 mpg overall, which is a significant improvement over the V8's 14 mpg combined. However, the 1959 still has a way to go to catch up with some of its competitors, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe, which has an additional 56 MPGe with 26 miles of all-electric driving. Competitors to the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958 come from both Stellantis and FordThe Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco stand as the Land Cruiser's primary competitors. They are both smaller, off-road-focused SUVs with an equal amount of heritage. The base trim of the Wrangler starts at $37,290 while the Bronco starts from $39,63, putting them much lower than the Land Cruiser's $57,900 MSRP.2025 Ford Bronco Sport SasquatchFordFinal thoughtsThe 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 1958 is a powerful blend of rugged heritage and modern practicality. Its smaller size and pricing with little cost increase from the previous year open the door to a broader consumer base while maintaining the same off-road capabilities that defined the Land Cruiser's legacy for decades.",
