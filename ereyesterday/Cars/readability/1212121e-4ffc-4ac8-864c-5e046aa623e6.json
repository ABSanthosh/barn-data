  "text": "While electric cars may not be ideal for everyone, certain models could be significantly enhanced by adopting such a drivetrain 3 hours ago by Stephen Rivers Even though EV sales may not have grown as manufacturers expected, they remain the future. Thus, we wonder which ICE-only model would benefit by adopting an all-electric drivetrain. Just about every segment of the automotive market today has at least one all-electric model in its lineup. Yet, a handful of models—or even entire brands—remain stubbornly tethered to internal combustion engines. Today, we’re flipping the script: which of these holdouts would gain the most from going all-electric? Our lead image offers what might be the best example of this. It’s not as though Rolls-Royce owners were frustrated by a lack of horsepower before the all-electric Spectre, but the British firm’s choice is an important one. Read: What’s The Best Electric Vehicle On Sale Today? A calm, composed, and quietly powerful ride has always defined the Rolls-Royce experience. By placing an electric drivetrain to the Spectre, the British marque amplified exactly that. In addition, since the Spectre isn’t relied on for lap times or extreme range estimates, an EV drivetrain is absolutely perfect for its luxurious and serene character, without lacking in performance. At the opposite end of the spectrum, we find city cars like the Fiat 500e. Sure, people deride it for making only 117 horsepower while having just 141 miles of range, but models like the Chevrolet Trax and Mazda CX-30 could do well by following suit. Before you start typing out “but Mazda did try the MX-30”, hear me out. Cars like the MX-30 and 500e cost a little bit too much for what they offer, but they’re also pretty specialized. In the same way that trucks and supercars have their own specialties, small electric city cars do too. For those who rarely plan on road-tripping and simply need to get around a dense urban area, an all-electric Trax or CX-30 would be a good choice. In truth, nearly any city-focused car with a sub-$35,000 price tag could thrive, provided it offers fast charging and a well-appointed interior that justifies its cost. An all-electric Nissan Sentra or Mitsubishi Mirage, for instance, could be a strong contender—assuming the right balance of pricing, range, and features is achieved. Those are just a few thoughts though. Now it’s your turn. Which car currently on sale would benefit most from shedding its combustion engine for an electric drivetrain?
