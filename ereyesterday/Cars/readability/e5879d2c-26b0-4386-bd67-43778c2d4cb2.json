This GTC4Lusso T has 22k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer in Washington with owner’s literature, a transferrable factory Genuine Maintenance program through July 2026, a battery tender, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title. The car’s three-door shooting-brake bodywork was designed in-house by the Ferrari Styling Centre under the direction of Flavio Manzoni. This example is finished in Bianco Avus and features a panoramic glass roof, tinted windows, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear cameras, and parking sensors. Paint protection film has been applied to the front body panels. The 20″ Y-spoke forged alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires showing date codes between 2022 and 2024. The GTC4Lusso is equipped with four-wheel steering and multi-mode magnetorheological dampers, and stopping power is provided by Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes with red-finished calipers fitted over cross-drilled and vented rotors at each corner. The Daytona-style seats are trimmed in Rosso Ferrari leather with white stitching and Cavallino Rampante logos embroidered on the headrests. Amenities include front seat ventilation and position memory settings, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a 10.25″ touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. The leather and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel features a manettino drive mode selector, an engine-start button, LED shift lights, and shift paddles. Instrumentation includes a white-dial central tachometer flanked by configurable displays. The digital odometer indicates 22k miles.

Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and the car is equipped with an electronically controlled rear differential. The selling dealer notes that the car remains under the factory Ferrari Genuine Maintenance program until July 31, 2026. The personalization specifications plaque lists factory colors and options.
