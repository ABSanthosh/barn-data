  "text": "The Ninety-Eight Regency Brougham currently shows 24,833 miles and still looks remarkably pristine 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The classic Oldsmobile is a well-equipped Nighty-Eight Regency Brougham. When it was first sold in 2016, the car had been driven just 1,600 miles. Powering the plush luxury sedan is a 3.8-liter naturally-aspirated V6. Even though Oldsmobile disappeared from showroom floors more than two decades ago, the brand’s legacy lives on through countless surviving models scattered across the country. Among them is this particularly intriguing 1986 Ninety-Eight, now up for sale for $12,900. That may seem like a hefty price for a mid-80s Olds, but this example is a genuine time capsule, appearing to have been maintained with a level of care usually reserved for museum pieces. This 1986 model is the Regency Brougham. The Ninety-Eight was Oldsmobile’s flagship luxury sedan at the time, and the Regency Brougham trim sat squarely in the middle of the lineup, retailing for just over $18,000 when new. This particular car was purchased brand new by George Berejik, a longtime Oldsmobile dealer who ran his Massachusetts dealership for 30 years. Read: The Oldsmobile Alero Was Trash, But Is This Final 500 Edition Worth Cash? For most of the car’s first three decades on Earth, it was stashed away in Berejik’s private collection and only used sparingly. It was finally sold to its first retail owner in 2016 with a barely believable 1,600 miles (2,574 km) on the clock. By the time it changed hands again in 2021, the odometer had crept up to just 3,135 miles (5,045 km). The current seller has been a bit more liberal with the car’s use, racking up enough miles to bring the total to 24,800 (39,900 km). Finished in Medium Blue Metallic, the exterior paint has held up remarkably well, showing just how carefully the car has been preserved. Inside, the blue leather cabin looks equally impressive, with minimal wear betraying the car’s nearly four decades of existence. The vehicle is currently offered by Orphan Car Garage in Massachusetts, which notes that while the original Bose sound system has been swapped out for a Kenwood unit, the change does little to spoil the vintage vibe. Despite the car’s age, the Oldsmobile still offers a surprising list of amenities by today’s standards. Power windows, a power-operated sunroof, powered front seats, and even a memory function for the driver’s seat all make an appearance. Under the hood, power comes from the original 3.8-liter naturally aspirated V6, a sturdy workhorse that prioritizes smoothness over speed. If you can imagine yourself gliding down the road in this pristine slice of 1980s Americana, it might be worth reaching out to Orphan Car Garage before someone else claims it. Orphan Car Garage",
