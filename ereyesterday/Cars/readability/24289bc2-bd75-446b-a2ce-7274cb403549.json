  "text": "Jeep's new boss has described the Avenger as \"an incredibly interesting product\" 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Jeep’s North American. lineup lacks a crossover to compete in the booming small-SUV market. In overseas markets, the company sells ICE, hybrid, and EV versions of the Avenger. The brand’s CEO, Bob Broderdorf, says a business case is required to evaluate a US launch. The Wrangler and Gladiator are obvious 4×4 go-tos for anyone looking for rugged off-road capability, but Jeep’s lineup hasn’t exactly been catering to smaller crossover enthusiasts in the US lately. Since the sub-compact Renegade was axed, Jeep’s smallest offering stateside has been the compact Compass. And while it’s perfectly serviceable, the absence of a more petite and affordable model has left a gap for buyers who want something smaller but still packed with that Jeep “lifestyle” appeal. That gap, however, might not stay empty much longer. Jeep already plans to launch a Renegade successor in 2027, but that might not be the only bite-sized Jeep headed for North American shores. For the past few years, Jeep has been selling the pint-sized Avenger in select international markets. Despite its success abroad, it hasn’t made its way to America—yet. But that could change soon if Jeep’s North American chief, Bob Broderdorf, gets his way. Review: Jeep Avenger Proves ICE And Manual Combo Can Still Be Compelling During a recent interview with Motor Trend, Broderdorf said he’s very interested in bringing the Avenger stateside, admitting he’s a big fan of how it looks and believes it could appeal to those looking for affordable crossovers. “I will tell you flat out: I am looking at it,” he said. “I think the Avenger is an incredibly interesting product. I actually love the look of that car, and what it is. Man, that thing is cool. I’m trying to understand what the shortcomings might be. Why it wasn’t picked [to be sold in the US] to start with.” The limited edition Jeep Avenger 4xe The North Face ICE, Hybrid, or EV? The Avenger lineup offers a variety of powertrains in Europe. Broderdorf didn’t specify whether he’s most interested in bringing the ICE version of the Avenger to the States or if the EV or hybrids variants are more likely contenders. In Europe, the trio appeal to different buyers. The ICE model features a 1.2-liter PureTech three-cylinder engine delivering 99 hp and 151 lb-ft (205 Nm) of torque. By comparison, the EV outmuscles it with 154 hp and 192 lb-ft (260 Nm), while the 4xe hybrid slots between them with 134 hp. Given the performance gap, it’s no surprise the EV commands a premium, costing upwards of €14,000 (~$14,400) more than the ICE model, depending on the country. Read: Wagoneer’s 48% Surge Couldn’t Save Jeep From Its Sixth Straight Year Of Decline Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf During the same interview, Broderdorf noted that “there is a movement toward more affordable EVs” in the States. However, before the Avenger can be offered stateside, he emphasized the need to ensure it makes financial sense. “I have to run the business case to see if it can be done, can I sell it, what would it cost, and can I get it here,” he said. “I have a lot of work to do before I can make that call. I have my hit list of things and that one is on there. So, we’ll see.” For now, the Avenger’s North American debut remains firmly in the “maybe” column. But Jeep’s willingness to explore new options like this could be what the brand needs to regain some footing. After enduring its sixth consecutive year of declining sales, including a 9% drop in 2024 compared to 2023, it’s clear that something needs to change. Thanos Pappas/Carscoops",
