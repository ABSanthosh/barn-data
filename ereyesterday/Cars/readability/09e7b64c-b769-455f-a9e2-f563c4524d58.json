  "description": "Among the 7 new nameplates that Tata Motors plans to launch by 2030 is a new compact SUV. Codenamed Scarlet, this sub-four-metre model is said to be a boxy looking SUV, with design cues inspired by the slab-sided and upright Sierra. New Tata compact SUV platform It will be underpinned by a monocoque platform While details on the Tata Scarlet compact SUV are scarce, it is expected to be underpinned by a monocoque chassis that will be compatible with internal combustion and electric powertrains. Whether it will use the Nexon’s 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine, the Curvv’s 125hp, 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo-petrol, the new naturally aspirated 1.5-litre petrol, or have a diesel option is still unknown. The all-electric version may come with motors on the front and rear axles giving buyers an AWD option. Due to cost and packaging constraints, an AWD version of the ICE compact SUV is unlikely. New Tata compact SUV price and rivals New Tata compact SUV price likely to overlap with Nexon With the mini Sierra, Tata is looking to grab a greater share of the compact SUV segment, where it already has the Punch and Nexon. Prices for the Scarlet compact SUV are expected to overlap with the Nexon (Rs 8 lakh-15.6 lakh) and Nexon EV (Rs 12.49 lakh-17.19 lakh), though Tata plans to avoid any cannibalisation of sales as the existing compact SUV and the new one target a different set of buyers. Some sources have referred to the Scarlet as a competitor to the Mahindra Thar and Maruti Jimny, though naturally as a monocoque based SUV, it is unlikely to have the same sort of off-road prowess. Instead, the Tata Scralet will be positioned as a lifestyle SUV, and an alternative to the current crop of crossover-like compact SUVs.   New Tata compact EVs also in the works Besides the Scarlet, Tata Motors also has plans for two more compact all-electric cars. These models – codenamed Kuno and Terra – are likely to be compact EVs. Tata Motors MD, Shailesh Chandra had mentioned before the launch of the Harrier EV that the brand’s strategy is to have two models in every segment: entry, mid-level and high. More details on these models, and the Tata Scarlet compact SUV, will be revealed in due time. Stay tuned.
