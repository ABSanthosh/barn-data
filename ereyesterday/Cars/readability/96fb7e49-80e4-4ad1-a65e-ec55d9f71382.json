  "description": "This 1976 Porsche 911S Targa was acquired as a non-running project by the seller in 2015, and recommissioning work by their shop between 2023 and 2025 included an overhaul of the 2.7-liter flat-six, a rebuild of the five-speed Type 915 manual transaxle, a refresh of the suspension and brakes, and a repaint in the original color of Magenta. The removable roof panel was re-covered and a replacement dashboard also installed, along with carpeting, door panels, and H4 headlights. Additional equipment includes black leatherette upholstery, a brushed Targa bar, fog lights, body-color bumpers, front bucket seats, and a heated rear window. This mid-year 911 is now offered at no reserve with the owner's manual, refurbishment records, a tool kit, and a South Carolina title in the name of the seller's business.",

The removable roof panel was re-covered and a replacement dashboard also installed, along with carpeting, door panels, and H4 headlights. Additional equipment includes black leatherette upholstery, a brushed Targa bar, fog lights, body-color bumpers, front bucket seats, and a heated rear window. This mid-year 911 is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, refurbishment records, a tool kit, and a South Carolina title in the name of the seller’s business. Previously finished in red, the car was repainted in its factory shade of Magenta in 2024. H4 headlights and replacement rubber seals were installed at that time, and the Targa top was refreshed with a replacement cover, headliner, and seals. The Fuchs 16″ wheels measure 6″ in width up front and 7″ wide out back, and they were mounted with Kumho Sport tires in 2024 measuring 195/65 and 215/60, respectively. A space-saver spare is stored in the front trunk. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. The brake calipers were refurbished by PMB, and the pads, rotors, and hoses were replaced during the refurbishment. Suspension work involved installing replacement shock inserts and replacing the lower ball joints, tie rods, sway bar bushings, and wheel bearings. Black leatherette upholstery covers the front bucket seats, folding rear seats, and side panels. A replacement dash pad, carpets, and door panels were installed and the pedal cluster was rebuilt under current ownership. The leather-covered three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of VDO instrumentation that consists of a 150-mph speedometer, a centrally mounted tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 58k miles, though the seller does not know if this is accurate. Total mileage is unknown. The 2.7-liter 911/82 flat-six features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and was overhauled in 2024. Work involved rebuilding the cylinder heads as well as replacing the piston rings, crankshaft and rod bearings, and timing chains and guides. A replacement fuel tank, pump, and injectors were also installed along with a rebuilt warm-up regulator, fuel distributor, and pressure accumulator. Partial engine stamping *646 is visible on the case as shown in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed Type 915 manual transaxle, which was also rebuilt in 2024 with replacement synchros, bearings, and seals. A Sachs clutch was also installed. The South Carolina title lists “exempt” under the brands section. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
