  "description": "Tata Motors took the wraps off two special edition SUV line-ups at the ongoing Auto Expo 2025. First up is the Bandipur edition range, which includes the Harrier, Safari and Nexon EV, followed by the Stealth edition models, which include the Safari and the upcoming Harrier EV SUVs.  The Bandipur and Stealth edition line-ups get multiple cosmetic tweaks Expected to go on sale in the coming months Tata Bandipur editions are a tribute to Bandipur National Park Similar to the now discontinued Kaziranga edition line-up from Tata motors that had its own distinct paint shades, all three Bandipur edition SUVs from Tata get a unique “Bandipur Bronze” exterior paint shade, which is inspired by the “clay soil” seen in the region. Additionally, there is a special “Elephant Mascot” on the front fenders of each vehicle, finished in dark satin gunmetal shade.    The Nexon EV 45kWh, Harrier, and Safari Bandipur editions come standard with dark grey alloy wheels, a roof rack, and a hood scoop. Inside, they get a dark brown interior theme, unique seat upholstery, and door pads finished in Khaki art leather with a Nappa grain, complemented by matching Khaki stitching. Additionally, there is an elephant mascot on the front seat headrests, along with black stitching. Special 3D floor mats with elephant mascots complete the Bandipur edition package for these SUVs. Tata Harrier EV, Safari Stealth editions get unique matte finish Alongside the Bandipur edition range, Tata Motors showcased the new Stealth editions for the Safari and the upcoming Harrier EV at the show. The Stealth edition line-up gets a unique matte black colour, 19-inch black alloy wheels, leather seats in a granite black finish, Stealth badging on the inside, and slight tweaks to the dashboard finish. The Harrier and Safari Bandipur editions, as well as the Safari Stealth Edition, also get features from their top variants, including Level 2 ADAS, a 12.3-inch infotainment screen, a 10.25-inch infotainment cockpit, ventilated seats, and a voice-assisted panoramic sunroof, among others.  Tata Bandipur, Stealth edition powertrain details There are no mechanical changes to any of these SUVs. The Harrier and Safari Bandipur editions come with the same 2.0-litre turbo diesel engines as the standard versions. Also, the Nexon EV 45 Bandipur edition continues with the same electric powertrain. Tata Stealth Editions get matte black exterior paint finish. Similarly, the Harrier EV Stealth edition gets a dual-motor setup with over 500Nm of torque, just like the standard Harrier EV. Tata Motors is yet to reveal the full specifications of the Harrier EV closer to its launch. Also read Auto Expo 2025 complete show report and pictures",
