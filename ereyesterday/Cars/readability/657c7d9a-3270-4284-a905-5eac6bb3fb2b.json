  "text": "The custom 1976 Chevette must be an absolute monster down the quarter mile, complete with a roll cage 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The 1976 Chevette was originally built with a Buick V6, before it was replaced by a V8. The 355 cubic-inch engine produces 447 hp includes aftermarket cylinder heads and pistons. A bright-colored exterior and interior adds to the subcompact car’s awesome street appeal. An original Chevrolet Chevette isn’t exactly what you’d call a “dream car” for most enthusiasts, far from it, actually. Unless, of course, you’re talking about this particular one. What you’re looking at is likely one of the most outlandish Chevettes in existence, and it’s headed to a Texas auction next month. If you’ve ever dreamed of an American-made hyperhatch (and let’s face it, who hasn’t?), this is probably as close as you’ll get. This Chevette’s story begins with a rather unlikely source of performance: Hooker Headers, who originally built it in the US and showcased it in a 1982 issue of Hot Rod Magazine. At first, the car was fitted with a V6 engine from a Buick, but, as you might expect, that didn’t last. Before too long, the V6 was swapped out for a 350 cubic-inch V8, and the car found its way to California’s drag strips, where it made its mark. Read: Chevy Will Restore And Restomod Classic Cars, But Not In The US Fast-forward to the present day, and this subcompact Chevy is powered by a 355 cubic-inch (5.8-liter) V8, mated to a 200 4R 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, driving the rear wheels. Despite the car’s relatively unassuming looks, it packs a serious punch, churning out 447 hp and 457 lb-ft (620 Nm) of torque at the wheels. There’s no word on how quickly this thing will hit 60 mph (96 km/h), but we’re pretty sure it’s hilariously fun to drive. The V8 engine has been heavily modified to squeeze out all that power. It includes aluminum cylinder heads, JE pistons with ARP hardware, a new Comp Cams camshaft, Edelbrock intake manifold, S\u0026S 750 CFM Holley carburetor, new ignition coils, and custom headers. Several other important upgrades have been made, including the fitment of adjustable coilovers and Wilwood brakes. Looks Like It Just Came Out of 1982 On the outside, the paint job is a throwback to the bold, eye-catching designs of the ’80s, with a dark grey base coat accented by bright red, yellow, and orange stripes. Inside, the cabin continues the same theme, with red leather and fabric upholstery, and a roll cage for added “I’m serious about this” vibes. And, of course, no self-respecting car from this era would be without a decent sound system—this Chevette is equipped with an aftermarket Kenwood audio setup and new speakers to match. If you’ve ever thought about rolling up to your local Cars \u0026 Coffee event in something that says, “I’m here to have fun,” this Chevette might be the car for you.
