  "description": "The 2025 BYD Seal, which received an updated suspension and a few convenience features last month, has been launched at Rs 41 lakh (ex-showroom). The BYD Atto 3 electric SUV has also been updated for 2025 with a new interior upholstery colour and a new comfort feature. Seal gets new powered sunshade, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Atto 3 SUV updated with front ventilated seats Both cars get new Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) low-voltage battery Here’s a look at the full price list of the 2025 BYD Seal: 2025 BYD Seal price (ex-showroom)Variant New Price Old Price Difference Dynamic RWDRs 41 lakh Rs 41 lakh -Premium RWD Rs 45.70 lakh Rs 45.55 lakh Rs 15,000Performance AWD Rs 53.15 lakh Rs 53 lakh Rs 15,000 The base price of the BYD Seal remains unchanged, but the Premium RWD and Performance AWD are now more expensive by Rs 15,000. 2025 BYD Seal gets updated suspension, new features More sophisticated suspension on Premium and Performance variants The Seal’s mid-spec Premium variant gains Frequency Selective Dampers (FSD), a feature previously reserved for the top Performance trim. In the Performance variant, BYD has added its DiSus-C system, which can soften the suspension on bumpy roads and stiffen it during cornering, acceleration and braking – all in real-time. With this year’s update, all variants of the BYD Seal now get a powered sunshade; an aftermarket fix-in-place sunshade was previously available as an accessory.

Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard, too. The electric car has also been equipped with an improved air conditioning and purification system. The Seal also gets a new Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) low-voltage battery with a 15-year lifespan. According to the company, it's six times lighter than a conventional lead acid battery. 2025 BYD Atto 3 new features The latest Atto 3 gets an all-black (previously three-tone) interior with ventilated front seats.
