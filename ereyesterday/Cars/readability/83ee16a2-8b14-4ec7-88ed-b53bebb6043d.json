  "text": "The 64-year-old man spray painted the victim's house and tried pouring sugar into the gas tank of a vehicle parked outside 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Police have arrested a man for retaliating against a woman who hit his truck nearly two years ago. The attacker was caught on camera spray painting the victim’s home and vandalizing a vehicle. The man confessed to police and reportedly pointed to the accident as the reason for the attack. Accidents are a fact of life, but one Ohio man reportedly couldn’t let a crash go. Instead, he allegedly vandalized the other driver’s car and home nearly two years later. The bizarre case appears to start on August 21, 2023 when Michael Dietz was stopped at an intersection in his 1996 Chevrolet truck. According to a police report we unearthed, he was rear-ended by a 2020 Kia Telluride that was driven by Marette Winchester. She was given a citation for the crash and that’s where things should have ended.

Citing Westlake Police, Cleveland19 is reporting that authorities received a call last Thursday morning about a home that had been sprayed painted with graffiti. Police investigated and believed the suspect also tried to pour sugar into the gas tank of a vehicle in the driveway. The incident was caught on camera and the victim thought the attacker looked familiar. It turned out to be Dietz, who confessed to police. When asked what happened, Dietz told police he “sprayed **** on her house” because she’s a “*******.” He also reportedly confessed to trying to add sugar to the gas tank. Chillingly, he also said the woman was lucky “I didn’t go over with a .357 and start shooting the place up.” While Winchester is never identified in the article or video, the timing of the accident and Dietz’s involvement lines up. Authorities also noted the man was upset about “ongoing court actions and medical issues stemming from the accident.” The station says Dietz was arrested and faces charges of felony vandalism and misdemeanor aggravated menacing. Additional charges are possible and the felony vandalism offense carries significant jail time, depending on the value of the damage. Lead image credit: Cleveland19",
