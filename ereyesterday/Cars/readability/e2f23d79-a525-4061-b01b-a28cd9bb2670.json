  "description": "Alpina has taken the wraps off its most powerful model, the B8 GT based on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe. The B8 GT comes with an uprated version of the 4.4-litre V8 engine and will likely be Alpina’s last model as a standalone tuner as the company becomes a part of BMW as per a 2022 agreement. Alpina B8 GT gets 634hp and 850Nm of torque Its claimed 0-100kph time is 3.3 seconds Production will be limited to 99 units Powering the B8 GT is BMW’s 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine that makes 634hp at 5,500-6,500rpm and 850Nm of peak torque at 3,500-5,000rpm. Interestingly, the output figure is 1hp less than the M5 CS, and the B8 GT is just 0.4 seconds slower to sprint from 0-100kph than BMW’s sporty four-door sedan. Alpina also claims a 0-200kph time of 10.5 seconds and a top speed of 330kph. The tuning brand has tweaked the ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic gearbox to handle the extra torque. Alpina says the B8 GT production is capped at 99 units, and only 20 will get a dual-tone paint scheme that combines a blue or green finish with a contrasting black. All units will sport a subtle carbon fibre body kit, including a more prominent rear diffuser, forged 21-inch alloy wheels, bespoke Pirelli P Zero tyres, special badges, a leather and wood interior and a metal insert in the cup holder bearing founder Burkard Bovensiepen’s signature. Bovensiepen passed away in October 2023 at the age of 87.
