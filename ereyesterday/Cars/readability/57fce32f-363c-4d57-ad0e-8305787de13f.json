  "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole.

However, the ACO's adjustments, dampening power and downforce, leveled the playing field, granting GT1 entrants a genuine shot at overall victory. Amidst this evolving landscape emerged an unexpected protagonist, backed by a brand yearning for its 13th Le Mans triumph.​ [caption id=\"attachment_451613\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2880\"] Photo Courtesy of the Porsche Archive[/caption] Jochen Dauer’s Unlikely Masterstroke Austrian entrepreneur and racer Jochen Dauer had acquired five Porsche 962C race cars in 1991 with the ambitious goal of converting them into road legal supercars. At the time, it seemed far fetched. But a few years later, Porsche saw an opportunity and stepped in to assist, modifying the car’s suspension to meet strict German road regulations. By 1993, Porsche discerned the potential in Dauer's endeavor and lent their expertise, tweaking the 962's suspension to align with stringent German road regulations. The metamorphosed Dauer 962 LM made its debut at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show. Shortly thereafter, a pact was forged to field the car in the GT1 class at Le Mans, with the seasoned Joest Racing team at the helm.​ Under the GT1 regulations, this iteration of the 962 enjoyed a power resurgence, a stark contrast to the constraints its prototype predecessors had endured. The compromise? Narrower tires. Yet, the ace up its sleeve was a substantially larger fuel tank compared to its P1 adversaries—a tactical advantage that would prove pivotal.​ As if to underscore Porsche’s full backing, the driver lineup was stacked with talent: two time Le Mans winner Hans Joachim Stuck, ex Formula One drivers Danny Sullivan and Thierry Boutsen, endurance racing aces Yannick Dalmas and Mauro Baldi, and American sportscar legend Hurley Haywood. [caption id=\"attachment_451614\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2880\"] Photo Courtesy of the Porsche Archive[/caption] The 1994 Le Mans Victory Competing under the banner of FATurbo Express, a transport brand of the logistics firm Français Allemande Transite, and erstwhile sponsor of Group C Porsche 962s, the #36 Dauer-Porsche, piloted by Dalmas, Baldi, and Haywood, seized a resounding victory.​ While rivals grappled to eke out 12 laps per fuel stint, the Dauer 962s extended their runs to 14 or 15 laps, securing a strategic upper hand. However, the triumph was not devoid of trials. The #36 car necessitated a driveshaft repair during the night and lagged behind the leading Toyota as the race neared its climax. Fate intervened when the Japanese prototype encountered a gear linkage malfunction on Sunday, catapulting the Dauer machine into the lead.​ The sister #35 car, with Sullivan, Boutsen, and Stuck at the wheel, clinched third place despite early setbacks, a puncture-induced spin and a tense episode where Boutsen navigated half a lap shrouded in darkness after shedding the front bodywork. The aspiration for a 1-2 finish slipped away in the waning moments, as future Ferrari F1 driver Eddie Irvine commandeered second place for Toyota amidst traffic, barely maintaining his position in a frenetic finale. A One and Done Success Story A total of thirteen Dauer 962 LM road cars were built, fewer than required under the revised 1995 ACO rulebook, which effectively closed the loophole that had enabled Porsche’s triumph. Some of these road cars were even fitted with DVD players, a futuristic touch for the era. Among the buyers? The Sultan of Brunei, who reportedly acquired six. On the racing side, only three Dauer 962 LMs were built, with a spare tub brought to Le Mans in 1994 that never saw competition. This meant that Porsche’s GT1 class victory was truly a one time deal. Dauer’s Rise and Fall Post-Le Mans, Jochen Dauer embarked on an even more ambitious venture, acquiring the remnants of the bankrupt Bugatti in 1995 and reengineering the EB110 with carbon fiber bodywork. However, the project stumbled, and Dauer's fortunes waned. In 2010, he faced imprisonment for tax evasion.​ Meanwhile, the F.A.T. International moniker faded into obscurity, until Ferdi Porsche resurrected it for contemporary endeavors, encompassing ice racing, karting, upscale dining establishments, and collaborations with Porsche Design. What started as a creative rule interpretation resulted in one of the most fascinating Le Mans victories in history, securing Dauer's place in motorsport folklore.   Continue...",
