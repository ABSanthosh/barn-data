  "description": "Honda has launched the 2025 XL750 Transalp at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom, Haryana). Its price remains unchanged compared to the outgoing model, but it receives a few new features. XL750 Transalp gets a new headlight; design same as the CB750 Hornet It gets revised suspension settings at both ends Honda XL750 Transalp: what’s new? For 2025, the XL750 gets a new windscreen and revised suspension settings For 2025, the Transalp’s fundamentals remain unchanged. It gets a new bi-led headlight setup, setting it apart from the outgoing model. It gets a redesigned windscreen with a new central duct that's supposed to improve airflow over the rider’s helmet. Honda has also made one crucial change to its suspension, with reduced damping at the front and a firmer shock at the rear. We had pointed this drawback out in our review and we look forward to experiencing this revised setup. The brand claims to have increased compression and rebound damping at both the front fork and rear shock. The XL750 Transalp also features an updated 5.0-inch TFT and four-way switchgear from the NX500. It features more customisation options compared to the outgoing model’s TFT. It also gets five riding modes (Sport, Standard, Rain, Gravel and User) that alters engine performance, engine braking and traction control. Apart from these changes, the 2025 XL750 Transalp remains unchanged from the outgoing model. It continues to be offered in two paint schemes – white and black – but they have been revised compared to the 2024 model. The XL750 Transalp continues to be powered by the same 755cc, parallel-twin, liquid-cooled engine that delivers 91.7hp and 75Nm. It's mated to a six-speed gearbox with a slip-and-assist clutch. The bi-directional quickshifter is a pricey optional extra. Priced at Rs 11 lakh, the 2025 XL750 Transalp’s price remains unchanged compared to the outgoing model. Booking has commenced with deliveries beginning from July.  Also see:  Updated Honda Transalp 750 to launch in India soon",
