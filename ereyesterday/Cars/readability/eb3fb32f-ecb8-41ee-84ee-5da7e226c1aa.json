  "description": "They come from near and far. Cars, cars, and more cars. Modern classics, all of them: sports cars, limos, performance sedans, muscle cars, and SUVs. Real cars. With real engines. real performance and real muscle. Cars from Germany, Italy, Britain Japan and US. Performance icons, cars renowned for their styling, cars that adorned our walls. The good and great, all placed together. Row upon row of epoch-making cars, a veritable museum of auto delights. Around 120 modern classics, carefully placed on the green lawns of the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, each with its own story to tell and era to revisit. Modern Classic Rally 2025 opens with 120-strong car exhibition Iconic muscle cars like Dodge Viper, Ford Mustang, and Chevrolet Camaro on display Sportscars from Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, and more also drew attention Modern Classic Rally 2025 muscle cars The cars that draw the biggest crowds are the muscle cars – outlandish designs with large bonnet scoops, air inlets and shaker hoods. Highlights include multiple Ford Mustangs (it was Ford that pioneered the mass-produced V8 engine), some with massive bus superchargers sticking out of the bonnet, Mach 1’s, big 427s, and iconic fastbacks. Gen 1 Dodge Viper also made an appearance Also present are multiple Pontiac Firebirds, with even a few early small-block equipped cars, as well as others with the famous square headlight and flaming bird decals on the bonnets. There are also multiple Corvettes and Camaros from Chevy, and a Charger fastback and a 8-litre V10-equipped Viper, of course, probably the pinnacle. Modern Classic Rally 2025 JDM cars From the US to Japan, and some delicious JDM cars. Honda’s game-changing NSX that taught Ferrari and Lambo how to make useable supercars, Nissan’s fabulous early GTRs that pioneered the electronic control of traction, and the outlandish Supra, with its near-indestructible 2JZ, which could easily be taken up to 800 or even 1,000hp with only minor mods. Modern Classic Rally 2025 Italian cars Ferrari, Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati cars galore Italians, however, do it better, and this time we have a special treat. Not one, not two, but three special Ferrari V8s. The F430 Scuderia, with its track-focused upgrades, a 458 Speciale Aperta – the last of the great naturally aspirated V8s, and the 488 Pista, the twin turbo special with 711hp. What a set, and they are all in red. We even have a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, or lightweight, that, despite its four-wheel-drive hardware and big V10 in the back, comes in at only around 1,500kg. From Ferrari to Alfa, and half a dozen or so spectacular examples. From the sublime Duetto convertible by Pininfarina to the 1750 GTV designed by the master Giugiaro and a rare six-cylinder 2600. Also Alfas sporting sedans, the Berlina and Super that helped actually also helped BMW define its brand. We even have three cool Maseratis: the Biturbo, the world’s first twin-turbo production car; the elegant 4200 with its timeless lines; and a more modern MC Straddle, with its Ferrari V8 engine and sharp front-engine handling. Modern Classic Rally 2025 European cars Also present in good numbers are BMWs, all the way from the E21 and E30s to M3s with big V8s under the hood. And we even have early TDS diesels that still sound super smooth. Up ahead, the Mercedes SLs, the timeless R129, partly responsible for the Youngtimer or Modern Classic, movement. We also have the tough-as-a-tank R107 SL, and even a pair of SECs, which still have lines that look better than today’s coupes. Also, Porsche, from the first 356, an SC, to a 996 911, and a pair of 997s, one of them a turbo. Rolls Royce, Jaguar, and Lotus classic cars exhibited as well Finally, from the UK, a quartette of Rolls-Royces, from the Silver Shadow onwards, all the way to the Phantom. Also in the mix, a pair of Lotus Elises, the lightweight bonded aluminium cars that rewired the sports car world, and a pair of E-Types, a convertible and a coupe with that rear door. Modern Classic Rally 2025 route map Mumbai While these are only some of the cars, you can see, hear, and feel all of them drive by if you are in Mumbai. The cars will leave from the Grand Hyatt hotel in Kalina at 10:30 hrs, head to the Sea Link, and then take the coastal road, taking a U-turn at Breach Candy before heading back.
