  "description": "Royal Enfield’s most accessible roadster, the Hunter 350, has been updated for 2025, marking the first major update this motorcycle has received since its inception. For this year, RE has made a few crucial changes to make the Hunter 350 more appealing. Here’s everything you need to know about the updated model.  Available in three variants Gets a new rear suspension Royal Enfield Hunter 350: What’s New? The Hunter 350 remains largely mechanically unchanged The biggest change has been made to the rear suspension, which moves from a linear spring to a progressive one. This, along with a new routing for the exhaust, has resulted in an overall increase of ground clearance by 10mm. The bike now also comes equipped with a redesigned seat that has the same profile as before but now features a higher foam density to aid comfort. The brand has also thrown in a slip-assist clutch across all Hunter 350 variants. Additionally, this model now gets more features and tech.  RE has now equipped the Hunter 350 with an LED headlamp and a digi-analogue instrument cluster with a tripper pod, and higher variants get a Type-C charger as standard. The Hunter 350 is available in six colours spread across three variants. Apart from these updates, the motorcycle remains largely mechanically unchanged.   The Hunter continues with the 349cc air-cooled J-series motor that delivers a relaxed 20.2hp and 27Nm. It's mated to the same slick-shifting 5-speed gearbox that is now paired with a slip-assist clutch. Currently, the Hunter 350 rivals the likes of the Honda CB350 RS and the Jawa 42. Prices for the Hunter 350 start at Rs 1.50 lakh for the base variant, Rs 1.77 lakh for the mid-spec variant and Rs 1.82 lakh for the top variant. While prices for the base variant remain the same as before, the top variant now sees a Rs 5,000 increase in price over the model it replaces.
