  "description": "The BMW Z4 M40i has just got a new special edition variant in India called the Pure Impulse edition. The big news is that it is the first time that BMW has offered a manual gearbox on the Z4 M40i, which has an ex-showroom price of Rs 97.90 lakh. There’s also the option of the 8-speed automatic, which, incidentally, costs less. The Pure Impulse edition also brings a few cosmetic updates inside and out, so let’s take a closer look. Z4 M40i Pure Impulse gets a 340hp inline 6-cylinder engine Available with 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic gearbox options Gets two new colour options: Frozen Deep Green and Sanremo Green Below are the prices of the BMW Z4 M40i range in India: BMW Z4 M40i price (ex-showroom)Variant Price BMW Z4 M40i AT Rs 92.90 lakh BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse ATRs 96.90 lakh BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse MTRs 97.90 lakh Just like the regular Z4 M40i, the new Pure Impulse edition also comes to India as a full import. Its automatic gearbox-equipped variant costs Rs 4 lakh more than the standard car. BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse powertrain New 6-speed manual gearbox Under the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse edition’s hood is the familiar 3.0-litre, straight-6 turbo-petrol engine that produces 340hp and 500Nm of torque, sending power to the rear wheels. The most notable addition is the 6-speed manual gearbox, which is not available with the regular Z4 M40i; the 8-speed torque converter automatic has been carried over as is. BMW claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.5 seconds with the automatic gearbox, while the manual takes 4.6 seconds. BMW Z4 M40i Pure Impulse exterior and interior updates New staggered wheel setup, new colours The biggest cosmetic update on the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse is a new staggered wheel setup comprising 19-inch front and 20-inch rear M alloy wheels with a double-spoke design. The Pure Impulse edition also gets a red finish for the brake calipers and a gloss-black finish on the doors and wing mirror caps. BMW is also offering two new colour options – Frozen Deep Green and Sanremo Green – alongside the colours already available with the regular Z4 M40i. New leather upholstery Inside, the special edition roadster gets Vernasca Cognac leather upholstery (dual-tone black and beige) with contrasting stitching that’s exclusive to the manual variant. In contrast, the regular Z4 M40i gets black leather upholstery. The equipment list remains unchanged. So, the dual 10.25-inch instrument cluster and central touchscreen, dual-zone auto AC, ambient lighting, electrically adjustable front seats with memory function for the driver’s seat and wireless phone charger have been carried over. Plenty of optional extras BMW is also offering numerous optional extras with the Z4 M40i Pure Impulse edition. These include lumbar support for the driver and passenger, M seat belts, adaptive LED headlights, an interior and exterior Mirror Package, a Harman Kardon sound system, a parking assistant and a head-up display. Direct rival to Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet The BMW Z4 is a direct rival to the Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet, but as a manual 2-seat roadster, it really is in a territory of its own. The Pure Impulse variants will be limited-edition, says BMW. Also See: Bentley Continental GT, Flying Spur get new 680hp V8 hybrid New Chevrolet Corvette electric concept revealed",
