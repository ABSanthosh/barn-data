  "description": "The second-generation Jeep Compass has been leaked in full ahead of its scheduled official debut in Europe by mid-2025. Sharing underpinnings with the recently unveiled second-generation Citroen C5 Aircross, the new Compass has an evolutionary design, a new interior and is expected to use the same powertrain as its Citroen sibling, i.e., a mild-hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and an all-electric powertrain. This new Compass, however, will not be make it to India. New Compass is based on Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform Draws design cues from larger Grand Cherokee Expected to get mild-hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains Second-gen Jeep Compass exterior design Looks more butch and muscular than the first-gen Compass  The second-gen Jeep Compass looks very much like an evolution of the outgoing Compass’ design, and when viewed from the front, it looks like a scaled-down Grand Cherokee. The face is characterised by Jeep’s signature 7-slot grille that has been blanked-off and even gets some illuminated at the top. It is flanked by new simple, rectangular headlamps with the LED DRL signatures positioned at the edges. The bumper, meanwhile, gets a healthy dose of black plastic cladding and a large centrally-located air intake. Over to the side, the new Compass gets squared-out wheel arches, a very prominent shoulder line and some deep contouring for the doors near the sills. The window-line pinches slightly at the rear three quarters, and the blacked-out roof and pillars contrast well with the body. It also gets new dual-tone, five spoke alloy wheels. The new Compass, perhaps, looks the most attractive from the rear quarter where it gets a contrasting finish for the number plate housing that extends to enclose the tail lamps as well. The two-part tail lamps are connected with a light bar with an illuminated Jeep logo in between. Second-gen Jeep Compass interior and features Interior gets new twin, connected screen setup  A single leaked image of the interior gives us a side angle view which doesn’t reveal much about the overall design, but what can be discerned is a twin screen setup for the infotainment and digital instrument cluster. There are also aluminium and wooden inserts on the dashboard and a new centre console with a rotary dial and some physical switchgear. Some of the features visible are a panoramic sunroof, a wireless charger in between the front seats and head-up display. Second-gen Jeep Compass platform and powertrain Two hybrids and an all-electric version expected  The new Compass sits on parent brand Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform, and it is expected to carry over the same powertrain options from the new C5 Aircross, although this is yet to be officially confirmed. The range will comprise a 134hp, 1.2-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine that’s coupled with a 12hp electric motor and a small 0.9kWh battery. Then there’s the PHEV which uses a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine in tandem with a 125hp electric motor for a combined 195hp, and has a 21kWh battery. Meanwhile, the all-electric Compass is expected to come with two battery options – 73kWH and 97kWh – in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. Next-gen Jeep Compass India launch plans As we have reported previously, the next-gen Compass will not come to India. Sources tell us that the new STLA Medium platform failed to meet the commercial viability for the Indian market, forcing Stellantis to cancel it. Given that the existing Compass sells in just three digits on a monthly basis, the involved expense did not justify the expected volumes.  Also See: Jeep Wrangler Willys ’41 Edition launched at Rs 73.24 lakh Volkswagen Golf GTi bookings open on May 5",
