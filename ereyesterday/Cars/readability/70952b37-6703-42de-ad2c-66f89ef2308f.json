  "description": "JSW MG Motor India will have one of the most sprawling pavilions at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025. We have already reported on MG’s plan to launch the new Cyberster electric sports car and showcase the M9 electric MPV. Now, the carmaker has confirmed two more models will be on display at the event – the MG 7 Trophy and the iML6 sedans. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. MG Cyberster The Cyberster will be MG’s showstopper at the Auto Expo. It has been showcased in India previously, but this time, MG will announce prices for what will be their first sportscar in India. To be sold through the ‘Select’ premium channel, the Cyberster is based on a born-electric platform. It will be offered with a 77kWh battery pack, paired with two electric motors on each axle, simulating an AWD setup. This powertrain produces 510hp and 725Nm of peak torque, with a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.2 seconds. MG claims a maximum range of 580km on a single charge (CLTC cycle). The open-top, two-door sportscar has classic proportions and a sleek new design language that’s reminiscent of MG's historic sporting heritage. MG M9 The newly christened M9, which is sold as the Mifa 9 abroad, will be second model to retail from the MG Select channel. It will make a reappearance in India as it has been previously showcased at the 2023 Auto Expo, but then MG didn’t have concrete plans of launching it here, and was only evaluating audience interest. The all-electric M9 has a front-wheel-drive setup. It is expected to be offered with a 90kWh battery which has a claimed WLTP range of 430km, while the front electric motor produces 245hp and 350Nm. The M9 is a large vehicle, stretching the tape at 5.2 metres in length, and is offered in both 7- and 8-seater layouts. The real highlight of the MPV is its second-row captain’s chairs with powered ottoman and massage function. The commercial launch is slated for March 2025, and it will likely be locally assembled, with prices ranging around Rs 65 lakh (ex-showroom). IM L6 sedan The L6 is an electric sedan from IM Motors. IM, which stands for ‘Intelligent Mobility’, was founded as an EV-only brand by MG’s parent brand SAIC in 2020, alongside e-commerce giant Alibaba and R\u0026D specialists Zhangjiang Hi-Tech. The L6 made its global debut at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show and is based on its iO Origin architecture. What’s unique about the L6 is that it uses a solid-state battery that significantly improves charging times and reduces leakage risks compared to a lithium-ion battery. In top-spec guise, the L6 uses a 133kWh battery which has a CLTC-certified range of 998km. Additionally, it can add 400km of range in just 12 minutes of charging. On the inside, the L6 gets a 26.3-inch panoramic screen setup, an additional vertical 10.5-inch screen, and even a yoke-like steering wheel. It also comes standard with ultra-long-range lidar, NVIDIA Orin X chip, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 chip. MG 7 Trophy The M6 7 Trophy is a fastback sports sedan that’s based on the regular MG 7 sedan available in some markets overseas. It has a low-slung fastback silhouette with muscular rear shoulders and sharp character lines flowing down its body. Under the hood, the Trophy variant features a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine that produces 257hp and 405Nm of torque, and it comes mated to a 9-speed automatic gearbox. In comparison, the regular MG 7 sedan uses a smaller 1.5-litre petrol engine. It is also luxuriously appointed on the inside with a twin-screen infotainment and digital instrument cluster setup. The interiors also exude a sporty feel with a dark colour scheme and sports seats. Apart from the said models, MG will also have its existing range of products like the Windsor and the Hector lineup on display at the Auto Expo 2025.
