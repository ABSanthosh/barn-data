  "description": "The exact definition of ‘café racer‘ is often debated, but it holds a special meaning for Kenji Heianzan, founder of the Japanese workshop Minami Motorcycle. “We pursue what we call the ‘Way of the Café,’” he tells us. “It’s a philosophy that values quiet confidence, balance, and street presence, without pretense.” Minami Motorcycle is a small two-man operation based in Meguro—a quiet residential ward in Tokyo. They have a particular affinity for iconic Japanese bikes like the Honda CB750, and they love simplicity. “Our approach to customization is one of subtraction rather than addition,” says Heianzan-san, “enhancing the motorcycle’s natural lines and structural beauty without relying on flashy parts or excessive shine. We believe the highest compliment is when someone asks, ‘Was this bike sold like this from the factory?’”…",

  "text": "The exact definition of ‘café racer‘ is often debated, but it holds a special meaning for Kenji Heianzan, founder of the Japanese workshop Minami Motorcycle. “We pursue what we call the ‘Way of the Café,’” he tells us. “It’s a philosophy that values quiet confidence, balance, and street presence, without pretense.” Minami Motorcycle is a small two-man operation based in Meguro—a quiet residential ward in Tokyo. They have a particular affinity for iconic Japanese bikes like the Honda CB750, and they love simplicity. “Our approach to customization is one of subtraction rather than addition,” says Heianzan-san, “enhancing the motorcycle’s natural lines and structural beauty without relying on flashy parts or excessive shine. We believe the highest compliment is when someone asks, ‘Was this bike sold like this from the factory?’” This 1978 Honda CB750 F2 is a cracking example of that ideology in practice. Built for the same photographer who took these stellar photos, Yuhei Kodaka, it effortlessly rides the line between café racer and restomod. Minami accomplished this balance by retaining just the right number of OEM parts, while adding custom details that complement them. The fuel tank is original, but it has an entirely different vibe juxtaposed against the custom seat and tail bump. The saddle is covered in Toray Ultrasuede—a durable synthetic fabric with a suede-like finish. The subframe was trimmed and looped to accommodate the shorter tailpiece. A license plate mount sits out back, flanked by LEDs that handle taillight and turn signal duties. The Honda retains its Comstar wheels, but they’re now wrapped in Coker tires. The front forks have been lowered, and the rear shocks have been replaced by modern items. An aluminum fender sits above the front wheel. A 5 3/4” headlight is mounted higher up, attached to handmade brackets that also host the front turn signals. The CB750’s cockpit is standard café racer fare. Minami installed Magura clip-ons, plus a new top yoke that’s devoid of handlebar clamps. The bars are adorned with CNC-machined switch blocks and leather-wrapped grips, and there’s a compact Daytona speedo mounted front and center. Rear-set foot controls from Over Racing do duty lower down. The engine is stock, but it inhales through Keihin CR carbs with pod filters. The whole bike’s been rewired, and the stock exhaust headers now terminate in a classy reverse-cone muffler. For the livery, Minami picked a glossy blue teal hue as the dominant color. The tank wears OEM Honda badges, while the raw aluminum front fender and handmade side covers add contrast. “As with our usual style, the idea was based on something that doesn’t stand out in an ostentatious way, but quietly reveals its attention to detail upon closer inspection,” Kenji adds. That’s a sentiment we can get behind. Minami Motorcycle | Instagram | Images by Yuhei Kodaka",
