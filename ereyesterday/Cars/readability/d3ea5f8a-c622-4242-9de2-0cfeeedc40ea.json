  "description": "Volkswagen, which has lined up multiple electric models at various price points for global debuts, is now looking to bring in more entry-level EVs for the masses. The first among these would be the ID.2, which will have a more conventional design, similar to the German brand’s ICE-powered models, according to our sister publication, Autocar UK. VW to continue to invest in ICE-powered models globally However, it still maintains that the future is electric India to get a Skoda Kaylaq-based compact SUV Future VW car designs: what’s in store? The future design direction taken by Volkswagen will ensure its all-electric ID range will look less seperated from the rest of its line-up. Volkswagen will also continue to invest in ICE architectures and technology and has put no end date on such investments, according to its new sales and marketing boss, Martin Sander. Speaking at the Paris Motor Show, Sander said he was still convinced “the future is electric” despite slowing demand for EVs. Sander added that “the ICE market globally is still that big that we can't put an end date to ICE development today”. “Of course, sooner or later, there will be an end date, determined by customer demand,\" he continued. \"As long as we see customers demanding ICE vehicles, we will have an offer. Importantly, when asked if that would lead to more convergence in the styling of ICE cars and EVs, Sander replied, “Yes.” The first example of this is set to be the production version of the Golf-sized ID.2all concept, which has styling that’s more in line with traditional VWs than the firm’s ID EVs. This raises the potential for two models in VW’s Golf range: an ICE car called Golf that’s built on a traditional architecture and an EV called ID Golf, styled similarly in a more “likeable” way but built on an EV-specific architecture. “I think it’s really important that we have a clear Volkswagen design language,” said Sander, adding, “For the next launches, you will see much more clarity in the way Volkswagen vehicles are designed.” Sander stated that there were no plans to drop the ID badge completely, even if the designs and names of their EVs converge on something more traditionally VW. He also confirmed that Volkswagen was now investigating extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) hybrid technology after its recent surge in popularity in China. Volkswagen line-up for India: what’s the plan? For India, Volkswagen will introduce a Skoda Kylaq-based compact SUV; the facelifts for Taigun and Virtus are also in the pipeline.
