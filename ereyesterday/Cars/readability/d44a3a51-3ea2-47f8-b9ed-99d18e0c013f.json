  "text": "A handful of rocks on the edge of the road appear to have prevented the untimely demise of the car October 14, 2024 at 20:46 by Brad Anderson A Subaru WRX fell off the back of a flatbed while driving on a remote mountain road. It remains unclear whether the rally car suffered any mechanical damage after the fall. The car came dangerously close to plummeting off the edge of a cliff during the mishap. One would think that the most obvious and basic thing to do when transporting a car on a flatbed is to strap it down securely. Failing to do that can turn a simple transport job into a disaster waiting to happen. Yet, for some reason, not everyone seems to follow that most basic of rules. Enter one flatbed driver, whose negligence or forgetfulness resulted in a near catastrophe for a Subaru WRX rally car. This clip, while short, was recently shared on social media and shows a flatbed transporting a modified WRX up a mountain road. While we can’t pinpoint the exact location of the footage, some clues suggest it was filmed on a remote mountain road in Turkey. In any case, the scenery does little to detract from the nerve-wracking drama that unfolds on-screen. Read: Transport Truck Flips With 10+ Supercars On Board As the video starts, the rally car, not strapped down properly (if at all), starts to roll backward toward the edge of the flatbed, teetering like a domino about to fall. The driver of the truck quickly brakes and this forces the WRX to roll forward. Unfortunately, as the truck was parked on a small slope, the WRX started rolling back again and fell off the rear of the flatbed. Initially, the rear wheels drop off the edge before the undertray painfully slides down the bed. The rear then slams into the ground before the front does the same, with the bumper almost completely ripped off from the car. While rally cars have suspension components designed to take a beating, the mistake could have caused some serious damage. An Alfa Romeo Tonale was traveling behind the Subaru at the time, and the driver was forced to reverse out of the way to avoid being collected by it. Things then go from bad to worse as the WRX rolls down the hill and toward the edge of a cliff. The clip cuts out shortly after the WRX reaches the cliff, and it seems as though it may have been stopped by some rocks conveniently located on the edge of the road, preventing it from sliding off the side of the mountain. While the Subaru may have narrowly escaped a full plunge off the mountain, the clip serves as a reminder of just how crucial it is to follow basic safety protocols, and that includes strapping down a car on a flatbed.",
