  "text": "Local authorities described a loud boom in the middle of the night and said they're working with the FBI to find the source 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Authorities in Washington are investigating a badly damaged Tesla Supercharger. They believe that an arsonist might have planted a bomb to destroy the station. FBI joins local investigators to determine if Tesla station was deliberately targeted. Just a few years ago, the idea of someone targeting a Tesla charging station in a bombing attack would’ve seemed unthinkable. Today, it’s just the latest sign of growing anger aimed directly at Elon Musk. Authorities in Washington State believe an explosive device might have been planted at a Supercharger station, destroying part of the site and taking the entire location offline. Now, Tesla, the FBI, and local law enforcement are all trying to figure out what happened. According to Lacey Police, a call came in around 1:30 a.m. reporting a “loud noise in the Sleater Kinney area.” When officers showed up at the local Target on 655 Sleater Kinney Rd, they found a severely damaged Supercharger station. Photos from the scene show one of the main cabinets of the charging station in several pieces. A Supercharger stall also has a piece missing. More: Vandals Attack 5 Cybertrucks At Shopping Mall Triggering Police Hunt The Lacey Police Department is calling the incident “malicious mischief” and said that it’s working with the FBI to sort out exactly what happened. In response to news of the event, Tesla itself responded on X to say that it’s working with the LPD and FBI to provide security camera footage. “Don’t mess with critical infrastructure,” it concluded. Restoring Power—and a Bit of Normalcy Notably, Tesla says it’s also working with Puget Sound Energy to get the Supercharger station back to full functionality so hopefully, those who rely on it won’t be without power for too long. This is, sadly, far from the first example of this sort of damage in recent months. Protests span across not just the USA, but the world at this point. While most have been peaceful, a growing handful of incidents in the States and abroad are violent and or dangerous. Elon Musk has blamed the surge in Tesla-related vandalism on backlash to his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has become a lightning rod thanks to deep federal budget cuts and significant government job losses. He has also claimed that criticism from Democratic leaders has fueled hostility toward Tesla and its supporters. It’s becoming clear that some protesters see Tesla as a proxy for Elon Musk himself—an easy, visible target to vent frustration. Unfortunately, that means owners, many of whom have no connection to Musk’s politics or public persona, are getting caught in the crossfire. In response to the uptick in vandalism, the FBI has launched a task force to investigate attacks on Tesla property. Even so, the broader wave of unrest shows no signs of slowing down. We're on-site with @LaceyPolice and @FBI, and reviewing camera footage. Also coordinating with @PSETalk to get the Superchargers back online asap. Don't mess with critical infrastructure. — Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) April 8, 2025 Credit: Lacey police",
