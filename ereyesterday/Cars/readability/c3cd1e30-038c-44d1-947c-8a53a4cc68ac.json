BMW M’s engineers have delivered hit after hit over the years, from the hotted-up M30 in the E12 530 MLE to the twin-turbocharged S58 sledgehammer in the current M3/M4 models. Since 1978’s M88 – a true engineering beauty – BMW M straight-six engines have offered a unique character that other manufacturers just can’t match. I do admit, I’m a through-and-through BMW nerd. As such, I might be blind to the… quirks associated with BMW M’s masterpieces. Others might call these ‘inherent design flaws.’ “But, Mario!” you exclaim, “What about rod bearings?” Never heard of him. “VANOS?” I don’t speak Spanish, sorry. “Timing chain slip?” Oh, is that the time? I really must be going… Fine, I’m not totally ignorant of the flaws that Bavaria’s finest engineers never ironed out of their engines. And that’s before we even mention difficult tuning or the availability of aftermarket parts. M-tax is real, and it can be prohibitively expensive to extract big power from a naturally aspirated M car. So what sonorous straight-six engine does Wael have in his 328i, with easy tuning and the ability to run serious power? A Toyota 2JZ-GTE, of course. Let’s drop the humour for a moment and speak objectively – this engine swap makes total sense. Architecturally, the fit is similar… ish. Both the car’s original BMW inline-six and its Toyota replacement can be rounded up or down to 30 inches in length, with comparable widths. While this can vary based on turbo setup and ancillaries, the 2JZ block looks right at home in the E46 engine bay. Part of that is due to custom mounts for the engine and gearbox; the high-mount Precision 6466 turbocharger and the modified intake manifold nestle perfectly between the strut towers. Not only has work been put into the engine’s positioning in the bay, but the turbo hints at the engine’s high-power build. From the top down, the 2JZ-GTE’s DOHC 24-valve cylinder head has been ported for maximum flow and features Brian Crower 264-degree camshafts, valve springs, and retainers. Bosch 1,500cc injectors supply fuel, while Audi R8 ignition coils deliver a strong spark. The engine exhales through a custom stainless steel exhaust system, finishing with OEM M3 quad tips. An Auto Verdi dry sump ensures consistent lubrication during heavy cornering, while twin Bosch Motorsport 044 fuel pumps in the boot complement the DeutschWerks 350 in-tank pump. A tried-and-tested combination of 9:1 compression ratio DP forged pistons, Tomei forged connecting rods, and a brand new OEM crankshaft means Wael’s 2JZ can reliably push 720whp. The drivetrain is suitably beefy; the Toyota/Getrag V160 6-speed gearbox has been upgraded with an OS Giken clutch, and runs a Samsonas tower shifter in the cabin. A custom prop shaft connects the transmission to an E39 BMW M5 limited-slip plated differential and driveshafts. If you couldn’t tell by now, this is not a half-hearted build, and the suspension and brakes have been upgraded accordingly. The E46 rides on KW V3 coilovers with Powerflex polyurethane bushes all around. Millway uni-ball camber top mounts allow Wael to fine-tune the alignment, while Brembo 6-piston front and 4-piston rear callipers provide serious stopping power. Apex wheels in 18×10-inch sit at all four corners. The 328i can take such aggressive fitment because the body has been converted to M3 spec. Wider M3 rear arches have been grafted on, complemented by M3 bumpers, mirrors, side skirts, and front wings. The boot lid is a genuine M3 CSL item, and the whole car is adorned with carbon fibre accents like the diffuser, front lip, corner intakes, and interior trim. Inside, Sparco Evo II seats secure the driver and passenger with SCHROTH Racing 6-point harnesses, while the Sparco steering wheel ties in nicely. For all its hardcore nature, small touches ensure Wael’s E46 remains comfortable. A carbon fibre rear bulkhead minimises noise in the cabin and complements the carbon fibre door cards. Even the Sparco seats have electrically adjustable bases, and the car retains a sunroof. I don’t think an M3-spec E46 can ever be called a sleeper, but licence plate aside, no clues reveal what Wael’s car hides under the hood. To me, that’s a fantastic thing, as the E46 M3 is one of my all-time favourite car designs. At a glance, this 328i looks like an M3 you might spot on the streets. A closer look at the roll cage, Apex wheels, and substantial brakes may mark it out as a typical ‘Clubsport’ build these days. Yet, this car is fundamentally a fantastic chassis, elevated to M3 spec and beyond. Choice upgrades address what may well be an E46 M3’s Achilles’ heel: its S54 engine. Is it my perfect E46? Hmm, I don’t think so. I’m too much of a purist. Objectively, however, is it the perfect E46? It’s certainly a strong contender for the crown.
