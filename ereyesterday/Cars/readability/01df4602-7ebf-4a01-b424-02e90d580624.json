  "text": "Owners will be able to drive their Valkyrie LMs at Formula 1 circuits around the world June 8, 2025 at 20:14 by Brad Anderson The car is virtually identical to the brand’s current Le Mans Hypercar. This track-honed beast has the Valkyrie’s beloved 6.5-liter V12. Aston Martin will host special track days for the fortunate few owners. Just a few days after Porsche unveiled a one-off road-legal version of its 963 Le Mans Hypercar, Aston Martin has revealed a production version of its flagship racing hypercar. Known as the Valkyrie LM, this track-only monster is essentially an uprated version of the car that will race at Le Mans this weekend, which will be offered to 10 lucky buyers. If you thought the Valkyrie AMR Pro was insane, the new Valkyrie LM looks to take things to another level. Just like the car racing at Le Mans, the LM looks virtually identical, with the same crazy aerodynamic body. Aston Martin hasn’t released any downforce figures, but does say the LM can pull 3.5g of lateral force and 2.5g under heavy braking. Read: Aston Martin Goes WEC And IMSA Racing With Valkyrie Hypercar Like the race car, the Valkyrie LM retains the Cosworth 6.5-liter naturally-aspirated V12. Curiously, despite the LM being free from racing regulations, this engine has been capped at 697 hp, despite the road-going Valkyrie pushing 1,000 hp alone from the same V12. No acceleration figures have been confirmed, although Aston says the LM can hit 210 mph (338 km/h). The LM weighs just 1,030 kg (2,270 lbs). The engine is mated to a seven-speed transmission driving the rear wheels. Aston Martin has eliminated the electronic systems required for the race car and also removed the ballasts designed to make endurance racing as competitive as possible. It’s a single seater with a carbon fiber seat and a racing steering wheel that looks fit for an F1 car. Track Day Special An enlarged fuel tank has been added to the Valkyrie LM, while the same double-wishbone front and rear suspension of the racer has been retained. It will also run on bespoke Pirelli slick tires and has the same carbon brakes as the race car. Owners will be treated to a catered experience to get up to speed with the Valkyrie LM and earn a race license. Dedicated track sessions will be held at Silverstone, and later next year, owners will also get to drive at other F1 tracks. “Valkyrie LM is an exquisite opportunity to be part of the most exclusive Aston Martin owners club in the world,” company CEO Adrian Hallmark said. “A Group who can immerse themselves in the purest and most comparable endurance driving experience, one that would otherwise only be available to our works drivers operating at the very limit of sportscar racing’s highest echelon.” The first cars will be delivered in 2026. There’s no word on how much the Valkyrie LM will cost.",
