Late last year, I took a whirlwind 36-hour trip from Vancouver, Canada to Los Angeles, USA with my friend Paul, driven by a single mission: to bring our friend Sid’s RWB Porsche 997 on a journey through some of LA’s most iconic roads and spots. It was one of those rare, fast-paced adventures that somehow leaves you feeling both energized and reflective. We landed at LAX in the early hours of Saturday morning, just past midnight. Our friend Colton was waiting for us, ready to whisk us away. Instead of checking into a hotel, we made an unconventional (but cheap!) choice – parking at Huntington Beach and camping out in Colton’s Audi SUV. The sound of the waves, the cool ocean breeze, and the quiet hum of anticipation made it a surprisingly peaceful start to what we knew would be a busy weekend. By sunrise, we were on our way to Donut Derelicts, a legendary Saturday morning car meet that’s as much about the people as it is about the cars. It’s a place where gearheads and dreamers converge, swapping stories over coffee while marveling at everything from vintage hot rods to new cars. The energy was infectious, a reminder of why car culture feels like a global language. Next, we headed to K’s Speed, where Akira Nakai, the mastermind behind RAUH-Welt Begriff, was busy applying the wide-body RWB treatment to a fleet of Porsches. Watching Nakai-san work is a privilege. His attention to detail and artistic flow are hypnotic, each car transformed by his hands into something that feels alive. It’s not just customization; it’s a craft, honed and elevated. But the highlight of the weekend came as the sun began to set. Sid handed us the keys to his RWB, a striking pink creation named Rashomon (羅生門) by Nakai-san. We set off for Azusa Canyon, chasing the sunset up the winding roads. The engine’s exhaust note harmonized with the rustle of leaves and the fading cries of the city below. The air was crisp, the sky painted in hues of gold and crimson, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. As the night deepened, we headed into Downtown LA, where the car’s vibrant pink stood out against the city’s urban glow. We spent hours capturing its beauty through photos and videos, the streets providing a cinematic backdrop. Driving through DTLA in an RWB Porsche felt surreal – the sound of the exhaust reverberating through the empty corridors, the reflections of neon lights dancing across the car’s curves. Behind the wheel, I found myself thinking about how far this journey has taken me. I thought back to when I was just a kid at school, hiding away in a computer lab, pretending to focus on assignments while scrolling through photos and stories of people living an automotive life that inspired me. Now, I was here – driving one of my favorite cars, built by one of my favorite people, through one of my favorite cities. I couldn’t help but wonder if there’s a kid out there right now doing the same thing, looking at the content like this and daring to dream. If they are, I hope they chase it and one day find themselves surrounded by the kind of friendships and experiences that redefine what’s possible. RWB has always been deep at the heart of my love for cars, and this trip only deepened that connection. Rashomon isn’t just a car – it’s a symbol of passion, creativity, and the idea that some dreams are worth chasing. By Sunday afternoon, we were back at LAX, boarding our flight home to Vancouver. The weekend was a blur, over almost as quickly as it began, but it left us with the kind of memories you carry with you forever. Sometimes, it’s not about how long a trip lasts but how deeply it resonates. This one? Heavy in the best way possible.

The air was crisp, the sky painted in hues of gold and crimson, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_03_21.Still019.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_03_21.Still019-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_03_21.Still019\" data-attachment-id=\"665014\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_03_21.Still019.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/a-speedhunters_017a0306-00_12_03_21-still019/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_03_21.Still019-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0612-Enhanced-NR-Edit-copy-2-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"A-Speedhunters_017A0612-Enhanced-NR-Edit copy 2\" data-attachment-id=\"664997\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0612-Enhanced-NR-Edit-copy-2.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/a-speedhunters_017a0612-enhanced-nr-edit-copy-2/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0612-Enhanced-NR-Edit-copy-2-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0597-Enhanced-NR-Edit-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"N-Speedhunters_017A0597-Enhanced-NR-Edit\" data-attachment-id=\"664998\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0597-Enhanced-NR-Edit.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/n-speedhunters_017a0597-enhanced-nr-edit/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0597-Enhanced-NR-Edit-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/a-Speedhunters_017A0614-Enhanced-NR-Edit-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"a-Speedhunters_017A0614-Enhanced-NR-Edit\" data-attachment-id=\"665012\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/a-Speedhunters_017A0614-Enhanced-NR-Edit.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/a-speedhunters_017a0614-enhanced-nr-edit/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/a-Speedhunters_017A0614-Enhanced-NR-Edit-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_37_00.Still020-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_37_00.Still020\" data-attachment-id=\"665008\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_37_00.Still020.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/a-speedhunters_017a0306-00_12_37_00-still020/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/A-Speedhunters_017A0306.00_12_37_00.Still020-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the night deepened, we headed into Downtown LA, where the car’s vibrant pink stood out against the city’s urban glow.

I thought back to when I was just a kid at school, hiding away in a computer lab, pretending to focus on assignments while scrolling through photos and stories of people living an automotive life that inspired me. Now, I was here – driving one of my favorite cars, built by one of my favorite people, through one of my favorite cities. I couldn’t help but wonder if there’s a kid out there right now doing the same thing, looking at the content like this and daring to dream. If they are, I hope they chase it and one day find themselves surrounded by the kind of friendships and experiences that redefine what’s possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0575-Edit-680x453.jpg\" alt=\"N-Speedhunters_017A0575-Edit\" data-attachment-id=\"665010\" data-go-fullscreen=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0575-Edit.jpg\" data-can-print=\"true\" data-attachment-url=\"https://www.speedhunters.com/2025/03/rwb-dreams-a-36-hour-adventure-in-la/n-speedhunters_017a0575-edit/\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/speedhunters-wp-production/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/04230052/N-Speedhunters_017A0575-Edit-1200x800.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eRWB has always been deep at the heart of my love for cars, and this trip only deepened that connection.\u003cem\u003e Rashomon\u003c/em\u003e isn’t just a car – it’s a symbol of passion, creativity, and the idea that some dreams are worth chasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIDzBFea1LM?si=eW6-vpeb2kkv-XZU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Sunday afternoon, we were back at LAX, boarding our flight home to Vancouver.
