  "text": "The production version of the Type 00 concept will offer up to 430 miles of range 2 hours ago by Michael Gauthier Jaguar’s upcoming electric four door GT has been spied ahead of its debut late this year. The model follows in the footsteps of the Type 00 concept, but features a tamer design. The sedan will ride on the new Jaguar Electrical Architecture and offer 430 miles of range. Jaguar has largely gone radio silent since unveiling the Type 00 concept in December. It marked the beginning of a new era for the brand, which had struggled trying to chase Audi, BMW, and Mercedes. However, a lot is happening behind the scenes as the British automaker continues testing their “electric four door GT.” It’s slated to debut late this year and will be built in the United Kingdom. More: Radical Jaguar Type 00 Concept Previews Make-Or-Break Electric Sedan A prototype was recently spied undergoing testing near the Nürburgring and it appears to remain pretty faithful to the concept. While a number of details are hidden by camouflage and padding, we can see the production model will have an upright front fascia and slender headlights. They’re joined by a sporty lower intake that is broken up into three different sections. Bigger changes occur further back as the production model has four doors and a larger greenhouse. Designers also gave the car flush-mounted door handles and a massive charging port cover. Elsewhere, there are sizable wheels and a sporty roofline that echoes the concept. Baldauf The rear end is heavily disguised, but could be far more harmonious than the appliance-like rear end seen on the Type 00. Details are hard to make out, but it appears the model will have a slender, split taillight bar. We can also get a glimpse of what appears to be a more curvaceous bumper and fascia. We can expect to learn more later this year, but the company has already confirmed the car will ride on the all-new Jaguar Electrical Architecture. It’s also slated to have a range of up to 430 miles (692 km) as well as a fast charging capability that can deliver 200 miles (322 km) of range in as little as 15 minutes. Baldauf",
