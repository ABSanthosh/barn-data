  "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar N125 has been revealed fully ahead of its looming India launch but without any details regarding its technical specifications or pricing. N125’s styling is typical Pulsar but distinctive enough Some of its parts are shared with Pulsar N150 and Freedom 125 Expected price is Rs 90,000-Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom)  The new Pulsar N125 has typical aggressive Pulsar styling, but it still has its own identity, which differentiates it from the other models. For starters, the LED headlight seems to be a brand-new unit, and the N125 has a lot of plastic cladding at the front. The fork shrouds and the panel around the headlight are covered in plastic to give it a beefy look. The plastic panel around the headlight will be finished in different colours depending on the shade you choose.  The N125 shares its wheels with the bigger Pulsar N150 and its display and indicators with the Freedom 125. This means that the N125 could have basic Bluetooth functionality built in. In keeping with its youthful positioning, the Pulsar N125 also has some new graphics on the side panels and tail section. Just like its primary rivals, the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R, the Pulsar N125 also has a split seating arrangement. The Pulsar N125 will be Bajaj’s fifth offering in the 125cc class after the Pulsar 125, Pulsar NS125, Freedom 125 and CT 125X, and it remains to be seen if it shares any of its fundamentals with the other models in this list.  We expect that the N125 will be priced in the same ballpark as its rivals from Hero and TVS, so expect it to sit around the Rs 90,000-Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) bracket.  Also See: Bajaj readying TVS Raider, Hero Xtreme 125R rival",
