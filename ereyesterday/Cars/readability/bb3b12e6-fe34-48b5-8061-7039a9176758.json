  "text": "A berserk 2,250-hp four-motor variant does exist, but it won’t be running at the Race to the Clouds this year 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Ford’s Pikes Peak Mach-E boasts 1,421 horsepower and 6,900 pounds of downforce. A different version of the electric coupe won’t race, but it produces 2,250 horses. Romain Dumas, a Pikes Peak champion, will pilot Ford’s Mach-E in this year’s race. The road to the 14,115-foot summit of Pikes Peak is no place for half measures. But that’s exactly what Ford is doing for the 103rd Race to the Clouds – sort of. Of course, when one’s ‘half-measure’ is a super EV with 1,421 horsepower (1059 kW), it’s probably more of a prudent move than others. The crazy bit is that even with half of the available power on board, this Pikes-Peak-bound Mustang Mach-E sounds absolutely monstrous, though, to be fair, it won’t actually be making any noise. Read: Ford Built An Insane Mustang Mach-E Coupe, But You Can’t Buy It We’ve known for a few weeks that the Mach-E Ford is bringing to Colorado Springs was going to be fast. The automaker confirmed the car would make 6,125 pounds (2,778 kg) of downforce, but didn’t say much about power. Now, we know that it’ll carry the same overall package: a trio of six-phase motors (one on the front axle, two on the rear), that the SuperTruck from last year did. This year, though, the drivetrain will make 1,421 horsepower and overall weighs some 260 pounds (117 kg) less. The Mach-E’s New Tricks “We’re continuing to push the boundaries of what’s possible with electric vehicles,” said Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford Performance. “This Super Mustang Mach-E demonstrator represents the next stage in our electrification journey — lighter, leaner, just as powerful, and more capable in high-altitude competition.” What he didn’t say there is that Ford also has a quad motor version that can make 2,250 horsepower (1677 kW) , reports TheDrive. For whatever reason, it won’t be racing this year. Still, the package headed to Pikes Peak sounds potent enough. It uses a new rocker-arm suspension setup, carbon ceramic brakes, and even more downforce than previously confirmed. That’s right, 6,125 pounds was the old number. Now, we know that it’ll actually make 6,900 pounds (3129 kg) at 150 mph. Now the question is whether or not all of that will be enough to win. Romain Dumas: The Secret Weapon Thankfully for Ford, having Romain Dumas at the helm won’t be a hindrance. “After last year’s incredible run with the F-150 Lightning SuperTruck and SuperVan 4.2 before it, I’m honored to be back with Ford to take on this challenge once again,” said Dumas. “This Mach-E is a different beast, and we’re excited to see what it can do on the mountain.” If anyone can win with this car, it’s gotta be Dumas. He’s the man who currently holds the overall record, 7:57.148 in a Volkswagen ID.R concept from 2018. While VW doesn’t seem to have done much with whatever it learned that year, Ford says what it’s doing here will translate directly to production cars. “Racing is our test bed,” added Rushbrook. “Every data point we gather on the mountain helps us build better electric vehicles for our customers — whether it’s maximizing power delivery, improving regen strategies, or managing heat in extreme elevation changes. What we learn here goes straight into future production.” How exactly that’ll translate to what you drive in a few years is up for debate. A Four-Door Mustang? Maybe Finally, let’s just go on record as saying that a four-door Mustang might sound like sacrilege, but if it looks anything like this, it might be good. We’ll be on the lookout for the Mach-E on America’s mountain on June 22nd.",
