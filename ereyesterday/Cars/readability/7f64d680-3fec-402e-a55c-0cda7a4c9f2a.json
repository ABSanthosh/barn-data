  "description": "This 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 fastback is one of 2,048 examples produced for the model year and was assembled on December 22, 1966. It was first delivered to Horn-Williams Ford of Dallas, Texas, remained with its original owner through 2006, and was purchased by its current owner in January 2022. A subsequent refurbishment that was carried out at Cobra Automotive of Wallingford, Connecticut, and completed in 2023 included building a 428ci Police Interceptor V8 and installing a rebuilt Tremec five-speed manual transmission. The car is finished in Wimbledon White with GT500 side stripes and equipped with functional hood scoops, a rear spoiler, power steering and front disc brakes, 15\" Magstar alloy wheels, a pair of Holley four-barrel carburetors, and a dual exhaust system with Dynomax mufflers. The black vinyl interior features front bucket seats, a roll bar, a heater, and an AM/FM radio. This GT500 is now offered by the seller on behalf of his father with a Deluxe Marti report, refurbishment records, historical sales and registration documents, a window sticker, a removed automatic transmission, and a clean Massachusetts title in the owner's name.",

It was first delivered to Horn-Williams Ford of Dallas, Texas, remained with its original owner through 2006, and was purchased by its current owner in January 2022. A subsequent refurbishment that was carried out at Cobra Automotive of Wallingford, Connecticut, and completed in 2023 included building a 428ci Police Interceptor V8 and installing a rebuilt Tremec five-speed manual transmission. The car is finished in Wimbledon White with GT500 side stripes and equipped with functional hood scoops, a rear spoiler, power steering and front disc brakes, 15″ Magstar alloy wheels, a pair of Holley four-barrel carburetors, and a dual exhaust system with Dynomax mufflers. The black vinyl interior features front bucket seats, a roll bar, a heater, and an AM/FM radio. This GT500 is now offered by the seller on behalf of his father with a Deluxe Marti report, refurbishment records, historical sales and registration documents, a window sticker, a removed automatic transmission, and a clean Massachusetts title in the owner’s name. The GT500 model was equipped with a ducktail rear spoiler, fender extensions, sail- and quarter-panel air scoops, and a fiberglass ventilated hood with a ram-air scoop and chrome hood pins. This example is finished in Wimbledon White (4) with GT500 side stripes, and it was optioned without over-the-top stripes. Additional equipment consists of inboard grille-mounted driving lamps as well as chrome-tipped dual exhaust outlets. Five-spoke 15″ Magstar alloy wheels wearing Shelby Cobra center caps were mounted with 225/60 front and 245/60 rear BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires as part of the refurbishment, and a matching spare is stowed in the trunk. GT500 models utilized heavy-duty coil springs and an anti-roll bar up front in addition to heavy-duty leaf springs out back. The steering is power-assisted, as are the front disc and rear drum brakes. Both the brake booster and the steering ram were replaced during the refurbishment. The front bucket and rear Sport Deck seats were reupholstered in black vinyl, and the replacement black carpets are overlaid with rubber GT500 mats. Interior appointments include front seat shoulder harnesses, rear seat lap belts, a push-button AM/FM radio, a TKX Quick Stick short shifter, a locking glovebox, and a heater. A roll bar with inertia-reel harness mechanisms was standard in Shelby cars. The three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and a replacement clock along with fuel and coolant temperature gauges. Stewart-Warner oil pressure and amperage readouts are centrally located on the bottom edge of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 28k miles, approximately 70 of which were added under current ownership. The replacement 428ci Police Interceptor V8 is based on a CNC-decked and -bored C7ME block with line-honed mains, a custom-ground hydraulic roller camshaft, and a balanced rotating assembly that features a Scat crankshaft and Icon forged pistons. A modified Edelbrock aluminum water pump and a high-pressure oil pump were installed, and the C7 cylinder heads were resurfaced and rebuilt with replacement valves, springs, retainers, locks, and bronze guides as well as hardened exhaust seats. The engine breathes through a pair of four-barrel Holley carburetors and Cobra Jet exhaust manifolds flowing into a dual exhaust system equipped with an H-pipe and Dynomax mufflers. Power is routed to the rear wheels by way of a rebuilt Tremec five-speed manual gearbox with a lightened billet steel flywheel. The custom driveshaft is linked with a 9″ rear end with an Eaton Truetrac differential and a 3.50:1 final gear ratio. The Deluxe  Marti Report displays a December 22, 1966, build date and lists factory colors and equipment along with production statistics. The car is also accompanied by a framed sales invoice and window sticker as well as an owner’s manual, refurbishment records and photos, a California car cover, and the removed C6 automatic transmission.
