Gene came up in the California hot rod and racing scene in the 1950s and made his legacy building custom vehicles of every stripe, from his trademark chopped-roof Mercury mashups to Cadillac wagon and ute conversions to fanciful TV and movie vehicles like the Star Trek shuttlecar, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. Piranha, and the cyberpunk menagerie from Blade Runner.",

Gene came up in the California hot rod and racing scene in the 1950s and made his legacy building custom vehicles of every stripe, from his trademark chopped-roof Mercury mashups to Cadillac wagon and ute conversions to fanciful TV and movie vehicles like the Star Trek shuttlecar, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. Piranha, and the cyberpunk menagerie from Blade Runner. Image: Hot Rod Magazine Image: The Modesto Bee Winfield had a prolific mind paired with an equally prolific pair of hands, and the number of cars blessed by his effort certainly numbers in the thousands. Aside from his boundless imagination, we’ve always been struck by the collaborative nature of Winfield’s work. Many of the cars on this site that bear his stamp were built in partnership with other customizers, and he wouldn’t hesitate to augment another’s work with one of his surreal candy-flake-fade color schemes. His openness to creativity and encouragement of other builders’ visions surely were a big part of what made him a household name in the automotive community. Many here learned of Gene Winfield long before they could drive by building AMT scale model kits of his designs, and well into his 90s he taught metalworking and fabrication out of his shop in Mojave, California—$500 for the weekend, with hands-on instruction from the man himself. Image: Motorcity Modified Auto Club via Facebook Winfield’s career spanned nearly 80 years, and he kept up a busy schedule of traveling, teaching, and building as long as his health permitted. It’s little wonder that his influence can be seen in so many of the custom car scenes, from T-bucket hot rods all the way to lowriders. We will always be big admirers of his work, and we are grateful that he—quite literally—passed on the torch to so many others during his lifetime. Eulogies from our Hearst Autos colleagues at Hot Rod and Autoweek can be read by clicking their respective links. And here’s a list of examples of Winfield’s work that have appeared in BaT auctions.
