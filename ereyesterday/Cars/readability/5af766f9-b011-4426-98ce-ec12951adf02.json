  "description": "Given the enthusiastic response to the Range Rover Ranthambore special edition, JLR is planning another bespoke special edition for India. Speaking to the media, Martin Limpert, JLR’s global managing director, said, “Our Ranthambore edition was well received, and our customers want more India-based specials, so we are planning another, and this one is based on the Himalayas.” Special Edition models add to exclusivity, says the brand Local assembly of Range Rover should make more special editions easier  Details of the Himalayan Edition were not disclosed, but it’s likely to get light paint shades, perhaps white, along with special thematic trim, much like the Ranthambore Edition. For reference, the Ranthambore Edition had a bespoke black finish with contrasting Corinthian Bronze and Anthracite accents, said to be inspired by a tiger’s stripes. Inside, the Caraway and Perlino semi-aniline leather upholstery had embroidery inspired by the stripes on a tiger's spine. JLR made 12 units available, and Limpert says all were sold within the first week. The Range Rover Ranthambore Edition had tiger stripes-inspired aesthetics.    Significance of Special Edition models  “Our customers are very appreciative of these editions, as they add to the exclusivity.” To that effect, the company is also planning to enhance its bespoke services offering, something the local assembly of the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport should make easier. Limpert also adds that the local assembly was pivotal in JLR’s performance last year. For FY2025, the company registered a 40 percent growth, selling 6,183 units and putting it in the third spot in the luxury segment in India. Within that, the local assembly of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport saw the models' sales grow by 2.5 times.  Also See:  Volkswagen Golf GTI launch on May 26 New Toyota RAV4 revealed with Camry like design cues",
