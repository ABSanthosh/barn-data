  "text": "Three juveniles aged 14 and 15 are accused of breaking into at least 35 different vehicles across two cities June 3, 2025 at 20:32 by Stephen Rivers Three teens aged 14 and 15 face 136 felony charges after a Georgia car break-in spree. Charges include theft, firearms violations, and entering vehicles that were left unlocked. Police are still investigating and seeking more evidence and additional potential victims. Car break-ins are nothing new, but the recent wave hitting LaGrange, Georgia, has the community on edge and police working overtime. Since March, local law enforcement has responded to reports of at least 35 separate incidents. So, was this the work of of a mastermind criminal sneakily slinking from one location to another to evade capture? Not exactly. According to investigators, the suspects are three teenagers, aged 15 and 14. The Troup County Sheriff’s Office says it arrested three teens, one aged 15 and two who are 14, in connection with the break-ins. Altogether, the trio is facing 52 felony charges within the county. Those charges span a range of offenses, from those directly tied to the vehicle break-ins to theft and even firearms-related violations. More: Teen Breaks Into 121 Cars In One Night, Then Walks Free The city of Hogansville worked with the TCSO in this investigation, and as such, is adding its own charges against the youngsters. The police department there says that it’s charging the teens with a combined 84 felonies. That’s right, 136 felony charges or an average of 45.3 per kid. That’s not a typo either. Here’s exactly what the Hogansville PD says about it. “As a result of the investigation, all three juveniles have been charged with a total of 84 felony counts related to incidents that occurred within the city limits of Hogansville, along with over 50 charges for crimes throughout Troup County.” Importantly, police in Georgia have the ability to charge these kids with ‘Entering a Vehicle,” which is key since many of the victims report leaving their vehicle unlocked. While we don’t know much about the suspects due to their legal rights as juveniles, we do have some good news to report. Officers say that they’ve already managed to return some of the stolen items to their owners. “I want to thank my excellent team of investigators who have been working tirelessly to try and find those responsible for these crimes and charge them accordingly,” said Sheriff James Woodruff. The investigation remains active, with both the Troup County Sheriff’s Office and the Hogansville Police Department continuing to search for additional victims and evidence.",
