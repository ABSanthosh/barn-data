  "text": "An ES Sport Cross would be a fitting rival to the BMW 5 Series Touring and Mercedes E-Class Estate 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas New Lexus ES reimagined as a wagon with styling cues from the electric RZ crossover. Concept features wraparound glass and retains the wheelbase of the regular sedan. A Sport Cross version of the new-generation ES is unlikely to ever enter production plans. Wagons may be all but extinct in today’s automotive landscape, cast away by buyers’ love of SUVs, but they still stir enthusiasm among certain corners of the car world. One such example is the Lexus IS SportCross, the only wagon in the brand’s 36-year history. The five-door model lasted just a single generation before being discontinued, yet it still holds a place in the hearts of wagon fans. One of them is digital artist Theophilus Chin, who recently imagined what a modern Lexus wagon could look like in the current lineup. Also: Lexus Sedan’s Radical Redesign Could Finally Bring Back The IS Spirit Instead of starting with the aging IS sedan, Theottle chose the larger and more contemporary Lexus ES as the foundation for his design. The familiar sedan form is reworked with a taller, more upright rear, and styling cues borrowed from the all-electric RZ. In this reimagining, the rear glass wraps around seamlessly into the side windows, visually slimming the D-pillars and giving the rear a cleaner profile. The roofline is less sloped than the standard ES, flowing into a pair of aerodynamic fins that replace the more conventional rear spoiler. The lower portion of the tail is carried over from the regular ES, including the slim LED bar, the integrated ducktail spoiler, and the rear bumper. The wheelbase and the rear overhang haven’t changed, meaning that the ES Sport Cross retains the footprint of the sedan. Illustrations: Theottle The new Lexus ES is based on Toyota’s TNGA-K architecture, which is compatible with self-charging hybrid and fully electric powertrain options. The flagship ES 500e trim with AWD capability would be the most fitting for the Sport Cross variant, generating 338 hp (252 kW / 343 PS) from its zero-emission powertrain. Furthermore, the 75 kWh battery would be good for a WLTP range of around 530 km (329 miles). More: Another V8 Sports Car Is Facing The Chopping Block If it ever reached production, the ES SportCross would go up against premium wagons like the BMW i5 Touring and the Mercedes E-Class Estate. But while the idea might appeal to wagon enthusiasts, Lexus appears far more focused on sedans and SUVs these days, making this actually happening quite unlikely. Still, there was a hint of possibility back in late 2021, when Lexus previewed a compact EV concept showcasing a variety of body styles, including a sedan, shooting brake, crossover, and convertible. At the time, many believed these prototypes hinted at the next generation IS, a model that now seems destined to offer more than just battery-electric powertrains when it eventually arrives.
