Beyond the fact that its core demographic wants nothing to do with EVs, Dodge’s problems with the car are likely related to its price and two-door configuration, but the company is set to solve one of those problems with a new sedan configuration for 2026. The Daytona sedan is nearly identical to the two-door model underneath and will only be sold in the Scat Pack configuration, like the coupe. The two-door Scat Pack’s price tag exceeds $70,000 before the myriad of discounts and incentives Dodge offers, so the sedan will likely be a bit more expensive to start. That said, the car’s performance is nothing to sneeze at, even if it lacks the Hellcat V8’s pleasing roar. Its dual-motor powertrain produces 670 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque, and it has a temporary boost feature that delivers another 40 horsepower for up to 10 seconds. That gives it a mid-11-second quarter-mile time, and Dodge says it’s the quickest muscle car in the world. It remains to be seen if the new sedan will help boost sales, on the electric side, but to be safe, Dodge plans to release gas-powered variants later this year, sporting the Hurricane inline-six-cylinder engines.
