  "text": "The project is unfinished but could easily become one of the sexiest pickups on the road May 18, 2025 at 21:11 by Thanos Pappas A UK builder converted a BMW 325i Touring into a unique single-cab pickup. The project includes an M3 bodykit, turbocharged engine, and custom rear bed. The unfinished pickup is priced at £6,995 ($9,300) but needs significant work. If you’ve ever had a thing for pickup conversions, then the BMW E30 3-Series with a custom rear bed probably already has your attention. Currently listed on eBay, this modified ride offers a unique twist on the classic BMW, though it’s not exactly showroom-ready and will require a little TLC to get it across the finish line. For starters, let’s calm your nerves by assuring you that no M3s were harmed in the making of this creation. Instead, this build was based off a BMW 325i Touring, which were available from 1987 through 1994. More: Brave Tuner Converts Brand New BMW M4 Competition Into Maloo Pickup The transformation begins with a significant alteration: the rear roof section is chopped off, and the interior is gutted, turning the wagon into a single-cab-style pickup. If you’ve ever dreamed of taking a perfectly good BMW wagon and making it even more unique, this is what that looks like. To up the cool factor, the builder went all in with E30 M3 parts, borrowing wider front fenders, a beefier front bumper, and a chin spoiler. The M3 theme is further driven home with a subtle rear wing and a fresh set of 17-inch BBS replica alloy wheels. It’s a bit of a Frankenstein job, but somehow it works, blending elements of elegance and aggression in a way only the E30 can pull off. The custom rear section looks noticeably wider than stock, paired with an M3-style rear bumper, genuine taillights, and dual exhaust pipes. The rear glass is sourced from an old VW Caddy, and the cargo area is lined with chequer plate for both durability and a touch of flair. All in all, the E30 ute has plenty of visual appeal, though it’s practically begging for a fresh coat of paint. Inside, the black leather upholstery is starting to show its age, though the seller claims the dashboard is in excellent condition. Don’t expect to sit in a luxury cabin, but with a little elbow grease, it could be brought back to its former glory. More: This Is The World’s Only BMW M3 Panel Van Imposter Under the hood, you’ll find the standard 2.5-liter six-cylinder from the 325i, but with a little extra juice: a Garrett turbocharger and a custom stainless steel exhaust. While there are no performance specs, the turbo should give it a noticeable power bump over the original 168 hp (170 PS). A five-speed manual gearbox sends power to the rear wheels, and while the E30 M3 looks certainly suggest it, a 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine swap would probably make this thing even more of a sleeper. But hey, it’s already got plenty of personality. Located in Hassocks, UK, this E30 pickup conversion is up for sale at a reasonable £6,995 (equal to around $9,300), and it comes with a bundle of spare parts. According to the seller, a serious injury is forcing the sale, so here’s hoping they recover soon and can get back to working on fun projects like this one. Photos: eBay",
