  "description": "This 1993 Jaguar XJ220 is the final of three examples prepared to Group N specification for privateer racing team Top Run to contest the Campionato Italiano Supercar GT championship during the 1993 season. While two of the cars competed through the season, this car, chassis 003, is said to have remained unraced before being sold in 1994. After the car was featured on BaT in December 2017, its aluminum bodywork was vinyl-wrapped live while on display at the 2024 New York International Auto Show in a white and blue livery inspired by the color scheme worn by the XJ220-N chassis that raced during the 1993 Italian GT season. Wearing silver paint beneath the wrap, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include slotted and ventilated Brembo disc brakes, staggered-dimension BBS wheels, OMP racing seats outfitted with six-point racing harnesses, and an AiM digital dash display. This XJ220-N is now offered on dealer consignment in Newbury Park, California, with a bill of sale.",

While two of the cars competed through the season, this car, chassis 003, is said to have remained unraced before being sold in 1994. After the car was featured on BaT in December 2017, its aluminum bodywork was vinyl-wrapped live while on display at the 2024 New York International Auto Show in a white and blue livery inspired by the color scheme worn by the XJ220-N chassis that raced during the 1993 Italian GT season. Wearing silver paint beneath the wrap, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include slotted and ventilated Brembo disc brakes, staggered-dimension BBS wheels, OMP racing seats outfitted with six-point racing harnesses, and an AiM digital dash display. This XJ220-N is now offered on dealer consignment in Newbury Park, California, with a bill of sale. The XJ220 was developed in collaboration with Tom Walkinshaw Racing based on an all-wheel-drive, V12-powered concept that was showcased at the 1988 British International Motor Show. The production version shared the prototype’s bonded aluminum honeycomb chassis but was shortened in wheelbase and overall length and powered by a rally-derived V6. In early 1993, TWR and Jaguar developed two carbon-fiber-bodied racing variants, the race-only XJ220-C and the road-going XJ220-S, in addition to a further three aluminum-bodied race cars with the “N” designation. XJ220-N chassis numbers 001 and 002 competed throughout the 1993 Italian GT series before contesting various Global GT Endurance Series races in 1995. This example is said to have served only as a backup in its early life and retains a Spa Silver finish that was covered with its current vinyl wrap by Phenomenal Vinyl in 2024. The white livery with blue stripes is a re-envisioning of the livery worn by the two XJ220-N chassis that raced during the 1993 Italian GT season and features period sponsors as well as number 13 graphics. Design elements carried over from production XJ220s include a front air dam, a trunk-mounted rear spoiler, underbody venturi tunnels that extend into a rear diffuser, intake scoops aft of the doors, retractable headlight covers, and louvers at the base of the windshield and rear window to stabilize airflow. The XJ220-N variant retained road-going equipment including headlights, turn signals, and windshield wipers. Multipiece BBS wheels are secured by hexagonal nuts and are wrapped in Hoosier tires measuring 275/40ZR17 up front and 345/35ZR18 at the rear. Stopping is handled by Brembo disc brakes with slotted and ventilated rotors, dual master cylinders, and front cooling ducts. The cockpit houses a pair of OMP racing seats that are trimmed in black cloth and equipped with silver Schroth six-point harnesses. Additional features include black XJ220-N floor mats, a carbon-fiber console, black dashboard and door-panel trim, a fire-suppression system, and an integral roll cage. The three-spoke Personal steering wheel sits ahead of an AiM digital dash display, while analog instruments include a clock and gauges monitoring voltage, boost pressure, and transaxle fluid temperature. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and mileage is unknown. The 3.5-liter JV6 V6 was developed by Jaguar and TWR based on the Austin Rover V64V used in the MG Metro 6R4 Group B rally car and was shared by Jaguar’s XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars. Features include twin Garrett turbochargers with corresponding air-to-air intercoolers, an aluminum block and cylinder heads, dual overhead camshafts on each bank, four valves per cylinder, dry-sump lubrication, multipoint fuel injection with dual injectors, and Zytek electronic engine management. The N variant of the XJ220 reportedly utilized larger turbocharger compressor housings than the road-going cars. This example’s engine is said to have received a borescope inspection of its cylinders under previous ownership. A fuel system refresh at that time is said to have included the replacement of the fuel cells, the addition of AN adapter fittings, and a rebuild of the alternator. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle equipped with a limited-slip differential. Suspension incorporates double wishbones and coilover shock absorbers, the latter of which are situated inboard at the rear. A TWR tag riveted inside the driver-side door jamb identifies the car as an XJ220-N with chassis number 003 and lists a build date of September 1993. The factory 17-digit VIN is stamped inside the engine bay. The Carfax report based on the 17-digit VIN lists entries starting in 2009. The car is not titled, and it is being sold for off-road use only on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
