  "text": "Plenty of exposed carbon fiber elements also make this special Mustang stand out January 9, 2025 at 19:50 by Brad Anderson The special edition retains its 815 hp 5.2-liter supercharged V8 from the Mustang GTD lineup. All models feature Performance White paint with Race Red and Lightning Blue accents. Ford has tried to spruce up the interior with newly-trimmed sports seats, but it still looks cheap. The ultimate version of the Ford Mustang has just received a new limited-edition trim. Dubbed the Spirit of America, this beast builds on the Porsche 911-chasing Mustang GTD and celebrates American ingenuity, as well as Craig Breedlove, who was the first person to smash through the 500 mph and 600 mph marks in his land-speed record cars in the 1960s. And if you’re wondering, Ford has not revealed how much the car costs or how many will be built. A unique livery makes the Spirit of America stand out from the already bonkers Ford Mustang GTD. The combination of Performance White with Race Red and Lightning Blue racing stripes match the legendary Mustang tribar and the colors of the overalls worn by Bleedlove. Fun fact: the livery also nods to the colors of Breedlove’s racing overalls. But there’s more as Ford is quick to remind us this car also celebrates a major milestone for the GTD: becoming the first American car to lap the Nürburgring in under seven minutes. Subtle flex, Ford. Read: Ford Mustang GTD Is The Most Powerful Production Pony Car Ever With 815HP All examples come standard with the GTD Performance Package, adding new front dive plans, an extended front splitter, underbody flaps, a drag-reduction system, and 20-inch magnesium wheels. Loads of exposed carbon fiber also make the car catch the eye. These include the front splitter, rear diffuser, and huge rear wing. A red painted ‘Mustang’ has also been added to the underside of the wing. All Spirit of America cars rock Race Red brake calipers as standard and can be configured with either Race Red wing mirror caps or carbon fiber caps. Much has been said about the Mustang GTD’s interior and its similarities to far less expensive versions. Ford has added new leather trim to the seats with Dinamica inserts to make this model stand out and feel a little more unique. These seats also feature Race Red accents, Re-Entry White trim, and Victory Blue contrast stitching, with additional touches of Victory Blue sprinkled around the cabin for a bit more visual drama. Still, despite these upgrades, there’s no escaping the sense that the interior doesn’t stray away from the standard Mustang playbook,. If you want to flex, there’s an optional 3D-printed titanium trim package that includes the shift ring, paddle shifters, and dashboard badge. Fancy? Sure. Necessary? Maybe not. But hey, when you’re already looking at a price tag north of $325,000 (for the base GTD, mind you), you might as well indulge in the details. Same extreme performance Underneath all the patriotic paint and upgraded trim, the Spirit of America is still the same fire-breathing machine. That means it retains the same formidable 5.2-liter supercharged V8 with 815 hp and 664 lb-ft (900 Nm) of torque. Other key standard parts include semi-active suspension and carbon-ceramic brakes. While Ford hasn’t revealed the exact cost of this special edition, it’s safe to assume it’ll eclipse the GTD’s $325,000 base price. Want to see it up close? Head to the Detroit Auto Show and bask in the glory of American muscle at its most extravagant.",
