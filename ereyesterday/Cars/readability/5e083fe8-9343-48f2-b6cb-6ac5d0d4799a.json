  "text": "A bright red interior perfectly matches the Italian icon's Rosso Corsa exterior January 31, 2025 at 19:06 by Brad Anderson Ferrari built only 213 U.S.-spec F40s, and this rare 1992 model is one of 60. The supercar’s 2.9-liter twin-turbo V8 rocks a Tubi style aftermarket exhaust. Its $3.5 million asking price highlights the skyrocketing value of Ferrari F40s. The Ferrari F40 has been in the news for all the wrong reasons over the past few weeks following a pair of high-profile accidents. However, no amount of crashes involving the F40 will ever tarnish its legendary status as one of the most iconic supercars ever made. Over the past few years, prices of used Ferrari F40s have jumped quite a lot, proving just how collectable it has become. Roughly a decade ago, pristine examples could be found for around the $1 million mark, but now, they’re much more expensive. A rare U.S.-spec F40 recently came across our desks and has been listed for sale through Ferrari Lake Forest in Lake Bluff, Illinois. It has an eye-popping price tag of $3,499,900. More: Video Captures Ferrari F40 Crash On UK Roads Ferrari only ever built 213 F40s in US spec, and this is one of just 60 that were built in 1992, the last year of production. Like most others, it’s painted in a classic shade of Rosso Corsa and in 2020, received Classiche Certification from the factory, verifying it as having the original numbers matching engine and transmission. It also retains the original toolkit, service book, owner’s manual, a copy of the window sticker, and various other documents. Ferrari Lake Forest The Perfect F40 The selling dealer says the mid-engined great has undergone a major cam belt service, and the upper and lower control arm bushings were recently replaced. It also has new engine mounts, a new valve cover gasket, ignition wiring, and new fuel injectors. Oh yeah, and it’s also only been driven 9,611 miles (15,467 km) since leaving the factory, meaning it could be the perfect option for any enthusiast owner who actually intends to drive it frequently. Like the exterior, the interior of this F40 is bathed in bright red, including colorful cloth on the seats. It looks to have been beautifully prepped for sale and is no doubt one of the finer F40’s on the market. It’s also rocking a Tubi-style aftermarket exhaust, ensuring the 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that was rated at 477 hp for North America absolutely screams. Ferrari Lake Forest",
