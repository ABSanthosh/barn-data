  "description": "While Tesla is still strategizing its India entry and looking for tariff reliefs, the Model Y facelift which was unveiled in January this year has recently been spotted testing on our roads. The company has already initiated homologation for the Model Y in India, along with the Model 3, which means these are likely be the first models to go on sale here. The sighting of the facelifted car suggests that the Model Y will indeed be offered in its latest iteration. Tesla Model Y gets up to 719km of range (CLTC cycle) Is available in two variants: RWD and Long Range AWD Tesla India first showroom location finalised in Mumbai Tesla Model Y facelift spotted testing Facelifted model improves aero-efficiency and range Although the test mule is well covered in camouflage, a look at the car’s front and rear lighting signatures is enough to suggest that this is facelifted model. The January 2025 update brought a new split headlamp arrangement with new full-width LED light signatures at the front and rear, and it was made more aero-efficient, too. On the inside, the Model Y’s rather minimalistic interior is dominated by a central 15.4-inch touchscreen, and the rear passengers also get an 8.0-inch touchscreen. The Tesla Model Y is available in two variants: RWD and Long-Range AWD. The former has a claimed range of 719km, while the latter returns 662km on a single charge, both as per the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC). Tesla claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.3 seconds for the AWD car, while the single-motor RWD model does it in 5.9 seconds. Tesla’s India entry: what’s the progress? Looking for local partner for manufacturing The company has already secured a Mumbai showroom on a 5-year lease, and is scouting for a location is Delhi as well. Tesla India Motor \u0026 Energy, Tesla's Indian subsidiary, has also begun hiring across customer support, sales and product development roles. While Tesla plans to bring its first models as CBUs (completely built units), the company is exploring contract manufacturing instead of setting up a greenfield plant immediately. When it comes to retail, the company’s approach would remain direct-to-consumer, with fully owned retail operations and a Supercharger network, too. Tesla’s ongoing challenges Entry into India is very crucial for Tesla because the company is struggling in its existing key markets. Demand has stagnated in Europe and interest in the US is lukewarm, too, thanks to Musk’s right-wing politics. Plus, there’s severe competition in China from carmakers like BYD and Xiaomi. It is, therefore, imperative for Tesla to get its India strategy right, and the key to cracking this market will, of course, be the pricing.
