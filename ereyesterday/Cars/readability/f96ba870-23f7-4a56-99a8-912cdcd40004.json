  "description": "BMW has given a mid-life update to the current-generation 2 Series Gran Coupe. The German brand’s smallest sedan is a direct rival to the Mercedes A-Class sedan, which is also sold in India. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe gets 1 Series like design cues Gets refreshed interior with curved infotainment screen Current powertrain options likely to continue for India BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe facelift: what all is new? While BMW has released official details and pictures of the 2-series Grand Coupe facelift in standard wheelbase form, its LWB iteration was leaked in China a few months ago. The updated 2 Series Gran Coupe has a completely different front compared to the outgoing model. The new face now resembles the recently updated 1 Series line-up, and the update brings the four-year-old 2 Series Gran Coupe more in line with BMW's fresh design theme. The refreshed look includes a lowered front with angular cuts, upward-swept headlamps, and a wider, more prominent dual kidney grille. The front bumper has a broad chin with a large air dam split into three parts, with two placed at the extreme corners. With the design revamp, the 2 Series Gran Coupe has been stretched by 20mm to 4,546mm, while its width and height have increased by 15mm each, now measuring 1,800mm and 1,435mm, respectively. According to BMW, these changes were made in part to maximise interior space. The M Sport models will get more blacked-out treatment, while the standard iterations incorporate ample chrome bits. There aren’t many changes on the sides and the doors also look the same as those on the pre-facelift car. At the back, it gets a more angular boot design with new BMW X1-like tail-lamps. The license plate location has been moved from the rear bumper to between the tail-lamps. The interior has also been updated with design changes from the 1 Series, including a curved touchscreen that runs the latest BMW OS9 software, resulting in a reduction in the number of physical buttons.   BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe facelift: powertrain and India launch details The entry-level BMW 220 uses BMW’s 167hp, 1.5-litre, three-cylinder turbo petrol engine, paired with a 48V mild-hybrid setup. The sport-oriented M235 xDrive uses a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, turbo petrol engine that delivers 296hp and does a 0-100kph sprint in 4.9 seconds. Both the 220 and the M235 xDrive come with a seven-speed automatic gearbox. Some markets, such as India, will likely continue with the existing petrol and diesel engine options. We expect BMW to introduce the updated 2-series line-up in India sometime early next year.
