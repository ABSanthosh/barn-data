  "text": "Published:  April 4th, 2025 2025 Mini Cooper S 2 Door Hardtop Fast Facts Powertrain2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (201 horsepower @ 5,000 RPM, 221 lb-ft @ 1,450-4,500 RPM)Transmission/Drive WheelsSeven-speed dual-clutch automatic, front-wheel driveFuel Economy, MPG28 city / 39 highway / 32combined (EPA Rating)Fuel Economy, L/100km8.5 city / 6.1 highway / 7.4 combined (NRCan Rating)Base Price$34,600 (U.S.) / $39,990 (Canada)As-Tested Price$39,495 (U.S.) / $49,358.50 (Canada)Disclaimer: Prices include $995 destination charge in the United States and $3,095 for freight, PDI, and A/C tax in Canada and, because of cross-border equipment differences, can’t be directly compared. Mini has always positioned itself as offering speed and fun for cheap -- even if the sticker price belies that mission.So it goes with the 2025 Mini Cooper S. Minis have maintained the same basic philosophy over the years, when it comes to size, shape, and mission. Keep it small and boxy (even if the edges are rounded) and make sure it's fun to drive. Don't forget the tall greenhouse and retro-themed interior switchgear.This should be a winning formula for those who don't need prodigious rear-seat room or excessive cargo space. A winning formula for the urbanite with a lust for sharp handling and a need for easy parking.And it would be, if price didn't matter. The 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder only puts out 201 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and while the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is fine, I miss the no-longer-available manual.While the manual is gone, the John Cooper Works trim lives. This test unit was no JCW, though it came equipped with the $1,200 JCW Style package. The key feature there is dynamic damper control -- the rest of it is appearance and comfort related (the sport seats are nice).Those power numbers might seem low, but a car this small doesn't need a ton of guts -- you'll get around slowpokes with enough ease that you'll -- well, I promised myself I wouldn't reference either \"The Italian Job\" movie, so I will stop there. Handling is, predictably, a joy, despite steering that's a tad too artificial, even in the sportiest mode. I even got the rear-end to rotate, manageably, on a mildly wet road. No one ever wants their rear end to wiggle uncontrollably, of course.Turn-in is sharp and the Mini just goes exactly where you put it, no fuss, no muss.Ride isn't sacrificed too much on the altar of handling, though it can be stiff at times, and you never forget how short the wheelbase is.The Mini remains a driver's car -- and if you're wondering about the suspension, it's a MacPherson strut setup in front and a multilink out back. Inside the cabin, Mini has gone minimalist (sorry) but retains the retro-themed looks and switchgear. The large, round center screen even has an option that lets you set it up like the gauges from Art Deco-era cars.It's fun to play with these features, though there can be a bit too much menu-diving and you have to choose between factory fun and Apple CarPlay.The rear seat isn't the most accommodating for larger adults, but the real problem is ingress and egress. If you have adult rear-seat passengers often, pay extra for two more doors. One reason Minis don't have minimal price tags (again, sorry) is that they tend to be feature-laden. This was no exception. The starting point was $34,600 and that price included 17-inch wheels, heated steering wheel and front seat, dual USB-C ports, dual-zone climate control, panoramic glass roof, head-up display, navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, satellite radio, Bluetooth, and ambient interior lighting.Options included the Iconic Trim (interior camera, active driving assistant, adaptive cruise control, Harman Kardon audio, $2,700), the Comfort Package Plus (keyless entry, park assist, wireless cell-phone charging, $1,500) and the aforementioned JCW Style Package, which was $1,200 and added a JCW steering wheel, the dynamic damping, sport seats, 18-inch two-tone wheels, and more.With $995 for D and D, the out the door price was $39,495. I want to love the Mini -- it's fun to drive and its diminutive size doesn't force you into too many sacrifices. But the price is hard to swallow, especially when one can get sport sedans that are still compact yet offer more interior and cargo space -- sport sedans that are similar money, if not cheaper, and not far off in available content.Seriously, unless the style or ease of parking matters, why would you not go for a Honda Civic Si or Volkswagen Jetta GLI or Hyundai Elantra N? If you want a hatch, the Volkswagen GTI is right there for you, and a few grand more in outlay would net you a Golf R with all-wheel drive.I suppose Mini manages to get enough buyers despite my kvetching, since the pricing has always been premium. It's just too bad -- the Mini could be a value hot-rod, but instead it's a luxury good.[Images © 2025 Tim Healey/TTAC.com]Become a TTAC insider.
