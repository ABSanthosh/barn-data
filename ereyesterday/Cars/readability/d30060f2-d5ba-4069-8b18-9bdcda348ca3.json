  "text": "Apr 30, 2025 5:00 PM EDTA module mishap puts Miatas on ice The 2025 Mazda MX-5 Miata rollout has hit a serious snag. Mazda confirmed last week that it has temporarily suspended deliveries of its beloved roadster due to a potential issue with a vehicle control module (VCM). While the company hasn't specified exactly which module is affected, some buyers have reported being told it relates to stability control systems. “We are investigating a potential issue with a vehicle control module in certain MX-5s,” a Mazda spokesperson told The Drive. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily suspended deliveries of 2025 MX-5s. The Mazda team is working hard to remedy the holdup as efficiently as possible.” The halt has affected a number of Miatas that arrived in the U.S. weeks ago but are now sitting idle at ports, including the busy Port of Los Angeles. The hold appears to affect only a subset of 2025 models, but without a clear list of VINs or affected trims, both dealers and customers have been left guessing. Buyers left in the dark Perhaps most frustrating for customers is the lack of communication. Reports of delays began surfacing in online forums like Miata.net, where some buyers say their cars haven’t moved since landing at the port three or more weeks ago. Mazda has not issued a detailed statement beyond acknowledging the issue and stressing its commitment to quality control. That hasn’t done much to ease concerns for those who put down deposits on special-edition trims, like the 35th Anniversary model, only to be met with silence and shifting delivery timelines. “Our quality assurance team is performing their due diligence on the matter and assessing the range of vehicles that may be impacted. Delivery timelines vary in general, but the latest intel we have is Summer 2025,” a Mazda spokesperson said. That means some buyers could be waiting until at least late June. Some Miatas are still making it through Despite the delay, not every 2025 Miata is stuck. A quick search on Autotrader shows more than 700 new 2025 model year Miatas listed on dealer lots nationwide, and some buyers have already reported receiving their vehicles, including those with the same trim levels as others on hold. This suggests that the VCM issue doesn’t affect all vehicles or that Mazda has begun addressing the problem in waves. Still, for buyers whose Miatas are sitting at ports, that only adds to the confusion. Mazda says that holding cars at the port allows them to ensure a uniform fix across affected vehicles and reduces the chance of a defect slipping through to a customer. Final thoughts There is one bit of silver lining: since the Miatas are already in the U.S., they won’t be subject to additional import duties regardless of how long the hold lasts. So while the delay may cost buyers time, it won’t cost them more money, at least for now. Until Mazda clears the issue, fans of the iconic roadster will need to sit tight.",

Still, for buyers whose Miatas are sitting at ports, that only adds to the confusion. Mazda says that holding cars at the port allows them to ensure a uniform fix across affected vehicles and reduces the chance of a defect slipping through to a customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"final-thoughts\"\u003eFinal thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp data-wp-block=\"{\u0026#34;dropCap\u0026#34;:false}\" data-wp-block-name=\"core/paragraph\"\u003eThere is one bit of silver lining: since the Miatas are already in the U.S., they won’t be subject to additional import duties regardless of how long the hold lasts. So while the delay may cost buyers time, it won’t cost them more money, at least for now. Until Mazda clears the issue, fans of the iconic roadster will need to sit tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
