  "text": "The system launches next year and will soon be found on millions of vehicles March 28, 2025 at 20:26 by Michael Gauthier Hyundai has introduced their new Pleos Connect infotainment system, which launches next year. It is based on Android Automotive OS and appears to feature an AI-infused digital assistant. The company is also gearing up to launch a Level 2+ semi-autonomous driving system by 2027. Automakers love talking about software-defined vehicles, but most of it makes you want to roll your eyes. However, it’s worth paying attention as the Hyundai Motor Group has introduced their new Pleos software brand as well as their next-generation infotainment system. Starting with the latter, the Pleos Connect infotainment system will be launched in the second quarter of 2026 and will be found on more than 20 million vehicles by 2030. It’s based on Android Automotive OS and features a smartphone-like interface that promises “unique, customizable, and user-friendly features.” More: BMW’s Panoramic iDrive Brings Pillar-To-Pillar Display To Future Models, Eliminates Knob Hyundai didn’t release many pictures, but we can see a large freestanding display that echoes the one found in Tesla vehicles. That isn’t the only similarity as both have a gear and battery display on the top left. The bottom row of ‘buttons’ also cribs from Tesla’s playbook and the whole thing looks like a knockoff. Tesla top, Hyundai bottom While it might be lacking in originality, Hyundai said the system will have Gleo AI, which allows for voice recognition-based intelligent vehicle control. In effect, it sounds like we can expect an AI-infused digital assistant. The company also mentioned a Pleos ID, which is a user profile connected to each driver. Thanks to cloud connectivity, owners will be able to access their profile – and presumably their presets – in any Pleos Connect-based vehicle. This means you could easily load your settings if you have to borrow your partner’s vehicle for the day. Aside from the infotainment system, Hyundai billed Pleos as an end-to-end software platform that integrates high-performance chips and controllers, vehicle operating systems, infotainment systems, cloud infrastructure, fleet management, and mobility and logistics optimization solutions. The company said this combination will allow for a “range of smart mobility functions – such as autonomous driving, vehicle connectivity, real-time data analysis, and optimized route planning – providing a foundation for improving the user experience and maximizing the efficiency of urban mobility operations.” Level 2+ Semi-Autonomous Driving Coming Soon In other news, Hyundai announced their Level 2+ semi-autonomous driving system is coming by the end of 2027. The automaker didn’t go into specifics, but said the system “recognizes vehicle surroundings through cameras and radars and makes more complex decisions based on its artificial intelligence deep learning decision structures.” If it’s like Volkswagen’s upcoming Level 2+ system, we can expect hands-free driving on select roads as well as automatic lane changes. We can also expect other functions such as traffic jam assist.",
