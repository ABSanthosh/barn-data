  "description": "This Chevrolet Corvette is noted to have been an unsold 1954 example that was initially utilized under the direction of Chevrolet engineer and former Indianapolis 500 race winner Mauri Rose as an experimental car for high-output V-8 performance development. Sales of the C1 were not meeting expectations following the model's launch, and seeing the marketing potential of breaking performance records, engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov proposed preparing a specialized example capable of becoming the first American production vehicle to top 150 mph. Chassis EX87 was reassigned from Rose to Duntov for development, including modifications to the bodywork such as a low-cut windscreen, a passenger-side tonneau cover, a head fairing, and a unique belly pan, as well as fitment of a manual transmission along with a bored and stroked 307ci V8 that featured a special high-lift camshaft, now known as the \"Duntov Cam.\" Reclassified as EX87/5951, the car was piloted by Duntov at the GM Desert Proving Grounds in Arizona, where it achieved speeds of around 163 mph during test runs. An updated 1956 Corvette was to be built for the actual high-speed run attempts held at Daytona Beach, and as a result, the car was disassembled and separated into the chassis, EX87, and the body, 5951. The 5951 bodywork was re-mounted elsewhere, while the EX87 chassis was brought to 1955 specification with fitment of a 265ci V8 engine, a two-speed automatic transmission, and replacement bodywork sourced from another test vehicle. That car went on to be used as a demonstrator and was reportedly later sold to a GM engineer before being purchased by the current owner's husband in 1968. Following a subsequent engine failure, a 327ci V8 was installed and the bodywork was repainted red. Having remained under the same ownership in California for 57 years, this C1 Corvette is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with historic correspondence from GM, literature, service records, spare parts, and a clean California title that lists the car as a 1955 Chevrolet.",

Having remained under the same ownership in California for 57 years, this C1 Corvette is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with historic correspondence from GM, literature, service records, spare parts, and a clean California title that lists the car as a 1955 Chevrolet. The car features 1955-specification fiberglass bodywork said to be mounted over chassis EX87, which was originally utilized as a development vehicle. It was refinished in red in the 1970s and is outfitted with a beige convertible top. Exterior details include a curved windshield, wire-mesh headlight guards, a chrome grille, a driver-side rearview mirror, clip-on side curtains with Plexi-glass windows, and dual exhaust outlets exiting through the rear valance. The rear bumper was modified to accommodate a tow hitch, which will accompany the car and is noted to have been used for speed calibration during test runs. Black-finished 15” steel wheels feature polished covers with faux knock-off spinners and are mounted with 6.70″ BFGoodrich Silvertown whitewall tires, while a full-size spare is stored in the trunk compartment. The C1 was equipped from the factory with an independent front suspension, front and rear hydraulic shocks, and a live rear axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel drum brakes. The bucket seats are faired into the rear bodywork and have been reupholstered in beige vinyl with red stitching. Interior appointments include a dash-mounted rear-view mirror, a heater, lap belts, a floor-mounted gear selector, and a push-button AM radio. The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and fronts a 140-mph speedometer. A central 6k-rpm tachometer is flanked by a clock and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 21k miles, and the seller notes that total mileage is unknown. The 1954-specification frame is noted to have been modified to accommodate a small-block V8 engine and a manual transmission during the car’s initial use a test vehicle. It was fitted with its current 327ci V8 in the 1970s, and it is equipped with a single carburetor, a polished air cleaner, and Corvette-branded finned valve covers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission. Correspondence from General Motors’ Engineering Department detail build orders for the speed-record development cars and are shown in the gallery below. A selection of spare parts will accompany the car. A reproduction data plate, shown above, is stamped with EX87, which matches the VIN listed on the current California title.
