  "description": "This 2024 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was purchased new by the seller and was ordered with approximately $86k in options, some of which include a paint-to-sample Carbon Steel Gray Metallic exterior finish in addition to the Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential, the car is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, Satin Indigo Blue-finished lightweight magnesium wheels, a front-axle lift system, heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats, and a Bose sound system. This 992 GT3 RS has 822 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner's manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential, the car is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, Satin Indigo Blue-finished lightweight magnesium wheels, a front-axle lift system, heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats, and a Bose sound system. This 992 GT3 RS has 822 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. The CFRP panels are finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave on Weissach Package-equipped cars. This example is finished in paint-to-sample Carbon Steel Gray Metallic and has LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, Exclusive Design taillights, a rear fog light, GT3 RS decals, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, auto-dimming mirrors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Protective film has been applied to the body and windshield, per the seller. Satin Indigo Blue-finished lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear center-lock wheels are mounted with Goodyear tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with black calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering, a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats are trimmed in black leather and Race-Tex with “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests, Shark Blue seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, ambient lighting, puddle light projectors, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features a centering stripe and drive-mode selector dials, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 822 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. The car is fitted with the optional extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) Plus. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche Woodland Hills in California, along with optional equipment and a total price of $330,910. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall.
