It was ordered with Lime Gold paintwork, black luxury upholstery, and a 428ci Cobra Jet V8 linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a 3.50 Traction-Lok differential. The car is believed to have remained registered on the East Coast since new, and after it was acquired from its previous owner in 2022 the wheels were replaced and the engine was rebuilt by Abacus Racing. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this GT500KR is now offered in North Carolina with a copy of a Deluxe Marti Report, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Virginia title. The GT500KR was added to the Shelby American lineup mid-way through the 1968 model year and shared its styling with the GT500 but was fitted with a higher-powered 428ci Cobra Jet engine. Exterior design elements include an SMC fiberglass hood with a functional ram-air scoop, grille-mounted Lucas lights, a rear spoiler, sequential taillights, and air scoops on the quarter panels. This example is finished in Lime Gold (I), and the selling dealer notes evidence of paintwork on both quarter panels and the rear valance. There are paint bubbles on the inner fenders as well as paint chips, scratches, and wear. The aluminum 10-spoke 15″ wheels and Goodyear Steelgard tires were mounted at some point after 2022. GT500 models utilized an upgraded suspension system with heavy-duty coil springs and an anti-roll bar up front in addition to heavy-duty leaf springs out back. The car also has power steering and power-assisted front discs. The cabin features front bucket seats and a folding Sport Deck rear seat trimmed in black vinyl. A roll bar with inertia-reel seatbelts was standard in Shelby cars, and a Bluetooth-capable retro-look radio has been added. There is wear on interior items. The selling dealer dealer installed the two-spoke woodgrain steering wheel on the tilt-away column in preparation for the sale, and the dashboard pad was also replaced. Instruments consist of a 140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, and a Stewart-Warner ammeter and oil pressure gauge are mounted in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 86k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 428ci V8 was rebuilt by Abacus Racing in 2023. The block was bored, honed, and decked before Speed Pro forged pistons, Edelbrock Performer heads, a Melling oil pump, and ARP hardware was installed. Following the rebuild the engine produced 322.1 horsepower and 422.4 lb-ft of torque on a chassis dynamometer. Records for the work completed are provided in the gallery.
