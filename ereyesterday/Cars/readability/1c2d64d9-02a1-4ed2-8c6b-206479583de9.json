But which small electric car should be buy? We’ve tested each and every one and here is our rundown of the very best. Design8Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs9 Pros Fun to driveImproved rangeGood performance Cons Divisive stylingDistracting infotainmentIncreased weight can be felt The Mini Electric brought all of the fun factor you expect from the brand when it arrived in 2020 – albeit packaged with a few equally typical usability restrictions.Now the Mini EV has entered its second generation and is being sold alongside the Mk4 combustion-engined Mini. It has gained sleek new looks, extra range and the latest digital technology systems from the BMW Group, which owns Mini. Based on a new platform developed in partnership with Chinese giant Great Wall Motors, the Cooper E is powered by a 181bhp electric motor and uses a 40.7kWh battery that offers up to 190 miles of range. The more powerful Cooper SE gets 215bhp and a 54.2kWh battery for up to 250 miles of range. The new Mini is a more grown-up proposition than the previous model, offering a far more usable range, faster charging and more premium lustre. In addition, the price is also very similar to its predecessor. That said, it's heavier than before, which is felt in the corners, and the car has lost some of the driver reward widely expected from a Mini.The interior is chock full of premium materials and it's a lovely place to sit, but the fiddly, unintuitive infotainment may put some drivers off. Despite those minor qualms, Mini's updated electric hatch is up there with the very best in the segment and is better than ever.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior7Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Provides excellent valueOffers good interior spaceGenuinely good fun to drive Cons Driver assistance features need a lot of refiningInterior materials don’t feel like they will stand the test of timeSome interior usability niggles Other picks here not affordable enough? Try this. The MG 4 EV is an important moment in the development of MG Motor as a serious car maker.Since the British brand’s relaunch under the ownership of the Chinese giant SAIC, it has always played the budget end of the market. With the MG 4, it still does, but with a car that is genuinely impressive in its own right.Its rear-drive layout lets it serve up some real handling thrills while its soft but controlled ride means it’s well suited to rough British roads.It has a very competitive range and charging figures too, and all for £26,995 for the SE model or £29,495 for the Long Range SE. There’s an Extended Range and a bonkers-fast 429bhp XPower model, but we wouldn’t bother.You can see some of the cost savings in the low-grade interior materials and slightly haphazard infotainment and driver assistance features, but none of it is egregious enough to seriously detract from how much value for money the MG 4 offers.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs9 Pros Decent daily performanceAffordable priceVery comfortable Cons Other comparable EVs are quickerSmall battery won't suit all driversLifeless steering Could the arrival of the new Citroën ë-C3 represent a watershed moment in the evolution of the electric car?It's certainly got a lot going for it. Priced from just £21,990, the ë-C3 is primed to become one of the cheapest electric cars on sale in the UK. Power comes from a 44kWh battery, which offers a claimed range of 199 miles. It powers a front-mounted 111bhp electric motor that allows the ë-C3 to hit 0-62mph in around 11.0sec and a top speed of 84mph. Although all ë-C3s have a 44kW battery at the moment, a smaller-battery variant may be UK-bound next year and it's priced at €19,990 (£17,250) in mainland Europe. We've only driven the ë-C3 on overseas Tarmac so far, but we were impressed by its equipment levels and its comfort.Downsides? There's no denying a range of 199 miles might not be quite enough for some drivers, and while comfortable, it's not the most dynamic car to drive, with numb steering that wants for driver involvement.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior6Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Welcome range improvements100kW charging speedOne of the UK's cheapest EVs Cons Interior isn't as smart as the Peugeot e-208Not that exciting to drivePoor second-row passenger space Vauxhall's sibling to the Peugeot e-208 doesn't quite have the same style or imaginatively configured interior of its sibling, but because it’s largely the same underneath, it’s still one of the best small electric cars.Early versions were a little behind the Peugeot on range, but an update that added a taller final drive ratio and a standard heat pump lifted the range from 209 to 222 miles – and now a battery capacity hike and a new electric motor have lifted it again, this time to 246 miles. The Corsa Electric's facelift also brought with it a thoroughly revised front end and a new multimedia system. The Corsa might be a little plainer than the Peugeot, but to our eyes, it still looks handsome enough, especially in its latest form.The driving experience combines a genuine 220-mile everyday battery range with keen and competent handling and a comfortable ride, while 100kW DC rapid charging compatibility as standard should be a selling point too.Vauxhall also has purchase incentives such as free home charger installation and access to a special home energy tariff.Vauxhall's large UK dealer network and the brand's desire to offer some decent discounts have helped to make this one of the UK's best-selling EVs, converting people who hadn't previously considered electric motoring. Our testers reckon it's certainly good enough to leave the right kind of impression.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign9Interior6Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Iconic 500 designDecent technologyDrives well at speed Cons Overly high driving positionSo-so real-world rangePoor pedal placement Fiat's model range is now slightly confusing because the old car lives on as the Fiat 500 Hybrid (despite being only a mild hybrid). The one you want, however, is the newer electric 500.It might look familiar, but it's only when you see them side by side that you realise the new electric 500 is completely new.Fiat has done a marvellous job of retaining the modern-day 500's cute retro looks while making it into a car for the modern age.Because it was developed as a purely electric car from the outset, it has a fairly sizeable (for a small car) 42kWh battery and a theoretical WLTP lab test range of 199 miles, although we discovered that translates to more like 140 miles in real-world use.There is a cheaper Fiat 500 Action model with a 24kWh pack, but we don’t think the financial savings are great enough to offset the much shorter range.The electric Fiat drives substantially better than any other 500 as well, with its 117bhp motor making it surprisingly zippy and fun for a city car. Yes, we found the steering to be quite light, but there's plenty of grip and an absence of body roll - and while it's not exactly at home on the motorway, it copes remarkably well.The interior is also a massive improvement over that of previous 500s too. It's still quite plasticky, but it looks great, the seats are comfortable and the infotainment is logical and responsive.There's even a convertible model with a roll-back canvas roof. It's still not great for tall drivers, though, and it goes without saying that you shouldn't plan on carrying adults in the rear very often.Inflation and the death of the Plug-in Car Grant have not been kind to the electric 500's list price, though. At launch, you could buy one for under £20,000, but now the range starts at around £30,000.If you want the longer-range version, you’ll need to fork out even more. That's a fair chunk of change for such a tiny tot, but we’re still quite fond of this tiny, fashionable EV that’s surprisingly good to drive when you escape the city.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design7Interior7Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs10 Pros Easy to drive smoothlyLighter and more compact than other EVsExcellent value for money Cons Very slow, hitting 0-62mph in over 13secDriving position and seat lack adjustabilitySmall battery, short range The Dacia Spring is the UK's cheapest full-size electric car, at £14,995. It also comes close to being the UK's cheapest car overall, with the Dacia Sandero, the Kia Picanto and Fiat Panda the only cars that undercut it. Entry-level models are powered by a puny-sounding 44bhp electric motor, which hits 0-62mph in a - let's say... leisurely... - 19.1sec.The higher-powered 64bhp variant reduces that to 13.7sec. Again, that might not sound all that quick (and it isn't), but it's about as quick as a 1.0-litre Volkswagen Up. Both models are equipped with a 26.8kWh battery, which is good for a claimed 137 miles of range overall, or 186 miles with some careful city driving. Equipment levels are good too, with a 7.0in touchscreen, electric windows, cruise control and rear parking sensors included as standard.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior7Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Up to 265 miles of rangeStarts from £25,490Very well equipped Cons Charging speeds max out at just 88kWWoolly handlingFrustrating control interfaces If you are after value for money, particularly for an EV, the incoming Chinese car manufacturers are a good place to start. The latest company with big plans for Europe is BYD, which is rapidly building a full range of electric cars. Its smallest model, for now, is the Dolphin.It is by no means the best car on this list, but given the entry-level model costs £25,490, rising to £30,990 for the fully loaded long-range version, some of its flaws can be excused.The handling is quite woolly and the leatherette is a bit naff, but the main problem of all BYDs is that the infotainment system is infuriating. Even though the screen is huge, it hides important settings in deep sub-menus and doesn’t integrate with phone mirroring very well.However, you get all the equipment you could possibly wish for, the ride is fairly plush and real-world range of comfortably over 200 miles is not to be sniffed at. The Dolphin is also a tad larger than the other cars on this list, so it offers more interior space as well.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs7 Pros Comfortable rideImproved interiorSpacious throughout Cons Dearer than close rivalsTouch-sensitive buttons still frustrateBigger batter and better tech tied to costlier trims While the ID 3 managed to secure plenty of sales from the off, it was plagued by issues that dented its progress in becoming a true Golf successor. Early cars were afflicted by a poor infotainment touchscreen and a complex model line-up, not to mention the cabin that lacked material richness. In 2023, Volkswagen sought to assuage these faults by treating the ID 3 to a much-needed facelift, with the hatchback gaining a more eye-catching front end, a simpler model line-up and an uplift in material quality inside.The touchscreen was also given a big overhaul, and it’s far easier to use than the one fitted to its predecessor – although the heating controls that sit below it are still touch-sensitive, as are those on the steering wheel. The ID 3 range now includes the 52kWh Pure, 58kWh Pro and 77kWh Pro S, with the last of those promising up to 345 miles of range. Prices range from £30,000 to £46,000, with the most expensive model being the sporty 322bhp GTX. As for the drive, there’s little to dislike. It doesn’t engage you like the technically related Cupra Born, but the steering is agile enough and it's very easy to pilot in town and manoeuvre around car parks. And much like in the Golf, ride quality remains intact, even for a heavy compact car with big wheels.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign6Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs6 Pros Upmarket interiorSmart stylingSharp steering Cons Range is too shortImpractical rear doorsNot as light as it should be Mazda has never been afraid to do things its own way, and the approach it has taken with its first all-electric car is no different. The MX-30 is therefore not quite what you might expect, but it's an appealing proposition all the same. Toy-car looks are wrapped around an unusually small battery pack – just 35.5kWh, giving an official range of 124 miles – because Mazda believes owners simply won't need more (and increasing the size of the battery would mean unnecessary cost and weight).The car is reasonably spacious inside, has an SUV-lite body that is very much on trend, and is trimmed in interesting materials that give the cabin a singularly cosy and likeable atmosphere.It also includes distinctive rear-hinged back doors - a nod to the brand's old rotary-powered RX-8 coupé - but we found them slightly impractical in day-to-day use.Dynamically, the MX-30 also stands out - although only when you're travelling with a bit of pace on an interesting road.With 143bhp and 199lb ft, the electric motor didn’t blow our socks off in a straight line, but the weighting of the MX-30's steering and the supple manner in which the suspension transfers weight while cornering are genuinely reminiscent of the MX-5 sports car. Around town, however, we found it a little plain.Rapid charging at up to 50kW is possible so, if the limited range works for you, there is plenty to like about the unusual Mazda MX-30. And if it doesn't, there's always the rotary-engined, range-extended REV version. See? Mazda likes different - so do we.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior6Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling5Costs6 Pros Good, usable battery rangePleasant, generally inviting interiorPerformance and drivability Cons ExpensiveRide comfortMeagre back-seat space As a traditional combustion-engined supermini, the Peugeot 208 doesn't do an awful lot to stand out from the crowd.However, in an all-electric guise, it makes good use of its genuinely usable range, good performance, practicality, style and perceived quality.This Peugeot's materially rich and distinctive interior distinguishes it just as clearly as the stylish bodywork. Its practicality is on a par with the now-departed Renault Zoe's and better than a Mini Electric's.Both of those aspects are key considerations for cars like this. Certainly, you get an adequate dose of that electric-motor-enabled zip.The car also rides with a suppleness missing from some smaller EVs, which often struggle to contain their body mass on the road, while in its higher-speed body movements, it doesn't feel as heavy as its main rivals.The steering is striking for its directness, although body control deteriorates a little if you drive more enthusiastically. All that said, it's largely the same as the Corsa underneath - but significantly more expensive. A style pick over sense, perhaps. Finance this car with DrivenfiFAQs Are small electric cars reliable? Electric cars are proving to be pretty reliable so far according to reliability data from our sister title, What Car? – indeed in the 2022 survey, most electric-car owners rated their models very highly. Electric cars recorded an average rating of nearly 91%; the original Nissan Leaf topped the EV chart with a mighty 98.9% score. While there are few independents set up to work on EVs right now, meaning maintenance will often have to be carried out at a main dealer, there are far fewer moving parts – so theoretically fewer points of failure. Certainly, What Car?’s data suggests there’s little to fear. Should a family have two electric cars? EVs were often relegated to second-car duties: school run, shopping trips and the like, with a combustion-powered car on hand to take on longer journeys, such as family holidays. It’s likely that it started because the first clutch of models, such as the original Nissan Leaf and Renault Zoe, were small and capable of modest ranges. Anecdotally, there’s an increase in the number of all-electric households owning a small EV for daily duties, and a larger model on hand for those longer trips. There’s certainly little reason not to go all-electric, just bear in mind that most homes will still only have one wallbox charger. What is the smallest electric car? The Citroen Ami is often thought of being the smallest electric car on sale today. And at 2.4m long and 1.4m wide it’s certainly tiny, yet there’s still decent enough space for a driver and a passenger. Technically, the Ami isn’t a car, though, and in the UK is classed as a quadicycle – which means you can't take it on a motorway; although with a 45mph top speed, you wouldn’t want to. The smallest ‘proper’ electric car is the Smart EQ Fortwo. It’s bigger in every dimension than the Ami, but still retains its party piece of being able to park perpendicular to the kerb. Are electric cars good for short trips? If there’s an area where all EVs excel, it’s on short trips. There’s no worries about engines never getting to operating temperature or clogged particulate filters. Most EVs even allow you to set a timer to heat the car up and defrost the windows on winter mornings, removing the need to have a car idling on the driveway while the air-conditioning clears the glass. What is the average price of a small electric car? The cheapest electric car (that isn’t the sub-£8,000 Citroen Ami) is the £22,000 Smart EQ ForTwo which costs a little over £22,000. But typically you can expect to pay between £25,000 and £30,000 for a small electric car – many of those are on our list. It's worth noting that many car manufacturers struggle to make electric cars profitable, so there are relatively few electric city cars on the market, even though such a model would argubly be perfect for crowded streets. Typically, what is classed as a small EV would be referred to as a supermini if it were petrol or diesel powered.

Yes, we found the steering to be quite light, but there\u0026#39;s plenty of grip and an absence of body roll - and while it\u0026#39;s not exactly at home on the motorway, it copes remarkably well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interior is also a massive improvement over that of previous 500s too.

But typically you can expect to pay between £25,000 and £30,000 for a small electric car – many of those are on our list.\nIt\u0026#39;s worth noting that many car manufacturers struggle to make electric cars profitable, so there are relatively few electric city cars on the market, even though such a model would argubly be perfect for crowded streets. Typically, what is classed as a small EV would be referred to as a supermini if it were petrol or diesel powered.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cblock\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin our \u003ca href=\"https://chat.whatsapp.com/IRAK6Rf3pMGHUwVXXnG4Eh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhatsApp community\u003c/a\u003e and be the first to read about the latest news and reviews wowing the car world.
