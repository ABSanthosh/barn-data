Power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle, and the car is finished in Onyx Black with orange stripes and optional decals. Equipment includes a carbon-fiber hood and adjustable rear wing as well as an adaptive suspension, a front-end lift system, center-locking 19″ and 20″ wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, front and rear parking sensors, and a Track Telemetry system. The cabin is appointed with touchscreen infotainment, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, and black Alcantara-lined bucket seats with McLaren Orange six-point racing harnesses. Acquired by the seller in 2022, this 620R is offered with the window sticker, a battery tender, car cover, floor mats, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title in the seller’s name. The 620R features a carbon-fiber MonoCell II chassis and was available as standard in McLaren Orange, Silica White, or—as seen here—Onyx Black with orange stripes and optional decals. The exterior is fitted with carbon-fiber bodywork that provides increased downforce, which includes a vented hood, dive planes, and a manually adjustable rear wing with an integrated brake light. The car also has soft-close dihedral doors, a front splitter, LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a rear diffuser, and dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear valance. Black 19″ and 20″ center-locking wheels wear Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires measuring 225/35 up front and 285/35 out back. The car is equipped with adaptive dampers, launch control, and a front-end lift system. Stopping power is provided by carbon-ceramic brakes with orange-finished calipers over cross-drilled rotors. The carbon-fiber bucket seats are lined in black Alcantara that extends throughout the cabin. McLaren Orange six-point racing harnesses are affixed to the rear harness bar, and further details include red door nets and pull straps, carbon-fiber trim, a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, and a Track Telemetry System with lap-time recording and three cameras. A plaque affixed below the 7″ infotainment touchscreen denotes this 620R as #151 of 350 planned production units. An Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features carbon-fiber paddle shifters and frames a configurable digital display with a central tachometer and readouts for oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The odometer indicates 4,600 miles, approximately 400 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted and twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter M838TE V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft and direct-port fuel injection. Factory-rated output was 612 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed Seamless Shift Gearbox with twin multi-plate clutches. An annual service was performed in June 2024, according to the seller. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery. The window sticker notes initial delivery to McLaren Newport Beach in Newport Beach, California, and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total MSRP of $296,775.
