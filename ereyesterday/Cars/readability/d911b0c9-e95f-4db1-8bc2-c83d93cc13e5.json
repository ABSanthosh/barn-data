  "text": "A Utah man faces multiple felony charges after using a fake ID and bogus check to buy a Porsche linked to other fraud cases July 6, 2025 at 21:11 by Brad Anderson Man reportedly impersonated a California attorney to buy a $218,000 Porsche in Utah. Police say that presented a fraudulent $100,000 cashier’s check that later bounced. Charges include theft by deception, communications fraud, identity fraud, and forgery. There are no shortcuts to walking into a Porsche dealership and leave with the keys to a new car; you simply have to pay up. Or at least how things are supposed to work, but as with every rule, there’s always at least one exception. Cue a 55-year-old man in Salt Lake City, Utah, who managed to find a way and purchased a six-figure Porsche while claiming to be someone else. Now, he is facing a slew of charges and is being actively pursued by police. In August 2023, it’s alleged that Robert Wesley McCorkle bought an unspecified Porsche model worth $218,000 from a Salt Lake City dealership. At the time, he claimed to have been an attorney from California who had just flown in to purchase the car. Watch: Four Teens Aged 15-16 Allegedly Stole Porsche, Maserati SUVs In Wild Chase Charges filed against the man allege that he presented fraudulent identification with the photo and personal information of the Californian attorney he was impersonating. He is also claimed to have forged the attorney’s signature on a purchase contract and presented a fraudulent cashier’s check for $100,000. McCorkle then left the dealership with the car, committing to finance the remaining balance. Not His First Rodeo? Of course, the fake check didn’t clear. As investigators looked into the case, Salt Lake City police discovered that McCorkle is also a suspect “in two similar incidents” in Nevada, suggesting this may not have been his first attempt. Charged Earlier this week, he was charged in 3rd District Court with theft by deception, communications fraud, and identity fraud, all of which are second-degree felonies. He was also hit with forgery, which is a third-degree felony, KSL reports. Police are now seeking an arrest warrant for him. This isn’t the only recent case we’ve heard about someone walking away with the keys to a Porsche by using a fake check. In early June, police in Georgia reported that a 19-year-old had deposited five counterfeit checks totaling $545,770.97 into his Synovus Bank account before using some of the money to purchase a Porsche. So, there are ways to get your dream car even if you can’t afford it – but we would advise you to steer clear of them if you don’t want to spend time behind bars.",
