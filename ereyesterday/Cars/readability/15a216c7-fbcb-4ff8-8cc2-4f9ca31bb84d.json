That’s 1.3 percent lower than the issue price of Rs 1,960. Hyundai diluted a 17.5 percent stake in its wholly-owned India unit It was the first IPO by a carmaker in India in over two decades The company raised around Rs 27,870 crore through the issue The share sale, which was open from October 15 to October 17, saw tepid investor interest in the first two days, but strong demand from qualified institutional buyers on the final day ensured its successful completion; it was subscribed 2.37 times. The IPO by India’s second-largest carmaker surpassed Life Insurance Corporation’s Rs 21,000-crore offering two years ago. It was also the first IPO by a carmaker in India in the two decades since Maruti Suzuki’s listing in 2003. “Today’s listing shows that HMIL is a key part of India. It demonstrates our commitment to this great nation and ensures that our shareholders and HMIL will continue to grow together,” said Hyundai Motor Group executive chair Euisun Chung while speaking at the listing ceremony. HMIL’s IPO was a pure offer for sale. None of the proceeds of the issue will come to the Indian unit. The South Korean parent company, Hyundai Motor Company, diluted a 17.5 percent stake in its wholly-owned India unit. The automaker raised Rs 8,315.28 crore from 225 anchor investors last week. It finalised the allocation of 4.2 crore equity shares to anchor investors for Rs 1,960 per share.
