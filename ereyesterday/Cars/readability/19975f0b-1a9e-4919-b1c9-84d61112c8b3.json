I mean, from management's perspective, I get it. These new technologies probably could save money, and some drivers do perform poorly and could get busted for, say, grabbing a beer instead of delivering the product.On the other hand, as a former delivery driver, I'd have not liked it much if my boss got alerts even for the most minor violations of the speed limit or limited my top speed. I'd have been annoyed if my vehicle ratted me out for swinging through a drive-thru to get a soda. Not all of these abilities were in Matt's piece, I am just thinking out loud.One thing that WAS in Matt's piece was an acceleration limiter. Imagine trying to limit how fast already-lumbering fleet vehicles can accelerate in Chicago traffic. It's almost as if the bosses want their drivers to be receiving the middle finger. Or worse.Oh, if you're wondering -- no, I never stop for a beer. A Wendy's Frosty, however -- that's a different story. So, I ask of you -- is this a legit way that bosses can make sure employees are being productive and the company isn't overspending, or is it too creepy and invasive?Sound off below.[Image: Ford]Become a TTAC insider.

More by Tim Healey Published March 6th, 2025 5:33 PM Comments Join the conversation Creepy? Yes. Invasive? Yes. But it's within the business' rights. Those vehicles are their property and they have every right to be able to track how they're being used.An illustration is in order.Let's say you own Joe's Auto Parts. The company owns a delivery truck, and unbeknownst to you, your driver likes to re-enact the opening scene from \"Baby Driver\" in it from time to time. And then one fine day, while he has your truck cranked up to a buck-twenty, he t-bones a van of senior citizens, and both vehicles and everyone in them go up in flames. First off, is this a tragedy? I sure hope you think so. Second, does the image of your truck, emblazoned with your company name on it and crumpled into a flaming heap along with a nursing-home van, make the 10 pm news? Bank on it...and bank on your customers knowing all about it. And, third, you can also bank on the lawyers for the driver and the old folks' families suing your company into oblivion, and then coming after you for whatever they can. After all is said and done, you're gonna be lucky if you're not living in a cardboard box.Now, would you like to have had a tool that alerted you to the driver's hooning habit before he made himself, your company property and a van full of old folks into a Burning Man exhibit? If you honestly answer that question \"no\"...well, sorry, at the risk of being indelicate, you're a fool. If you answer \"yes,\" then you know why companies are doing this creepy, invasive stuff. No problem as far as I’m concerned. It’s not some minimum wage driver paying the insurance premium or repairs on a Napa hooptie.",
