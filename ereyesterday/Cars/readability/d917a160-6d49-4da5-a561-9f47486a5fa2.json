  "description": "Dodge is now offering heavy discounts on the all-electric Charger Daytona. Dealer bulletins have indicated that the brand is discounting the model by $6,500. This is despite the Daytona being the brand’s new halo vehicle and comes after we’ve seen numerous dealer markdowns to address a lack of demand and Stellantis offering employee discounts to the public.",

  "text": "Unfortunately, this isn't a case of a well-trained fit athlete suddenly getting fat and slow and uncompetitive. For 15 years management has painted Dodge into a corner as \"The Charger/Challenger company\" and any efforts made to the contrary have been token gestures. There was no plan B other than to stick the landing on the new Charger, and we're finding out what happened if it didn't. Personally, I like the car, but not at the prices mentioned and it may not be bigger than my wife's ES but looks it, and I don't need a ride that humongous.(and I can't help but laugh a little when Dodge reached into the bag of heritage names and pulled out one from AMC not especially fondly remembered - though I have been around long enough to know that ride and the original Maverick weren't great shakes even at the time. C'mon GM - Citation, Vega, Chevette all beckon)BUT - at the same time management also cynically painted Chrysler into a corner as \"The 300 and Pacifica company\" - and there's even less of a succession plan there. There has been whispers and rumors and cancellations but nothing concrete about what's next from them - if there is anything coming.BUT - at the same time management (and previous management) decided that they could put a 7-slot grille on absolutely anything (Renegade, Patriot, Compass) and it would be accepted as a Jeep and at the same time deciding Jeep was an aspirational luxury brand and should be priced accordingly. It's like the success of Hellcat-anything for Dodge went to their heads.And looking further, what exactly has Stellantis got right? We know Ram sales are down, but elsewhere Alfa's way down, Maserati's got problems, Fiat is barely alive. What doesn't ring solid to me are all the comments about how Dodge simply can't survive unless they bring back products with a V8. Somebody tell that to Honda. Even then, to pre-LX platform Chrysler corporation where there hadn't been V8 cars since the 5th Avenue and it was going decently enough. If the products are good enough and priced competitively that won't matter- but if you've based 15 years of marketing of ever-bigger, ever-rowdier and ever more pricey V8s to a slim segment of the buying public, don't be too shocked when ...",
