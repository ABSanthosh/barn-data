  "text": "A special Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is headed to Pikes Peak later this month June 12, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Hyundai and Evasive Motorsports will tackle Pikes Peak with a one-off Ioniq 5 N. It features a multitude of carbon fiber components and a 500 lb weight reduction. The EV will be driven by Rob Walker, who previously competed with a Scion FR-S. The countdown to the 103rd running of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb continues as Hyundai and Evasive Motorsports have unveiled a hardcore Ioniq 5 N. It’s slated to race up the 12.42 mile (20 km) long course on June 22 with Rob Walker behind the wheel. Billed as Evasive Motorsports’ “most ambitious EV project to date,” the specially prepared Ioniq 5 N Pikes Peak has undergone a radical transformation and lost 500 lbs (227 kg) in the process. That’s a significant reduction and it was made possible by stripping the interior and creating a new set of doors out of carbon fiber. They’re joined by a carbon fiber tailgate and a number of one-off components. More: Acura’s Tackling Pikes Peak With A Hardcore Integra Type S Evasive said one of the biggest hurdles was sourcing competition parts, since very few exist for the Ioniq 5 N. However, Japan’s Voltex stepped up and created an aerodynamic body kit that includes a carbon fiber splitter, bulging fender flares, and new side skirts. They’re joined by carbon fiber underbody paneling and a massive rear wing. Aerodynamics aside, the car has been outfitted with Krontec air jacks and 19-inch Titan racing wheels wrapped in Yokohama racing slicks. They’re joined by a six-point roll cage and a Moton coilover suspension with prototype anti-roll bars from EVS Tuning. Rounding out the highlights are CSG Spec brake pads and a Sparco carbon fiber seat. Since the electric motors can’t be tuned, the car features a familiar dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing up to 641 hp (478 kW / 650 PS) and 568 lb-ft (769 Nm) of torque. This enables the road-going model to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 3.25 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 162 mph (261 km/h). Evasive Motorsports co-president Mike Chang said they’re aiming to “break the elusive 10-minute barrier” this year. He added, “We’ve come close in the past and feel it’s far more achievable with the Ioniq 5 N.”",
