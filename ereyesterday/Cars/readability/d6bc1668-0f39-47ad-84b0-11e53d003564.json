  "description": "Having revealed the introductory starting price of the Harrier EV earlier this month, Tata Motors has now announced the full price list of the RWD variants. The Harrier EV RWD price ranges between Rs 21.49 lakh and Rs 27.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India). Not only does the Harrier EV sit at the pinnacle of Tata’s all-electric line-up, but it’s also the carmaker’s first model with an all-wheel-drive layout since the Safari Storme was discontinued over five years ago. Bookings for the Harrier EV are slated to open on July 2, 2025. Tata Harrier EV launched in India at Rs 21.49 lakh (introductory) Electric SUV sports minor design tweaks over current Harrier  Gets 65kWh and 75kWh battery pack options; maximum output is 313hp and 504Nm Here's a look at the full price list of the Harrier EV RWD: Tata Harrier EV RWD priceAdventure 65 Rs 21.49 lakh Adventure S 65 Rs 21.99 lakh Fearless+ 65Rs 23.99 lakh Fearless+ 75Rs 24.99 lakh Empowered 75Rs 27.49 lakh Do note, an AC fast charger and its installation cost will be levied additionally; price of top-spec Empowered AWD variant is still yet to be announced.  Tata Harrier EV exterior design Mostly identical to ICE-powered Harrier On the outside, the Harrier EV’s styling largely echoes the facelifted Harrier that’s been on sale here since 2023. However, Tata has brought it in line with other EVs in its line-up. Up front, the Harrier EV gets a new closed-off grille, underneath which sits a revised bumper with a line-based design. Over to the side, the Harrier EV comes with a set of new 19-inch, aero-optimised alloy wheels and ‘EV’ badging on the front doors. The only change at the rear is the ‘Harrier.EV’ lettering on the tailgate. The Harrier EV is 2mm longer and 22mm taller than the standard Harrier, though their wheelbases are the same – 2,741mm. All-black Stealth Edition on offer Four colour options will be available with the Harrier EV at launch: Empowered Oxide, Nainital Nocturne, Pristine White, and Pure Grey. Alongside these, Tata will also sell a Stealth Edition of the Harrier EV, which features blacked-out design elements inside and out – in line with the carmaker's Dark Edition models. Tata Harrier EV interior and features Infotainment screen is a Samsung QLED panel Much like the outside, the Harrier EV’s cabin doesn’t stray far from its ICE-powered counterpart. However, the 14.53-inch infotainment screen that sits atop the dual-tone dashboard is a world-first Samsung Neo QLED display, which should make for crisper image quality. There's a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and a four-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Tata logo. Boot space stands at 502 litres (999 litres with second row folded down), and a frunk is available too. Harrier EV feature list is loaded The centre console has a touch-based HVAC control panel, and moving further down reveals a rotary selector for the six terrain modes - Normal, Snow/Grass, Mud-Ruts, Sand, Rock Crawl, Custom - and electronic parking brake. Other notable features on the Harrier EV include a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, ventilated and powered front seats, powered Boss mode for the second row, 10-speaker JBL sound system with Dolby Atmos 5.1, powered tailgate, vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) functionality, four drive modes (Eco, City, Sport, and Boost), all-digital inside rearview mirror, auto park assist, and more. With the Harrier EV, Tata has also debuted a new electrical architecture termed TiDAL (Tata Intelligent Digital Architecture Layer) that powers the SUV's connected car features, such as over-the-air (OTA) updates, voice commands, etc. Additionally, the Harrier EV gets a 540-degree surround camera view that alerts the driver if any of the wheels comes too close to a kerb, and there's a new DrivePay feature that eliminates the need for a mobile device for FASTag and EV charging point payments. Coming to safety, the Harrier EV comes equipped with six airbags as standard (seven in higher trims), a 360-degree camera, built-in dashcam, blind spot monitor, electronic stability control (ESC), and more. Level 2 ADAS is also part of the Harrier EV's safety suite, and Tata claims that it has been fine-tuned for Indian road conditions. Moreover, the system can provide a live feed stitched from all the cameras around the Harrier EV, which can be quite helpful while off-roading and is a segment-first addition. Tata Harrier EV battery and range Generates up to 504Nm of torque The Harrier EV leverages an enhanced iteration of Tata’s Acti.ev platform, which debuted last year with the Punch EV and is also utilised by the Curvv EV. Entry-level trims of the Harrier EV come equipped with a 65kWh LFP battery pack that powers a single motor on the rear axle that sends 238hp to the rear wheels. In higher trim levels, the Harrier EV gets a 75kWh LFP battery and dual motors – one for each axle – that develop a combined 313hp and a whopping 504Nm. This variant can sprint from 0-100kph in just 6.3 seconds with the Boost mode enabled. 75kWh Harrier EV delivers up to 627km range As far as range goes, the Harrier EV's RWD 75kWh and AWD 75kWh variants can travel up to an MIDC-certified 627km and 622km on a single charge. When subjected to Tata’s internal testing cycle – dubbed C75 – the RWD 75kWh version returned a real-world range of 480-505km, easily surpassing other EVs from the carmaker. When it comes to charging, a 7.2kW AC charger can replenish the Harrier EV from 10-100 percent in 10.7 hours, while a 120kW DC fast charger will juice up the SUV’s battery from 20-80 percent in 25 minutes. Notably, the Harrier EV incorporates a new 'Ultra Glide' multi-link suspension setup at the rear with frequency-dependent dampers for better off-road drivability. To that end, Tata has included an 'Off-road Assist' function - essentially a low-speed cruise control that can be set as low as 5kph -  and a 'Transparent' mode that projects an image of what's underneath the Harrier EV on the infotainment screen. There's a four-level regenerative braking system on offer with the Harrier EV too, as well as a summon mode that can extract the SUV from tight spaces autonomously. For more spirited drivers, Tata offers a Drift mode in the Harrier EV, which likely dials down the traction control. Tata Harrier EV price, variants and rivals Lifetime battery warranty Tata will sell the Harrier EV in three trims: Adventure, Fearless+, and Empowered. The 65kWh battery has been available on the Adventure and Fearless+ trims, while the larger 75kWh battery comes on the Fearless+ and Empowered trims; AWD is likely to be reserved for the top Empowered trim only. Tata has also confirmed that all Harrier EV buyers will get a lifetime warranty for the battery. Higher starting price than BE 6, but undercuts XEV 9e and Atto 3 At this price point, the Harrier EV lands squarely against the Mahindra’s latest EV duo – the XEV 9e and BE 6 – and the BYD Atto 3.

Moreover, the system can provide a live feed stitched from all the cameras around the Harrier EV, which can be quite helpful while off-roading and is a segment-first addition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTata Harrier EV battery and range\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGenerates up to 504Nm of torque\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/News/Harrier.ev – QWD Dual Motor.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Harrier EV leverages an enhanced iteration of Tata’s Acti.ev platform, which debuted last year with the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/tata/punch-ev\"\u003ePunch EV\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and is also utilised by the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/tata/curvv-ev\"\u003eCurvv EV\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Entry-level trims of the Harrier EV come equipped with a 65kWh LFP battery pack that powers a single motor on the rear axle that sends 238hp to the rear wheels. In higher trim levels, the Harrier EV gets a 75kWh LFP battery and dual motors – one for each axle – that develop a combined 313hp and a whopping 504Nm. This variant can sprint from 0-100kph in just 6.3 seconds with the Boost mode enabled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e75kWh Harrier EV delivers up to 627km range\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs far as range goes, the Harrier EV\u0026#39;s RWD 75kWh and AWD 75kWh variants can travel up to an MIDC-certified 627km and 622km on a single charge. When subjected to Tata’s internal testing cycle – dubbed C75 – the RWD 75kWh version returned a real-world range of 480-505km, easily surpassing other EVs from the carmaker. When it comes to charging, a 7.2kW AC charger can replenish the Harrier EV from 10-100 percent in 10.7 hours, while a 120kW DC fast charger will juice up the SUV’s battery from 20-80 percent in 25 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotably, the Harrier EV incorporates a new \u0026#39;Ultra Glide\u0026#39; multi-link suspension setup at the rear with frequency-dependent dampers for better off-road drivability. To that end, Tata has included an \u0026#39;Off-road Assist\u0026#39; function - essentially a low-speed cruise control that can be set as low as 5kph -  and a \u0026#39;Transparent\u0026#39; mode that projects an image of what\u0026#39;s underneath the Harrier EV on the infotainment screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s a four-level regenerative braking system on offer with the Harrier EV too, as well as a summon mode that can extract the SUV from tight spaces autonomously. For more spirited drivers, Tata offers a Drift mode in the Harrier EV, which likely dials down the traction control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTata Harrier EV price, variants and rivals\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLifetime battery warranty\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/News/20250603035929_17.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTata will sell the Harrier EV in three trims: Adventure, Fearless+, and Empowered.
