  "text": "The new Q5 e-hybrids sport a bigger battery pack and an impressive electric-only range June 11, 2025 at 20:35 by Michael Gauthier Audi has introduced plug-in hybrid versions of the new Q5 and Q5 Sportback. They feature a 2.0-liter TSFI engine, an electric motor, and a 25.9 kWh battery pack. There are outputs of 295 hp and 362 hp as well as electric-only ranges of up to 62 miles. Audi unveiled the redesigned Q5 last fall and now the company has introduced new plug-in hybrid variants in Europe. Available in two outputs, the eco-friendly powertrain will be offered on both the crossover and crossover coupe. The entry-level plug-in hybrid features a 2.0-liter TFSI four-cylinder engine, a 25.9 kWh battery pack, and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with an integrated electric motor. This setup enables the model to produce a combined output of 295 hp (220 kW / 299 PS) and 332 lb-ft (450 Nm) of torque. When drivers floor it, they can accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 6.2 seconds before hitting a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). More: 2025 Audi Q5 Comes Stateside And Starts At $52,200 Customers can also opt for a performance variant that produces 362 hp (270 kW / 367 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque. Thanks to the extra oomph, the dash to 62 mph (100 km/h) drops to 5.1 seconds but the top speed remains unchanged. Delving a little deeper, Audi noted the battery is roughly 45% larger than its predecessor. This helps the plug-in hybrids to travel 51-62 miles (82–100 km) on electricity alone. When it comes time to charge, owners will be thankful for the improved AC charging rate of 11 kW. That’s up from 7.4 kW and it means the battery can be fully recharged in around 2.5 hours, which is faster than many smartphones. In terms of equipment, the models have an S line interior with black leather sport seats and a tri-zone climate control system. They’re joined by an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch infotainment system. Other highlights include an S sports suspension, red brake calipers, and 19-inch lightweight alloy wheels. The plug-in hybrids are built in Mexico and will be available to order in Europe later this month. German pricing starts at €63,400 for the Q5 e-hybrid quattro, while the Q5 Sportback e-hybrid quattro begins at €65,900. The performance variants cost €71,800 and €74,300.",
