  "description": "Sixth-generation executive saloon and estate ramp up the luxury and tech The new car market is changing faster than ever, but that doesn't mean some things can't say the same - and the Mercedes E-Class is a case in point. Despite years of progress, the big German's underlying receipe of quality, comfort, space and refinement remains largely untouched. This then is new ‘W214’ E-Class, which is the latest iteration of one of the oldest model lines from one of the oldest car manufacturers. By Mercedes-Benz’s own count, it is the 10th generation of a largely unbroken lineage going back to 1947.Despite being very keen to refer to its heritage (and why wouldn’t it be?), Mercedes isn’t a particularly nostalgic company. It has come up with radical designs, such as the original A-Class and Smart City Coupé, while its electric cars are really exploiting the aerodynamics and design possibilities that an EV offers. Unlike with the BMW i5 and 5 Series, Mercedes is choosing to keep the electric Mercedes EQE and combustion-engined E-Class apart. According to the literature, the new E-Class needs to balance tradition with modernity and ‘build a bridge’ between traditional exec saloons and the tech-filled EVs of the future. Plenty of buyers are not ready for their car to be a smartphone on wheels, so that mission could well strike a chord. To find out whether the E-Class might succeed, we've road tested an E220d saloon, though we've also driven the E300e and both the E220d and E450d EstatesThe range at a glanceModelsPowerE200201bhpE220d194bhpE300e308bhpE300de308bhpE450d 4Matic362bhpMercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid 4Matic+577bhpThe E-Class offers a very wide range of powertrains, including a four-cylinder petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid, a six-cylinder diesel with four-wheel drive and uniquely for Mercedes, a diesel plug-in hybrid. Topping the range for the time being is the E53 AMG, with a plug-in hybrid six-cylinder. In other regions, there's an E450 petrol as well, but that is not offered in the UK for the time being - and is unlikely to make an appearance over here anytime soon.Apart from the top-rung Exclusive Edition, all trim levels are all AMG Line of some sort, with Advanced, Premium and Premium Plus packs tacked on for the more expensive versions.",

  "text": "Anyone hoping Merc’s ‘bridging model’ strategy means the E-Class’s interior stays traditional will be disappointed: our Superscreen-equipped test car is wall-to-wall display, but the MBUX system is, at least, one of the best for usability.Most of the interface is the same as in other recent Mercedes, so almost everything is controlled via a big screen, with a row of physical shortcut buttons giving access to driving modes and vehicle settings. The advanced voice control can activate lesser-used functions that might otherwise require a trawl through menus, or you can just say “Hey Mercedes, set mood lighting to yellow” in one go, rather than waiting for it to acknowledge you.Where the user experience has taken a baffling backwards step is with the climate controls. In other Mercedes, the temperature and fan controls are permanently on screen, but here you must open a menu first. The layout doesn’t save space on screen (not that it needs to) and is more difficult to use.We have criticised some recent Mercedes models for their interior quality, but this E-Class seems to halt, if not completely reverse, the trend. Most things feel solidly built and the materials are pleasing.For an ICE-powered saloon, it is decently practical, too. Having the gear selector on the steering column leaves the tall centre console free for storage, and the carpeted door bins are pretty big.In a world of EVs, the rear leg room in a longitudinally engined exec saloon can disappoint. Nevertheless, there is slightly more here than in the new 5 Series, and head room is plentiful even for tall adults. The boot is 20 litres bigger than that of the BMW 520i. If you choose one of the plug-in hybrid E-Class versions, you're in for a shock, though, since the battery eats up 170 litres of space. The floor remains flat, but you lose a lot of height.We would opt for the estate in any case. It gets 50mm more head room in the rear seats, and lots of room for the dog. The rear seats fold nicely flat with electronic release but tons in the boot, and the luggage cover automatically lifts up when you open the tailgate. Plug-in hybrid versions suffer from the same problem as the saloon, but it won't be as noticeable. The load luggers aren't quite as cavernous as Mercedes wagons of yesteryear (in fact, they're not as commodious as Skoda's Octavia or Superb Estates), but there's 615-litres of space to play with, which stretches to 1830-litres with the rear bench lowered.Multimedia systemMercedes’ MBUX interface has been with us for a few years now. It has always distinguished itself with its ‘zero-layer’ concept, which puts navigation, media controls and frequently used functions on the home screen permanently so none of them requires any menu-diving to operate.We have remarked in the ‘Interior’ section (see opposite) that the climate controls have sadly gone rogue and retreated into a menu, but apart from that, the rest works mostly as before.The navigation is clear and easy to program, and while the ‘augmented reality’ function isn’t especially helpful, it is at least easily turned off. Phone mirroring is integrated well and can be used wirelessly or wired.Increasingly, functions are tied to having a Mercedes Me account. Our test car had not been properly configured so we didn’t experience the full functionality of the navigation’s traffic information or voice control. This won’t be an issue for most owners, but it still seems an unnecessary complication that these functions won’t work properly on the ‘guest’ profile.",
