  "description": "This 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R is one of 4,194 Series 1 V-Spec examples produced, and one of 227 Series 1 examples delivered from the factory in Athlete Silver. Imported to the US from Japan by the selling dealer in October 2024, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six mated to a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system with an active rear limited-slip differential. It is equipped with Super HICAS rear-wheel steering, Brembo disc brakes, a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, gray cloth upholstery, and automatic climate control. The car was modified with the NISMO Sports Resetting package in 2004, which included remapping the ECU and installing replacement spark plugs, up-pipes, and catalytic converters. Additional modifications include a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment system along with a NISMO NE-1 exhaust system, intercooler, oil separator, radiator cap, and gauge cluster. This R34 GT-R V-Spec is now offered in San Francisco, California, with factory books, a removed gauge cluster, Japanese service records, NISMO documentation, a CarVX report, and a clean Virginia title.",

Imported to the US from Japan by the selling dealer in October 2024, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six mated to a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system with an active rear limited-slip differential.

The car was modified with the NISMO Sports Resetting package in 2004, which included remapping the ECU and installing replacement spark plugs, up-pipes, and catalytic converters. Additional modifications include a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment system along with a NISMO NE-1 exhaust system, intercooler, oil separator, radiator cap, and gauge cluster. This R34 GT-R V-Spec is now offered in San Francisco, California, with factory books, a removed gauge cluster, Japanese service records, NISMO documentation, a CarVX report, and a clean Virginia title. This R34 is finished in Athlete Silver (KV2) and features a front spoiler, xenon headlights, an aluminum hood, amber side marker lamps, a rear window wiper, a rear wing, and a carbon-fiber rear diffuser. The selling dealer notes paintwork on the left door and quarter panel, and areas of touch-up paint on the front lip and rear bumper can be seen in the gallery. Factory 18″ six-spoke wheels are mounted with 245/40 Bridgestone Potenza RE-11 tires showing 2014 date codes. An electronically actuated Super HICAS rear-wheel-steering system was standard equipment, and stopping power is provided by gold-painted Brembo calipers over discs at all four corners. The right-hand-drive cabin features manually adjustable sport seats and a rear bench trimmed in textured gray cloth with microsuede inserts and red contrast stitching, along with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Equipment includes a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment system, automatic climate control, power windows, and GT-R-branded checkered floor mats. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a replacement NISMO GT-R-branded gauge cluster, including a tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline and an inset oil pressure gauge, a 320-km/h speedometer, and gauges to monitor coolant temperature and fuel level. A digital screen in the center of the dashboard provides additional information including boost pressure, throttle input, injector workload, and temperature readings. The replacement digital odometer shows over 23k kilometers (~15k miles), and the cluster was installed by Nissan Prince Tochigi in Japan at approximately 34k kilometers. The removed cluster is included in the sale and can be seen in the gallery along with an invoice from the service. The twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six is equipped with individual throttle bodies, dual overhead camshafts, 24 valves, and red-finished timing- and valve covers. An adjustable strut-tower brace spans the engine bay, and a NISMO intercooler, oil separator, radiator cap, and air filter were installed under previous ownership. The car received the NISMO Sports Resetting package in 2004, which reportedly included a remapping of the ECU as well as the installation of replacement spark plugs. A fluid service was performed by the selling dealer in preparation for the sale, and an Optima Yellow Top battery was also installed. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA E-TS Pro four-wheel-drive system with an active rear limited-slip differential. A NISMO NE-1 stainless steel exhaust system has been fitted, and replacement catalytic converters and up-pipes were reportedly installed as part of the NISMO Sports Resetting package in 2004.
