  "description": "Confirming its participation at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January 2025, Mercedes-Benz announced it will be showcasing five of its models and a concept car. The new lineup ranges from the electric G-Class to the Maybach EQS Night Series. Mercedes will also put on display already-on-sale AMG cars like the SL 55 and S 63 E Performance and the E 450 LWB AMG Line.  Electric G 580 features G-Turn, G-Steering and off-road crawl Standard Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 is already on sale in India The electric CLA concept is based on the MMA base Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology Ahead of its Bharat Mobility Show presentation, the Mercedes G 580 with EQ Technology will mark its India launch in production-spec on January 9, 2025. The new G-Class electric SUV will outperform its combustion-engined sibling – the G 450d – when driving off-road, claimed Mercedes. Its interior and exterior look unchanged from the regular G-Class save for some EV-specific changes.  The G 580 uses four electric motors, with one powering each wheel of the car. Each motor alone produces 147hp, making for a total output of 587hp, along with 1,165Nm of torque. Mercedes says the G 580 has a 0-100kph time of less than 5 seconds and a top speed of 180kph, however, it is aimed at delivering off-road performance. Its 116kWh battery, shared with the EQS, can be fast-charged at speeds of up to 200kW and gives a claimed range of 470km. Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 Night Series While Mercedes-Maybach currently sells the regular EQS 680 in India, the Night Series design package will be offered for the first time. As part of the pack comes a blacked-out theme for exterior elements like the Maybach emblem, front grille panel, air intakes and running board. A rear roof spoiler is added as well. It will likely share its electric underpinnings with the standard 680 model, which includes dual electric motors generating 658hp and 950Nm of torque (combined), feeding power to all four wheels through the 4Matic AWD tech. This translates into a  0 to 100kph time of 4.4 seconds, before topping out at 210kph. The 122kWh battery pack, which can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 31 minutes with a 200kW charger, returns a WLTP range of 611 kilometres on a single charge. Mercedes-Benz Concept CLA  Based on the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA), the electric CLA concept coupe first debuted at the International Motor Show 2023 in Germany. The next-generation CLA will continue to have four doors with the swooping roofline for a coupe-esque look. The grille has also been widened and merges with the bumper, and its headlamps get a new design. It is expected to get a full-width MBUX Superscreen, similar to the Vision EQXX's, with Mercedes’ new operating system. Further, it will boast the usage of eco-friendly materials for some cabin bits.  This new CLA will be slightly longer than its predecessor and could be the only entry-level offering from Benz in some markets, if it entirely phases out the A-Class sedan. We have also reported on the production version of the upcoming CLA coupe which you can check here.  Mercedes-Benz SL 55 AMG, S 63 E Performance AMG and E 450 LWB AMG Line From the house of AMG, cars like the 476hp-SL 55 4Matic+ Roadster and 802hp-S 63 E Performance will also be shown. Ex-showroom prices for the former and latter are Rs 2.44 crore and Rs 3.30 crore, respectively. The E 450 LWB 4Matic AMG Line entirely differs from the above-mentioned AMG pair as it only packs design elements for a sportier look. Mercedes currently sells the long-wheelbase E 450 for Rs 92.5 lakh. Also, see: Mercedes AMG S 63 E Performance review: Absolute Power Mercedes-AMG SL 55 review: Open air theatre",
