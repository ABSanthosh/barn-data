Acquired by the seller in 2019, this Firebird Trans Am coupe is now offered with a window sticker, promotional material, partial service records, a car cover, T-top shades, a spare set of wheels and tires, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Black, and details include removable T-top roof panels, Ram-Air induction, functional hood scoops, pop-up headlights, fog lights, and a decklid spoiler. Black-finished 18″ alloy wheels with red accents are mounted with Ironman tires. The WS6 Ram Air Performance and Handling Package included revised suspension tuning and a power steering cooler. A Baer Brakes brake kit has been retrofitted up front, while Eradispeed rotors have been installed at all four wheels. The 2+2 cabin features seating surfaces upholstered in Dark Pewter leather. Appointments include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control, aftermarket audio speakers, a trunk-mounted CD changer, and a Monsoon CD stereo with a graphic equalizer. The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a 155-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline, and supplementary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer was replaced and recalibrated in March 2000 and shows 24k miles, approximately 5k of which have been added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter LS1 V8 features Ram-Air induction and was modified with a Comp Cams camshaft as well as a custom-fabricated exhaust system with tubular exhaust headers and a Flowmaster mufflers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential, the latter of which was rebuilt in 2023. The included window sticker shows initial delivery to Faulkner Pontiac in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a total vehicle price of $30,510. Manufacturer’s literature, promotional material, partial service records, a car cover, T-top shades, and a spare set of wheels and tires will also accompany the vehicle.
