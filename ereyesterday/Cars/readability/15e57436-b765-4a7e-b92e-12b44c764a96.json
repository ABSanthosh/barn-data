  "text": "The prototype is expected to preview a new electric M3, possibly named i3 M December 11, 2024 at 19:50 by Michael Gauthier BMW M has dropped the first pictures of what appears to be a Neue Klasse EV prototype . The company seemingly referred to the model as a high-performance battery electric vehicle. It could have a quad-motor all-wheel drive system, similar to their i4-based prototype. Spy photographers recently snapped the first pictures of the Neue Klasse i3 and now we’re getting a look at the M variant. Little is known about it, but BMW M quietly dropped a handful of images on Instagram and their website. The company isn’t saying much at this point, but noted the car is a prototype and is “on the way to set new standards.” The automaker also referred to the model as the “HP BEV,” which presumably means high-performance battery electric vehicle. More: BMW Engineers Built An Electric M2 Prototype To Impress The Board Of Management If those weren’t enough hints, the images were accompanied by a quote from BMW M’s head of development, Dirk Häcker, who said “Electrification opens up completely new degrees of freedom for us to create M typical dynamics.” Moving onto the pictures themselves, we can see the model follows in the footsteps of previous prototypes as well as the Vision Neue Klasse concept. However, the M prototype is more aggressive as it appears to have a wider track as well as lightweight wheels wrapped in high-performance rubber. The car also sits low, which hints at a sportier suspension setup. There isn’t much else to see, but the car has retractable door handles and a relatively flat roof. They’re joined by a plain rear end that unsurprisingly lacks an exhaust. While BMW isn’t saying much, the wrap echoes the one found on the i4-based quad-motor prototype that has been undergoing testing for the past few years. Rumors have suggested the model could have more than 1,000 hp (746 kW / 1,014 PS) as well as advanced torque vectoring and even a tank turn capability. Given that BMW M has been on an electrification teaser spree as of late, we wouldn’t be surprised if more information were to follow in the coming days. H/T to BMW Blog",
