  "text": "Pricing climbs $1,250 but customers will find revised styling and a larger infotainment system February 24, 2025 at 20:00 by Michael Gauthier The facelifted Mitsubishi Outlander starts at $29,645 and will arrive at U.S. dealerships shortly. Styling changes are relatively minor, but the model has a classier cabin with new equipment. Power is provided by a familiar four-cylinder engine that develops 181 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque. Mitsubishi introduced the facelifted Outlander last fall and now the company has announced U.S. pricing will begin at $29,645 before a $1,495 destination fee. That’s an increase of $1,250 but the crossover sports a number of improvements. Looking instantly recognizable, the 2025 Outlander has a lightly revised grille and front bumper. They’re joined by new 18- and 20-inch wheels as well as smoked-finish taillights. Buyers will also find a revised color palette that now includes Moonstone Gray Metallic. More: 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Arrives In America Early Next Year Some of the biggest changes occur inside, where there’s a newly standard 12.3-inch infotainment system with GPS navigation as well as support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Further below, there’s a redesigned center console with repositioned cup holders. Occupants will also find updated controls, larger armrests, and higher quality materials. Elsewhere, there are new 8- and 12-speaker Yamaha audio systems. The Outlander also gains ventilated front seats for the first time and they can be found on SEL and above trims. Speaking of seats, there are a couple of new upholstery options including Brick Brown semi-aniline leather and light gray synthetic leather with suede-like inserts. The upgrades extend beyond equipment as engineers made a host of noise, vibration, and harshness improvements. This results in a “reduction of more than 0.5dB in road noise and nearly 6dB in overall sound isolation compared to the 2024 model.” To deliver a better driving experience, the crossover has a retuned power steering system that promises to be more precise. They’re joined by recalibrated springs, shock absorbers, and stabilizer bars to deliver better ride and handling. Power is provided by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 181 hp (135 kW / 184 PS) and 181 lb-ft (245 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to a continuously variable transmission, which can be paired to an available all-wheel drive system for an additional $1,800 on most trims. 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Pricing",
