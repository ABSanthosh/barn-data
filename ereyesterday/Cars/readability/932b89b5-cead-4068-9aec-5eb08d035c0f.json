  "description": "One of the most sprawling stalls at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025 will be that of Tata Motors. The homegrown carmaker will have a decided focus on EVs, but new models with other green technologies, such as flex fuel and CNG, are also expected to be showcased. Tata Motors will also display a few special editions and concepts at the pavilion. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect. Tata Harrier EV The most important model at Tata Motors’ stall will be the Harrier EV. It will be making a reappearance, having been showcased at previous years’ shows, but this time it is expected to debut in production-spec guise. The Harrier EV will likely sport a 60kWh battery with about 500km range. What will set it apart is that it’ll be the first all-electric model from Tata to sport an AWD setup, with an electric motor on each axle. In terms of design, it looks very similar to the ICE-powered Harrier, with some EV-specific updates. The interior is yet to be officially seen, but we expect loads to be shared with the regular Harrier and some with the Curvv EV. Prices of the Harrier EV are expected to be announced before March. Tata Sierra EV Another familiar sight at the stall will be the Sierra EV concept. We’ve seen different phases of the concept previously, and this time, it could be displayed in its closest-to-production form yet. Visually, the Sierra EV has some instantly recognisable design cues from the original Sierra from the ’90s. The signature curved-over rear-side windows, the squarish wheel arches and the high-set bonnet seen on the concept are all reminiscent of the original Sierra and are expected to make it to production. Not much has been said about its technical specifications, but we know it will be underpinned by Tata’s Acti.ev architecture and will be offered with electric, petrol and diesel powertrain options. The Sierra EV could also get a dual-motor AWD setup like the Harrier EV. The Sierra EV will have a 5-seater layout, and a 4-seater variant with ‘lounge seating’ is also a possibility. Tata Avinya Concept We have previously reported that Tata’s Avinya will not be a single model, but will spawn a new family of premium electric vehicles. This was previewed by a concept back in 2022. At the upcoming Expo, Tata Motors could give us a sneak peek at the first of these models, although the show car will still likely be in the concept stage. Technical details on Tata’s Avinya range are quite sparse.     Special Editions and alternative fuel vehicles Apart from new EVs, Tata Motors will be showcasing special editions of some of its existing models. Sources say two EVs and one ICE vehicle will be showcased in a new special edition on the lines of the Kaziranga Edition that the carmaker had introduced back in 2022 across its SUV line-up. Tata Motors could also showcase a flex-fuel version of Nexon or Punch SUV. The newly updated Tiago and Tiago EV and the carmaker’s existing range of CNG vehicles will also be present.
