Do you quote ‘80s movies so frequently your wife finally left you for some guy willing to watch newer movies and eat his vegetables without being told? Well, then boy have I got the car for you — this Back to the Future–themed 1982 DeLorean DMC-12 that’s currently listed on Cars \u0026 Bids. Why bidding is already up to $35,000 at the time of writing, I can’t explain, but then again, I also have no idea who these replicas are for.Suggested ReadingMy Favorite Christmas Present Was A Power Wheels DeloreanOffEnglishSuggested ReadingNow, I’ll readily admit, I’m too young to truly get “Back to the Future.” I may have been alive in the late 1900s and experienced the movie for the first time on VHS, but I was an ‘89 baby. By the time I was old enough to appreciate “Back to the Future,” its cultural impact had dissipated. Had I been born 20 years earlier, I would have been 16 when it came out, and I’d probably understand the attachment people have to a prop made out of a shitty car, but whether it’s age or something else, I just don’t get it. The thing is, though, I don’t think it’s specifically a “Back to the Future” thing. I just don’t see any point in owning something that’s so obviously a movie prop. Want to build a replica of the black Toyota SR5 from the same series? Go for it. In fact, I even understand paying a little extra for a truck with the right BTTF look. It’s a subtle nod to those who know, but to everyone else, you’re just driving around in a cool, old pickup truck. A DMC-12 that’s been given the time machine treatment, on the other hand, is only cool to people who are big fans of a move that’s nearly 40 years old. If you took it to a convention or something, I could see the appeal there, but for use outside of that? You’re just driving around in an obvious movie prop, and it comes off like you desperately want people to talk to you about your car. For less than $10,000, I could maybe understand, but these things go for real money! There are five days left on the auction, and as previously mentioned, it’s already been bid up to $35,000. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this thing ends up going for more than I make in a year.The real questions here are “To whom?” and “Why?” And while it probably sounds like I’m being snarky here, I promise I genuinely want to understand. What is the appeal of these cars? Are Gen X-ers realizing 65 is creeping up on them quickly and desperately trying to relive their youth? Please tell me what I’m missing because, clearly, I’m missing something here.",
