It is finished in Frozen White with Exposed carbon-fiber stripes over black Alcantara Dark Energy interior and powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Riding on 20″ gloss carbon-fiber wheels mounted over Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, the car also has butterfly doors, a retractable rear wing, a rear diffuser, gloss carbon-fiber exterior trim, and Sparco seats. Acquired by the current owner on BaT in September 2022, this Ford GT has 363 miles and is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of its current owner in Pennsylvania with a car cover, accessories, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Chris Svensson-designed second-generation GT debuted at the 2015 North American International Auto Show and entered production in December 2016 at Multimatic’s Markham, Ontario, assembly facility. This example is finished Frozen White with over-the-top exposed carbon-fiber stripes and was optioned with the Carbon Blue Graphics Package, which matches the mirror caps to the center stripe and brake calipers. Further details include LED headlights, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, LED taillights, a rear diffuser, and carbon-fiber exterior trim. Paint protection film is said to have been applied under current ownership. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Variable ride height, front-axle lift system, selectable driving modes, and launch control are standard features. Staggered-width 20″ gloss carbon-fiber wheels are secured by titanium lug nuts and wrapped in 245/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by blue-painted Brembo six-piston monoblock calipers over 15.5” carbon-ceramic discs up front, while four-piston calipers are mounted over 14.1” units out back. The cabin features black Alcantara over the Sparco seats with manually reclining carbon-fiber shells along with exposed carbon fiber that is visible on the door sills, dashboard, and center console. The fixed-position driver seat is paired with an adjustable pedal box and steering column, and additional appointments include automatic climate control and a touchscreen infotainment system. The F1-inspired Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel sits ahead of anodized aluminum shift paddles flanked by a digital instrument panel. The digital odometer indicated 363 miles, approximately 300 of which have been added under current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 features a carbon-fiber engine cover and was factory rated at 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. The GT received revised buttress air ducts and larger intercoolers for the 2020 model year, and the output rating was increased by 13 horsepower compared with 2017–2019 examples. Work performed in 2025 included replacing the relays in the battery and auxiliary junction boxes along with an oil change. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. An Akrapovič titanium exhaust system is fitted along with carbon-fiber aero panels fore and aft. A GT-branded car cover and Ford accessories are included in the sale. The Carfax report shows at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
