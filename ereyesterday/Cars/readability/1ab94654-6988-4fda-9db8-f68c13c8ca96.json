  "description": "All-new combustion-engined seven-seat SUV slots in between the Tiguan and Touareg Those of you who know your Chinese cars will be aware of the Volkswagen Tayron name from a crossover produced collaboratively by Volkswagen and FAW – but in 2025, it's going global.This new Tayron is an entirely new model that plugs the gap formerly filled by the Tiguan Allspace, offering a longer wheelbase, increased practicality and the choice of five or seven seats.It sits just above the regular, five-seat Tiguan and below the range-topping, luxury-geared Touareg. It's a natural rival to the Hyundai Santa Fe, Skoda Kodiaq and Peugeot 5008, all of which have received comprehensive updates in the past 12 months. Volkswagen Tayron range at a glanceThe Tayron offers one of the widest powertrain selections of the Volkswagen range, with petrols, diesels, mild hybrids and plug-in hybrids on offer.The UK market gets the entry-level mild-hybrid 1.5 eTSI, both plug-in hybrids, two diesels and the range-topping 2.0-litre petrol with 262bhp. VersionPower1.5 eTSI147bhpeHybrid 204PS201bhpeHybrid 272PS268bhp2.0TDI 150PS147bhp2.0TDI 193PS190bhp2.0TSI 204PS201bhp2.0TSI 265PS262bhp",

  "text": "Although the Tayron feels well-built inside, it’s not a haven of plush materials. Some softer plastics and fabrics are present on the doors and dashboard, but there are still a few too many glossy and scratchy surfaces throughout. There’s a clear feeling that Volkswagen didn’t want its newest SUV to cross over too much with the Touareg, the brand’s more expensive luxury flagship. All Tayrons get a 12.9in digital display as standard, plus a 10.25in digital cockpit. A larger, 15.0in infotainment display is available as part of the £1130 Infotainment Package Plus, which also adds a head-up display, several USB-C charging ports and Volkswagen’s AI-powered voice assistant, Ida. Volkswagen’s much-maligned climate and volume sliders are present, but they are at least backlit to make for easier night-time operation. There are just two physical buttons on the centre console, for starting/stopping and the parking brake. But Volkswagen has taken inspiration from Skoda with a new rotary dial that can be customised to control various functions, including media, volume and drive mode. More physical buttons wouldn’t go amiss, but the Tayron’s interior is certainly a more intuitive space than the 5008’s. It’s spacious in the Tayron’s first two rows, with plenty of leg and head room. The third row is much tighter than that of the 5008; adults will struggle for comfort. The Santa Fe’s is also more spacious and provides far more amenities, like USB ports and climate vents. Boot space measures 885 litres in five-seat petrols and diesels, 850 litres in seven-seaters (or 345 litres with the third row in place) and 705 litres in the five-seat-only PHEVs.",
