  "description": "This 1961 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster is one of 1,858 roadsters built during a six-year production run and is among 250 examples manufactured in 1961. Chassis 002753 is said to have been purchased out of New Orleans in 1981 by an owner who commissioned a refurbishment before utilizing the car in Gull Wing Group events during the course of his 35-year stewardship. The car was purchased by its current owner 10 years ago and subsequently underwent further refurbishment work that included a repaint in Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Palomino leather, and overhauls of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six and four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include Bosch mechanical fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, servo-assisted four-wheel drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle equipped with a 3.89:1 ratio, chrome 15” steel wheels, a body-color hardtop, a tan soft top, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 roadster is now offered by the seller in California on behalf of the owner with invoices from the last 15 years and a clean Arizona title.",

Chassis 002753 is said to have been purchased out of New Orleans in 1981 by an owner who commissioned a refurbishment before utilizing the car in Gull Wing Group events during the course of his 35-year stewardship. The car was purchased by its current owner 10 years ago and subsequently underwent further refurbishment work that included a repaint in Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Palomino leather, and overhauls of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six and four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include Bosch mechanical fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, servo-assisted four-wheel drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle equipped with a 3.89:1 ratio, chrome 15” steel wheels, a body-color hardtop, a tan soft top, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 roadster is now offered by the seller in California on behalf of the owner with invoices from the last 15 years and a clean Arizona title. The roadster variant of the 300SL entered production two months after its debut at the March 1957 Geneva Motor Show, superseding the coupe model as the final Gullwings left the factory. Construction incorporated a reconfigured version of the coupe’s tubular space frame with the sill trusses lowered to accommodate conventional doors and the rear segment revised to create usable trunk space. Like its predecessor, the roadster featured steel bodywork with aluminum utilized for the hood, trunk lid, door skins, sills, floors, and bulkhead. This example is said to have been finished in black when purchased in the 1980s by its long-term previous owner, who subsequently commissioned a repaint of the body and hardtop in the current shade of Fire Engine Red. An additional repaint in red was performed during the refurbishment under current ownership, which also included a repaint of the convertible top frame and the installation of a replacement tan fabric top. Additional work during the project included replacement or re-chroming of the brightwork and replacement of the North American-specification headlights. Exterior features include bumper guards at front and rear, pivot-out door handles, narrow-profile rear rocker panel end flanges, a fender-mounted driver-side mirror, and a fender-mounted antenna on the passenger side. The steel wheels wear covers with body-color accents and were re-chromed during the refurbishment under current ownership, which also included the mounting of Coker Classic wide-whitewall tires measuring 205/75R15. Servo-assisted braking is handled by finned aluminum drums at each corner, with actuation via dual floating shoes up front. A brake system refresh during the refurbishment under current ownership included rebuilds of the wheel cylinders, while additional work during the project included replacement of the wheel bearings, servicing of the steering box, and an alignment. The cabin was re-trimmed by Rudi \u0026 Company under current ownership in Palomino leather over the bucket seats, door panels, dash, center tunnel, and aluminum tonneau panel. Additional features include beige square-weave carpeting, an ivory-color shift knob, roll-up windows, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, a locking glovebox, a dash-mounted ashtray, and a Becker Mexico radio. The windshield wiper motor and transmissions were rebuilt under current ownership. The ivory-color steering wheel was fitted under current ownership and sits ahead of VDO instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and a rectangular combination gauge with English lettering. The five-digit odometer shows 65k miles, approximately 4k of which have been added under current ownership. The instruments were rebuilt by Palo Alto Speedometer during the refurbishment under current ownership. The 300SL roadster model’s 3.0-liter M198 inline-six was carried over from the fixed-roof variant and shares its canted orientation, Bosch mechanical direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, and aluminum cylinder head. The competition camshaft that was optional on the coupe was made standard for the roadster, which also gained a dual-point/dual-coil ignition system and various fuel system refinements. This example’s engine was overhauled by Metric Motors during the refurbishment under current ownership, and the injection pump was rebuilt by Pacific Injection. Additional work included rebuilds of the injectors, radiator, throttle body, generator, and starter, as well as replacement of the water pump and thermostat. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission and a 3.89:1-ratio rear end. The clutch disc and bearing were replaced under current ownership, while the flywheel was resurfaced and the driveshaft was rebuilt. The roadster’s four-wheel independent suspension utilizes a single-pivot rear axle with a compensator spring for improved stability over the coupe’s double-pivot design. Replacement Koni shock absorbers were fitted during the project under current ownership. A stainless-steel exhaust system was added under previous ownership.

The competition camshaft that was optional on the coupe was made standard for the roadster, which also gained a dual-point/dual-coil ignition system and various fuel system refinements. This example’s engine was overhauled by Metric Motors during the refurbishment under current ownership, and the injection pump was rebuilt by Pacific Injection. Additional work included rebuilds of the injectors, radiator, throttle body, generator, and starter, as well as replacement of the water pump and thermostat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413\" alt=\"1961 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=1240 1240w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1961_mercedes-benz_300sl-roadster_img_0072-14268.jpeg?w=1860 1860w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission and a 3.89:1-ratio rear end. The clutch disc and bearing were replaced under current ownership, while the flywheel was resurfaced and the driveshaft was rebuilt. The roadster’s four-wheel independent suspension utilizes a single-pivot rear axle with a compensator spring for improved stability over the coupe’s double-pivot design. Replacement Koni shock absorbers were fitted during the project under current ownership. A stainless-steel exhaust system was added under previous ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\tYou are not connected to real-time updates.
