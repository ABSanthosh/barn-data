  "description": "At the global debut of the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, the brand had teased another rugged upcoming SUV by showing a boxy silhouette. Now, fresh patent images that have surfaced on the internet point at the same SUV and also give us a preview of its final design. Touted to be a min-Fortuner for the masses, this new SUV is likely to be called the Toyota FJ Cruiser upon global debut.  New SUV is expected to revive the FJ Cruiser nameplate Expected with a range of petrol and diesel engines Is based on a derivate of Fortuner’s ladder frame chassis New Toyota FJ Cruiser: what is it? The name FJ has been a legendary moniker for Toyota with most Land Cruiser generations bearing the FJ suffix, starting from the FJ20 back in 1955. The last time Toyota used the FJ name on an SUV was for the retro-styled “FJ Cruiser” that was sold from 2006 to 2022. This all new SUV was slated to see a global debut last year, but things seems to have been delayed. Toyota FJ Cruiser to be the brand’s smallest rugged SUV FJ Cruiser based on a modified IMV ladder frame chassis The patent images confirm that this rugged SUV from Toyota is a larger evolution of the Compact Cruiser EV concept that was shown back in 2021. As per our previous reports, the new FJ Cruiser from Toyota will sit on a modified version of the IMV ladder frame chassis that currently underpins the Toyota Hilux Champ pickup sold in Thailand and Indonesia. This platform is a derivative of the IMV ladder frame setup that underpins the Hilux, Fortuner and the Innova Crysta.  The patent hints at the production-spec design of the Compact Cruiser EV concept. While the patent for this SUV was filed last year, it is only now that the image has surfaced on the internet.  Apart from the boxy stance, the patent image also confirms a proper five door layout. It has pronounced front and rear fenders and thick C-pillars with an upright rear. The future Toyota FJ Cruiser’s styling upfront has some rounded edges, but the rectangular grille, the tall front bumper and the heavy body cladding give it a rugged and utilitarian look. At the back, apart from the upright rear door, the SUV also gets a full-size spare wheel mounted at the tail gate. As for dimensions and powertrain, we expect the future Toyota FJ Cruiser to get a 2,750mm wheelbase which is identical to the Hilux Champ and also the Toyota Fortuner. Under the hood, expect a range of powertrain options, including the 2.0-litre petrol seen on the HIlux Champ, a 2.7-litre petrol and also the 2.8-litre diesel that sees duty on the Fortuner.  Some variants will get a basic 4WD setup, similar to the Fortuner and Hilux. Toyota FJ Cruiser will it come to India While Toyota has been evaluating more SUVs for India, it remains to be seen if Toyota will bring it here in the future. Expect the new Toyota FJ Cruiser to see a global debut sometime in late 2025 or early 2026.  Image Source: Oriba, via X  Also See: Toyota Fortuner mild hybrid launched at Rs 44.72 lakh New Jeep Cherokee revealed with hybrid powertrain",
