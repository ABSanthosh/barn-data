  "description": "We recently took the Tuono 457 to the CoASTT High Performance Centre for our annual track day, and even though I missed out on testing it on the street, hopping on it at the track was worth the wait. It was so impressive, in fact, that it deserved a standalone story of its own. Aprilia Tuono 457 design (8/10) A good looking design but the traditional Tuono face is missed. The Tuono is essentially an RS 457 in streetwear – same engine, chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres. The tank is slightly reshaped, and of course, those upright handlebars change the ergonomics. But the big surprise was that the lap time in Rajini Krishnan’s hands was nearly identical to the RS 457’s at our 2024 Track Day. No clip-ons, no wind protection, and less front-end load, yet it hung right in there. That’s remarkable. The fuel tank shape is slightly reprofiled on the Tuono. A few things played to the Tuono’s advantage this year. The track surface at the CoASTT was in better shape than the last time we visited, the weather was a little kinder, and, as always, familiarity counts. This bike also ran the optional quickshifter, something Rajini appreciated. It’ll set you back Rs 20,000 – not cheap by any stretch, especially on a sub-Rs 4 lakh machine – but it works well and really adds to the experience. Aprilia Tuono 457 ergonomics (6/10) Acessible seat height but cramped for tall riders. Like with the RS 457, the real gem remains the engine, and Aprilia’s 457cc parallel-twin continues to be the segment’s crown jewel. 48 horsepower and segment-leading torque only tell half the story. The motor is also very smooth, and it packs crisp throttle response and a rich and evocative sound. With that wide, sculpted tank between your legs and the bike’s superbike-like soundtrack, there’s a genuine sense of occasion every time you roll on the gas. That said, it’s not all roses. Ergonomics is where the Tuono 457 will leave taller riders wanting – especially on track. I found myself cramped against the rear seat bump stop, with the bike’s bodywork feeling particularly slippery. The already compact RS 457 felt more accommodating with its wide, more forward set clip-ons, but the Tuono’s setup makes the cockpit feel more restrictive. Some of this can easily be fixed by adding some grip tape and maybe by modifying the rear seat to allow the rider more room to slide back. But if you’re close to 6 feet tall, you will find this bike cramped – particularly in how the fuel tank recesses lock your knees in place – and that won’t be just at the race track. Aprilia Tuono 457 performance (9/10) Superb mid-range makes up for flat top-end and it makes a great sound. Beyond the hard metrics, the Tuono 457 is engaging, playful and, crucially, fast enough to make every session exciting. The aluminium chassis, firm suspension and impressive Eurogrip Pro Torque Xtreme tyres all come together to make this (along with the RS 457) probably the most impressive handling bike ever to be made in India.  Quickshifter is an impressive but expensive option CoASTT is a flowing circuit with few heavy braking zones, and while the 457’s front brake fade is a known issue, it wasn’t a problem here. That said, if you plan on hitting more tracks with more demanding braking zones, upgrading the pads, fluid, or master cylinder is something you’ll have to look into. Aprilia Tuono 457 handling (9/10) Chassis, suspension and tyres work well but brake fade needs to be addressed. What makes the Tuono so special is that it isn’t a detuned RS that trades capability for comfort. It carries the same spirit, the same capability, and nearly the same lap times. Unfortunately, it’s not all perfect. First, there’s the bike’s size and the fact that the design isn’t as evocative as the RS 457, which is more visually linked to its bigger siblings.  More worryingly, however, there have also recently been some customer reports of unexpected engine reliability issues, and this is something that Aprilia needs to address in a speedy and decisive manner. From a sheer capability standpoint, though, the Tuono 457 has exceeded expectations, and that’s not something that happens very often. Aprilia Tuono 457 verdict (9/10) Nearly as capable as the RS 457 and with considerably more seat comfort.  What really struck me is how this bike stacks up against the competition. Whether it’s KTM’s singles or Yamaha’s twin-cylinder offerings, the Tuono feels like it’s operating on a higher plane – especially on a fast circuit like CoASTT that rewards power and flow. In fact, the lap time is closer to more powerful bikes like the Suzuki GSX-8R and Ducati Hypermotard Mono than it is to rivals like the KTM 390 Duke and Yamaha R3.
