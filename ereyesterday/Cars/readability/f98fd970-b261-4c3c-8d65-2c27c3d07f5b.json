  "text": "An ID.3 GTI is rumored to arrive next year with around 335 hp May 8, 2025 at 20:35 by Michael Gauthier VW is preparing a 335 hp rear-drive ID.3 GTI to launch sometime next year. It will slot above the GTX Performance with minor power and chassis upgrades. Pricing in Europe is likely to exceed that of both the Golf GTI and Clubsport trims. Volkswagen isn’t wasting time signaling that the GTI nameplate won’t be left behind in the EV transition. The German automaker dropped a pretty clear hint when it rolled out the ID. GTI Concept at the 2023 Munich Motor Show. While that concept was aimed at previewing the upcoming ID.2 GTI, signs now point to an ID.3 GTI being next in line. According to a report from Auto Motor und Sport, the car will slot above the ID.3 GTX Performance, which features a 79 kWh battery pack and an electric motor developing 322 hp (240 kW / 326 PS) and 402 lb-ft (545 Nm) of torque. This setup enables the hot hatch to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 5.7 seconds and have a WLTP range of up to 373 miles (602 km). More: VW ID.3 GTX Fire+Ice Is A Hot Electric Hatch That Pays Tribute To The Past While little is known about the GTI variant at this point, the publication says it will arrive next year and be rear-wheel drive. However, don’t expect it to be significantly more powerful than the ID.3 GTX Performance. Quite the opposite as they suggest the car could only have around 335 hp (250 kW / 340 PS). That’s not much of a boost, but the upgraded powertrain could be accompanied by “extensive modifications to the chassis … intended to enable even more agile handling.” Besides the performance and handling tweaks, the car would likely incorporate a number of GTI styling cues. The hot hatch should also build on the ID.3 GTX Performance, which has revised steering, a retuned suspension, and an available DCC adaptive chassis system. All of this will likely lead to steep pricing as the ID.3 GTX Performance starts at €48,725 ($54,706) in Germany. To put that into perspective, the Golf GTI starts at €45,655 ($51,255) while the GTI Clubsport begins at €49,225 ($55,263).",
