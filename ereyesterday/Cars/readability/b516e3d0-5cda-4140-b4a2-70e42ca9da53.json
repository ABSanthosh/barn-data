This C4 Grand Sport is now offered in Maryland by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. All C4 Corvette Grand Sport examples were finished in Admiral Blue (28) and featured a white central stripe with twin red hash marks above the left front wheel. Exterior equipment includes pop-up headlights, fog lights, a white vinyl convertible soft top, a Corvette-branded front plate cover, and quad tail lights. The 17″ black five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle GS-C tires. The car is equipped with traction control and the Selective Ride and Handling Package, which added adjustable dampers. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS. A brake fluid flush was performed in January 2025. The cabin features power-adjustable sport seats trimmed in black leather with red Grand Sport headrest embroidery. Amenities include a Delco Bose CD stereo, cruise control, automatic climate control, an onboard computer, and power windows and locks. The two-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central digital speedometer, a fuel level monitor, and analog instrumentation consisting of a tachometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and voltage. The digital odometer indicates 513 miles. The 5.7-liter LT4 V8 was factory-rated at 330 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.
