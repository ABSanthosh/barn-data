  "description": "Mahindra has launched the much-anticipated BE 6e today with introductory prices starting at Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India). The BE 6e and the XEV 9e are the two new electric coupe-SUVs that Mahindra unveiled today. Apart from the design, which is arguably one of the biggest highlights of the BE 6e, some figures of interest include an ARAI-certified range of up to 682km, 281hp of max power and a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 6.7 seconds. The BE 6e is the first product from the newly constituted electric-only BE sub-brand. There will be more products under this name that have been previously previewed by the BE.07 and BE.09 concepts. Mahindra BE 6e gets 59kWh and 79kWh battery pack options Is available only in rear-wheel drive form at launch Full price list to be revealed in January at the Bharat Mobility Show Mahindra has currently revealed the price of only the base trim of the BE 6e, called the Pack One, and it is exclusive of the charger, which needs to be bought seperately. This variant is available with the smaller 59kWh battery pack; prices of higher-spec trims will be revealed later. Mahindra BE 6e exterior design What’s really impressive about the BE 6e is that it looks nearly identical to its very radical concept. In fact, the only noticeable differences on the production version of the SUV are the conventional wing mirrors as opposed to the cameras on the concept, and slightly different positioning of the flush-fitting door handles. Styling is sharp and edgy all around, and the pronounced wheel arches with the thick gloss black cladding around the sides and on the face creates a nice dual-tone finish for the exterior. A really cool detail is the air duct between the lights that channels air through the bonnet for better efficiency. Other elements that stand out include the illuminated logos, the C-shaped LED daytime running lamps enclosing the main headlamp cluster and the two-part split spoiler and full-width wraparound LED tail-lights at the rear. The high-deck rear with the coupe roofline and a wraparound glasshouse also give it a very distinct silhouette, but that seems to have pinched the rear window line compromising the view out. The rear bumper also gets a diffuser-like effect, further accentuating its sportiness. Mahindra BE 6e dimension The BE 6e measures 4,371mm in length, 1,907mm in width, 1,627mm in height and has a wheelbase of 2,775mm, which is identical to the XEV 9e. In fact, the wheelbase will be identical on all INGLO models to optimise costs and packaging. The coupe-SUV rides on 19-inch aero-optimised wheels with 245/55 section tyres, giving it a very strong road presence. One can also opt for larger 245/50 R20-inch wheels. Mahindra says the BE 6e has a ground clearance of 207mm and a turning circle of less than 10 metres which is pretty impressive. It has a boot space of 455 litres and an additional frunk space of 45 litres. Mahindra BE 6e interior and features The interior design is just as radical as the exterior, carrying forward a lot from the concept. The most distinctive element here is the halo-like trim that wraps around the driver, giving a cockpit-like feel to the interior. It extends from the dashboard to the centre console, houses the driver's AC vents and effectively splits the cabin into two; the passenger side AC vents are also seamlessly integrated in a slim strip on the dashboard. Instrumentation and entertainment duties are handled by dual, 12.3-inch floating screens running a new software called MAIA with 30+ pre-installed apps. The system has has 24 GB RAM, 128 GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 processor, which Mahindra claims is the fastest chipset in automotive grade. The infotainment system even gets three pre-set themes – Calm, Cozy and Club – with signature tunes curated by AR Rahman, ambient light and climate control adjustments. The BE 6e also gets a segment-first augmented reality head-up display. Other highlights include a new two-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated Mahindra logo and a floating centre console that houses an aircraft thrust lever-style drive mode selector, a rotary dial for the drive modes, a wireless charging pad and cup holders. Being a born-EV, there’s a nifty open storage area just below the floating centre panel. Another aircraft-style control panel on the roof houses lighting and sunroof controls, and it has unique strap-type interior door handles. Top-spec variants of the BE 6e get dual-zone climate control, a huge panoramic sunroof with integrated multi-colour lighting patterns and laminated glass which can block UV rays, auto park assist, an in-car camera, electronic parking brake, a Dolby Atmos 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, ambient lighting, powered driver’s seat with memory function, 5G connectivity with in-built Wi-Fi, OTA updates, Level 2 ADAS suite, 360-degree cameras, 7 airbags and the works! The 6e also allows for a unique BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) feature where you can plug-in any external device on the front seat backs and stream your desired content. Mahindra BE 6e interior battery, range and charging The Mahindra BE 6e will be offered with two battery packs – a 59kWh unit and a 79kWh unit – with Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. It is underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform which employs BYD’s blade cell technology, and uses what the brand calls a ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ made up of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. The BE 6e will be offered in two states of tune – the 59kWh variants produce 228hp, while the 79kWh variants produce 281hp; torque is rated at 380Nm for both. At launch, the BE 6e is only available in rear-wheel drive form, although an AWD version could be on cards for the future. Mahindra is claiming a 0-100kph sprint time of 6.7 seconds for the higher-spec variant of the BE 6e. The car offers three drive modes – Range, Everyday and Race – along with an additonal Boost mode that provides 10 seconds of max torque. These specs are also identical to the XEV e9.  The larger battery pack has an ARAI-claimed range of 682km, or a WLTP range of 550km; the smaller battery pack has an ARAI-certified range of 535km. Mahindra is also providing lifetime warranty on the battery pack and claims that the batteries can charge from 20 percent to 80 percent in just 20 minutes using a 175kW DC fast charger. As standard, however, the company will be providing either a 11.2kW AC charger (0-100 percent in 8hrs/6hrs for 79kWh/59kWh, respectively) or a 7.3kWh AC charger (0-100 percent in 11.7hrs/8.7hrs for 79kWh/59kWh, respectively), which must be bought separately. Other technical highlights of the BE 6e include adjustable regenerative braking, electric power steering with variable gear ratios, semi-active suspension, brake-by-wire technology and disc brakes on all four wheels. Mahindra will commence deliveries for the BE 6e from late February or early March 2025. Stay tuned for booking details and the full price list.  Also See: Mahindra BE 6e image gallery Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e to be sold through existing dealer network",
