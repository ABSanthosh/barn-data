Work was completed in 2024 and included a bare-metal repaint in the factory shade of Silver Grey Metallic and reupholstering the cabin in red leather along with the installation of air conditioning, rebuilds of the 2.5-liter inline-six and four-speed automatic transmission, and overhauls of the suspension, steering, and brakes. A replacement soft top and hardtop were also added in addition to a stainless steel exhaust system, Euro headlights, and a refurbished Becker AM/FM radio with Bluetooth capability. This W113 SL was acquired by the seller on BaT in April 2024 and is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car was finished from the factory in Silver Grey Metallic (180) and was stripped to bare metal before being repainted during the aforementioned refurbishment, at which time the passenger door and trunk floor were replaced and the right lower front fender and quarter panels were patched and welded. The chrome trim was re-plated and the windshield and side glass replaced along with the bumpers, weatherstripping, and rubber trim. A replacement hardtop and soft top were installed and Euro headlights and a right-side mirror were added. The seller notes a paint crack ahead of the left mirror. Steel 14″ wheels feature hubcaps with painted centers and chrome trim rings, and they are mounted with thin whitewall Phoenix tires. The car rides on Bilstein shocks and is additionally equipped with power steering and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. During the refurbishment, the shocks, brake calipers, brake lines, and brake proportioning valve were replaced, while the brake booster, power steering pump, steering rack, and steering column were rebuilt. The seats were reupholstered in red leather and color-coordinated dash pads, door panels, and squareweave carpets were added. A Kuhlmeister air conditioning system was overhauled before being installed under prior ownership and the interior brightwork was re-chromed. The Becker Europa AM/FM radio was refurbished and fitted with a Bluetooth module and speakers were added to the kick panels. The replacement two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames instrumentation that was refurbished by Palo Alto Speedometer, including a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The horns and switchgear were also replaced. The five-digit odometer shows 60k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The 2.5-liter M129 inline-six was rebuilt under current ownership, and additional work included installing a rebuilt Bosch distributor, re-coring the radiator, and replacing the wiring harness, water pump, thermostat, and thermostat housing. Later-model 55-amp alternator internals were installed in a factory-style 35-amp housing and the fuel system was overhauled, including rebuilding the fuel injection pump and fuel pump as well as replacing the injectors, lines, cold start valve, and constant speed servo. Work in February 2025 involved repairing power steering, fuel injection pump, and oil pan leaks as well as adjusting the neutral safety cable, replacing the hood release cable, and tightening the valve covers. A replacement battery was also installed under current ownership. The four-speed automatic transmission was overhauled by Sun Valley Mercedes Transmissions in Pacoima, California in 2019. The axles were refreshed and the center U-joint, pinion bearing, outer axle bearings, boots, and seals were replaced at that time. A ceramic-coated stainless-steel exhaust system was installed and a wax coating was applied to the underside. Chassis number 11304312001367 is shown on the reproduction trim tag above, and the VIN on the title is listed as 250SL001367, which utilizes the model in conjunction with the last six digits of the chassis number.
