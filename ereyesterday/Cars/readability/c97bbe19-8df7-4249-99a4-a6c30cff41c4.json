  "text": "These renderings suggest that the design of the new Charger suits a Mach-E style crossover shape quite well February 9, 2025 at 19:24 by Brad Anderson An independent designer has reimagined the Stellantis Peugeot 408 as a new Dodge Dart. The render makes a compelling case for adding a liftback-style crossover to Dodge’s range. In theory, an EV version of this crossover could rival the Ford Mach-E and Tesla Model Y. After bidding farewell to the classic Challenger and Charger, and with the Durango on the chopping block, Dodge is facing a major identity crisis. The brand desperately needs new, high-volume vehicles to pull it back from the brink, as it will soon be left with only the new Charger and the Alfa Romeo-based Hornet. Could a revived version of the Dodge Dart – last built from 2012 to 2017 – be the answer? Thanks to Dodge’s position within the Stellantis group, it could take an existing model, rebrand it, and sell it under its own nameplate. One interesting candidate? The Peugeot 408 crossover – arguably one of the most striking vehicles in Stellantis’ European portfolio. Designer Theophilus Chin suggests the 408 could serve as the perfect foundation for a modern-day Dart, whether in its pure-electric E-408 or hybrid 408 form. Read: Electric Peugeot E-408 Is A Stylish French Fastback With A Disappointing 282-Mile Range In creating this new-age Dart, the rendering specialist has kept the same overall crossover shape as the 408 but grafted on the bodywork from the new Charger Daytona. Obviously, if Dodge were to build a new liftback-style crossover based on the Peugeot, it would need to look quite different from the Charger. However, it could retain some design elements, similar to what Ford did with the Mustang Mach-E and the two-door ‘Stang. Illustrations Theophilus Chin In Chin’s vision, the Dart’s front and rear fascias mirror those of the Charger Daytona. Think retro-inspired headlights, a signature LED light bar, and the R-Wing that channels air over the hood. At the rear, you’ve got the same signature LED taillights, albeit positioned higher on the tailgate than on the Peugeot. It’s an interesting mix of the old and the new, with some familiar Dodge elements woven in to make the crossover feel unmistakably like it belongs to the brand. More: Dodge Sold A New Dart 8 Years After It Died, And A New Viper Too While we doubt that Dodge will bring back the Dart as a crossover inspired by the Peugeot 408, there’s still a case to be made for another SUV in its lineup. The Hornet is a decent option, but it’s not particularly sexy or desirable. These renders show that, with the right tweaks, the Charger’s design could translate into a crossover, blending both muscle and practicality into one package. Would you be on board for a new Dart crossover, or is this all just a pipe dream? Maybe you think Dodge should scrap the whole idea and focus on a different direction altogether. Either way, we want to hear your thoughts. Drop a comment below and let us know where you stand on the future of Dodge’s lineup. Peugeot E-408",
