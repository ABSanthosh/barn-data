  "text": "Ford is recalling a batch of brand-new Super Duty pickups and issuing a “Do Not Drive” warning over a potentially faulty retaining spring attached to the brake booster pushrod. Obviously, if the component were to fail drivers run the risk of their brakes becoming non functional.It doesn’t need to be said that a vehicle lacking the ability to stop itself is out of compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and are therefore required by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to undergo a formal recall.A total of 2,345 trucks are involved in the recall that includes Ford F-250, F-350, F-450, and F-550 Super Duty pickups from the 2025 model year. Concerns surround the aforementioned retaining spring — which may have been improperly installed or not installed at all.Impacted individuals should have already begun receiving formal notices in the mail and are being advised against driving the trucks.\"Owners are advised not to drive their vehicles until they have been repaired. Dealers will inspect and repair the brake pedal assembly as necessary, free of charge,\" explains the NHTSA recall report.Those seeking more information can contact Ford’s Customer Service at 866-436-7332. The manufacturer’s number for this recall is 25C26. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline is another resource (888-327-4236) or you can head to the agency’s recall website. Just be sure to have your VIN and recall campaign code (25V401000) handy.[Image: Ford]Become a TTAC insider.
