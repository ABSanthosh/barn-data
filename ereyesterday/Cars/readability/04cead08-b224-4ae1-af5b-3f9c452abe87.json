  "description": "The Classic 650 Twin has been a long time coming, and it is the latest model to use RE’s proven twin-cylinder mill and combine it with the timeless British looks of the Classic 350. While we did sample the bike in the UK last year, this opportunity to ride it around Coonoor helped us understand who this bike is for. Royal Enfield Classic 650 design, features Appealing design and high quality levels found on the big Classic Probably one of the strongest driving forces behind someone’s purchase of the Classic 650 will be its charming design. While this is unmistakably a Classic, its sheer size and that additional peashooter will instantly give away that this is the bigger one.  The Classic 650's design is one of its strongest points. The fit-and-finish is absolutely top-notch here, and the attention to detail is marvellous for a bike at this price point. You get things like chromed-out switch cubes and wheel hubs on all the colourways, and this top variant we rode gets bodywork that’s almost entirely chrome!  The Classic 650’s features set is very similar to the smaller 350’s, and you get the same handsome digi-analogue display and a USB-C charger. It also gets a slip/assist clutch and adjustable levers, but that’s about it. USB-C charger tucked away discreetly below the clutch lever. While it certainly is a head-turner, one little chink in its armour is the gap between the fender and the rear wheel. It’s not really an eyesore, but it stands out like a sore thumb on this gorgeous a machine. Royal Enfield Classic 650 engine, performance Proven twin-cylinder motor has good power, but at 243kg, the bike is rather heavy Aside from the appealing design, another major reason that people will gravitate towards the Classic 650 Twin is its engine. The 648cc parallel twin motor has been lifted straight off the Shotgun with almost no changes, but that’s not a bad thing.  We’ve come to know this engine very well over the years, and it carries forward all of its strong points, such as its creamy smooth refinement, the easy-going but punchy performance, and that lovely soundtrack. For someone looking to step up from a smaller Royal Enfield or buy a retro-looking motorcycle with proper highway capability, the Classic 650’s performance is sure to impress.  The twin-cylinder engine is smooth, powerful and has a lovely soundtrack. At 243kg, the Classic 650 is a big, heavy thing, and you feel that at a standstill and also while pushing it around or during U-turns, but Royal Enfield has done a commendable job of masking its weight once you get going. We rode this bike on some really narrow, twisty roads, and with how well it handles, I’d never have guessed it weighs what it does.  Unlike the Shotgun, the Classic 650 gets a right-way-up fork, which performs just fine and suits its more traditional look, too. Braking performance is also nice, and while the power is more than sufficient, the rear brake felt a little too aggressive; a more progressive, gentler initial bite here would suit the overall demeanour of this machine.  The Classic’s handling belies its 243kg kerb weight. Royal Enfield Classic 650 suspension comfort  With suspension derived from the Shotgun, this Classic has a stiff ride The Classic 650’s rider triangle is spot on, and you’re seated in this really commanding position, just like its smaller sibling. You could easily spend long hours in this bike’s saddle, and it would have made for a great touring machine.  We say “would” because the suspension comfort here (or the lack thereof) really betrays the Classic name. The twin shock absorbers are lifted straight off the Shotgun and have the same 90mm of travel, too. RE says the tuning is slightly different, and while the Classic 650 is marginally better than the Shotgun, it still has that underlying stiff feeling. Stiff shock absorbers don’t do justice to the Classic’s name. While the roads we travelled on were largely well-paved and smooth, over the few bumps that I did go over, I didn’t get the same plush, absorptive feel that the Classic 350 has; it felt rather close to the Shotgun. Another complaint I have is that the Classic 650 runs tubed wire-spoke rims, and while RE is working on a tubeless solution, that is still some time away. Royal Enfield Classic 650 price and verdict Good pricing, pleasing design and performance will find it quite a few takers Ultimately, the Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin is a heart-over-head purchase, and it’s for a casual sort of rider – someone who likes to use their bike as more of a leisure pursuit than as their regular workhorse. Chrome switch cubes are nice to look at and operate, but the placement of the pass switch is unintuitive.  As for the Classic’s pricing, the bike is available in four colours. The base Vallam Red and Bruntingthorpe Blue will set you back Rs 3.37 lakh, the middle Teal (which comes with a colour-matched frame, centre stand and side stand) costs Rs 3.41 lakh, and finally, this top Black Chrome colour will set you back Rs 3.50 lakh.  Same display as the smaller Classic and Bullet, but the headlight housing is much bigger. This places the Classic 650 Twin almost on par with the Bear 650, and it sits above the Interceptor and Continental GT but a fair deal below the Shotgun and Super Meteor. With its strong brand recall, fantastic design and the ability to hold triple-digit speeds without any fuss, the charming Classic 650 Twin could well become one of the bestselling RE 650s, both in India and overseas. Just try to steer clear of any bumps you encounter on the road!",
