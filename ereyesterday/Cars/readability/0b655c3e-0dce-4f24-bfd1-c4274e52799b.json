Work included a repaint in Pastel Blue and overhauls of the interior, engine, brakes, and suspension. The car is powered by a 2.2-liter flat-six and equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle, LED headlights, Fuchs wheels, Koni dampers, GTS Classic seats, a Porsche Classic radio, and a leather-wrapped RSR-style steering wheel. The owner bought the car and brought it to California in 2023 and it is now offered on their behalf with a Porsche Production Specifications sheet, the owner's manual, service records, spare parts, a car cover, four keys, and a clean Montana title.",

Work included a repaint in Pastel Blue and overhauls of the interior, engine, brakes, and suspension. The car is powered by a 2.2-liter flat-six and equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle, LED headlights, Fuchs wheels, Koni dampers, GTS Classic seats, a Porsche Classic radio, and a leather-wrapped RSR-style steering wheel. The owner bought the car and brought it to California in 2023 and it is now offered on their behalf with a Porsche Production Specifications sheet, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a car cover, four keys, and a clean Montana title. The car was stripped to bare metal in 2014 and rust repair was carried out around the body. It was then repainted in the factory Pastel Blue using Glasurit enamel. LED headlights have been fitted and the removed factory items are included in the sale. A 657-photo gallery documenting the bulk of the restoration work can be viewed here. The 15″ Fuchs wheels are mounted with 185/70 Pirelli P7 Cinturato tires. The brakes and suspension were overhauled in 2016. The brake fluid was flushed in 2024. The cabin has been reupholstered and fitted with GTS Classic seats, a Porsche Classic Bluetooth radio, a leather-wrapped RSR-style steering wheel, and a Rennline phone mount. Rust in the floor was treated in 2024 and a hole was repaired. The removed factory seats are included in the sale. Instrumentation includes a 150-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 80k miles, approximately 800 of which were added under current ownership. The 2.2-liter flat-six is equipped with Bosch fuel injection and was factory rated at 155 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque. The engine was rebuilt between 2014 and 2016 and the seller reports that the block was align bored and the main bearings and oil bypass were shuffle pinned. Installed components include 911S pistons and camshafts, hydraulic timing chain tensioners, and an SSI heat exchanger. A compression and leak-down test was performed in September 2024. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a five-speed 911/01 manual transaxle. The Porsche Production Specifications sheet lists factory colors and optional equipment. Photos of service records, a handwritten fuel log, and past registrations can be viewed in the image gallery below along with photos of removed factory parts included in the sale. There is currently a lien on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
