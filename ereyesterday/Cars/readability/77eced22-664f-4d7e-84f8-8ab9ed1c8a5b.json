  "description": "As Kia’s flagship SUV, the EV9 stands as the brand’s largest, most luxurious and most technologically advanced model yet. Since it comes to India as a fully imported unit, it is pricey at Rs 1.30 crore ex-showroom. We got a brief opportunity to experience it on Kia’s test track. Here are the first few impressions. Kia EV9 Exterior Plus-sized SUV with impressive aerodynamics Upward sloping window line and sleek LEDs add flair to an otherwise clean design. The EV9 certainly commands attention with its plus-sized proportions and upright stance. It’s larger than the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV and even boasts a longer wheelbase. The LED daytime running lamps appear to be neatly embedded into the front grille panel. Other interesting design details include bumper flaps that automatically open to cool the battery. The 20-inch wheels are definitely eye-catching as well. Its LEDs appear to be neatly embedded in the bodywork. The EV9 also features flush-type door handles, which, along with the clean body lines, are designed to improve aerodynamics. In fact, the EV9 has a drag coefficient of 0.28, which is impressive for such a large SUV. The upward-sloping window line and sleek LED tail-lamps add flair to the otherwise clean and minimal body styling. While the styling is futuristic and elegant, the paint quality leaves room for improvement, with an evident orange-peel effect on the gloss-black cladding and main body panels. Kia EV9 Interior Comfortable and luxurious, but not German-grade Extremely comfortable captain chairs, with ottomans. Get heating, cooling and a massage function. Step inside the EV9, and you’re met with a sophisticated black and dark brown theme. The dashboard is clean and horizontal, and the throne-like front seats feel luxurious, with comfort being enhanced by ventilation, heating and massaging function options. The EV9 is typically Kia – it impresses and is very well-loaded. The trouble is, at this price point, expectations are high. While the interior feels premium, it’s not to the level of its German rivals; there’s a noticeable use of hard plastics, which detracts from the luxury experience. The 360-degree camera system is clear but lacks the level of detail in the UI presentation and animations that you see at this level. With all three rows in place, 333L boot space is rather respectable. Appreciably, there are physical switches to control fans and temperature for the air-con, as well as a high-quality volume scroller for the infotainment screen. However, all’s not perfect. The dedicated screen for the air-con controls is hidden from the driver’s field of vision, and the row of touchscreen shortcut keys requires serious effort to click and operate. In India, the EV9 is offered only as a six-seater, featuring second-row captain chairs, which, just like the front seats, are extremely luxurious. To start with, they are placed higher than the front seats, so unlike most EVs, you are not seated in a knees-up position. Further, these get electrically powered ottomans as well, and to enhance comfort, they offer heating, cooling and massage functions. However, you can hear all that work, as it’s noticeably loud, but the good news is that it offers a proper high-intensity massage much akin to home massage seats. This function can be activated using a tablet controller, too. While clarity is fine, the camera display lacks detailing in terms of user interface and animations. Middle-row passengers benefit from a dedicated sunroof, sunshades, boss mode to adjust the front passenger seat, a large centre console with a built-in fridge (optional), and wireless charging, to name a few comforts. Access to the third row is easy thanks to the powered captain seat movement. And while headroom is ample even for tall adults, you are forced to sit at an angle to make space for the large (optional) middle-row console. As for boot space, it is rather respectable at 333 litres with all seats up. Of course, it is expandable by folding the third row of seats. A 52-litre front luggage compartment further adds to the practicality. A 52L front loading area further adds practicality.   Kia EV9 Performance, Ride and Handling Brisk performance and even quicker charging capabilities The EV9’s twin motors – one for the front wheels and one for the rear – draw energy from a 99.8kWh battery. Combined, these produce 384hp and 700Nm of torque. As a result, it accelerates briskly. However, you are not pinned to your seat as the power delivery is measured. Based on our GPS-based testing, it accelerated from 0 to 100kph in merely 5.36 seconds, which is respectable for a 7-seater EV weighing over 2.6 tonnes. Even regenerative braking feels quite natural and predictable. Column-mounted drive selector is very easy to use. Kia claims a range of 561km (ARAI-rated), and thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, it supports ultra-fast charging. With a 350kW charger –provided you can find one– its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 24 minutes. The EV9 feels mature and composed from behind the wheel. Ride quality, based on a brief stint on Kia’s test track, was surprisingly comfortable even without air suspension (it uses steel springs). Handling is impressive for such a large vehicle, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds. However, under hard braking, the SUV’s 2.6-tonne mass is noticeable. Handling is impressive for such a large car, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds.   Kia EV9 Price and Verdict A lot of car for a lot of money The Kia EV9 is spacious, comfortable, luxurious and tech-rich, and it performs well. Middle-row comfort is a major highlight, arguably surpassing what’s offered by rivals like the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE. That said, at Rs 1.30 crore, the EV9 is priced at par with these two, which, besides their badge, also deliver the whole luxury experience. So, even though the EV9 is a lot of car, it’s a lot of money, and the question is, are you willing to look beyond its badge?
