  "description": "Hero’s electric subsidiary Vida has launched its new V2 e-scooter, which is available in three variants: Lite (Rs 96,000), Plus (Rs 1.15 lakh) and Pro (Rs 1.35 lakh).  Lite variant gets a 2.2kWh battery, 94km claimed IDC range V2 Plus, Pro identical to V1 models Battery packs come with 3-year/30,000km warranty Vida V2 model lineup explained The Vida V2 is an evolution of the V1 range that Hero had kicked off its EV innings with. The most affordable V2 Lite is an entirely new variant and comes with a small 2.2kWh battery pack that has a claimed 94km IDC range. It also has a lower 69kph top speed compared to the Plus and Pro variants, which have top speeds of 85kph and 90kph, respectively. Only two riding modes are available on the V2 Lite – Ride and Eco – but the rest of the feature-set is very similar to the other two, including the 7-inch touchscreen TFT display.  At Rs 96,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi), Hero’s Vida V2 sits bang on par with the TVS iQube 2.2 and Bajaj Chetak 2903 models, in terms of price and battery capacity. When it comes to the V2 Plus and V2 Pro, the changes are rather hard to make out. Essentially, these versions are uncannily similar to the V1 models, if not the same. The Rs 1.15 lakh V2 Plus has a 3.44kWh battery pack, an 85kph top speed and a 143km claimed IDC range. The range-topper in the Vida V2 lineup is the Rs 1.35 lakh V2 Pro, which has a 3.94kWh battery, 90kph top speed and a 165km claimed IDC range.  The e-scooter comes with a 5-year/50,000km warranty whereas the battery packs come with a 3-year/30,000km warranty.  Vida has slowly but steadily made inroads into the EV market, with sales numbers for Hero’s electric subsidiary growing steadily every month. With the launch of this new affordable V2 Lite, and the growing network of Vida showrooms across India, expect the company to cement itself in the top five players in the EV game in the coming months.
