  "text": "Published:  November 18th, 2024 It appears that the incoming Trump administration might loosen some regulations around autonomous vehicles. Figures, since such a move might benefit Tesla, and Tesla boss Elon Musk has been at Donald Trump's side since the election was called. Though, as Matthew Guy notes, General Motors would also likely benefit.It seems that the new admin would like to see more fully-autonomous vehicles on the road sans steering wheel.These self-driving car test-mules have been involved in crashes, and now it looks like we're getting a business-friendly loosening of rules that will allow for more testing but possibly at the expense of real-world damage to life and limb. At least, that's how I see it. I am not against fully autonomous vehicles necessarily -- though I don't want to give up the option to drive for myself -- but I don't like the idea of for-profit companies using us a crash-test dummies.I'd love to see a strong regulatory environment around AVs, but I am wary that this suggested change could benefit Tesla and GM at the expense of the public.Maybe I am being paranoid, though. What do you think? How best can we regulate the real-world test of autonomous vehicles? I am especially curious to hear from people who live in San Francisco or other areas where these vehicles are being constantly tested.Sound off below.[Image: Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”.

More by Tim Healey Published November 18th, 2024 6:30 PM Comments Join the conversation Jmo2 17 minutes ago Have we established they get in more accidents than people? If they, for the sake of round numbers, kill a pedestrian every 1 billion miles traveled vs every 500 million for a person, so what? There seems to be some theory that AVs killing someone every 1 billion miles is worse than people doing it every 500 million miles - for reasons I can’t fathom. They do get into more accidents than people do, but they are rarely responsible for those accidents under current definitions of liability. That isn't to say that they kill more or less people, but they are conclusive proof that not everyone who rear ends someone is at fault. NO RULES at all. LET the FREE market decide what is BEST",
