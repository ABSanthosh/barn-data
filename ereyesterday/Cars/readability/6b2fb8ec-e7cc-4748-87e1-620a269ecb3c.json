  "description": "Sharad Agarwal has stepped down as head of Lamborghini India and joined Classic Legends as its chief business officer(CBO). He assumed his new role this week and will report to CEO Ashish Joshi. As CBO, Agarwal will oversee sales, network expansion, and service at Classic Legends. Agarwal, an automotive industry veteran with over 23 years of experience, spent more than a decade at Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Private Limited. During his tenure at Lamborghini, India sales crossed the landmark of over 100 cars annually. Before leading Lamborghini in India, Agarwal was head of sales at Audi India, where the Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker rose to become the country's number-one brand. Skoda Auto Volkswagen India confirms Agarwal’s exit In an official response, a Skoda Auto Volkswagen India spokesperson confirmed the development and said, “Škoda Auto Volkswagen India, with its five aspirational brands – Volkswagen, Škoda, Audi, Porsche, and Lamborghini, is committed to the Indian customers. Sharad Agarwal, the Brand Director of Lamborghini India, has decided to move from the Group after several years of service. We thank Sharad for his commitment and contribution in strengthening the Brand Lamborghini in India. We will announce his replacement in due course.” ‎ Agarwal, who started his career at TVS Motor Company, is seen as a turnaround specialist and has scaled up multiple businesses in his professional life of over two decades. This is sort of an homecoming for Agarwal, who had previously worked with the Mahindra Group. He was amongst the first lot of people who joined Mahindra’s First Choice Business and scaled the used car division to around 40,000 cars per annum in a segment that was beginning to witness the market getting organised. Agarwal spent over half a decade at Mahindra First Choice.
