Finished in Manilla Beige over Dark Brown MB-Tex upholstery, the car is powered by a 4.5-liter V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a dark brown soft top, a removable hardtop, 14″ Bundt alloy wheels, fog lights, a cassette stereo, electric windows, cruise control, and air conditioning. Work performed under current ownership is said to have included replacing the tires, brake pads, tie rods, and power steering pump. This R107 is offered with manufacturer’s literature, service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Manilla Beige (681) and features a color-matched removable hardtop and a dark brown convertible soft top. Additional exterior equipment includes fog lights, a power antenna, and chrome-accented bumpers and trim. There are tears in the soft top, per the seller, and there is a ding in the right rear quarter panel. Silver 14″ Bundt alloy wheels are fitted with Westlake tires that were mounted in 2024. The car was factory equipped with power steering and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. The seller states that the tie rods were replaced in 2024, and the brake pads were replaced in 2025. The two bucket seats are upholstered in Dark Brown MB-Tex, and interior amenities include a cassette stereo, electric windows, air conditioning, and cruise control. The seller states that the climate control servo requires replacement. The four-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including an 85-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, a clock, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 108k miles, approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership. The 4.5-liter V8 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and was factory rated at 160 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. The power steering pump was reportedly replaced in preparation for the sale. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. Manufacturer’s literature and service records are included in the sale. You are not connected to real-time updates.
