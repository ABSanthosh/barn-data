  "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GT is said to have been raced and used for track day events in Europe before being brought to the US in 2018 and subsequently underwent a multi-year build process commissioned by the selling dealer, 1600Veloce, from 2021 through 2024. Work involved a repaint in Giallo Fly and an interior re-trim in dark blue Poltrona Frau leather and gray Alcantara along with installation of a 2.0L Twin Spark inline-four and rebuilt five-speed manual transmission sourced from Alfaholics in the UK. The car rides on 15\" GTA-style wheels and features a stepped hood and wrap-around bumpers, while the cockpit is fitted with low-back Recaro seats accompanied by an OMP roll cage, a Hellebore steering wheel, and Veglia instrumentation. The engine is equipped with dual Weber 45 DCOE carburetors paired with Pipercross ram pipes, and further Alfaholics additions include a 3D-mapped ignition setup and stainless-steel exhaust along with their Fast Road Stage 3 suspension package, a big-brake kit with Superleggera calipers, and a race-spec limited-slip differential. This Stepnose is the 1,600th auction from our local partner, 1600veloce, and it is now offered with build records and a Wisconsin title.",

This Stepnose is the 1,600th auction from our local partner, 1600veloce, and it is now offered with build records and a Wisconsin title. Early 105-series Giulias featured a “stepnose” front as well as one-piece wraparound bumpers and lower rear wheel arches than later models. This example underwent a glass-out repaint in Giallo Fly, a Ferrari color, under current ownership in 2024. A bullet-style mirror is affixed to the driver-side door, and further details include a black finished grille, Carello headlamps, and pop-out rear side windows. The 15×7″ Alfaholics GTA-style wheels are mounted with 195/55 Yokohama Advan Neova Ad08 RS tires. The car was factory equipped with an independent double-wishbone setup with an anti-roll bar up front paired with a live axle, lower trailing arms, and a reaction trunnion out back. An Alfaholics Fast Road Stage 3 suspension kit with Bilstein shocks, lightweight spring pans and trailing arms, adjustable quick-ratio steering arms, and an aluminum T-bar was added as part of the build along with their big-brake upgrade featuring Superleggera calipers, slotted front rotors, drilled and slotted rear rotors, remote master cylinders, and braided lines. The Recaro bucket seats have been re-trimmed in dark blue Poltrona Frau leather, while gray Alcantara covers the headliner and dash. Matching leather and Alcantara extends to the OMP six-point roll cage as well as the custom door panels, and square weave carpets line the floors and custom rear bulkhead. Further details include a Blaupunkt push-button radio, a cabin heater, and gray lap belts. The Hellebore steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 220-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and water temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 68k kilometers (~42k miles). The Alfaholics Monza 2.0L Twin Spark inline-four was installed as part of the build. It is equipped with dual Weber 45 DCOE carburetors, Pipercross ram pipes, and an Alfaholics branded filter along with their 3D-mapped ignition kit and stainless-steel exhaust system. An aluminum radiator, a remote oil cooler, and an 80-amp alternator have also been added, and the battery has been relocated to the trunk. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a synchromesh five-speed manual transmission sourced from Alfaholics that was installed at the time of the engine change. It has been fitted with a REM-finished GTA gearset, and further Alfaholics upgrades include their production-spec quick-shift kit, race-spec selector rod, GTA-R steel selector forks, a Fast Road / Rally six-bolt clutch kit, and a race-spec limited-slip differential. The Wisconsin title carries “previously titled by: FN” and “this is a replacement title” notations in the Additional Vehicle Detail section. You are not connected to real-time updates.
