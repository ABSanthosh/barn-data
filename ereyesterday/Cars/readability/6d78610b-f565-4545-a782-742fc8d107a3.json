  "description": "In the ADV world, the GS moniker carries some serious baggage – but the good kind. A brand that’s instantly recognisable, even in the remotest of trails. But what if you want that GS clout without lugging around upwards of 250kg of flagship girth off-road? That’s where the F 900 GS rolls in. It costs Rs 1.25 lakh more than its predecessor and is now lighter, livelier, and loaded, but there’s also a bit of a catch. BMW F 900 GS design and quality (8/10) The F 900 is now more compact and lighter than its predecessor The F 850 GS looked like a skinnier F 850 GSA. The F 900 GS, however, comes across with a rally-raid aesthetic that looks even narrower and more focused. BMW has redesigned the fuel tank with plastic panels, resulting in a slimmer midsection. The entire silhouette looks leaner, and the motorcycle is now 14kg lighter than before. It appears someone has already kicked the indicator/brake light The bike is currently offered in two variants: Style Passion and Style GS Trophy. The Style Passion variant, which is the one tested here, features 20mm less suspension travel, a more accessible 835mm seat height, plastic handguards, a clear visor and misses out on a bash plate. For an additional Rs 25,000, you can opt for the Style GS Trophy variant, which offers 20mm more suspension travel, a taller 870mm seatheight, rugged metal handguards, a black tinted visor, and a slightly thicker, more comfortable seat. High quality and tactile switchgear make navigating the user interface a breeze While this motorcycle is specced out nicely, it misses out on the Enduro Pro Package available internationally. That would have included a 45mm fully adjustable Showa fork, a black handlebar with aluminium forged risers (20mm taller), and other enhancements that would’ve raised its off-road credentials. The new rally raid aesthetic looks more focused the F 850 GS Everything you see here is standard, except for the engine guard (Rs 40,000 extra). While the overall design is purposeful, the São Paulo Yellow paint may divide opinion. The headlight (same as the G 310 GS) could’ve been brighter, and the brake-light setup, which is integrated into the indicators, also looks like it could be a fall or an accidental snag away from a trip to the service centre. BMW F 900 GS position and comfort (7/10) Overall riding position is better suited for off-road riding The lower seat height of the Style Passion variant will help shorter riders, but this is still a tall bike. While the reach to the handlebar feels slightly stretched while seated, that same reach works well when you’re standing on the pegs. Seat padding and comfort could have been better The tank is now narrower, the seat more rally-style, and the overall ergonomics are off-road-biased. While standing on the pegs feels natural and confident, long-distance comfort is compromised. Another thing worth mentioning is that while the seat height is lower, the seat padding is also thinner, which eventually results in saddle soreness. It isn’t very pillion-friendly either. The advantage of this firm seat is that standing up from it feels a lot easier, but it will come at the cost of long-distance comfort. If height isn’t a concern, pay the extra money and get the GS Trophy variant instead Range is another limitation. The new tank holds 14.5 litres – half a litre less than before. Compared to the F 900 GS Adventure’s 23-litre tank, the standard F 900 GS will likely cover under 300km on a full tank. The lack of grab rails and mounting points also hurt its touring credentials. BMW does offer panniers and luggage racks, but these are optional extras that could set you back over a lakh. BMW F 900 GS performance and refinement (9/10) It has more performance and better refinement than the model it replaces Under the skin, BMW has worked on the old 853cc motor, bumping displacement to 895cc. It now makes 10hp and 1Nm more than before. Fire it up, and the engine has a bit more character, thanks in part to the standard Akrapovič can. Akrapovic exhaust looks great but not much louder than stock On the move, the bike feels livelier across the rev range. The broader torque spread allows for easy chugging in higher gears and confident overtakes. There’s no explosive top end, but the mid-range is very strong, perfect for trails and highway cruising. The F900 GS's motor is pretty refined at triple digit cruising speeds Despite its upright stance, the F 900 GS is deceptively quick and will get into high triple-digit territory with ease. Above 160kph, the blocky Metzeler Karoo 4 tyres become the limiting factor. City commutes don’t reveal much heat despite the season, and it shouldn’t be a problem in traffic. Punchy motor and well calibrated electronics ensure controlled slides Hit the dirt, and power delivery is strong but predictable, with plenty of bottom-end grunt to crawl up rocky climbs or make any overtakes on highways. The off-road traction control system also works well, enabling plenty of slide, but not too much. The six-speed gearbox is slick, but the bi-directional quickshifter requires a firmer foot, especially with standard road boots. It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals. BMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10) It handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage There has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS. It still retains that familiar, planted GS feel, but now with more willingness to play. Despite the knobby tyres the F 900 GS handles rather well At 226kg, it’s not light by enduro standards, but its weight is so well-balanced that it never feels intimidating. The suspension has a soft baseline tune but can feel firm over sharp bumps. Meanwhile, there’s not much you can do about the front on the Style variant as rebound and preload adjustability can only be tweaked at the rear. The F900 GS feels right at home off-road The GS Trophy variant gets an additional 20mm of travel and would be a better pick for serious trail work. Even in this spec, though, the F 900 GS manages light to moderate trails quite well, and it’s predictable and easy to handle on loose surfaces. While there is a lack of feedback, the F 900 GS is quite eager to fall into corners Enduro Pro mode is the only fully customisable mode, and, even with traction control on, it rarely cuts in unnecessarily. ABS, however, cannot be fully switched off at the front, and there were a few instances of it intervening unexpectedly. Early signs of wear are a bit concerning On the road, the bike feels surprisingly light and easy to filter through traffic. Around corners, the chassis feels composed, but the Karoo 4s start to show their dual-purpose nature. These tyres work well off-road but wear quickly, with significant wear already visible with less than 3,000km on the odo. BMW F 900 GS features and safety (8/10) The F900 GS has a whole host of electronic aids that can be fine tuned to suit your style It features a crisp and clear 6.5-inch TFT with an easy to read and use layout. Additionally, this TFF supports Bluetooth connectivity and other app based features. As standard, the F 900 GS gets four riding modes (Rain, Road, Enduro and Enduro Pro). The best TFT in its class with an excellent layout While the other modes cannot be tweaked, the Enduro Pro mode is the only one that allows you to fine tune its parameters. Additionally, this model also gets heated grips for India which should be handy in colder parts of our country. The F 900 GS also gets adjustable gearshift and brake levers to suit riders of different shapes and sizes.  BMW F 900 GS price and verdict (9/10) The F 900 GS significantly under cuts its closest rivals BMW hasn’t just added 50cc and changed the paint; it’s a proper evolution of the F 850 GS. With sharper handling, better ergonomics, and stronger mid-range performance, this is a much more focused machine than its predecessor. Even without the international-spec Showa fork or Enduro Pro pack, the Indian version remains a well-equipped and versatile ADV, especially for those who prefer trails to tarmac. Factor in BMW’s aggressive pricing, despite being a CBU, and this bike undercuts its key rival. If you prefer broken trails and dirt roads over well paved tarmac, the F 900 GS is one to consider If you were to throw in the extra Rs 25,000 to get the top variant and spec in some accessory extras, you’d still manage to undercut the Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro and the Ducati Desert X by a fair margin. If road touring is your goal, BMW has you covered with the F 900 GS Adventure. But if you’re after a lighter, more playful GS that still carries the badge’s spirit, the F 900 GS, particularly in GS Trophy trim, might just be your Goldilocks bike.

It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIt handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS.
