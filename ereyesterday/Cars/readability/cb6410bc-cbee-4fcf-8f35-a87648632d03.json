  "description": "The Nissan X-Trail hasn’t exactly set the sales charts on fire. Launched in August 2024 at Rs 49.92 lakh, the X-Trail was brought in as a CBU, contributing to the high asking price for this 7-seat SUV. We can now confirm that zero-mileage Nissan X-Trail units are available at premium used car dealer Big Boy Toyz (BBT) for a whopping Rs 20.42 lakh less (about 40 percent) – at Rs 29.50 lakh. Nissan despatched 37 X-Trails to its dealers in 8 months   Price tag and features list among the reasons for slow sales BBT has an X-Trail on sale with more equipment Why does the new Nissan X-Trail get a 40 percent discount 80 X-Trails acquired by Big Boy Toyz Based on SIAM data, Nissan despatched 37 units of the X-Trail to its dealerships across the country between August 2024 and March 2025; that’s just 37 of the 150 units originally imported into India in the span of 8 months. Sources tell us that BBT has acquired around 80 MY2024 units through a third-party wholesaler, though a few units of the X-Trail are also available at Nissan’s own dealerships. When we reached out to Nissan India for a comment, a spokesperson said, “Bulk queries and corporate deals for products are a normal industry practice through authorised dealer partners, and the details of the same remain confidential.” High price, lack of features and seemingly low output figures contribute to the X-Trail’s dismal sales Among the reasons for the slow sales of the Nissan X-Trail are its price tag and the relative lack of features for something this pricey – the international-spec model gets leather upholstery, a larger touchscreen, power-adjustable front seats, ventilated seats, a powered tailgate and an ADAS suite. Most of these features are also seen on 7-seat SUV rivals like the Skoda Kodiaq (Rs 46.89 lakh-48.69 lakh) and Jeep Meridian (Rs 27.80 lakh-38.79 lakh*), both of which are priced lower. Considering the imported X-Trail was not meant to be a volume seller, a better-specced version for our market would have helped the SUV's image and, perhaps, its sales.  Another reason for the dismal sales figures is the image of the 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine – its 163hp and 300Nm output figures sound disappointing on paper. However, our X-Trail review found that it’s smooth and refined. In addition, the high-tech powertrain features a variable compression ratio, which never leaves us wanting power while still delivering an appreciable fuel economy. Nissan X-Trail on sale at Big Boy Toyz X-Trail inventory at Gurugram office, though deliveries are pan-India One model available with BBT gets a larger touchscreen and premium upholstery. Speaking of the lack of features, one of the X-Trail units displayed on BBT’s site has been upgraded with a larger 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen (the standard models get an 8-inch unit) and beige leather upholstery. Interestingly, it is priced at the same Rs 29.50 lakh as the model without the additional features. A BBT sales representative also confirmed that while the X-Trail units acquired have been stocked at the company’s Gurugram office, deliveries are available pan-India. *7-seat variants only; 5-seat Meridian priced at Rs 24.99 lakh-28.79 lakh. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
