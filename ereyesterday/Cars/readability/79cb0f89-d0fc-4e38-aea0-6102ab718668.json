  "text": "Restoring a motorcycle can seem like a mundane task compared to customizing one. But it can also be very rewarding, especially when you’re restoring the right bike for the right person. This 1970s Honda Dax comes from the fine folks at Australia’s Purpose Built Moto. Although the Gold Coast workshop relishes custom projects, the opportunity to restore the tired Dax back to its former glory was too good to resist. It also helped that the bike’s owner was already a customer… and friend. “Jake is a well-known local bloke and a great guy all around,” says Tom Gilroy, PBM shop boss. “I often see him and his wife out for a walk with their dog.” “The backstory on this bike is that Jake uses it to run up to the shops for late-night snacks, grab a coffee, or even pick up a beer on Sundays, hooning around Mermaid Beach and generally keeping his neighbors on their toes. Before that, the bike was owned by his wife as a kid and had always been in her family. So Jake decided to restore the bike to pristine condition as a surprise for her (at least, that’s how he got the green light to start the project).” “Though the Honda Dax wasn’t my ideal candidate for a restoration job, I know Jake doesn’t cut corners on his builds, and he’d want this bike done right with all the sensible upgrades. How could I say no to a guy like that?” Known as the Honda CT70, Trail 70, or Mini-Trail in some countries, the appeal of the Dax’s quirky aesthetic transcends generations. From its pressed steel frame, to its chunky seat and mini-ape bars, it’s an adorable mini-bike that has spawned countless knock-offs. (No wonder Honda now makes a modernized version of it.) As rad as mini-bikes are, 70 cubic centimeters can only provide so much fun. So PBM’s first job was to overhaul the engine with a 110 cc kit from Japan. Only the crankcases and transmission remain from the original engine—the crank, piston, head, and ignition were all upgraded. The engine parts were vapor-blasted before being polished or resprayed as needed. The ‘new’ engine is protected by the Dax’s original crash bars and sump guard. Next, the crew sourced an aftermarket stainless steel exhaust that would do the new motor justice, modifying it to mimic the routing of the OEM pipe. Once that was done, they smoothed out the welds and had everything chromed for a period-correct look. Most of PBM’s effort went into undoing the years of use and abuse that the Dax had survived. “Although it was a kid’s bike in the 80s,” says Tom, “no doubt the uncles and dads of the family would’ve had a few beers at the BBQ, built a makeshift ramp with some planks and bricks, and sent it around the backyard. At least that’s how I grew up.” Many parts needed painstaking repair and restoration work, including the fenders, foot peg mounts, handlebars, and several smaller bits that would take days to list. PBM rebuilt the forks and triple clamps, too, along with the Dax’s wheels. “As they’d suffered some pitting and corrosion in the past,” says Tom, “we split the three-piece wheels, polished the hubs, and chromed the steel rim halves.” PBM also threw some aftermarket parts in the mix—like their own Scrambler mirrors, and a vintage headlight eyelid that’s adorned with a chrome die-cast Honda wing. “We’re not restoring a factory Dax here; we’re recreating someone’s childhood memories,” Tom adds. “Details like these little trinkets count for a lot.” Timeless Auto Trim stepped in, creating a seat cover that looks brand new while echoing the style of the original. Regular PBM collaborator Justin at Pop Bang Classics handled the paint job, mixing the colors by eye to capture a teal hue reminiscent of the Dax’s glory days. Aiming for perfection, Tom made sure that every part was refinished—most of them in chrome. “As we started putting everything together,” says Tom, “seeing these elements come together got the whole team—and anyone visiting the shop—excited for the end result. These bikes just have something endearing about them. They look like fun.” “Finishing up the build and hearing the fresh engine crackle to life through the new stainless exhaust, we had to take turns cutting laps around the car park and enjoying this little beauty. Anyone who sees this thing on the road can’t help but smile (and probably feel a little jealous).” “Reviving a childhood memory for Jake’s wife was a fun process, especially seeing the look on his face during his visits to the shop—and his wife’s reaction when it was delivered.” Purpose Built Moto | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Tristan Tolley \u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003e/iframe\u0026gt;",
