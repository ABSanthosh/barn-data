  "text": "Faraday Future is not exactly a household name nowadays, but one of only 16 cars the company sold is now up for sale!If you're familiar with obscure electric startups, you likely know about Faraday Future. What started in 2014 as one of those companies with big dreams and a name calling back to one of the titans of electricity, is now a company that will reportedly focus on selling rebadged Chinese vans.Their initial product, the FF 91, is like a long crossover, not-quite-minivan, thing with a starting price of $249,000 for the base model and $309,000 for the limited edition FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance edition. That latter one was going to be limited to 300 units, although as of January 2025, only 16 cars were ever delivered by Faraday Future.2023 Faraday Future FF 91 2.0 Futurist AlliancePrivateCollectionMotors/Bring a Trailer #5 of 300 can now be yours!The better news is that now you have the chance to buy one of those elusive 16 examples on Bring a Trailer with no reserve! This black FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance model is #5 of the 300 that were planned, and shows 6,200 miles on the odometer. Whether it was used by a company executive or as some sort of demo car is unknown.The FF 91 is powered by three electric motors, a liquid-cooled 142.0-kWh battery pack, and a direct-drive system capable of a reported 1,050 hp and 1,458 lb-ft of torque. The EPA gave it an estimated range of 381 mi and a 0–60 mph time of 2.27 seconds, making it a rather speedy footnote in EV history.Inside is where the luxury really takes hold, with 11 screens, power-operated heated, ventilated, and massaging seats, and the company's so-called  “Zero Gravity” rear seats.2023 Faraday Future FF 91 2.0 Futurist AlliancePrivateCollectionMotors/Bring a Trailer The FF 91 did not hold back on the AITech in the FF 91 is aplenty, as one would expect from a car of this nature. Apart from Faraday Future’s “All-Terrain AI Body Control Technology” system, which reportedly uses AI to improve the car's off-road handling,  other standard features include emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and smart parking systems.The automaker also emphasized the inclusion of the \"FF aiHyper 6x4 Architecture 2.0 operating system,\" a mouthful that would eventually give the FF 91 autonomous capabilities and other AI-powered amenities. However, it's likely safe to say that the FF 91 won't be getting any OTA updates anytime soon.2023 Faraday Future FF 91 2.0 Futurist AlliancePrivateCollectionMotors/Bring a Trailer Final thoughtsBuying such a technologically advanced car that is no longer being produced, from a company that could go bankrupt at any second is a scary undertaking, to put it mildly. This FF 91 is something you buy to either drive until it dies and then keep on display or something that you're intimately familiar with and can repair when it breaks.One commenter who used to work at Faraday Future even mentioned that the car uses a lot of bespoke components right down to the door projecting lights. This isn't a project for the faint of heart.Not many people can say they own a Faraday Future FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance, though, and this one ends in three days with a $44,444 bid. We're curious to see where this one ends up.2023 Faraday Future FF 91 2.0 Futurist AlliancePrivateCollectionMotors/Bring a Trailer Love reading Autoblog?
