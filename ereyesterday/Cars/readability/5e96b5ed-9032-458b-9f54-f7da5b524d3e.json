  "text": "Power is provided by a 6.7-liter Power Stroke V8 with 500 hp and 1,200 lb-ft of torque, but there's a lot more to this build 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The pickup rocks a set of 20-inch wheels and a set of huge 46-inch Michelin wheels. MegaRexx has added new Icon springs and Fox Racing front and rear shocks. Plenty of new body panels also make this F-250 stand out from any other. When it comes to upgrading Ford F-Series trucks, the aftermarket world offers nearly endless possibilities. Whether owners are after more horsepower or off-road upgrades that could make even the toughest trail seem like a Sunday drive, there’s no shortage of companies eager to make it happen. But if there’s one name that consistently stands out when it comes to truly transforming these trucks, it’s MegaRexx Trucks out of North Dakota. Read: MegaRexx’s SVN Custom Is A Wild Family Hauler With Ten Seats For years, the company has been building some of the craziest Fords on the market, and this is its latest project. Based on an F-250 Crew Cab Lariat, it looks like a miniature monster truck that’s ready to conquer the Dakar Rally. MegaRexx’s changes start with the bodywork. The original bumpers have been removed and replaced with steel ones, drastically improving the truck’s approach and departure angles. Further building on that are 4.5-inch Icon springs at the front and 5-inch leaf springs at the rear, complemented with Fox Racing 2.5 front and rear shocks with remote reservoirs. New radius arms, adjustable track bars, and dual steering stabilizers have allowed for the fitment of new 20-inch three-piece wheels clad in a set of huge 46-inch Michelin XZL tires. These make the 37-inch rubber of even a stock Bronco Raptor seem small. The tuner has also crafted a new grille and hood for the F-250 while also adding custom front and rear quarter panels. The latter, by the way, include flared fenders that are a massive 9 inches wider on each side than stock. There’s also a new cage in the bed, a 40-inch LED light bar, and fittingly, a train horn. Unless you’re more than six feet tall, you’d probably have no chance of actually climbing inside this thing, so MegaRexx has added retractable side steps. As for power, this thing rocks Ford’s 6.7-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 that churns out 500 hp and 1,200 lb-ft (1,626 Nm) of torque. All in all, this looks like the attempt to turn a humble workhorse into an off-roading powerhouse is a success. We can’t be 100 percent sure, of course, since we haven’t driven it, but based on the spec sheet, it should be nigh unstoppable off the beaten track. Photos MegRexx",
