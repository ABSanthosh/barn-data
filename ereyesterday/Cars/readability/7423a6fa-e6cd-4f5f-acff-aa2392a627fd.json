  "description": "The Toyota Corolla Cross – essentially an SUV based on the popular Corolla (sold as a hatchback and sedan in select markets) – has received a facelift and a sportier GR Sport variant. This is the second facelift for the Corolla Cross in as many years, and the first time the SUV has been offered in a sportier GR variant. Corolla Cross facelift gets minor exterior and interior changes GR Sport gets mechanical and design changes 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross facelift: exterior and interior changes 2025 facelift gets new LED light signatures and a new front grille Compared to the model revealed in February last year, the 2025 Corolla Cross features minor design changes. The headlights and tail-lamps now have new DRL signatures, the front bumper gets a new mesh design, and the headlights are now connected by an illuminated bar, on which sits the Toyota logo. The side profile is also the same as the outgoing model, except for the new 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels. Centre console sees biggest updates On the inside, the updates are subtle as well. The facelift features new AC controls, a new gear shift knob, and a larger centre console, which incorporates an additional smartphone storage area, a sliding storage box, and revised cup holders. As before, the 10.5-inch infotainment touchscreen and the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster remain, along with features like a Level 2 ADAS suite, a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, a heated steering wheel, and seat heating. No mechanical changes There are no mechanical changes compared to its predecessor, with the Toyota Corolla Cross being offered with two hybrid powertrains: a 140hp, 1.8-litre petrol-electric (Hybrid 140) and a 197hp, 2.0-litre petrol-electric (Hybrid 200). The 2.0-litre powertrain also comes with an AWD option, which now features a Snow mode, previously unavailable on the Corolla Cross. Toyota claims a 0 to 100kph time of 9.9 seconds for the Hybrid 140, 7.6 seconds for the FWD Hybrid 200, and 7.5 seconds for the AWD Corolla Cross. 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross GR Sport: exterior and interior changes GR Sport gets larger alloys, exclusive exterior colour and sportier interior theme On the outside, the sportier GR Sport variant gets all-black 19-inch alloy wheels, a sharper nose and more aggressive bumpers, along with an exclusive Storm Grey and black dual-tone exterior finish. Naturally, GR logos also feature on the front grille and on the tailgate. The interior of the GR Sport features Brin-Naub upholstery, which is a suede-like synthetic leather, long with contrasting red stitching and GR logos.   2025 Toyota Corolla Cross GR Sport: mechanical changes It gets a more aggressive Sport mode and lowered suspension Compared to the standard Corolla Cross, the GR Sport variant has been lowered by 10mm. The Sport mode for the e-CVT gearbox gets a more aggressive setting while accelerating and decelerating. Toyota Corolla Cross India launch plans shelved The previous Toyota Corolla Cross was under consideration for an India launch. Codenamed 340 D and also known as the Toyota C SUV at the time, the brand was evaluating a rollout from its Karnataka plant for June 2026. It should be noted that the Corolla Cross and the Innova Hycross, currently on sale in India, share the same modular TNGA-C platform. However, the potential annual volume of 75,000 units did not meet the technical commercial viability for Toyota, which is why the Corolla Cross hasn’t made it to our shores.
