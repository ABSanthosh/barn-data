Modifications include a rebuilt six-speed transaxle fitted with 997 Cup gearing as well as a lightweight flywheel, a GT3 RS 4.0L clutch, an OS Giken limited-slip differential, 996 Cup shifter cables, a Function-First shift-rite solution, CSF radiators, revised engine and transaxle mounts, Tarett Engineering adjustable rear toe links, Öhlins Road and Track coilovers, RS-style front bumper vents, and a rear decklid scoop. Finished in Arctic Silver Metallic over black leather, the car is powered by a 3.6-liter Metzger flat-six and is equipped with 18″ alloy wheels, a lower aero package, xenon headlights, a fixed rear wing, power-adjustable sport seats, automatic climate control, extended leather and carbon-fiber trim, Guards Red seat belts, and a factory CD stereo. This GT3 has 34k miles and is offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Massachusetts title. The car is finished in Arctic Silver Metallic with black vinyl stripes and features revised aerodynamic lower bodywork and a fixed rear wing. Additional exterior details include xenon headlights with washers as well as smoked corner markers, power-adjustable side mirrors, an aftermarket decklid scoop, and dual exhaust outlets. RS-style vents are cut into the front bumper cover, and the center radiator mounts have been modified to make the vents functional. Paint protection film is applied to the front bumper cover, hood, headlights, fenders, rockers, A-pillars, and the leading edge of the roof, and paint meter readings from around the car are presented in the gallery. Staggered-width 18″ GT3 wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires manufactured in 2023 and 2024. The suspension is modified with Tarett Engineering adjustable rear toe links and Öhlins Road \u0026 Track coilovers. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over a cross-drilled rotor at each corner. Work since 2019 included replacing the front lower control arms, sway bar end links, wheel bearings, brake calipers, and brake rotors. The power-adjustable sport seats are trimmed in black leather that extends to the dashboard, vent trim, center console, and door panels. The front headrests are debossed with Porsche crests and the center console armrest is debossed with a GT3 logo. Appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, a carbon-fiber shift knob, parking brake lever, and sill plates, Guards Red seat belts, and a factory CD stereo. Shift cables from a 996 Cup and a Function-First Shift-Rite solution were installed on the factory shifter in 2019. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer with an 8,200-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer and gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 34k miles. The 3.6-liter flat-six was factory rated at 375 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque and is equipped with a two-stage resonance intake system, dry-sump lubrication, VarioCam variable valve timing, and titanium connecting rods. Work since 2019 included installing a 997 GT3 alternator, front and side CSF aluminum radiators, 9964/993 RS engine mounts, and replacing the following components: Water pump Thermostat Coolant expansion tank Coolant hoses Heater hoses Serpentine belt tensioner Idler pulley All four oxygen sensors Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a lightweight flywheel, a clutch sourced from a GT3 RS 4.0L, and a six-speed manual transaxle. The transaxle was rebuilt in 2019 by G Box in Erie, Colorado with steel synchros, an OS Giken 24-plate limited-slip differential, and third, fourth, fifth, and sixth gears sourced from a 997 Cup car. It was reinstalled using 997 GT3 mounts with polyurethane inserts. GT2 riveted brake ducts and red trailer tie-down anchors are fitted to the underside and additional photos are presented in the gallery. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: C02 – Version for US XKL – Leather speaker covers XMZ – Leather center console XNG – Leather-covered instrument frame XNN – Leather center air vent bracket XNU – Leather dashboard trim strip XSC – Porsche crests debossed in headrests XJ4 – Leather-covered ignition surround XN3 – Leather dashboard side air vent XV1 – Leather defroster trim X47 – Carbon shift knob X58 – Carbon handbrake lever X69 – Carbon sill plates with logo X71 – Aluminum-look instrument dials 288 – Headlamp washer The Carfax report is free of accidents and other damage and lists history in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts.
