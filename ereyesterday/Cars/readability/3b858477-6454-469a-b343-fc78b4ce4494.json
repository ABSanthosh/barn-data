  "description": "This 1956 Austin-Healey 100 BN2 roadster was refurbished in the early 2000s, and it was purchased by the current owner on BaT in August 2022. Finished in red and black over red leather upholstery with white piping, the car is powered by a 2,660cc inline-four mated to a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Equipment includes 15″ wire wheels, a black removable soft top, a tilting windscreen, a louvered hood, dual SU H6 carburetors, a Denis Welch Motorsport aluminum cylinder head, a Moto-Lita steering wheel, and lap belts. The cylinder head was resurfaced in May 2025, and other work involved replacing the head gasket, starter solenoid, fuel pump, battery, a tie-rod-end boot, and a rear-axle seal as well as rewiring the voltage regulator and installing a heater valve. This BN2 is now offered on dealer consignment with recent service records, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean Oregon title in the owner's name.",

This BN2 is now offered on dealer consignment with recent service records, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean Oregon title in the owner’s name. The body was repaired and refinished in red and black circa 2005, according to the previous seller. The louvered hood is secured by a leather strap. Other equipment includes a removable black soft top, a tilting windscreen, and chrome bumpers with overriders. Silver-painted 15″ knock-off wire wheels wear 165SR15 Michelin XZX tires that were mounted in April 2022. Braking is handled by drums at each corner. A tie-rod-end boot and a rear-axle seal were replaced in May 2025. The bucket seats have been retrimmed in red leather with white piping, Equipment includes red carpeting, lap belts, a heater, a passenger grab bar, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, and door-panel pockets. The Moto-Lita wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 81k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 2,660cc inline-four is equipped with dual SU H6 carburetors. A rebuild in 2009 included balancing the rotating assembly, replacing the cylinder liners, and installing a Denis Welch Motorsport aluminum cylinder head as well as a 100M-specification camshaft and pistons. Service in May 2025 involved resurfacing the cylinder head, rewiring the voltage regulator, installing a heater valve, and replacing the head gasket, starter solenoid, fuel pump, and battery, the seller tells us.
