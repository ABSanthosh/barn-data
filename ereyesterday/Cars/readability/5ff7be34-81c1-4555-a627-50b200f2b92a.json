Yet, someone found a way to relax in the EV and let its semi-autonomous systems do the driving. A few years ago, Tesla was being fiercely criticized for rolling out driver-assistance technologies without any effective driver-monitoring system. It didn’t take long before videos emerged of drivers sleeping behind the wheel, putting all their faith in the car’s onboard systems and sensors. Tesla eventually introduced driver monitoring, but based on a recent clip that surfaced on Reddit, it doesn’t stop some from behaving irresponsibly. The video, filmed on a highway somewhere in the States, shows a red Tesla Model 3 cruising along with a sunshield completely blocking the windshield. It seems as if the driver decided it would be a good idea to have a rest and let the car do all of the driving. Watch: Video Shows Tesla Mistaking Teddy Bear For A Driver And Hitting A (Fake) Kid In the clip, the Model 3 can be seen driving in the center of the highway and at one stage, approaches a slower-moving Toyota Prius and automatically changes lanes. It then cruises past the occupants of the car filming and it looks as though the owner has stuck old newspaper to the side windows to block out as much of the sun as possible. We don’t actually get a chance to see the driver. It’s hard to know how the driver has managed to trick the car’s monitoring system. There are devices sold online that clip onto the steering wheel and apply enough torque to it, allowing for a ‘hands-free’ experience. However, all Model 3s are fitted with a cabin camera that’s used to determine driver inattentiveness and provide audible warnings to remind drivers to keep their eyes on the road when Autopilot is engaged. In theory, this should be enough to prevent drivers from doing things as dangerous as this. Video Reddit The motorists who filmed this Tesla Model 3 noted the car’s license plate and, hopefully, alerted the appropriate authorities to what they’d seen. While Tesla’s marketing of Autopilot and its Full-Self Driving systems has long been controversial, owners need to remember that even with these technologies enabled, they must remain attentive at all times.
