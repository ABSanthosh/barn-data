  "text": "The injured man drove himself to a hospital and was treated and released March 31, 2025 at 20:34 by Michael Gauthier A Trump supporter was attacked at a Tesla protest in Idaho over the weekend. A 70-year-old man allegedly hit a 49-year-old with his car, after making an “obscene gesture.” The elderly man was arrested and is now facing charges of aggravated battery. Last weekend’s Tesla Takedown was the largest yet with over 200 scheduled events taking place across the country as well as internationally in Australia, France, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom. While many of these protests appear to have been peaceful, things took an ugly turn in Meridian, Idaho. According to NBC News, approximately 30 protesters and 200 supporters converged at a Tesla dealership in the city on Saturday. While specifics are hazy, a 49-year-old reportedly arrived on the scene in a truck decked out in “pro-Trump flags.” More: Trump Supporter Pulls Taser At Tesla Protesters, But Grandma Isn’t Having It The unnamed man then parked and left his vehicle. Shortly thereafter, 70-year-old Christopher Talbot allegedly made an “obscene gesture” and struck the man with his car. This appears to have happened at low speeds as the victim was able to drive himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated and released. Talbot was arrested and reportedly charged with aggravated battery. According to the Schofield and Young law firm, aggravated battery is a felony that is punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment as well as a $50,000 (£38,708 / €46,216) fine. The department asked witnesses to come forward and reminded people to “respect everyone’s right to protest and express their 1st Amendment Rights without resorting to violence.” Earlier this month, there was a similar, but less severe incident, where a Florida man reportedly drove his Nissan onto a sidewalk and into a crowd of protestors at slow speed. No one was injured in that incident, but it resulted in charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent.",
