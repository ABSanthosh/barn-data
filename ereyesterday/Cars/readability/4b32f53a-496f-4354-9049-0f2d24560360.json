  "text": "May 26, 2025 3:31 AM EDTAt first glance, the Bovensiepen Zagato may seem like just another BMW M4 Convertible. But under the skin – and all around it – is something far more exotic. It boasts the familiar firepower of BMW’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, now tuned to deliver an impressive 602 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. That’s more oomph and grunt than the track-hardened M4 CSL.  Launching from 0 to 62 mph in just 3.3 seconds and topping beyond 186 mph, it’s a quick drop-top grand tourer edging into supercar territory. Helping it stick to the road is a set of Bilstein Damptronic adaptive dampers, while a featherweight titanium Akrapovič exhaust ensures it sings an appropriately operatic tune. Styled By Zagato With A Bespoke Carbon Fiber Suit But the mechanical upgrades are only half the story. What truly sets this machine apart is its Italian suit. Almost every panel has been reworked, now draped in carbon fiber and capped with Zagato’s signature double-bubble roof. The traditional BMW kidney grille has been reimagined in CNC-machined stainless steel with a honeycomb pattern. A re-sculpted trunk lid gives the rear a tasteful ducktail spoiler, while 20-inch forged aluminum wheels fill the arches with precision and poise. Step inside, and the fusion continues. The familiar BMW layout remains intact, but Bovensiepen has transformed the surfaces with bespoke craftsmanship. Lavalina leather, also used by Alpina, wraps nearly every touchpoint, and buyers can further elevate the cabin with Alcantara accents. Over 130 hours are spent perfecting the interior alone, which is offered in 16 standard colors. For those with more specific tastes, the Bovensiepen Bespoke program opens the door to tailor-made hues and finishes. Made By Alpina Founders Though BMW stole headlines at Lake Como’s Villa d’Este with its Speedtop concept and the latest M2 CS, it’s this Italo-German hybrid that quietly turned heads. Bovensiepen, founded by Andreas and Florian Bovensiepen, sons of Alpina’s legendary founder, marks its debut with the Zagato, a coachbuilt collaboration with the famed Italian design house bearing its name. With Alpina now under BMW’s direct umbrella, Bovensiepen seems poised to carry the torch of boutique craftsmanship and exclusivity. Production numbers and pricing remain under wraps until later this year, but don’t expect this exotic convertible to come cheap. With over 250 hours of work poured into each unit, a cabin fit for a Milan fashion house, and performance that rivals purpose-built sports cars, the Zagato will likely command a price well beyond regular BMWs. Deliveries are scheduled for the second quarter of 2026.",
