Powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, the car has 1,200 miles and is further equipped with Satin Silver 20″ forged aluminum wheels, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, a rear diffuser, six-point harness anchors, and orange brake calipers. This Ford GT is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title in the owner’s name. First unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show, the second-generation GT was built by Multimatic of Markham, Ontario, with production beginning in December 2016. This example is finished in Ingot Silver with over-the-top Competition Orange stripes. Additional details include LED headlights, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, LED taillights, a rear diffuser, and gloss carbon-fiber exterior trim. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Variable ride height, front-axle lift system, selectable driving modes, and launch control are standard features. Staggered-width 20″ forged aluminum wheels finished in Satin Silver are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by orange-painted Brembo six-piston monoblock calipers over 15.5” carbon-ceramic discs up front, while four-piston calipers are mounted over 14.1” units out back. A power steering line has been replaced, per the seller. The cabin was optioned with the Dark Energy Interior Upgrade package and features black leather over the Sparco seats with manually reclining carbon-fiber shells. Exposed carbon fiber is visible on the door sills, dashboard, door panels, and center console. The fixed-position driver seat is paired with an adjustable pedal box and steering column, and additional equipment includes automatic climate control, six-point harness anchors, and a touchscreen infotainment system. The leather-wrapped F-1-inspired steering wheel fronts anodized black aluminum paddle shifters and a configurable digital instrument panel. The digital odometer indicates 1,200 miles, all of which were added during current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 features a carbon-fiber engine cover and was factory rated at 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Carbon-fiber aero panels are fitted fore and aft.
