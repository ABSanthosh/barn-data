  "text": "Here are all the details about the most outrageous Jeep Wrangler ever made December 21, 2024 at 19:10 by Stephen Rivers The Rubicon 392 Final Edition is the ultimate version of Jeep’s icon.  As you may have noticed, we recently reviewed the V8-powered Wrangler.  Before driving it, we took your questions and today, we’re giving you answers.  The Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 Final Edition makes a statement. It’s something obvious and that happens even before you drive it. After a week of testing it, we called it the silliest Jeep ever made. Before we drove it, we asked you what you wanted to know about this six-figure rock crawler. Today, we give you answers here and in a short video below.  Should It Be a Hybrid? The first question we’ll discuss is perhaps an odd one. Should this Jeep actually be a hybrid rather than a gas-only big V8? After all, hybrids provide better fuel economy. That means that they’ll usually cost less to run. In addition, many hybrids can offer as much, if not more, power than a gas-only alternative.  Review: Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 Final Edition Is A Muscle Car That Can Rock Crawl In reality, the Hemi feels like the right choice here for several reasons. That’s mostly because it gives this Wrangler something no other one can claim: an air of fun everywhere it goes. This is, after all, the flagship version, so fun has to be a part of the DNA.  Would this SUV be more eco-friendly as a hybrid? Absolutely. Would it be as fun to drive on everyday roads? Not remotely. That feeling of having fun in a Jeep on public roads isn’t something that the brand has ever offered to the degree with which it does in the Wrangler 392. Besides, if you prioritize fuel economy over fun, and still want Jeep’s icon, there’s always the 4xe plug-in hybrid in the range. What’s the Top Speed? Someone else asked, what is the top speed? Jeep says that this Wrangler will go 112 mph (180 km/h). Whether or not that’s true I wasn’t able to find out legally, but I can assure you that it’ll do at least that provided that the gearing allows for it. In addition, it’s worth noting how well it accelerates too.  Jeep says it’ll go from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in just 5.5 seconds. On BFGoodrich K02 tires I sincerely didn’t think it would be easy to manage that feat. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Not only did the Wrangler 392 do exactly that time to 60 mph, but it did it multiple times during testing. That’s genuinely impressive for a car like this.  Does It Feel Like a $100,000 Car? Finally, the tough question: does it feel like you’re driving a $100,000 car? Put simply, no. But keep in mind that in the world of six-figure cars, the overwhelming majority place an emphasis on comfort or on-road performance over everything else. The Wrangler 392 Final Edition is very unique in that it focuses on blending on- and off-road performance in a way not really available anywhere else. Got More Questions? Something like the Land Rover Defender X might be the closest one could get in terms of price and capability. Even then, the Defender starts at $93,425, comes with a V6, and is slower. Those are the answers to your questions. If you have more, leave them below and we’ll answer them there!
