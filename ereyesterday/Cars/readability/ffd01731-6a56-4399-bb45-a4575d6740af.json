However, it’s not the kind the brand wants as its tiny frunk has become an online joke. The electric E5 Sportback will be launched in China this summer offering up to 776 hp. Audi’s AUDI, which, ironically, is not an Audi, has always struck us as a bit ridiculous, and that seems to be a theme for the model. Not only does it sport a name that sounds like it was picked by the least imaginative people on Earth, but it also comes with a ridiculously small frunk. How small? Roughly the size of a shoe box judging by an image that has surfaced on social media. While there’s no immediate word on its dimensions or capacity, opening the hood reveals a large expanse of black plastic. In the center is a small opening, which appears to be carpeted and barely useful. More: Audi’s AUDI Launches 770 HP Wagon Most Of The World Will Never See While some frunk is better than no frunk at all, the AUDI E5 Sportback’s compartment is far from impressive. This helps to explain the strong reaction on social media. Set to be launched in China this summer, the E5 Sportback is a glorified wagon that lacks a four-ring logo. The model also features a “reinterpretation of the familiar Singleframe” grille with a Light Frame surround. The latter consists of more than 1,000 individual lights and they’re joined by Matrix LED headlights. Other notable highlights include digital side mirrors and frameless doors. In terms of size, the model measures 192.2 inches (4,881 mm) long, 77.1 inches (1,959 mm) wide, and 58.2 inches (1,478 mm) tall. This means the E5 is 4.3 inches (109 mm) shorter than the redesigned A6. The company hasn’t said much about the interior, but it’s dominated by a 59-inch pillar-to-pillar display. Two screens showing footage from the digital side mirrors act as bookends and the display-focused setup gives the car a high-tech persona. The rest of the cabin sports a minimalist design largely devoid of switchgear. However, there’s a 50 watt wireless smartphone charger, a Bose audio system, and an electrochromic sunroof. Buyers will also find an AI assistant, chestnut wood trim, and a fragrance diffuser. The car rides on the Advanced Digitized Platform and will offer rear- and all-wheel drive. These will have outputs ranging from 295 hp (220 kW / 299 PS) to 776 hp (579 kW / 787 PS). The latter variant will rocket from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in a mere 3.4 seconds. AUDI has been coy on additional details, but the E5 will be offered with up to a 100 kWh battery pack. This will provide a range of up to 478 miles (770 km). When the battery is low, an ultra-fast charger can deliver 230 miles (370 km) of range in as little as ten minutes. The E5 Sportback also promises to have advanced driver assistance systems that will make commutes a breeze. Besides the roof-mounted LiDAR sensor, there are three long-range millimeter-wave radars, twelve ultrasonic sensors, eleven cameras, and several multi-modal sensing units.
