Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this R8 Spyder is now offered in Rhode Island with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in Phantom Black Pearl and features a Black convertible soft top as well as LED headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and power-folding mirrors. The front grille was repainted in 2019, and a ceramic coating was applied in 2023. The selling dealer notes scratches on the body. Aftermarket 20″ Vossen VFS-1 wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. The right-front wheel was repaired in 2021, and the selling dealer notes curb marks on one wheel. H\u0026R lowering springs and wheel spacers were installed in 2014, and braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated and cross-drilled discs. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in Black Fine Nappa leather with diamond-stitched accents that extend to the door panels. The interior is further appointed with the Audi Parking System Plus with a rearview camera as well as a Bang and Olufsen sound system. An aftermarket remote start system is installed, and the door panels have delamination. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with shift paddles and frames factory instrumentation. The digital odometer indicates under 11k miles. The 4.2-liter FSI V8 features dry-sump lubrication and was factory rated at 430 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. The battery and a drive belt were replaced in October 2023. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Quattro all-wheel drive. A custom exhaust system was installed in 2018. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Jim Ellis Audi Atlanta in Georgia and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $153,200.
