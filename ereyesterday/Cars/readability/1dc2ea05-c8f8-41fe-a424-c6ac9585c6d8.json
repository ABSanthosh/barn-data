Powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six linked with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, the car has 14k miles and is further equipped with a limited-slip differential black leather and Alcantara upholstery, the $18k Weissach Package, the Sport Chrono Package, 20″ and 21″ magnesium center-lock wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes with yellow calipers, a front-axle lift system, rear-axle steering, LED headlights with PDLS, a rear wing, navigation, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, and a Bose sound system. This 991 GT2 RS is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, a Carfax report, and a clean California title. Weight savings were targeted with the GT2 RS program, and Porsche fitted multiple carbon-fiber components including the hood, front fender vents, side intakes, side mirrors, and rear wing. The Weissach Package reduces weight further through the use of carbon fiber for the roof panel and the anti-roll bars. Downforce is increased with a large rear wing, underbody diffuser, and a deeper front fascia, while NACA ducts in the front trunk lid aid in brake cooling. This example is finished in Guards Red and has been covered with satin black vinyl wrap. Additional details include LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System, fog lights, and dual exhaust outlets. An accident is listed in a September 2021 entry of the Carfax report, and the selling dealer states the front bumper cover, radiator, left-front fender, left headlight, and left-rear quarter panel have been replaced by Premier Motorsport Inc., in Carson, California, as a result of the damage. Staggered-diameter 20″ and 21″ magnesium wheels feature center-locking hubs and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The car is equipped with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Stability Management, and rear-axle steering. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes were standard on the GT2 RS and feature yellow calipers and cross-drilled rotors. The optional front-axle lift raises the car on command to help prevent scraping. A brake fluid flush was performed in May 2024, at which time the tires were replaced, per the Carfax report. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests, Silver Gray seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center armrest, steering column, and door panels. Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include carbon-fiber trim, a dash camera, a fire extinguisher, aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, cruise control, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features lightweight shift paddles and carbon-fiber trim, and it frames a 250-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six was factory rated at 700 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Features include an intercooler spray system, a titanium rear exhaust muffler, and a carbon-fiber engine cover. An oil change was performed and the spark plugs were replaced in May 2024. The selling dealer notes that all scheduled maintenance has been performed at Porsche centers in the Los Angeles and Orange County regions, with the most recent service appointment carried out at 13,589 miles in November 2024 at Porsche of Newport Beach, California. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned accident. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
