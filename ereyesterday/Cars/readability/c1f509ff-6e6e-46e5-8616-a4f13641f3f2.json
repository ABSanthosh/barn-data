  "description": "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera RS is one of approximately 1,014 examples produced for the 1995 and 1996 model years, and it was sold new via Mizwa Motors in Japan. It was imported to the US by the selling dealer under the NHTSA Show or Display exemption in 2013 and was subsequently federalized by JK Technologies of Baltimore, Maryland, before it was purchased by the current owner later that year. The car is finished in Polar Silver Metallic over two-tone black and gray leather upholstery, and power comes from a 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, front and rear spoilers, 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels, a front strut tower bar, air conditioning, power-operated windows, front airbags, and a Porsche CDR-220 head unit. This 993 Carrera RS shows 43k kilometers (~27k miles) and is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Gruppe P collection with Japanese-language factory literature, tools, a removed Japanese-market radio, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Massachusetts title.",

It was imported to the US by the selling dealer under the NHTSA Show or Display exemption in 2013 and was subsequently federalized by JK Technologies of Baltimore, Maryland, before it was purchased by the current owner later that year. The car is finished in Polar Silver Metallic over two-tone black and gray leather upholstery, and power comes from a 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, front and rear spoilers, 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels, a front strut tower bar, air conditioning, power-operated windows, front airbags, and a Porsche CDR-220 head unit. This 993 Carrera RS shows 43k kilometers (~27k miles) and is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Gruppe P collection with Japanese-language factory literature, tools, a removed Japanese-market radio, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Massachusetts title. The 993 RS Carrera is a lightweight variant of the Carrera that was introduced for the 1995 model year and featured a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, deleted headlight washers, and thinner glass compared to the contemporary Carrera. This example is finished in Polar Silver Metallic (A8) and is equipped with front and rear spoilers, Carrera RS decklid badging, and amber side marker lamps. The 18″ multi-piece Speedline wheels wear RS center caps and were mounted with 225/40 front and 265/35 Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires in 2016, at which time the left rear wheel was repaired and refinished. A strut bar spans the front trunk, and stopping power is provided by red four-piston calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at all four corners. A brake fluid flush was performed in February 2025. The cabin features fixed-back seats trimmed in black leather upholstery with gray perforated inserts along with a black dashboard, door panels, and carpets with gray Carrera RS rear bulkhead embroidery. Equipment includes power windows, air conditioning, a Porsche CDR-220 head unit, a front passenger airbag, and drilled aluminum pedals. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 7,600-rpm tachometer, a 300-km/h speedometer, a quartz clock, and combination gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 43k kilometers (~27k miles), approximately 1k of which were added by the current owner. The M64/20 flat-six was enlarged to 3.8 liters for the Carrera RS and features a VarioRam intake system, forged pistons, lightened rocker arms, enlarged intake valves, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory output of 300 horsepower. A replacement battery was installed in 2016 and an oil change was performed in February 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was federalized and an EPA emissions conversion was carried out by JK Technologies in 2013. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The Massachusetts title carries a “Kilo Title” notation along with a disclosure that the odometer reads in kilometers. Filed under: 993 You are not connected to real-time updates.
