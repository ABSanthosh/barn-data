Having 24k miles, it is further equipped with black leather and Alcantara upholstery, the Sport Chrono Package, 20″ center-lock alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, LED headlights with PDLS+, a rear spoiler, a front-axle lift system, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, PCM with navigation, a Bose sound system, aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber interior trim, and Porsche Torque Vectoring. This 991.2 GT3 is now offered in New Jersey on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a New York title. The 991 GT3 featured revised front and rear bumper covers when compared to the standard Carrera as well as a rear wing and dual center-exit exhaust pipes. This example is finished in Graphite Blue Metallic and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System Plus (PDLS+), carbon-fiber mirror caps, and LED taillights. A dent was removed from the right-rear quarter panel in June 2022. Platinum Satin-finished 20″ center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by yellow Porsche-branded calipers over ceramic-composite rotors. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and Porsche Active Suspension Management. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, Porsche crests on the headrests, Silver Gray seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the center armrest, dashboard, steering column, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, the Light Design Package, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, automatic climate control, a Bose sound system, and cruise control. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 24k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended-range fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The current New York title lists a “Duplicate” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
