  "description": "A year after Toyota revealed the Maruti eVX-based Urban SUV concept, the Japanese brand has taken the wraps off the final production version, the Urban Cruiser EV. While it carries over much from the concept, the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV is slightly smaller, and other than the design, it shares a lot with the recently revealed Suzuki e Vitara, which will come to India with a Maruti badge. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV is shorter in length than the concept version Like the e Vitara, it will have 49kWh and 61kWh battery options and optional AWD Features include ADAS suite, 10.25-inch digital instrumentation, 10.1-inch touchscreen Toyota Urban Cruiser EV design and dimensions Naturally, many details from the concept’s design have been toned down for the final production model. While the grille and headlights are still thin units, they are not as slim as those seen in the concept, and the front bumper also adopts a less angular radiator section. Along the sides, most details of the two-box e-SUV have been retained from the concept, with black plastic cladding giving it the requisite SUV cues. Toyota will offer the Urban Cruiser EV with 18-inch or 19-inch aero-optimised wheels. Like the e Vitara, the Urban Cruiser EV has rear door handles in the C-pillar. At the back, Toyota’s new ‘born-EV’ features a toned-down yet elongated version of the concept’s tail-lights and roof spoiler and a chunky rear bumper. In rear styling, the Urban Cruiser overlaps significantly with the e Vitara. Toyota says it will offer a wide variety of colour options, including dual-tone ones with a contrasting black roof. From concept to production, the born-electric SUV has lost about 15mm in overall length (4,285mm) and 20mm in width (1,800mm), but its height has increased by 20mm to 1,640mm. The wheelbase size is the same at 2,700mm. Interestingly, these dimensions also make the Urban Cruiser EV marginally larger than the Suzuki e Vitara. Toyota claims a 5.2 metres turning radius for the e-SUV. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV battery and motors We’ve reported that this Toyota e-SUV shares a lot with the e Vitara, from the skateboard platform to the battery pack options and motors. The Urban Cruiser EV has lithium-iron phosphate cells with 49kWh and 61kWh capacities. Urban Cruisers with the smaller battery will have a front axle-mounted 144hp, 189Nm motor, while those with the larger battery will pack a 174hp, 189Nm front motor. Like the e Vitara, an AWD version will also be on offer, which is powered by the 61kWh battery and comes with an addition 65hp rear axle-mounted motor. The Urban Cruiser in AWD form has a total output of 184hp and 300Nm of torque. These versions will also get hill-descent control and a ‘Trail Mode’, which assists during rough-roading. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV interior and features The Urban Cruiser EV’s cabin is nearly identical to the e Vitara, from the dashboard layout and two-spoke steering wheel to the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen. The images released by Toyota show an electronic parking brake with auto hold, drive modes, a single-zone auto climate control, wireless phone charger and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other confirmed features – at least on range-topping trims – include powered driver’s seat adjust, a JBL audio system and a sunroof. The Japanese brand has also confirmed that the EV’s rear seats will come with a sliding and reclining function, along with a 40:20:40 split-folding function.  The safety kit on the Urban Cruiser EV will come in the form of a 360-degree camera and an ADAS suite that includes a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure alert and lane-keep assist. Like the Maruti on which it is based, six airbags are expected to be standard. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV India launch While the Japanese brand has yet to confirm when its new EV will be introduced to the Indian market, we expect the Urban Cruiser to arrive later in 2025. As it is an international model (though it’ll be made in India at Suzuki’s Gujarat facility), the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV will make its public debut at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show, which will begin on January 10. The company has confirmed that prices for the UK-spec model will be announced during the third quarter of 2025.
