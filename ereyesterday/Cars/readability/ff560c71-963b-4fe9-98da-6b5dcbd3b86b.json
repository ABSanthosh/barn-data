The Argentine duo of Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp works on myriad makes and models, constantly flitting between different build styles. So if you give them carte blanche on a project, you can bet they’ll deliver something highly imaginative—like a Royal Enfield bobber with a bespoke frame and a dazzling livery. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 [known as the INT650 in the USA] is a cracking donor bike for a custom build. It’s not crazy expensive, its parallel twin engine is easy to get along with, and it looks great out of the box with lots of room for tweaking. But for Marcelo and Germán, this particular project called for something more… “A client came to us asking to make a bobber out of his Interceptor 650, but it had to be different,” Marcelo tells us. “For this, he gave us the freedom to make whatever we want.” “What Germán and I really like are Japanese-style bobbers—but in this case, we shook it up a little. Our goal was that everything on this build had to be as customized as possible. And if we used an original part, we had to modify it.” To achieve their vision, STG Tracker stripped the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 down to its bones and began cutting up its frame. By the time they were done, all that was left was the original steering neck and frontal down tubes. Everything else is new, fabricated out of tubular steel to create a more retro look than the original square-section backbone. STG retained the original forks, but polished the lowers and the stock yokes. The custom frame dips towards the rear tire, where it’s propped up on a short pair of aftermarket shocks. The bike now rolls on 19” aluminum rims—adding a measure of equilibrium to this bobber’s deliberate nose-up stance. Next, STG cut slots into the OEM swingarm, welding fresh material into the inside of each one. The idea was to radically change the swingarm’s look without sacrificing strength. The slotted design is repeated on the front fork brace and the foot controls, which also wear chunky STG Tracker pegs. The guys also flipped the rear brake caliper to position it under the hub and rerouted the brake line through the swingarm. There’s another nifty detail up front, in the form of a billet aluminum hub cover on the wheel’s non-braking side. Moving to the bodywork, STG shaped a small teardrop fuel tank out of steel. Its size left little room for the bike’s fuel pump—or an adequate amount of fuel. So the duo built a second fuel cell under the seat to house the pump and carry extra fuel, bringing the total capacity to almost 9 liters [2.38 gallons]. The Enfield’s triangular side covers were inspired by the Harley FXR. STG shaped them out of fiberglass over a handmade mold. The leather seat is a one-off, as is the ribbed rear fender. There’s more of Marcelo and Germán’s handiwork in the cockpit. Handmade stainless steel handlebars with integrated risers are bolted to the top yoke, and fitted with custom aluminum switchblocks that feature integrated LED warning lights. ODI x Cult Vans ‘waffle’ grips adorn the bars too. All the wiring runs through the bars, before routing around the steering neck and into a channel in the frame. Other details include a Motogadget speedo, and a small chopper-style headlight on a custom-made stainless steel bracket. LED turn signals at the back double up as taillights. STG Tracker chose not to mess with the Enfield’s 646 cc mill—but they did add BMB pod filters and a custom twin exhaust system. “The engine has good torque and it’s reliable,” Marcelo explains. “So we just mapped it to make it breather better with the air filters and exhaust.” “What we didn’t like at all was the oil radiator—just a square black piece, ruining everything. Looking at what old Harleys use, we made two separate round aluminum radiators. They work great, functionally, and they look f**king good!” When it came time to paint their latest creation, STG decided to attempt something they’d never done before, by matching the bodywork and frame paint, inch for inch. “The color scheme was inspired by the Californian sunset, using a gradient pattern with four colors, and an STG logo with an 80s vibe on the tank. This could only have been possible thanks to our master painter, Alejandro Minissale.” There’s nothing subtle about this Royal Enfield bobber’s livery—but now that we’ve seen it, we can’t picture it any other way. Equal parts slick and sassy, it’s another smash hit from Buenos Aires’ finest. STG Tracker | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Darío Rodriguez",
