  "description": "TVS has updated its flagship, the Apache RR 310 sportbike, to meet the latest OBD2B emission norms. In the process, the RR 310 has gained a few features such as launch control, cornering drag torque control, sequential turn indicators and new 8-spoke alloy wheels derived from its sibling, the RTR 310. Prices start at Rs 2.78 lakh (ex-showroom, India) for the latest Apache RR 310.  Apache RR 310 is mechanically identical to before Sepang Blue race replica colour inspired by TVS Asia OMC racebike Prices hiked by Rs 3,000 across the board TVS Apache RR 310 gains new features along with OBD2B compliance Some new electronics, new wheels and colours part of the update The TVS Apache RR 310 continues to be powered by the same 312cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled engine, making the exact same 38hp and 29Nm torque as before. A 6-speed gearbox with a slip/assist clutch is on offer, along with a bidirectional quickshifter. As part of this update, TVS has now plonked the same alloy wheels onto the RR 310 as were first seen on the RTR 310. The company has also added some new electronic rider aids, such as launch control and cornering drag torque control, to the bike as standard now. Aside from these changes, the RR 310 is identical to the previous model. With this update, the TVS Apache RR 310 range has become dearer by Rs 3,000 and starts at Rs 2.78 lakh for the base red bike without the quickshifter. Optioning the slick bidirectional quickshifter is a steep jump to Rs 2.95 lakh, and if you choose the Bomber Grey colour, then you have to pony up Rs 3 lakh. Additionally, the company offers you BTO (built-to-order) packages that you can pick and choose from: the Dynamic pack costs Rs 18,000, and the Dynamic Pro pack is an extra Rs 16,000. TVS has also leveraged its racing background in the Asia One Make Championship series and introduced a neat-looking Sepang Blue shade on the RR 310 for an additional Rs 10,000. So, a fully decked-out Apache RR 310 will cost well above the Rs 3 lakh threshold.  All prices ex-showroom, India Also See: Feature: TVS Apache RR310 ARRC race bike ridden – World class",
