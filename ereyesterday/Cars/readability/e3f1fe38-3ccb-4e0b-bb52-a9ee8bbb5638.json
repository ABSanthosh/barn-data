It is powered by a 3.4-liter DOHC V8 linked with a dogleg five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero Connolly leather. Features include an aftermarket exhaust system, a black convertible soft top, 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. This 348 is now offered on dealer consignment with service records, tools, a soft top boot, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Ohio title. The 348 was the final V8-powered Ferrari model developed under the direction of Enzo Ferrari, and its design was overseen by Pininfarina chief stylist Leonardo Fioravanti. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa and features a black convertible soft top, pop-up headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, louvered taillights, a soft top boot, and quad exhaust tips. One of the fog light lenses is cracked and is covered in clear film. The 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Asimmetrico tires, which show date codes from 2007. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded calipers over ventilated discs along with an anti-lock system. The rear-right brake caliper, ABS sensor, and wheel bearing were replaced and the corresponding brake rotor was resurfaced in October 2023. The cabin features two seats upholstered in Nero Connolly leather along with a matching dashboard, center console, and door panels. Equipment includes a dogleg-pattern gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows and door locks. A JVC stereo and aftermarket Diamond speakers have been added to the cabin, and a Rockford Fosgate amplifier is stationed in the front trunk. Wear is evident on the driver’s seat. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure. Auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are mounted in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 21k miles, approximately 1,500 of which have been added by the current owner. The 3.4-liter quad-cam Tipo F119 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and was factory rated at 312 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. An aftermarket exhaust system has been added. An engine-out belt service was conducted in August 2017 at 21k miles. The battery was replaced in October 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Work in August 2017 at 21k miles included replacing the clutch, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage.
