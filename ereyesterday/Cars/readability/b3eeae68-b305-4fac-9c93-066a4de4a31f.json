  "text": "Local police are still searching for a Rolls-Royce Dawn that was recently snatched during transport 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Armenian and Russian brokers have been re-routing deliveries of several high-priced cars. Police have arrested a 41-year-old, a 53-year-old, and a 43-year-old in relation to the thefts. A Rolls-Royce Dawn and a Ferrari 488 Pista were recently stolen while being transported. Car transporter thefts are becoming an increasingly worrying trend across the US, with thieves zeroing in on high-end vehicles during transit. In Miami Beach, Florida, authorities recently arrested three men linked to a criminal ring believed to be behind the theft of several exotic cars in recent weeks. Among the stolen vehicles is a Rolls-Royce Dawn taken in January, which, despite efforts, is still missing. To put an end to the operation, police set up a sting that eventually led them straight to the suspects. Read: Hackers Reroute Delivery Truck To Steal $300K Rolls-Royce Dawn Investigators have revealed that thieves across the United States are now targeting dispatchers and transporters, gaining access to the computer systems of delivery companies to change order destinations. In one case, police in Florida arranged a delivery in Aventura. Three suspects arrived in a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce Cullinan, expecting to pick up the keys to an orange Lamborghini Urus. Instead, they were met by police and promptly arrested. The suspects were identified as 41-year-old Yuriy Korotovskyy, 53-year-old Arman Gevorgyan, and 43-year-old Hrant Nazarian. They were taken into custody and charged with grand theft, dealing in stolen property, and conspiracy to commit organized fraud. Authorities believe they were part of a broader network working with Armenian and Russian brokers to reroute deliveries of high-end cars. Among the victims of this ring was Nader Eldamouni, whose Rolls-Royce Dawn was stolen during transport from South Florida to Michigan. He alerted police to the theft, and shortly after, they launched an investigation into the matter. However, authorities have yet to locate the car. Protecting Your Vehicle During Transport Authorities are now advising car owners shipping vehicles across the country to install GPS tracking systems on their cars before they’re transported. This simple precaution could be the difference between recovering your car or dealing with the frustration of a stolen exotic. Recently, a Houston resident informed 7News about a similar case involving the theft of his Ferrari 488 Pista, which was rerouted and stolen in Miami. While police were already aware of this method of stealing vehicles, they’ve now highlighted its growing prevalence “over the past few weeks”. So, if you plan on shipping a high-end vehicle anytime soon, it might be worth taking that extra step to protect it. Photos 7News/ Florida Police",
