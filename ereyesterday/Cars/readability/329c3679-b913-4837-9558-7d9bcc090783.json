  "description": "This 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,858 roadsters built during a six-year production run and was delivered new in Germany, where it was first registered on July 25, 1958. Chassis 8500114 is said to have remained in Germany throughout its life and was acquired by its current owner from his father five years ago. Finished in silver over black leather, the car is powered by a replacement 3.0-liter M198 inline-six that features Bosch mechanical fuel injection and dry-sump lubrication. Additional features include a four-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted brakes with front discs, four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle, a black convertible top, and a retro-look Becker Mexico radio with infotainment. This W198 roadster is now offered on dealer consignment in Hamburg, Germany, with a July 2024 Kukuk evaluation report and German registration.",

  "text": "This 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,858 roadsters built during a six-year production run and was delivered new in Germany, where it was first registered on July 25, 1958. Chassis 8500114 is said to have remained in Germany throughout its life and was acquired by its current owner from his father five years ago. Finished in silver over black leather, the car is powered by a replacement 3.0-liter M198 inline-six that features Bosch mechanical fuel injection and dry-sump lubrication. Additional features include a four-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted brakes with front discs, four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle, a black convertible top, and a retro-look Becker Mexico radio with infotainment. This W198 roadster is now offered on dealer consignment in Hamburg, Germany, with a July 2024 Kukuk evaluation report and German registration. The roadster variant of the 300SL entered production two months after its debut at the March 1957 Geneva Motor Show, superseding the coupe model as the final Gullwings left the factory. Construction incorporated a reconfigured version of the coupe’s tubular space frame with the sill trusses lowered to accommodate conventional doors and the rear segment revised to create usable trunk space. Like its predecessor, the roadster featured steel bodywork with aluminum utilized for the hood, trunk lid, door skins, sills, floors, and bulkhead. Originally finished in Light Ivory, this example wears an older repaint in silver. The Kukuk evaluation report describes imperfections in the finish and body panels, which can be viewed in both list and chart form in the document pictured in the photo gallery below. A paint thickness chart is also presented in the report, and paint-meter readings are shown in the gallery. Features include bumper guards at front and rear, European-specification headlights, a driver-side mirror, pivot-out door handles, small-nut windshield wiper arms, and a black convertible top. Chrome-finished 15″ wheels wear polished hubcaps with body-color accents and are mounted with 205/70 Michelin XWX tires showing 2004 date codes. A matching spare is housed in the trunk. The servo-assisted brakes have been updated with front discs, while finned aluminum drums remain at the rear. A tag inside the engine bay lists a brake fluid change on August 31, 2023. The cabin houses bucket seats trimmed in black leather with matching trim over the door panels, sills, and upper dashboard. Additional features include charcoal square-weave carpeting, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, an ashtray, a clock, a locking glovebox, a retro-look Becker Mexico radio with Bluetooth and navigation, and a dual rally tripmeter unit. The black steering wheel is accented by a chrome horn ring and sits ahead of VDO instrumentation including a 270-km/h speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and a rectangular combination gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 88k kilometers (~55k miles), approximately 2k of which have been added under current ownership. The 300SL roadster model’s 3.0-liter M198 inline-six was carried over from the fixed-roof variant and shares its canted orientation, Bosch mechanical direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, and aluminum cylinder head. The competition camshaft that was optional on the coupe was made standard for the roadster, which also gained a dual point/dual coil ignition system and various fuel system refinements. This example’s engine is noted to be a replacement, and the engine serial number stamp is unreadable. The Kukuk report shows a 1960 casting date on the cylinder head and lists a 1955 casting date on the engine block. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. The roadster’s four-wheel independent suspension utilizes a single-pivot rear axle with a compensator spring for improved stability over the coupe’s double-pivot design. The data card is pictured in the Kukuk report and lists the original colors and equipment numbers. The report includes images of stamps of transmission number 8500322, differential number 8600134, steering box number 6514538, and body number 670. The front axles are not stamped. The report includes the results of a frame analysis utilizing optical emission spectrometry and ultrasound as well as notes on the condition and correctness of various components. The vehicle is being sold on its German registration, which serves as an ownership document in Germany. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
