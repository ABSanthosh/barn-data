  "text": "A rare Shelby Mustang 1000, built for David Yurman, is hitting the auction block soon 37 seconds ago by Brad Anderson Shelby only built 20 Mustang 1000s, making this one of the rarest pony cars. It was powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual. This was the final car signed off by Carroll Shelby himself before his passing. Shelby’s Mustang GT500 and Super Snake have always been among the most remarkable pony cars on the street, but back in 2012, the company launched an even crazier ‘Stang. Known simply as the 1000, the package could be added to existing GT500 and Super Snake models and included several upgrades that seriously increased their engines’ output. It was, in every sense of the word, a “hold my beer” moment for Mustang enthusiasts everywhere. Read: This Secret Mustang Prototype Could Obliterate Every GT500 Before It At the time, the Shelby 1000 was the most powerful Mustang ever built, and it made other performance cars look like they were standing still. Under the hood, Ford’s 5.4-liter V8 was supercharged with a monstrous 3.6-liter Kenne Bell blower, and Shelby wasn’t content to stop there. The 1000 also got new injectors, an upgraded fuel system, forged internals, and ported heads. The result was a road-going Mustang producing 950 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque, enough to send a cold chill down the spine of every Cars \u0026 Coffee meet within a 50-mile radius. For those crazy enough to want more, a track version cranked out a ridiculous 1,100 horsepower. It was estimated the 1000 could hit 60 mph in around 3.7 seconds. Shelby is thought to have only ever built 20 Mustang 1000s, so it’s quite rare to see an example hit the used market. But Mecum got its hands on one, and it will cross the auction block next month. It was originally built for David Yurman, a successful jeweler, and has only ever been driven 973 miles (1,565 km). If you’re not a fan of newer Mustangs and want one with more horsepower than sense (ed’s note: shouldn’t all fun pony cars be that way?), this could be just what the doctor ordered. Mecum Auctions Numerous other modifications were made to the Mustang to ensure it could (or at least do its best to) handle this kind of horsepower. These include an upgraded 9-inch rear end, new six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers, and a strengthened driveshaft. Shelby also added stiffer springs, sway bars, and bushings, along with a lightweight carbon fiber hood featuring functional air vents to keep the engine bay cool. Adding to the car’s desirability is the fact that it was the final model overseen by Carroll Shelby himself before his passing in May 2012. Factor in the hypercar-like output and rarity, and you’ve got yourselves a winner. Back in the day, the Shelby 1000 had an MSRP of $200,000, which included the GT500 Ford Mustang donor car. That’s supercar money, both then and now. So, if you’re feeling lucky (and have a few extra zeroes in your bank account), you might want to check out Mecum Auctions’ listing over here to see how much this special Mustang might fetch. Just don’t say we didn’t warn you – it’s going to cost you. Mecum Auctions",
