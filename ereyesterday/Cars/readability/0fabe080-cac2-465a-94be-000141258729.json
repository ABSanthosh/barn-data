Chassis 2261996 was refreshed in July 2022 by BMW Group Classic in Germany before being imported to the US and sold on BaT in July 2023. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, the car is finished in Ceylon Gold over beige fabric and black vinyl upholstery and is powered by a fuel-injected 3.0L inline-six mated to a retrofitted five-speed manual transmission. Additional equipment includes a limited-slip differential, four-wheel disc brakes, and 16” Alpina wheels along with wood interior trim, a Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette stereo, and electric windows. This 3.0CSi is now offered as part of DriverSource’s 2024 Oktmotorfest Collection with manufacturer’s literature, a stamped service booklet, records from the 2022 refresh, tools, and a clean California title. The car left the factory in Ceylon Gold (8) and was repainted some time ago in Europe. Exterior details include a driver-side mirror, quad headlamps, front fender vents, and wraparound chrome bumpers with rubber impact strips. Close-up photos of the paint, trim, and windows can be viewed in the image gallery below. The 16” Alpina wheels are mounted with 205/55 front and 225/50 rear Hankook Ventus Prime 3 tires, and a 14″ wheel with an older Michelin tire is stored in the trunk. Braking is via discs at all four corners. Work during the refresh in 2022 included stripping and powder coating various suspension components as well as replacing the tie rods, shocks, and brake hoses. The front bucket seats and contoured rear bench are trimmed in black vinyl and beige fabric, while wood trim adorns the dash, center console, and doors. Amenities include a Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette stereo, a heater, and electric windows. A Petri-style steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation that consists of a 240-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, a combination gauge, and an analog clock. The five-digit odometer shows approximately 10k kilometers (~6k miles), approximately 500 of which have been added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The 3.0-liter M30B30 inline-six features Bosch D-Jetronic fuel injection. The engine bay was refinished in 2022, at which time the water pump was refurbished and the spark plugs, fuel hoses, fan clutch, and an exhaust pipe were replaced. A five-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential were added under prior ownership. The clutch assembly was replaced and the rear axle was overhauled by BMW Group Classic in July 2022, and the underbody was also dry-ice blasted, coated, and refinished at that time. A composite By The Numbers photo has been provided by the selling dealer and shows various identifying markings around the car. Manufacturer’s literature, a stamped service booklet, a binder of records, and a jack and tool kit are included in the sale. Filed under: e9 You are not connected to real-time updates.
