These early gearboxes have some quirks that the uninitiated will have no idea about. To maximize your driving pleasure – and minimize any costly transmission damage – AutoEsoterica’s host and cofounder Craig Cole explains how he rips through the gears in his flathead V8-powered 1936 Ford sedan… rips through the gears gently, that is.
