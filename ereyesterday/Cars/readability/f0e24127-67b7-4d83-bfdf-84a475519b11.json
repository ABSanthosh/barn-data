  "text": "We're not sure the upcoming 911 GT2 RS will even be able to rival this special 911, of which only 10 were ever made 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson This 911 GT2 R was limited to just 10 examples and requires extensive rebuilding. There’s an engine at the rear, but its specifics remain unknown and unconfirmed. Once owned by René Snel and later raced by Klaus Abbelen, this 911 has history. A rare gem in the world of racing Porsches is up for auction later this month, and it could fetch as much as €700,000 (about $784,000). But before you start imagining yourself behind the wheel, there’s a catch: this iconic 911 isn’t exactly ready to hit the track. Read: Porsche Hides New 911 GT2 RS Mule Under GT3 RS Bodywork It’s in need of a rebuild, which means you’ll have a significant project on your hands. For the right millionaire with a penchant for exclusivity and a taste for a challenge, though, this could be the ultimate track-ready transformation. The car in question is a 993-based 911 GT2 R that was built to go racing for the 1997 season. It was originally owned and raced by René Snel, but he would go on to crash it in August 1999. The car then landed in the hands of Klaus Abbelen, who repaired it and raced it at various events at the Nurburgring, Monza, and Hockenheim. For those who don’t know, Abbelen was the husband of the late Sabine Schmitz. In 2014, the car changed hands once more, and the process of rebuilding began anew. However, the project was left incomplete, and now the car sits in a half-finished state, awaiting a new owner to finish the job. A Project Car with History Neil Fraser/RM Sotheby’s RM Sotheby’s hasn’t provided specific details about how much work remains to get this car back in working order, but it’s clear that there’s a lot to do. The cabin has been fully stripped out, though the sale does include some parts like carpets, a Recaro racing seat, and a handful of other interior components. Notably absent are the gauges and, of course, the windows. There is an engine in the back, but the specifics remain a mystery, as there’s no word on where it came from or which Porsche engine it is. What we do know is that rebuilding this car is a serious undertaking, but for the right buyer, it could be a labor of love. If you’re willing to take on the challenge, you could walk away with the keys to an exclusive car that’ll make even the forthcoming 911 GT2 RS seem a little pedestrian. It’s not a project for everyone, but if you’ve got the deep pockets to take it on, this car could be the ultimate automotive toy. Check out the listing over here and place your bid if you’re up for the challenge. Neil Fraser/RM Sotheby’s",
