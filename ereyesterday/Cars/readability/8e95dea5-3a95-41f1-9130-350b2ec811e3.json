  "description": "This 1961 Ferrari 250 GTE is one of 954 Pininfarina-bodied 2+2 coupes built during three years of production and is among the last of 299 first-series examples constructed during the model’s first two years. Chassis 3075 was completed on December 14, 1961, and was delivered new in the US via Luigi Chinetti Motors in New York. By the 1980s the car appeared under ownership in Florida and was later imported to Europe, where it was sold by a Belgian dealer to its current owner in 2014. A refurbishment was subsequently performed in Modena, Italy, between 2016 and 2020 before the car participated in the 2021 and 2022 Auto e Moto D’Epoca fairs and then returned to Florida in 2023. Finished in Grigio Conchiglia, the car is powered by a 3.0-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a four-speed manual transmission with electric overdrive. Additional features include servo-assisted Dunlop four-wheel disc brakes, telescopic shock absorbers, 15” Borrani wire wheels, and red leather interior upholstery. This 250 GTE is now offered on dealer consignment in Waltham, Massachusetts, with copies of its factory build sheets, invoices from 2018 to 2022, owner's literature, and a clean Florida title.",

A refurbishment was subsequently performed in Modena, Italy, between 2016 and 2020 before the car participated in the 2021 and 2022 Auto e Moto D’Epoca fairs and then returned to Florida in 2023.

Additional features include servo-assisted Dunlop four-wheel disc brakes, telescopic shock absorbers, 15” Borrani wire wheels, and red leather interior upholstery. This 250 GTE is now offered on dealer consignment in Waltham, Massachusetts, with copies of its factory build sheets, invoices from 2018 to 2022, owner’s literature, and a clean Florida title. The 250 GTE was introduced at the 1960 Paris Motor Show and carried over a modified version of the 2,600mm-wheelbase 508 chassis used in previous 250 variants, with the engine moved forward to accommodate standard rear seats. Pininfarina bodywork combines steel construction with aluminum hood and trunk panels. The model was built in three series, the first two of which featured styling incorporating slim inset headlight bezels, grille-mounted driving lights, and chrome Superamerica-style taillight housings. This example was originally finished in Grigio Conchiglia and received a repaint in its original shade during a refurbishment that is said to have been performed by Carrozzeria Europa in Modena, Italy, between 2016 and 2020. The brightwork is also said to have been replated during the project. The Borrani wire wheels were refinished by Turrino Wheels in Peterborough, England, in 2020 and are secured by three-eared knock-offs, while 205/70VR15 Michelin XWX tires are mounted all around. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes that were refreshed during the refurbishment with a replacement servo and calipers. The steering box was also rebuilt during the project. The cabin is trimmed in red leather over four-place seating as well as over the door panels and center tunnel, while black upholstery covers the dashboard. Additional features include gray carpeting, a beige headliner, a lockable glovebox, and a Pininfarina-branded ashtray. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, a clock, and gauges monitoring oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 1,500 kilometers (~900 miles), all of which are said to have been added under current ownership. The 3.0-liter Tipo 128 V12 features an aluminum block and aluminum cylinder heads with spark plugs positioned on the outer side of each bank as well as coil valve springs and individual intake ports. The engine and its triple Weber 40 DCL6 carburetors were overhauled by Technomecc in Modena, Italy, during the refurbishment, with work including the replacement of the pistons, connecting rods, bearings, and valves. The generator and fan clutch were also rebuilt during the project. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission that is also said to have been overhauled during the refurbishment and is equipped with Laycock de Normanville overdrive. Additional work during the project included a rebuild of the differential and a refresh of the suspension with replacement Koni shock absorbers. The flywheel was ground and balanced in 2022. Copies of the factory build sheets list the original equipment numbers and production information. The chassis plate is stamped with number 250GTE3075, while the title lists identification number 3075GT. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
