Features include an optional removable vinyl-trimmed hardtop, 15″ Rally wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a cabin heater, an AM/FM radio, a dual exhaust system, and retractable headlights. This C2 was purchased by the seller in 2024 and is now offered in North Carolina at no reserve with a Protect-O-Plate, a tank sticker, the owner’s manual, spare parts, the removed soft top, and a clean Montana title assigned to the seller’s LLC. The fiberglass body is finished in Marlboro Maroon (988) and features a vinyl-covered hardtop that was only available for the 1967 model year and exclusively trimmed in black. The car also has a domed hood, retractable headlights, chrome split bumperettes, fender vents, a driver-side mirror, and dual exhaust tips. The soft top has been removed and is included in the sale. There is wear across the exterior surfaces and close-up photos are provided in the gallery. The 15″ Rally wheels wear chrome trim rings and center caps and are mounted with Mastercraft Radial Tires tires measuring 205/75/15. The car features a fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The cabin features two bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl as well as color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include a heater, a vertical push-button AM/FM radio, an analog clock, and lap seatbelts. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, amperage, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 41k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The tachometer does not work. The 327ci V8 is equipped with a single four-barrel carburetor and was factory rated at 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. Service includes: The engine stamping is shown above.
