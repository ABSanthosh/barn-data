  "description": "Indu Chandhok, the doyen of Indian motorsports with which he was accociated for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 93. Indu Chandhok was born in Kolkata on July 22, 1931, and then moved to Chennai in 1932. He was one of the founder-members of the Madras Motor Sports Club in 1953. He also helped found the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI) in 1971, of which he was the president (1978-79). He was also an integral part of the Trust that purchased and developed the Madras International Circuit (erstwhile Madras Motor Race Track) at Irungattkottai, and about 40km from Chennai. His involvement with Indian motorsports for the last 60 years – first as a competitor and later an organiser – earned him the sobriquet of \"Godfather of Motor Sports in India\". Off the racetrack, he was involved with the Punjab Association Trust of which he was the chairman; the DAV School; Camp Tonakela; the Madras Round Table which he founded; the Masonic Lodge; and he was president of Indian Motor Parts Dealers Association, and involved with the 41 Clubs of India, an association of ex-Round Tablers whose international President he became. His son Vicky Chandhok, is a former National Rally Champion and is the current MMSC vice president. His grandson Karun Chandhok, is India’s second Formula One driver (after Narain Karthikeyan), and is now a well-known F1 race commentator and analyst. Regarding the passing, Madras Motor Sports Club (MMSC) president Ajit Thomas, said, \"In Indu Chandhok’s demise, the MMSC and Indian motorsports have lost a giant and an institutional figure. He was instrumental in providing definitive direction to motorsports in India and we are now enjoying the fruits of his untiring efforts. He also shaped MMSC to what it is today. We deeply mourn his passing away and offer condolences to his family.\" Indu Chandhok’s son and MMSC vice president Vicky Chandhok, said, \"The Patriarch of the Chandhok family, passed away in his sleep this morning. Total legend he was. 'BIC' lived his life filled with a great sense of humour until the end. He was a fantastic father and protector. In a way, he was also the patriarch of Indian motorsports who saw the big picture with a clear vision for the growth of the sport. The family and the motorsports fraternity will miss him.\" Former FMSCI president Shramik Masturlal, said, \"Indu was an institution in himself. His co-founding of the FMSCI, his huge efforts in making Sholavaram races what it became, the creation of the new track from scratch, the birth of the MMST etc, all bore the stamp of Indu’s efforts in furthering motor sports to unimaginable levels. Indu leaves gigantic footprints. An era has passed!\" Also see: Tested Like Samsonite with Karun Chandhok Mercedes engine deal hints at plans to sell Alpine F1 team: Karun Chandhok",
