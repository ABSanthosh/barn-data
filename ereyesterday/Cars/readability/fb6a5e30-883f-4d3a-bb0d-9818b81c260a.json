  "description": "The first two months of this year have been quite eventful for the Indian automobile industry, thanks to Auto Expo 2025 in January and new car launches in February. The inaugural quarter of 2025 will close at the end of March, which will see the addition of more cars and SUVs to the market. Volvo XC90 facelift Launch date: March 4, 2025 The current-gen Volvo XC90 SUV has been on sale in India since 2016, so it’s due for an update. The Swedish carmaker first revealed the XC90 facelift last year with redesigned exterior styling elements adopted from the EX90 electric SUV. These include a revised grille with diagonal slats, slimmer headlights, refreshed bumpers, darker tail-lamps and new alloy wheels. Inside, the XC90 facelift offers a larger 11.2-inch Google-based touchscreen infotainment system that supports over-the-air updates. The powertrain is expected to remain the same as the current XC90, with a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol mild-hybrid engine channelling 250hp and 360Nm of torque through an 8-speed automatic gearbox to all four wheels. Prices are yet to be revealed, but the Volvo XC90 facelift will most likely come at a premium and compete against the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Audi Q7. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series Launch date: March 17, 2025 First unveiled internationally last year, the Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series will debut in India next month. The luxury roadster evidently builds upon the Mercedes-Benz SL and is claimed to be the sportiest Maybach model ever made. The SL 680 dons Maybach’s definitive dual-tone paint scheme, a new grille with vertical slats and multi-spoke wheels. The interior features white Nappa leather seats, a white dashboard and steering wheel with satin silver trim pieces, and a quieter exhaust system than the standard SL Roadster. Despite the luxury focus, the Maybach SL 680 comes equipped with a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8. The unit produces 585hp and 800Nm, channelled to all four wheels through a 9-speed automatic gearbox, enabling a 0-100kph time of 4.1 seconds. The Maybach SL 680’s price for India has not been disclosed yet. However, considering that the SL 55 Roadster retails for Rs 2.35 crore (ex-showroom), the Maybach SL 680 is expected to cost more than that. Maruti Suzuki e Vitara Launch date: March 2025 Maruti Suzuki will finally launch its debut EV for India, the e Vitara, in March. Design-wise, the e Vitara retains many of the styling cues of the eVX concept that previewed it in 2023: the upright stance, large LED headlights and chunky cladding all around. The e Vitara will feature 18-inch wheels as standard, and the rear of the SUV is dominated by an LED light bar. The e Vitara’s cabin sports a more upmarket design than the other Maruti Suzuki offerings in India, and the top-spec variant will include goodies such as a floating 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, a 10.1-inch fully digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a fixed panoramic sunroof, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, ventilated front seats, and more. The safety will be taken care of with seven airbags, rear disc brakes, a blind-spot monitor, a Level 2 ADAS suite, a 360-degree camera, and an electronic parking brake with auto-hold, among other bits. Two LFP battery packs will be offered for the e Vitara: 49kWh and 61kWh. Torque output is the same for both at 192.5Nm, but the smaller battery makes 143hp, and the larger pack develops 173hp. Maruti Suzuki has claimed a 500km MIDC-tested range for the 61kWh e Vitara. As far as pricing goes, the Maruti Suzuki e Vitara is expected to retail between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 30 lakh. It will rival the MG ZS EV, Tata Curvv EV and Mahindra BE 6. Also see: Maruti e Vitara features, colour options revealed Maruti e Vitara vs Toyota Urban Cruiser EV: design, specs, features compared",
