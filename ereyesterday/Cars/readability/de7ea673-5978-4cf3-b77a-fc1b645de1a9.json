  "text": "While crossovers are king, a car saw the biggest increase in sales last month May 1, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier While a number of automakers had a stellar April, Subaru sales only climbed 0.3%. Crosstrek and Forester sales were up, but a majority of models experienced declines. BRZ sales soared 85.9%, but that equates to an increase of less than 200 units. Subaru made a splash at the New York Auto Show, but it appears the excitement didn’t extend to dealer lots. Quite the opposite as sales were only up 0.3% and this stands in stark contrast to the double digit gains seen by rivals. However, one model was up 85.9% in April. While that sounds like an impressive achievement, we’re talking about the BRZ, so this only equates to an additional 153 sales. Bad for Subaru, but good for 331 buyers who got themselves a heck of a car. Review: Subaru BRZ tS Is A Blast For The Young And The Young At Heart On the flip side, the 2025 Forster appears to be winning over consumers as sales climbed 8.3% last month to 19,330 units. The popular crossover was trailed by the Crosstrek, which was up 23.2%. Subaru’s third best-seller was the Outback and it was down 12.4%. Speaking of the Outback, Subaru introduced the redesigned model in New York and it’s a huge departure. Besides abandoning the wagon body style, the model features a larger cargo area and two engines. The 2.5-liter Boxer produces 180 hp (134 kW / 183 PS), while the optional 2.4-liter turbo develops 260 hp (194 kW / 264 PS). Despite a huge price cut for 2025, Solterra sales fell 34.8%. A facelifted model debuted in the Big Apple and it likely won’t help as the upgraded powertrain is offset by a questionable design. Lastly, the WRX has seen better days as sales of the 271 hp (202 kW / 275 PS) sedan were down 59.1%. That’s a decline of more than 1,000 units and it appears there isn’t much of a market for a sporty all-wheel drive car that starts at $35,750. Subaru U.S. Sales",
