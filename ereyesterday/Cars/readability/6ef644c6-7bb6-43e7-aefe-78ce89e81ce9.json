  "text": "Photo: ChevroletChevrolet finally revealed the production version of the C8 Corvette ZR1 over the summer, promising us 1,064 horsepower and 828 pound-feet of torque from its twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V8. That’s some serious power, and it gets even scarier when you remember the Corvette ZR1 is rear-wheel drive. That means the engine sends more than 500 hp to each powered wheel, which truly is an absurd figure when you think about it. Now, we’ve got official acceleration numbers from Chevrolet, and boy is this thing quick. It’ll hit 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds and runs the quarter-mile in 9.6 at 150 mph. Suggested ReadingOffEnglishSuggested ReadingFor comparison, the 670-hp Corvette Z06 officially runs the quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds and has a 2.6-second 0-to-60-mph time. The 655-hp all-wheel-drive hybrid Corvette E-Ray, on the other hand, is slightly quicker, knocking a tenth of a second off both the Z06's 0-60 and quarter mile times. Over the course of 1,320 feet, you aren’t going to notice a difference of a tenth of a second. A full second, though? That’s something completely different. You’re definitely going to notice the difference between a 9.6-second quarter-mile and a 10.6-second quarter-mile. “The 2025 Corvette ZR1 yet again exceeded our expectations,” chief engineer Josh Holder said in a statement. “Combined with a top speed record of 233 mph – which is unrivaled by any current production car priced under $1 million – the Corvette ZR1 delivers on its mission to provide customers unrelenting power.”That said, Chevrolet didn’t achieve those times with a “base” Corvette ZR1. If you want to go as fast as possible, you’re going to have to add the ZTK Performance Package. Cars without that package officially take 2.5 seconds to hit 60 mph and run the quarter mile in 9.7 seconds, although you’ll achieve a slightly higher trap speed of 152 mph. While the tests were run using ultra-sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires, Chevrolet says it achieved those times on 93-octane gas and without the use of a prepped drag surface. So yes, the Dodge Challenger Demon 170 is still officially the quicker car in the quarter mile, but since it required a prepped surface to break into the eights, there’s no telling just how big a difference you would see in the real world. And, of course, once it comes time to turn, the Corvette is going to have a huge advantage over the Dodge, especially since the carbon-fiber aero bits included in the ZTK package officially generate more than 1,200 pounds of downforce at the Corvette’s top speed.",
