Renault discounts in December 2024 Benefits of up to Rs 85,000 Renault India entry-level product, the Kwid, takes on the likes of the Alto K10 and the S-Presso.

The Triber compact MPV, which gets a 72hp 1.0-litre petrol engine, is an affordable alternative to the Ertiga.

The Grand i10 Nios is powered by an 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine, and Hyundai has also recently introduced the dual-cylinder CNG version of the hatchback. The Aura compact sedan, which takes on the Dzire and the Amaze, gets discounts of around Rs 25,000 this month. The Tata Tigor rival shares its powertrain with the Nios. The Verna sedan, which comes with a 115hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine and a 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine, on the other hand gets higher benefits to the tune of Rs 75,000, or even close to Rs 1 lakh depending on inventory.

While the 1.2-litre engine is shared with the Tiago, it makes 2hp more on petrol, and a nearly identical 73.5hp on CNG. A dual-clutch auto is on offer with the petrol engine. The Altroz is the only premium hatchback that is currently ofered with a diesel engine – it's a 90hp, 1.5-litre unit that is paired with a manual gearbox as standard. The performance-focused Altroz Racer has a more powerful 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol mill that's shared with the Nexon compact SUV.     The Tigor compact sedan is the oldest model in the segment, which is one of the reasons why it is available with significant discounts. MY2023 variants get discounts over Rs 1.5 lakh, though MY2024 models get around the same benefits as the Tiago, with which the compact sedan shares its powertain.  Also see: New car launches, unveils in December Buying a used Hyundai i20 N Line: what to look out for Maruti Dzire ZXi trims get over 50 percent of total bookings",
