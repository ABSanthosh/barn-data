  "description": "This 2020 Ford GT Mk II is the first of 45 track-only Mk II models that were engineered independent of race series regulations and built by Multimatic in Ontario, Canada. Chassis MKII–001 is said to have been driven on track at the Dubai Autodrome, the Silverstone Circuit, and the Bahrain International Circuit between 2020 and 2022. It was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and now shows 730 kilometers (~450 miles). The car is finished in Blu Elettrico Viola with twin Shadow Chrome racing stripes over black upholstery, and power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Equipment include adjustable DSSV shock absorbers, an air-jack system, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, 19″ forged alloy wheels with Michelin slicks, a redesigned front splitter and rear diffuser, a dual-element rear wing, a roof-mounted intake for auxiliary cooling, fixed-back Sparco race seats with harnesses, a roll cage, and a MoTeC data acquisition system. This Ford GT Mk II is now offered at no reserve in Atlanta, Georgia, with a spare parts collection and a bill of sale.",

Chassis MKII–001 is said to have been driven on track at the Dubai Autodrome, the Silverstone Circuit, and the Bahrain International Circuit between 2020 and 2022. It was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and now shows 730 kilometers (~450 miles). The car is finished in Blu Elettrico Viola with twin Shadow Chrome racing stripes over black upholstery, and power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Equipment include adjustable DSSV shock absorbers, an air-jack system, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, 19″ forged alloy wheels with Michelin slicks, a redesigned front splitter and rear diffuser, a dual-element rear wing, a roof-mounted intake for auxiliary cooling, fixed-back Sparco race seats with harnesses, a roll cage, and a MoTeC data acquisition system. This Ford GT Mk II is now offered at no reserve in Atlanta, Georgia, with a spare parts collection and a bill of sale. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the pushrod suspension system. This example is finished in Blu Elettrico Viola with Shadow Chrome over-the-top stripes. Additional equipment includes butterfly doors, a rearview camera, and LED headlights and taillights. The 19″ Forgeline alloy wheels are exclusive to the Mk II, and they are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport GT racing slicks. An additional three sets of matching spare wheels and tires are included in the sale. Stopping power is handled by Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes measuring 15.5″ up front and 14.1″ at the rear, with a retuned Bosch anti-lock braking system. The removal of the electronically adjustable suspension is said to save approximately 200 pounds over a standard Ford GT and is replaced with five-way adjustable Multimatic DSSV two-stage dampers with high-speed blow-off, fixed-rate springs, and an air jack system. Also specific to the Mark II are unique billet-machined uprights and redesigned tie-rod ends. The cabin features fixed carbon-shelled Sparco race seats trimmed in black cloth with wraparound headrests, GT embroidery, and blue safety harnesses. Exposed carbon fiber is visible throughout, while the dash pad and pillars are trimmed in black Alcantara. Additional equipment includes carbon-fiber dash moldings, a fire-suppression system, and an FIA-compliant chromoly roll cage. The Multimatic carbon-fiber multifunction steering wheel is trimmed in Alcantara and sits in front of a 10” digital instrument screen that displays a speedometer and tachometer alongside oil temperature and pressure, coolant temperature, and boost pressure. A MoTeC data acquisition system provides vital information for the driver and doubles as a display for the rearview camera. The digital odometer shows 730 kilometers (~450 miles). The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 was factory rated at 700 horsepower, approximately 40 more than the road-going GT and an increase of 200 horsepower over the factory GTLM race car. The Mk II received a high-capacity air-to-air outboard-mounted charge cooler with an ionized water spray that automatically activates during high-temperature situations, while auxiliary coolers for the gearbox, oil system, and clutch are fed via the roof-mounted scoop. Replacement battery wiring was installed in 2020. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Getrag 7DCL750 seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. An Akrapovič titanium exhaust system is fitted along with carbon-fiber aero panels fore and aft. Replacement driveshaft assemblies, CV joints and boots, and rear brake shrouds were installed in 2020. The car is accompanied by a collection of spare parts that include brake, suspension, and exhaust components. The car does not have a title, as it is intended for track use only. It is being sold on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
