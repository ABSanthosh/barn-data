  "text": "The Plus Six successor promises to be thoroughly modern, despite the old school vibe 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Morgan has teased their new flagship, which is set to debut this spring. The model “isn’t a direct replacement” for the Plus Six, but fills its spot. It rides on a new platform and will use a straight-six turbo from BMW. Morgan announced plans to retire the Plus Six last year and introduce a new flagship in 2025. We’re now getting our first look at the model, ahead of its debut this spring. While the British company is keeping its name under wraps, they said the car will be “instantly recognizable as a Morgan, whilst projecting a more contemporary aesthetic and an aerodynamically informed proportion.” That certainly appears to be the case judging by the teaser images, which show a camouflaged prototype. More: Morgan Sends Off Plus Six With Pinnacle Edition, New Flagship Coming In 2025 The new model wears an old school front fascia with a protruding horseshoe grille that is flanked by circular headlights. They’re joined by flowing bodywork, bulging fenders, and retro-inspired mirrors. Interestingly, there are three windshield wipers that look like an AI fever dream. The rear end loosely recalls the Plus Six as we can see a familiar dual exhaust system as well as fender-mounted taillights. However, they’re joined by a modernized bumper as well as what appears to be rectangular reflectors. The car rides on the new CXV platform, which is being billed as an “advanced evolution” of their bonded aluminum chassis. It promises to be lighter and stiffer, while also enabling a “range of new technical features and engineering enhancements throughout, all contributing to greater dynamic performance and driving enjoyment.” Morgan went on to say the car will be powered by a turbocharged six-cylinder engine sourced from BMW. There’s no word on which one, but the Plus Six had a 3.0-liter TwinPower Turbo six-cylinder engine that produced 335 hp (250 kW / 340 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque. It was connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission, which enabled the model to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 4.2 seconds and onto a top speed of 166 mph (267 km/h).",
