They have updated their best-selling scooter, the Activa 110 and launched it at Rs 80,950. Honda Activa is now available in 3 variants, 6 colours Gets a 4.2-inch TFT display Prices have gone up by Rs 2,266 for the Standard variant Updated Honda Activa: What’s new? Honda has been updating and making its complete lineup OBD-2B compliant which came into effect last year. The Activa 110 also receives an upgrade in its feature list in the form of a 4.2 inch TFT colour display which gives you a host of information such as a mileage indicator, trip meters, an eco indicator and distance to empty. The Activa also gets a USB type-C charging port to charge your device on the move. Powering the Activa is the same 109.51cc, single-cylinder PGM-Fi engine that is now OBD2B compliant. It develops 7.8hp and 9.03Nm, and Honda has equipped the Activa with an Idling stop system. The Honda Activa 110 has been the brand’s bestseller for the last 2 decades and was launched back in 1999. The Activa has remained largely unchanged with a few feature additions to keep it fresh such as an LED headlight and digital trip meter.  The 2025 Honda Activa is now available in 6 colours -  Metallic Red, Pearl Black, Pearl White, Metallic blue Matte Gray and Pearl Blue.  These colours are available across 3 variants i.e STD, DLX and H-Smart.  All these changes have also amounted to an increase in the price of the Activa. The STD variant starts from Rs 80,950 which is an increase of Rs 2,266 compared to the outgoing model. Honda has not mentioned pricing for DLX and the H-smart variant but we expect their prices to increase as well.
