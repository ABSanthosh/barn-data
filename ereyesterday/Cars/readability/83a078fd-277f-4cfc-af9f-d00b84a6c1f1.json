  "description": "Hero’s electric subsidiary, Vida, has launched its more affordable family-centric offering, VX2. Prices start at just Rs 59,490 for the base Go variant if bought on the BaaS plan and go up to Rs 1.10 lakh for the Plus model if purchased with the batteries.  Vida VX2 offered with BaaS option on both variants Go and Plus have 92km and 142km claimed range, respectively Hero claims running cost of just Rs 0.96/km for the Vida VX2 Vida VX2 price, battery and range details Vida VX2 BaaS details Hero offers the Vida VX2 in two variants - Go (2.2kWh battery) and Plus (3.4kWh battery). The claimed IDC range is 92km and 142km, for both variants respectively. The Vida VX2 can also be purchased on a Battery as a Subscription (Baas) model wherein you pay for everything on the scooter except the batteries, which you lease.  Hero claims running costs of just Rs 0.96/km for the VX2 models and if you have purchased it via the BaaS plan and the battery’s performance falls below 70 percent, the company will replace it free of charge.  The Vida VX2 looks different to the earlier V2 and has more of a family-centric design with smooth, flowing lines. It has a near-flat single-piece seat, pillion backrest and a handlebar shroud, which differentiates it from the V2. The headlight, tail light and indicators are shared between the V2 and the VX2. The VX2 also comes with an accessory plastic frunk on the front apron. Plus variant has a few more features, larger battery than Go The Go variant with the 2.2kWh battery has a spacious 33.2 litre boot - the 27.2 litre underseat storage capacity of the Plus is a little smaller, considering it needs to accommodate two batteries instead of just one on the Go. With the supplied 580W charger, the Go variant's battery can be charged fully in 3hr53min, while the Plus takes 5hr39min. Both also have fast-charging capabilities and can be charged from 0-80 percent and 0-100 percent by one of the charges in 1 hour and 2 hours, respectively.  Both models run on 12-inch wheels at both ends and appear to share most of their underpinnings. The VX2’s Go variant comes with a front drum brake because a teaser shared by the company in the buildup to its launch showed a scooter with that. The VX2 Go has a 70kph claimed top speed, whereas the Plus can go a little higher at 80kph.  Another area of differentiation between the Go and the Plus is that the former comes with a 4.3-inch LCD display whereas the latter comes with a 4.3-inch TFT dash. Both come with a suit of connectivity features and a physical key. The Go has 2 riding modes - Eco and Ride - whereas the Plus comes with a Sport mode in addition to these two.  Vida VX2 price and colours The Vida VX2 is available in seven colours - blue, black, yellow, red, white, grey and orange - with the latter two only available on the Plus variant. The Go variant is priced at Rs 59,490 (with BaaS) and Rs 99,490 (without it), while the Plus commands Rs 64,990 (with BaaS) and Rs 1.10 lakh (without it).  All prices ex-showroom, Delhi Also See: Ather Rizta S 3.7kWh launched at Rs 1.38 lakh TVS iQube 3.1 launched at Rs 1.10 lakh",
