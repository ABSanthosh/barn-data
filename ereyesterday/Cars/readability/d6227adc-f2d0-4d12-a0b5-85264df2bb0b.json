  "description": "This 2023 Rimac Nevera is the sixth of a planned 150 examples designated for production and was ordered new by the Ohio-based Triple F Collection, to whom it was delivered in the presence of Rimac founder and CEO Mate Rimac at Rimac of Naples in Florida in June 2023. Finished in pearlescent Nevera Blue over blue leather, the car is powered by four permanent-magnet electric motors that drive all four wheels via four independent inverters and four single-speed gearboxes in three housings. Additional features include a carbon-fiber monocoque with an integrated 120-kWh lithium manganese nickel battery pack, a 22-kW three-phase charging system, electro-hydraulic Carbon Ceramic Material for Racing brakes with six-piston calipers, electronically adjusted dampers, software-controlled torque vectoring, staggered-width 20” polished Vertex wheels, adaptive aerodynamics, and three TFT screens with a configurable driver display, infotainment, and telemetric data. This Nevera has 1,371 miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owners with a copy of its window sticker, a clean Carfax report, a charging cable, two key fobs in a numbered case, a cover, and a clean Ohio title that lists the car as a 2023 Bugatti.",

Finished in pearlescent Nevera Blue over blue leather, the car is powered by four permanent-magnet electric motors that drive all four wheels via four independent inverters and four single-speed gearboxes in three housings. Additional features include a carbon-fiber monocoque with an integrated 120-kWh lithium manganese nickel battery pack, a 22-kW three-phase charging system, electro-hydraulic Carbon Ceramic Material for Racing brakes with six-piston calipers, electronically adjusted dampers, software-controlled torque vectoring, staggered-width 20” polished Vertex wheels, adaptive aerodynamics, and three TFT screens with a configurable driver display, infotainment, and telemetric data. This Nevera has 1,371 miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owners with a copy of its window sticker, a clean Carfax report, a charging cable, two key fobs in a numbered case, a cover, and a clean Ohio title that lists the car as a 2023 Bugatti. Founded in 2009 by Mate Rimac, Croatian manufacturer Rimac Automobili unveiled the Nevera under the name “C_Two” at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show as a follow-up to the company’s debut model, the Concept One. Named after the sudden lightning storms that occur along the Croatian Adriatic coast, the Nevera entered production in 2022, and in subsequent testing, set a top speed record for electric cars at 258 mph, followed by 23 acceleration and braking records reported by Rimac on a German test track in June 2023. This example is one of two cars delivered as the second and third Neveras to arrive in the US. The chassis incorporates a carbon-fiber monocoque that utilizes the battery pack as a structural element and features a bonded carbon-fiber roof panel as well as a carbon-fiber rear subframe and carbon-fiber and aluminum crash structures. The carbon-fiber body panels are finished in pearlescent Nevera Blue, a €20k option, with the Carbon Level 2 Package, an €80k option that added exposed gloss carbon-fiber accents. Active aerodynamic elements include a front hood flap, a front underbody flap, rear valance flaps, and a rear wing. Additional design touches include butterfly doors, dual carbon-fiber side mirrors, and necktie-shaped side channels, the latter a nod to the cravat’s significance in Croatian culture. The polished Vertex wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires measuring 275/35ZR20 up front and 315/35ZR20 at the rear. Stopping is handled via electro-hydraulic brake-by-wire actuation of six-piston calipers over 390mm-diameter CCM-R cross-drilled and ventilated rotors with cooling ducts at each corner. Double-wishbone suspension incorporates electronically adjusted coilover dampers as well as anti-roll bars at front and rear. The car is equipped with a hydraulic lift system. The cabin is trimmed in blue leather with white accents and white and blue stitching over power-adjustable Sabelt carbon-fiber-backed seats, while matching blue leather covers the door panels, upper and lower dashboard, and console. Additional features include blue leather floor mats, anodized metal accents, billet aluminum knobs that control drive modes and incorporate climate control vents, and a central touchscreen that handles infotainment, amenity controls, and telemetric display. Rimac Driver Coach provides instructions based on input from 12 ultrasonic sensors, 13 cameras, and six radars. The three-spoke steering wheel is wrapped in blue leather with a white centering stripe and sits ahead of a configurable NFT display. The digital odometer shows 1,371 miles. A passenger-side screen displays telemetric information. The powertrain comprises four electric motors incorporating surface-mounted permanent magnets and carbon sleeves, with each front motor rated at 226 kW and the rear units rated at 450 kW apiece. Power is delivered to each wheel via four independent inverters, two separate single-speed front gearboxes, and two single-speed rear gearboxes sharing one housing. Rimac All-Wheel Torque Vectoring calculates torque output per wheel and is configurable by the driver. Total output is factory rated at 1,914 horsepower and 1,741 lb-ft of torque. The 120-kWh lithium manganese nickel battery pack is charged via a 22-kW three-phase system. Service performed since delivery is said to have included a software update. Number 006 out of 150 is marked on the firewall. The window sticker lists the original colors and equipment and includes €136k in options for a total suggested retail price of €2,136,000. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other issues and includes five entries with mileage reports. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
