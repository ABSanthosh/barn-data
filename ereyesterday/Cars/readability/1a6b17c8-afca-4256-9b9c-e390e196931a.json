  "text": "Fines would apply per cover sold and could slow a growing trend in the state 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers California bill would raise penalties for making or selling license plate blockers in the state. As of now, the fine is $250 per plate, but lawmakers want to increase that to $10,000. Assemblywoman Catherine Stefani says blockers contribute to theft, robbery, and toll evasion. Across the US, a certain breed of drivers is finding new ways to dodge tolls thanks to a little help from technology. From plate flippers to blockers, some motorists have turned avoiding identification into something of an art form. Now, California is looking to clamp down harder not just on drivers, but also on companies making and selling the devices. If the state gets its way, offenders could be looking at a $10,000 fine for every single unit made or sold. More: California’s Running Out Of License Plate Numbers Faster Than It Thought According to California Assemblywoman Catherine Stefani, her bill, titled AB 1085, is designed to give the state a stronger hand. It turns what is already an illegal act, manufacturing or selling any device that obscures a license plate, into a far riskier proposition. As it stands, those who commit that crime in the state are subject to a $250 fine every time they make or sell such a device. The new bill would make that fine $10,000 when everything is said and done. “These devices have become a tool for lawbreakers,” said Assemblymember Stefani. “They’re linked to vehicle thefts, robberies, and toll evasion – undermining public safety and costing the state millions in lost transportation revenue. This bill ensures that enforcement can keep pace with technology designed to deceive.” No doubt the technology she’s talking about is advancing. Scofflaws have their choice from devices that flip plates to those that cover them physically or with electro-tinting. It’s not just those trying to avoid tolls that use these tools, though. The San Francisco Standard reports that speeders and reckless drivers are using it to avoid consequences. That should come as no surprise given the type of driving we’ve reported on respective to both coasts. In other cases, it’s burglars using them. Interestingly, the state tells Carscoops that it actually changed the bill to keep the total fees from exceeding $10,000. On April 8, the bill text was amended to read $2,500 rather than $10,000 per fine. We asked the state what that was about, and here’s what a spokesperson told us.

So the new number in the bill will amount to about $10,000 per violation in the real world when implemented.” Granted, this bill has a lot of sifting through the government before it becomes law, but it seems like it’s inching forward.
