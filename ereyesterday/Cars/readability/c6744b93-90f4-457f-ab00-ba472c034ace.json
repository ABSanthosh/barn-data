  "description": "A 372-mile journey from Phoenix to California in a Bentley Continental GT is no hardship The US is so big that you tend to default to jumping on a plane for any intercity journey. Indeed, the Google Maps journey planner in North America treats plane journeys the same way as it does train journeys here. For example: Phoenix, Arizona, to San Diego, California, is given as a 1hr 25min flight for £77 or a six-hour, 372-mile drive. The former is the easy option and something often necessitated by time. Yet fortunate timing on recent back-to-back work events and a Bentley Continental GT that needed repatriating to California meant that I could at last take the latter option and go on a proper journey, rather than just a trip. Phoenix itself seemed to go on forever and was most notable from the road for its admirable commitment to listing every single fast-food outlet available at each highway junction. Once west of Phoenix, I headed south at Buckeye – less impressive than it sounds – then west again onto Interstate 8 at Gila Bend, a rather sad place that felt like it had been left behind by the modern world.
