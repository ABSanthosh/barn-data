The tank features a welded hull and a hydraulically operated turret with a de-milled 37mm M6 gun, while power is provided by dual 346ci Cadillac L-head V8 gasoline engines that send power to the tracks via dual four-speed Hydramatic automatic transmissions and a single dual-speed transfer case. Additional features include adjustable seating for a driver, co-driver, commander/loader, and gunner as well as a Signal Corps radio, periscopes, and ammunition storage. This M5A1 is now offered by the selling dealer in Taft, California, on a bill of sale. The M5 entered production in April 1942 as a development of the M3 platform adapted to utilize power from Cadillac V8 engines in lieu of the M3’s radial engine, which was vulnerable to short supply due to demand for aircraft applications. The updated M5A1 variant arrived in late 1942 with an extended turret allowing space for a more powerful radio. This example’s welded hull is finished in olive drab with white stenciled graphics and features dual headlights, dual hatches with tracks for a windshield on the driver’s side, knock-out plugs ahead of both the driver and co-driver, and a machine-gun port at the right of the glacis. The turret is positioned on a hydraulically operated traverse and features a gyrostabilizer and a de-milled 37mm M6 gun, while the tank’s .30-caliber machine guns are absent. The dual-pin steel tracks feature rubber tread blocks and roll under four spoked road wheels on each side, while also utilizing idler wheels at the rear of the tank and three return rollers each. The Stuart M5A1 uses vertical volute suspension. The turret hosts height-adjustable seats for a tank commander/loader and a gunner. Equipment includes a Signal Corps radio, ammunition boxes, and provisions for three periscopes. The hull houses adjustable seating for a driver and co-driver, each provided with ceiling-mounted steering tillers and an accelerator pedal. The instrument panel hosts a single 80-mph speedometer and an ammeter flanked by individual tachometers and gauges monitoring oil pressure and coolant temperature for each engine. The odometer is not legible, and mileage is unknown. The dual 346ci Cadillac V8 gasoline engines feature side valves, downdraft carburetors, and horizontally mounted radiators. Output was rated at 110 horsepower each, which is sent via two Hydro-Matic four-speed transmissions to a single two-speed transfer case.
