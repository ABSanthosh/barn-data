  "description": "Like its predecessor, the KTM 390 Adventure X undercuts its higher-spec counterpart and aims to deliver 90 percent of the experience at a much more affordable rate. For 2025, this motorcycle is all-new from the ground up, featuring more performance, better features and improved handling for just Rs 11,000 more than the outgoing model. The 390 Adventure X misses out on cruise control.   KTM 390 Adventure X design and quality (7/10) High resolution TFT adds to the appeal of this motorcycle What impressed me was the bright headlight that offers commendable illumination, and it might just be the best in class for now. I’m also happy to see that KTM has equipped this bike with the new TFT and ditched the monotone LCD from the older ‘X’ model. This new screen is vibrant and clear, giving the bike a premium feel. Switchgear quality is also solid, aside from the missing rocker switch for cruise control. The seating posture on the 390 Adventure is upright and commanding   KTM 390 Adventure X riding position and comfort (8/10) The X has the same ergonomics as the 390 Adventure, with a slightly lower seat height Apart from a slightly shorter seat height, the X is identical to the regular 390 Adventure. The posture is upright and commanding yet comfortable. However, the large windscreen isn’t adjustable, so you’re robbed of some of that sweet cooling airflow in this scorching heat at city speeds. Also, the seat remains quite firm, leading to saddle soreness after about an hour or two, which isn’t ideal for long-distance touring. While those shortcomings are worth noting, they’re far from being dealbreakers. The X corners surprsingly well and feels quite planted   KTM 390 Adventure X performance and refinement (8/10) In our tests, the 390 Adventure X managed a 0-100kph time of just 6.04s While this motorcycle packs the same motor as the standard 390 Adventure, it feels a lot more tame and approachable. This is because the X runs on what’s essentially the equivalent of Road Mode on the standard 390 Adventure. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does make the bike feel rather mellow and un-KTM-like in its performance.  That said, performance is about the same as the standard 390 ADV, and this is the quickest bike in this segment. Despite the alloy wheels, the X can manage mild trails   Another surprise win? Less tyre noise. It was something I noticed on the standard bike, but here, it’s noticeably quieter. One letdown, though, is the quickshifter that requires a fair bit of force to engage and was mostly unusable on our test bike. That said, the X’s light clutch makes shifting manually easy and enjoyable. Moving on to braking, the X performs nearly on par with its counterpart despite missing out on sintered brake pads. Our braking tests showed nearly identical numbers between the two bikes, although the feel at the lever isn’t as good as the standard ADV. Seat height and weight are slightly down by 5mm and 1kg, respectively, which, while not massive, are both changes in the right direction. Unlike the 390 Adventure, the X uses organic brake pads that perform nearly on par   KTM 390 Adventure X ride comfort and handling (8/10) The X's non-adjustable suspension performs better than the higher spec adjustable suspension Despite running non-adjustable suspension and alloy wheels, the X still manages to feel pretty capable off-road. With the same 200mm/205mm wheel travel at both ends, it’ll do nearly all of what the full-spec 390 Adventure can, just with reduced confidence and feedback from the smaller front wheel. In fact, for on-road comfort, both Rishaad and I found ourselves preferring the non-adjustable setup on the X since it felt less fussy and a little more absorptive of poor road surfaces. Graphics and interface make the TFT feel upmarket.   KTM 390 Adventure X features and safety (8/10) Missing list of features aren't dealbreakers in any way The ‘X’ misses out on features like cruise control, riding modes, cornering ABS, adjustable brake and clutch levers, tubeless spoke wheels and an adjustable front fork. Cruise control was the only feature I truly missed and would’ve appreciated. Yes, it makes highway miles easier, but given the cost savings, I can live without it. The 390 Adventure X is considerably more affordable than the standard 390 Adventure.   KTM 390 Adventure X price and verdict (9/10) The ‘X’ costs Rs 77,000 less than the 390 Adventure Given the price difference, the 390 Adventure X makes a very strong case for itself. It delivers almost everything you’d want from the 390 Adventure platform at a pocket-friendly rate. For those skilled enough to push this platform to its limits, KTM still offers the fully specced 390 Adventure and even the Enduro R for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. But if you’re hunting for an affordable, lightweight ADV that punches well above its price tag, the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure X delivers. And if you’re not exactly ‘Ready to Race’, Royal Enfield’s Himalayan costs about the same and offers more all-around usability and comfort, although it feels much bigger and heavier.
