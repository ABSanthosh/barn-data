  "text": "This Land Cruiser features a host of upgrades, including a new multi-link suspension and 37-inch off-road tires November 7, 2024 at 19:55 by Brad Anderson Westcott Designs reimagined the 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser as a Baja-ready racer. Upgrades include a new multi-link suspension, Fox shock and 37-inch Toyo tires.. The beefed-up 4×4 is currently on display at Toyota’s SEMA booth in Las Vegas. Plenty of dramatic Toyota Land Cruisers are on show at SEMA this year, and this example, brought to life by Westcott Designs, is one of the most eye-catching. The vision for the 4×4 was to turn it into a proper racing machine that could conquer the Baja 500 while still retaining many of the standard model’s features. Starting with a 2024 Land Cruiser First Edition, Westcott’s team gave it a fresh lick of glossy black paint that was then adorned with a satin PPF, giving the SUV this unique exterior finish. The tuner then bolted on a set of 17-inch Innovate Racing G700 wheels with a billet gold finish, beautifully contrasting the Toyota’s paint. These wheels are wrapped in 37-inch Toyo Open Country NTR Desert Race tires. Read: Toyota Made A New Land Cruiser Pickup And A 2-Door 2025 4Runner For SEMA Plenty of other gold-colored parts are found across the exterior, including the badges and exterior screws. New multi-link suspension with Fox shocks promises to transform how the 4×4 handles the open road and there are new upper and lower linkages manufactured from billet machined aluminum, also anodized gold. Up front, there’s an incredible 22-inches of travel while at the rear, there’s 18-inches of travel. Skid plates have also been installed to protect the underbody. Lighting is another area where Westcott didn’t hold back. Like a legitimate Baja competitor, ensuring the Land Cruiser had lights capable of lighting up the environment ahead was important. Mounted to the roof are seven six-inch LED off-road lights, while mounted below the front grille are a further five six-inch lights. A new fuel cell adds to the Land Cruiser’s competition credentials and includes fuel fillers on both sides. Completing the raft of modifications are new Sparco Evo S QRT racing seats with five-point harnesses and trimmed in leather with gold stitching. Those attending SEMA who are interested in seeing Westcott’s design in person can visit the Toyota booth.",
