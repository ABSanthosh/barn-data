Having 626 miles, it was ordered with all four factory options including forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, painted white stripes, and a McIntosh stereo system. The car is finished in Mark IV Red over Ebony leather and is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, Sparco seats, and air conditioning. This Ford GT was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The GT took inspiration from the GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features an extruded-aluminum space frame, roll-bonded floors, and aluminum body panels. This example is one of 348 finished in Mark IV Red for the model year and features optional over-the-top white stripes and Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 626 miles. Blemishes are visible on the steering wheel emblem. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
