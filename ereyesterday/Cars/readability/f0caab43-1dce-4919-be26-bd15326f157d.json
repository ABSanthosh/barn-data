Assigned Kar Kraft number 1661, the car was originally delivered to Henderson Ford of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and it was reportedly fitted with a replacement 429ci engine block under prior ownership. Acquired by the seller in 2011, the car was refinished in Candyapple Red in 2013 and features black upholstery, a four-speed manual transmission, a Traction-Lok differential, power steering, 15″ Magnum 500 wheels, the Interior Decor Group, a center console, an AM radio, and front disc brakes. This Mustang Boss 429 is now offered with an Elite Marti Report, an owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The Boss 429 was offered for the 1969 and 1970 model years in order to homologate the 429 engine for use in NASCAR. Production was completed by Kar Kraft of Brighton, Michigan, and each example was given a serialized number. This car was assigned serial number 1661, and it was refinished in Candyapple Red with white Boss 429 fender decals at O’Quin Restoration of Amarillo, Texas, in 2012 and 2013. Features include a front spoiler, dual side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. The 15″ Magnum 500 wheels are mounted with Goodyear Polyglas GT white-letter tires. The Boss 429 model was equipped with revised control arms, a higher-rate front anti-roll bar than other Mustangs, a rear anti-roll bar, and a competition suspension with staggered rear shocks. Power-assisted brakes with discs up front and drums out back were standard on the 429, with the front brakes reinforced with heavy-duty hubs and rotors as well as oversized spindles. Power-assisted steering was also equipped from the factory. The cabin features high back bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in black vinyl along with simulated woodgrain appliqués on the dash, center console, and door panels. Interior appointments include an AM radio, an analog clock, and deluxe seatbelts with a reminder light. The steering wheel frames a 120-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for temperature and fuel level. Controls for the choke and hood scoop are located on a bracket below the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 32k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. Kar Kraft was commissioned by Ford to modify Cobra Jet Mustangs with a larger 429ci V8 featuring “crescent”-shaped hemispherical combustion chambers. Factory equipment included an aluminum intake manifold and a four-barrel Holley carburetor, and output was rated at 375 horsepower when new. This car was fitted with a replacement service block under prior ownership, and “HP 429” casting marks are pictured in the gallery below. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission and a Traction-Lok differential. The seller states the rear end was serviced in January 2021. The Elite Marti Report indicates initial delivery to Henderson Ford of Ann Arbor, along with factory equipment, colors, production numbers, and a build date of April 2, 1969.
