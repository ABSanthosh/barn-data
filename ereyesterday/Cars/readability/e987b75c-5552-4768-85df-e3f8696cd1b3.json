  "text": "While the car gains a little weight, it still has an excellent 49:51 front to rear weight distribution January 14, 2025 at 19:24 by Brad Anderson The new Vantage Roadster has the same upgraded 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 as the Coupe. Coupled to the engine is an eight-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. Deliveries will start in the second quarter, but prices haven’t been announced. It was only a matter of time before the new Aston Martin Vantage spawned a Roadster version, and here it is. Just like the Coupe, the Vantage Roadster combines the British brand’s iconically beautiful styling with some serious grunt. Not only does it offer way more performance than the old model, but it has almost as much power as the DB12 Volante. Without further ado, let’s dive in. As with its Coupe sibling, the new Aston Martin Vantage Roadster has the marque’s latest and greatest 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8. This engine is good for 656 hp and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque – huge gains of 153 hp and 85 lb-ft (115 Nm) over the previous-gen model. These gains have been achieved with larger turbochargers, revised camshaft profiles, and optimizations to the compression ratio. Read: 2025 Aston Martin Vantage Stuns With 656 HP V8 And Styling Like Its Big Brothers Mated to the beefy V8 is an eight-speed transmission and an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential transmitting power to the rear wheels. Aston says the car can hit 60 mph (96 km/h) in just 3.5 seconds and tops out at 202 mph (325 km/h). Convertibles typically weigh more than the hardtops they’re based on and it’s no different here. However, Aston Martin has kept the weight gains to a minimum, only adding 132 lbs (60 kg), which will be undetectable by most drivers. The car has a 49:51 front-to-rear weight distribution, double wishbone suspension at the front, and a multi-link setup at the rear. Aston Martin has also equipped it with Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers. Not just a big engine All new Vantage Roadsters will leave the factory equipped with model-specific Michelin Pilot Sport S 5 tires and huge carbon ceramic brakes. There are also eight different settings for the traction control, allowing owners to tailor their driving experience to different conditions. Plenty of engineering has gone into the folding roof. It has a Z-folding action and can be opened or closed at speeds of up to 31 mph (50 km/h) and takes just 6.8 seconds. According to Aston Martin, this makes it “the fastest fully automatic deployable roof mechanism on the market.” The roof can also be opened or closed remotely using the key. All Vantage Roadster models come standard with an 11-speaker audio system, and an optional one developed alongside Bowers \u0026 Wilkins is also available. That’s good news for audiophiles out there, but let’s be honest: the snarling V8 is the best musical instrument of all.   Deliveries to start in Q2 “The technical and dynamic capability of New Vantage delivered outstanding performance; far beyond any other preceding Vantage and it is now seen as a true class leading sports car,” Aston Martin chief executive Adrian Hallmark described. “Vantage Roadster was no different feat in that it is a fully reinvented experience, with all the benefits of the Coupe and no compromise to refinement or performance through meticulous work by our engineering and dynamics teams. Vantage Roadster delivers a world-class roof-down driving experience like no other.” Customer deliveries have been penciled in for the second quarter of this year. Aston Martin is yet to release pricing information.",
