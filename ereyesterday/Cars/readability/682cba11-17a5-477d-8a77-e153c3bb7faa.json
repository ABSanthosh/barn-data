  "description": "Jaguar, which is reinventing itself as an EV-only brand, has revealed its new logo as well as additional elements that will make up its new corporate identity. Jaguar Device Mark The Jaguar lettering is now presented in a new font, which is rounder and more open. The company calls the Jaguar lettering the Device Mark, and it uses a mix of upper and lower case characters. Jaguar Artist Mark Next is the Artist Mark, which is a monogram consisting of the ‘j’ and ‘r’ letters from the new font and held within a circle. Thanks to the font’s design, the Artist Mark appears right-side-up even when turned upside down. Jaguar Strikethrough Also new is what the company calls the ‘Strikethrough’, a series of horizontal lines that could appear on their own but also with other elements upon them as presented in two iterations so far: one in which a single line breaks open to carry the new lettering and the other with the ‘leaper’, the famed leaping cat logo. Jaguar Makers Mark    The Strikethrough carrying the leaping cat logo is the Makers Mark, and the leaper appears to be the only carryover from the company’s previous brand identity.   New Jaguar brand identity details Besides the aforementioned elements, the company said it will use vibrant and exuberant colours as “a cornerstone of Jaguar’s new brand identity” and “always presented with texture or movement”. While details as to how and where these new design elements will appear are sparse at the moment, the company said the Makers Mark will be “used as a flourish or finishing touch”, thus indicating that the famed leaping cat may not adorn the cars’ bonnet or face. Also missing in the new designs is the Roaring Jaguar monogram, which carried a roaring Jaguar’s face and the lettering above it, and the 3D leaper emblem that used to adorn the bonnets of older models. On the decision to do away with much of the past designs, Rawdon Glover, managing director of Jaguar, said, “We can’t present a bold new Jaguar by only looking to the past, but at the same time, we understand and value our provenance, and that’s why, along with the many exciting new designs, you will still see the leaper but presented in a new fashion.” More will be known about the company’s new brand identity on December 2 at the Miami Art Week, where it will unveil a new concept that will serve as a vision of what its new electric car would look like. The production version of that model already began testing on public roads last week.
