  "description": "This 1988 Lamborghini Countach is one of approximately 610 examples of the 5000 Quattrovalvole variant produced between 1985 and 1988. The US-market car was brought to Canada around 15 years ago and underwent a repaint in its current red finish by Lamborghini Montreal in 2020. It rides on gold-finished 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and features a European-specification front bumper and a V-shaped rear wing along with pop-up headlights and scissor doors. Inside, fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in Champagne leather are accompanied by a Raid steering wheel paired with a gated shifter as well as an Alpine AM/FM cassette stereo and air conditioning. Power is supplied by a 5.2-liter quad-cam V12 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work completed in 2024 prior to the selling dealer's 2025 acquisition involved an engine-out service as well as installation of a replacement clutch assembly. Now showing 13k kilometers (~8k miles), this Countach 5000 QV is offered by the selling dealer with manufacturer's literature, a tool kit, partial service records, and Connecticut registration.",

It rides on gold-finished 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and features a European-specification front bumper and a V-shaped rear wing along with pop-up headlights and scissor doors. Inside, fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in Champagne leather are accompanied by a Raid steering wheel paired with a gated shifter as well as an Alpine AM/FM cassette stereo and air conditioning. Power is supplied by a 5.2-liter quad-cam V12 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work completed in 2024 prior to the selling dealer’s 2025 acquisition involved an engine-out service as well as installation of a replacement clutch assembly. Now showing 13k kilometers (~8k miles), this Countach 5000 QV is offered by the selling dealer with manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, partial service records, and Connecticut registration. Introduced as a prototype in 1971, the Countach was designed by Bertone’s Marcello Gandini with angular wedge-shaped styling and scissor doors. The car features a tubular steel space frame under aluminum bodywork as well as NACA ducts aft of the doors and air intakes above the rear quarters. The 5000 QV model debuted in 1985 and utilized Kevlar front and rear deck lids. This example was stripped and underwent bodywork prior to a repaint in red by Lamborghini Montreal in June 2020. Further details include a European-specification front bumper as well as pop-up headlights, fog lights, and a V-shaped rear wing. Paint meter readings are shown in the gallery. Gold-finished 15″ Ruote OZ wheels are mounted with 225/50 front and 345/35 rear Pirelli P Zero Asimmetrico tires. A Ruote OZ–branded spear with an older Michelin tire is stored in the front trunk. The Countach features a fully independent suspension with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. The cockpit features fixed-back bucket seats upholstered in Champagne leather along with a matching center console, lower dashboard, and door panels. Interior appointments include an Alpine AM/FM cassette stereo and a Veglia digital clock along with air conditioning and manual-crank windows. The leather-wrapped Raid steering wheel is paired with a dogleg-pattern gated shifter. Jaeger instrumentation includes a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline along with gauges for battery voltage, oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 13k kilometers (~8k miles), approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. The Bizzarrini-designed 5.2-liter V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was factory rated at 420 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out service in 2024 included rebuilding the distributor, ignition unit, and water pump in addition to replacing the spark plugs, exhaust seals, and rear engine mounts as well as the fuel injectors and seals. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the former of which is mounted in the middle of the car, ahead of the engine. The clutch assembly and slave cylinder were replaced in 2024. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage from its first entry in May 2002. The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its Connecticut registration, which displays “antique” under the registered usage section. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
