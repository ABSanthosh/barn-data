A whopping 24,000 visitors sashayed their way through the scores of custom bikes and cars during the one-day show, displaying a sort of organized hubbub typical of Japanese events. Among them were our friends Marc Holstein and Christine Gabler; a formidable German photography duo with a deep love for Japan and her culture. With an invite to the much quieter setup day, Marc and Christine captured the show’s most intriguing machines in vivid detail, before returning the next day to document the colorful whirlwind that is the Mooneyes show. We’ve already profiled a couple of hits from the show; Sureshot’s zany Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 and 46Works’ stylish Ducati Monster 900. And we were pleased to hear that FNG Works’ twin-engine Yamaha RXZ made it to Yokohama too, bagging a handful of accolades in the process. As for the rest, here’s the lowdown on the 2024 Mooneyes show, in Marc’s words, with a selection of Marc and Christine’s finest images. Marc Holstein The 2024 Mooneyes event is a wrap, and as always, it was an incredible experience. It was a pleasure reconnecting with old friends and meeting new custom builders. The Yokohama Custom Show remains heavily focused on showcasing the world’s finest choppers. Still, every now and then, you can spot a café racer amidst the sea of Panheads, Shovelheads, and Knuckleheads. As with every Mooneyes show, the experience was truly exceptional. The organizers have an incredible talent for curating an event that brings together some of the most inspiring and interesting builders, creating an atmosphere that is entirely unique and unmatched. One of the aspects I particularly love about wandering through the alleys is discovering the Japanese artists and artisans showcasing their work at their booths. This time, I found myself drawn to the Dice booth, which featured exquisite custom belts. I couldn’t resist having one made in my size—it’s a piece of art in itself! Beyond the motorcycles, the cars on display were equally impressive. The craftsmanship and artistry, especially in the paint jobs on the custom bikes, were astonishing. Japanese builders have mastered perfection in this area, and in my opinion, there’s nothing else like it in the world. It was also an absolute pleasure to see Shinya Kimura, a true legend in the custom scene, participating in the ride-in. Royal Enfield’s engagement with the show is also worth mentioning—they’re consistently connecting with and supporting the custom motorcycle culture, which adds to the event’s appeal. Editors note BMW Motorrad, Harley-Davidson, and Indian Motorcycle are all co-sponsors of the show too, validating the impact that it has on the motorcycle scene at large. Choosing a favorite among so many outstanding builds is always a challenge, but for me, Beware Choppers’ Knucklehead and Pangea Speed’s Panhead stood out. Christine’s favorite build was Cheetah’s bike, which had a custom frame with a super rare Koslow Chicago engine. The vibe, as always, was fantastic. Japan in December is an unforgettable experience that’s worth traveling for. The weather was mild and pleasant, making the trip even more enjoyable. In fact, I went surfing in Chiba the day before the show; the perfect way to round out an amazing visit. Images by, and with sincere gratitude to, Marc Holstein and Christine Gabler",
