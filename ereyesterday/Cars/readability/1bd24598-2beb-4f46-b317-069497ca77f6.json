  "description": "The full-fat Range Rover is going all-electric for the first time, but will it be any good? We drive a prototype to find some clues This is the new electric Range Rover, in still-secret prototype form. And we've driven it off-road. Join Matt Saunders here as he guides you through the new Range Rover EV's technical details, some of which are still to be confirmed. What we can tell you is that it'll have two motors, one at each end, totalling 542bhp. There's a 118kWh battery underneath the car too, which because it's a stressed element helps make this the strongest Range Rover yet built. It may well be the heaviest too, but we'll know more about that when final details are released, ahead of the car's launch this coming autumn. For now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the sound of silence as this exceptionally quiet EV goes about its off-roading business.
