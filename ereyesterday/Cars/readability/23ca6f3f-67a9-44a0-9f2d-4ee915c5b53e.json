Equipment includes Ebony cloth and Miko suede upholstery, the R-Electronics Package, a cat-less exhaust system, black and red racing stripes, 19″ carbon-fiber wheels, Brembo brakes, a carbon-fiber wing, and Recaro seats. The car spent time in New York before the seller’s 2021 purchase, and they have since added approximately 3k of the 11k indicated miles. This GT350R is now offered with a window sticker, an owner’s supplement, a car cover, a scale model, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Lead Foot Gray (JX) with optional over-the-top black racing stripes with red accents, and matte Lead Foot Gray vinyl wrap has been installed. Other exterior details comprise HID projector headlights, a carbon-composite front grille, functional hood and fender vents, a front splitter with the Shelby logo, a carbon-fiber wing, LED taillights with sequential turn signals, and quad exhaust outlets. The black 19″ carbon-fiber seven-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires measuring 305/30 up front and 325/30 out back. The R-specification suspension features a MagneRide damping system, and braking is handled by two-piece brake rotors with Brembo calipers at all four corners. The Recaro sport seats are trimmed in Ebony cloth and Miko suede with red stitching and “R” headrest embroidery. The rear seat is omitted on R models, and equipment includes a rearview camera, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, and SYNC 3 infotainment with a touchscreen and voice-activated navigation. The passenger-side dashboard plaque designates this GT350R as chassis JR233. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with an 8,250-rpm redline, auxiliary gauges, and a central multi-function digital display. Additional gauges for oil pressure and oil temperature are mounted in the center stack. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The 5.2-liter Voodoo V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft along with dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing, and an engine oil cooler. A commemorative plaque displays the signature of the engine builder, and factory-rated output was 526 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque. Additional coolers for the engine, transmission, and differential were standard. The oil was changed, and the fuel pump sender assembly and battery were replaced in January 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec TR-3160 six-speed manual transmission and a 3.73:1 Torsen limited-slip differential. The catalytic converters have been removed. The window sticker notes initial delivery to World Ford Pensacola in Florida and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total MSRP of $69,115. A car cover, an owner’s supplement, a scale model, and service records are also included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
