Every 2025 BMW i7 does see a meaningful addition to the standard equipment list: the Panoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof. The fancy glass roof is what most consider to be mandatory in an opulent ride like the i7, and we’d agree. Massaging seats and the Luxury Rear Seating Package are now standard on the i7 xDrive60 model. But, other than that, the 2025 BMW i7 carries the electrified full-size luxury sedan torch unchanged.2025 BMW i7 Electric Motor and PerformanceThree flavors when shopping for an i7: eDrive50, xDrive60, and M70. The entry-level i7 eDrive50 comes with 449 horsepower and accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds. xDrive60 models increase output to 536 horsepower and lower that 0-60 dash to 4.5 seconds. Finally, the i7 M70 rips off 3.5-second zero-to-60 sprints courtesy of 650 horsepower. No matter which you choose, the i7 doesn’t leave you wanting for power.2025 BMW i7 Charging and RangeThe i7 relies on a 101.7-kWh battery to get around its not-inconsiderable heft. Expect to add around 80-90 miles of range in 12 minutes with DC Fast Charging. Slower DC chargers (125A/50 kW) will add 20-30 minutes to that time. Home charging – say, with the BMW Wallbox – restores 90 miles of range in approximately three hours. Buying a 2025 BMW i7 new also grants you a promotional 2,000 kWh credit from Electrify America.The standard i7 can roam up to 314 miles on a full charge, according to BMW. The xDrive60 model shaves down projected maximum range to 311 miles, and the M70 further pares that down to 285 miles. As always, wheel choice plays an important role in maximizing range. For example, 20-inch wheels on the xDrive60 lower expected range to 296 miles.Interior and Cargo SpaceWhether you’re in the front or the back seats, the 2025 BMW i7 boasts an interior a cut above the competition. More opulent options include the 31-inch Theater Screen, Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, and laminated glass. Most of the coolest goodies are bundled in the Executive Package, which includes automatic doors, massaging seats, and a collection of tech. A Luxury Rear Seating Package adds rear ventilated and massaging seats. Notably, Glass Controls come standard.The i7 has a slightly smaller trunk than gas-powered 7ers – 17.7 cubic feet compared to 19.1. You likely won’t notice a difference, as the space is still plenty ample. 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats come standard, allowing your luxury sedan to double as a pretty capable hauler. If, for some reason, you need it to be.2025 i7 Technology and ConnectivityiDrive 8.5 powers a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and 14.9-inch central information display. As with the rest of the BMW lineup, you get wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, voice commands, and MyBMW app integration. A head-up display is standard, too, as is cloud-based navigation if you opt to use the car’s infotainment instead of your phone.Safety and Driver Assistance FeaturesThe i7 comes packed with driver aids. Frontal Collision Warning, Active Blind Spot Detection, Lane Departure Warning all come standard. The Driving Assistance Professional Package – $2,500 regardless of the trim level you opt for – adds Highway Assistant and Active Driving Assistant Pro. That’s a fancy way of saying camera/radar cruise control and hands-free driving up to 85 mph in some scenarios.2025 BMW i7 PricingThe i7 starts at $105,700. xDrive60 variants command nearly $20,000 more, starting at $124,200. The M70 starts at $168,500. If you’re not accustomed to the segment, that may seem like a premium; it really isn’t. Taycan starts at just over $100K, the e-tron GT starts at around $108,000, and the Mercedes-Benz EQS starts at over $105K.The i7 is expensive, but it also comes with a lot of standard features that the competition charges for. A head-up display and ventilated seats, for example, both come standard. While that matters more for shoppers at the lower end (if there is a “lower end” of the six-figure sedan market), it’s still something to consider.2025 BMW i7 FAQDoes the BMW i7 qualify for tax credits?The i7 – like all BMW EVs – qualifies for the $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, which leasing customers will still see the benefits of.Is the i7 M70 worth it?If you can afford it, the nearly $200K super sedan is truly one-of-a-kind. It’s a little light on standard features, unfortunately. If your pockets are particularly deep, though, there’s no reason not to spring for a 650-horsepower 7 Series.How many miles can BMW i7 go?The i7’s claimed maximum range is 314 miles. Real-world tests seem to indicate that to be a pretty reliable number, with ArenaEV managing 314 miles exactly out of an xDrive60 model when traveling at 81 mph. The 56-mph test achieved 342 miles.How much does it cost to charge a BMW i7?Ostensibly nothing if you charge at home, which is what we recommend. Charging prices outside of your home will vary depending on your locale, but expect to pay significantly more than even regular on-peak rates. Importantly, the 2025 BMW i7 benefits from a 2,000 kWh credit with Electrify America – so that will insulate the cost early-on.",

The M70 starts at $168,500. If you’re not accustomed to the segment, that may seem like a premium; it really isn’t. Taycan starts at just over $100K, the e-tron GT starts at around $108,000, and the Mercedes-Benz EQS starts at over $105K.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe i7 is expensive, but it also comes with a lot of standard features that the competition charges for. A head-up display and ventilated seats, for example, both come standard. While that matters more for shoppers at the lower end (if there is a “lower end” of the six-figure sedan market), it’s still something to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2025 BMW i7 FAQ\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"faq-question-1734289435699\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes the BMW i7 qualify for tax credits?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe i7 – like all BMW EVs – qualifies for the $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, which leasing customers will still see the benefits of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"faq-question-1734289459757\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the i7 M70 worth it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can afford it, the nearly $200K super sedan is truly one-of-a-kind. It’s a little light on standard features, unfortunately. If your pockets are particularly deep, though, there’s no reason not to spring for a 650-horsepower 7 Series.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"faq-question-1734289470398\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many miles can BMW i7 go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe i7’s claimed maximum range is 314 miles. Real-world tests seem to indicate that to be a pretty reliable number, with ArenaEV managing 314 miles exactly out of an xDrive60 model when traveling at 81 mph. The 56-mph test achieved 342 miles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"faq-question-1734289501585\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much does it cost to charge a BMW i7?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOstensibly nothing if you charge at home, which is what we recommend. Charging prices outside of your home will vary depending on your locale, but expect to pay significantly more than even regular on-peak rates. Importantly, the 2025 BMW i7 benefits from a 2,000 kWh credit with Electrify America – so that will insulate the cost early-on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
