  "description": "Ever since it came out in 2022, the Hunter 350 has been a runaway success for Royal Enfield. And it's not hard to see why - it's a stylish, well built and reasonably affordable entry point into one of the most aspirational brands in our market. But that's not to say it was a perfect machine and it did have one significant flaw. Recently, Royal Enfield updated the Hunter with changes that kept customer feedback in mind. So, are the Hunter’s drawbacks a thing of the past now?  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 suspension and ride comfort - 8/10 New shocks offer noticeable improvement in ride comfort What was perhaps the biggest problem on the Hunter (and a number of recent Royal Enfield launches) - the stiff rear suspension. For 2025, the company has replaced the earlier model’s linear springs with these progressive units you see here. And in a word, the effect they've had on the ride quality is landmark!  New progressive springs have transfromed the Hunter's ride quality. Whether you're going over big potholes that have started appearing now that the monsoon is here or you're tackling high frequency recurring bumps like thickly painted rumble strips, this rear suspension keeps you reasonably comfortable. Do bear in mind, it's not suddenly become as thoroughly plush as a Classic 350 but the ride comfort on the Hunter is no longer the dealbreaker it once was.  The Hunter's ride quality is no longer the dealbreaker it once was. Even when you’re just sitting on a static bike, you can feel the suspension sagging a little, unlike the previous model. And when you’re tackling uneven patchwork, big potholes, jarring concrete and the myriad of road imperfections that Mumbai’s road infrastructure is littered with, you’re no longer wincing in pain while getting tossed out of the seat like on the older bike. The good news for existing Hunter owners is that you can retrofit these new shocks to an older bike and have this same level of comfort.   Royal Enfield Hunter 350 clutch effort - 9/10 New slip/assist clutch greatly reduces clutch effort, helpful in city traffic Another pain point on the earlier Hunter was its heavy clutch pull, especially inside staccato big city traffic. Royal Enfield has remedied this problem by giving the latest model a slip/assist clutch which has greatly reduced the effort needed to pull in the clutch lever. While it is much lighter (thankfully!) it still has a decent amount of feel. This is especially important because the new riders this bike is aimed at can be deterred by a heavy clutch pull. Slip/assist clutch greatly reduces effort needed to pull the clutch lever, helpful in long traffic jams. And another little cherry atop this cake is that this lighter clutch action will soon be common across RE’s 350cc lineup as they will all be updated with this same slip/assist clutch in the coming months.  More good news is that just like the new suspension units, you can also retrofit this slip/assist clutch to existing Royal Enfield 350cc models. It might not be cheap to do so, but if you spend a lot of time stuck in traffic, your left forearm will thank you for it.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 ride and handling - 8/10 It's wonderfully agile yet never feels unstable  Aside from these two changes, the Hunter is mostly the same as it's always been although there are a few small updates that we’ll talk about further down. This is an accessible and fun machine, and even more so now with our few earlier complaints being addressed.  The Hunter is an agile machine but isn't overly reactive. The best way to describe the Hunter’s demeanour is to say that it is an agile yet surefooted and confidence inspiring machine but not an overly eager one. And that's okay because this is meant to be a relaxed roadster at the end of the day.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 seating comfort - 9/10 Despite its small size, it is roomy for taller riders While it is a compact machine, it's not cramped even for larger riders although with a pillion onboard, it can get a little tight. The company tells us that the handlebar is now a little closer to the rider than before and the seat foam’s density has been reworked, although seat height remains the same at 790mm. The reason behind making these changes has been to improve rider comfort over longer stints in the saddle. Truth be told, the difference is minimal and it's something most riders aren’t likely to notice.  Despite its diminutive size, the Hunter can seat taller riders comfortably. And while it's not aimed at doing long stints in the saddle, you can take the Hunter on longer trips without too much hassle.One change that's sure to help on our unpredictable roads, especially when riding two up or with luggage is the added ground clearance (now up by 10mm to a total of 160mm) Royal Enfield has liberated by rerouting the exhaust piping.  Seat foam density is now revised for added comfort. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 engine sound and refinement - 9/10 Characterful, smooth and torquey, the RE 350cc motor is an absolute peach  One very compelling reason you'd want to take the Hunter on longer rides is that charming engine. It's torquey, smooth, characterful and has a lovely exhaust note to accompany you on your getaways. It remains unchanged with the same 20hp and 27Nm as before. While those numbers aren't spectacular, its the way the torque is delivered, the gentle thump at low speeds and how the motor is absolutely calm at 80-90kph with just a slight pulse through the touch points that makes you want to take the longer route to your destination.  The Hunter's exhaust note also sounds remarkably different to the other 350s and has more of a fast-paced beat to suit its demeanour than its more relaxed siblings.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 headlight performance - 7/10 New LED headlight looks good but its performance is rather average The final change on the Hunter 350 is the LED headlight and this is the same unit that has come from the shared RE parts bin. The previous model’s halogen setup worked well at lighting up a dark road and this new LED headlight provides rather average illumination in comparison to it. That being said, from a purely visual standpoint, the LED suits the modern look of the Hunter more than the earlier bulb headlight. LED headlight looks good but illumination is adequate and is the same as almost every other RE. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 price and verdict - 9/10 Lot of changes for a small increase in price, its a properly compelling option now Summing up, the Hunter 350 is now a really sorted machine and the best part is that Royal Enfield has only increased the price by Rs 7,000 for the mid and top variants, while keeping the starting price the same as it was before. As before, the difference between the mid and top versions is only in the colour schemes. Meanwhile, the base bike has simpler switchgear, wire spoked wheels with tubed tyres and single-channel ABS owing to the rear drum brake. The Hunter is a stylish and well-built machine. With this update, most of the Hunter’s flaws have been ironed out and it's encouraging to see a big company like Royal Enfield address customer feedback so comprehensively. As it stands today, the Hunter is one of the most compelling options in its class and it will surely become an even bigger success for Royal Enfield.",

Meanwhile, the base bike has simpler switchgear, wire spoked wheels with tubed tyres and single-channel ABS owing to the rear drum brake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Royal Enfield Hunter 350 right angle front three quarter static.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Hunter is a stylish and well-built machine.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-4adfe9eb-7fff-4c57-a5ba-ed8992d52f6b\"\u003eWith this update, most of the Hunter’s flaws have been ironed out and it\u0026#39;s encouraging to see a big company like Royal Enfield address customer feedback so comprehensively.
