  "description": "This 1942 Packard Super Eight Custom One-Eighty is the 13th of 15 examples produced with style-1529 Convertible Victoria coachwork designed by Howard “Dutch” Darrin and built by the Sayers and Scovill Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the final year of the Packard-Darrin partnership. It is said to have been purchased in the early 1950s by a California collector who commissioned a refurbishment with the assistance of San Francisco Packard dealer Earle C. Anthony before the car appeared in a September 1953 issue of Road \u0026 Track. It was subsequently sold to an owner in Houston, Texas, and later returned to California, where it served as one of two Packard-Darrins utilized in the filming of the television detective show Banacek. The car then spent time in two New Jersey collections before moving to Florida and then residing in the Michigan-based Adderley Collection for 16 years, during which it is said to have undergone another refurbishment. Finished in maroon over red leather, the car is powered by a 356ci L-head inline-eight that breathes through a single downdraft carburetor and is mated to a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Additional features include hydraulic drum brakes, Safe-T-fleX independent front suspension, a red convertible top, and a push-button radio. This Series 2006 Convertible Victoria was purchased by the selling dealer approximately six months ago and is now offered with a clean Missouri title.",

This Series 2006 Convertible Victoria was purchased by the selling dealer approximately six months ago and is now offered with a clean Missouri title. After spending several years in Paris, American-born Dutch Darrin moved his operations to Los Angeles, where he began courting Hollywood’s elite with his coachbuilt versions of luxury cars in the late 1930s. In 1939, Packard agreed to offer Darrin’s designs as part of its 1940 catalog, and production was moved from Darrin of Paris on Sunset Boulevard to Auburn’s Central Manufacturing body division in Connersville, Indiana. In 1941, Central Manufacturing’s wartime commitments necessitated another shift in bodywork assembly to Cincinnati, where the Convertible Victoria remained in production on the 127”-wheelbase 1906 and 2006 Super Eight platforms through 1942. Around the time of its first refurbishment in California in the 1950s, the car was featured in the September 1953 issue of Road \u0026 Track. This example is finished in maroon and is said to have undergone a refurbishment circa the late 2000s. Features include horizontal side grilles distinct to the model year, cut-down doors, a raked split windshield, dual side mirrors, a cowl-mounted antenna, bright rear fender stone guards, and a red three-position convertible top that can be stowed under a matching boot. Body-color steel wheels wear bright hubcaps and beauty rings and are wrapped in 7.00-16 Denman wide-whitewall tires, as is a matching spare housed in the trunk. Braking is handled hydraulically by drums at each corner, and the shoes were cleaned in 2024. The outer wheel bearings are said to have been repacked at that time. The cabin is trimmed in red pleated leather over the front bucket seats, rear bench, and door panels. Additional features include color-keyed carpeting, roll-up windows, dual rear rolltop ashtrays, a lockable glovebox hosting a clock in its door, a heater, and a pushbutton radio. The clock is inoperable. The beige three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a column-mounted shifter and a Signal-Stat turn signal controller. Instrumentation includes a linear-sweep 110-mph speedometer flanked by gauges monitoring amperage, fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 93k miles, approximately 25 of which have been added under current ownership. The 356ci L-head inline-eight features a nine-main-bearing crankshaft, hydraulic lifters, and a single dual-throat downdraft carburetor. The engine was reportedly fitted with the cylinder head from a Packard 327ci engine in the 1950s. Service performed in 2024 is said to have included an oil change, refreshing of the air filter oil, and replacement of the spark plugs and radiator cap. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission with electric overdrive. Independent front suspension comprises upper A-arms mounted to lever-arm hydraulic shock absorbers, lower A-arms formed by control and torque arms, coil springs, and an anti-roll bar, while the solid-axle rear suspension incorporates leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers. Service in 2024 is said to have included replacement of the front and rear U-joints and replacement of the idler arm bushings. Areas of oxidation are noted on various underside surfaces.
