  "description": "Priced from £54k, the new powertrain packs 242bhp and an electric-only range of up to 59 miles The Volkswagen Multivan and its camper van counterpart the California have gained the four-wheel drive with the introduction of a new plug-in-hybrid powertrain. Priced from £54,525 in the Multivan and £71,295 in the California, the new system comprises a turbocharged 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, a six-speed automatic gearbox and two electric motors (one per axle).  They combine to put out 242bhp, allowing the van to complete the 0-62mph sprint in 9.0sec. A 19.7kWh lithium ion battery gives an electric-only range of up to 59 miles, depending on the chosen model; the California is less energy-efficient, due to its extra weight. The battery can be charged at a rate of up to 50kW on a DC connection or at up to 11kW on AC. Volkswagen said it has devised the PHEV system to run on electric power as often as possible.  The front motor takes priority over its rear-mounted counterpart or the petrol engine. The engine is primarily used to generate electricity, driving the wheels only when the battery is flat or when the gearbox kickdown is activated.  The rear motor is also decoupled from the powertrain above 81mph (130kmh) to improve energy efficiency. The new four-wheel-drive powertrain replaces the Multivan’s previous 1.4-litre PHEV option.",
