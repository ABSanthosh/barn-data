  "text": "You're not going to find another mid-engined, V8-powered Mini truck like this, built in 1994 by GT Developments March 10, 2025 at 20:29 by Brad Anderson The one-off Mini was built by a British expert specializing in Ford GT40 replicas. This bespoke creation features a hand-built custom chassis and rear-wheel drive. Power comes from a Ford-sourced 5.0-liter V8 engine with 300 horses on tap. This pint-sized truck may not be an original Austin Mini pickup, but it is a hugely intriguing creation that we’re sure is an absolute riot to drive. This bold one-off was built in the UK and is heading to auction later this month, where it could sell for between £30,000 (~$38,800) and £35,000 (~$45,200). That may sound like a lot, but you’d be hard-pressed to find another pint-sized truck like this anywhere in the world. The company behind this creation is GT Developments. While that name may not be familiar to you, the British brand was a leader in building Ford GT40 replicas in the late 1990s. It built this Mini pickup in 1994 to show off its engineering prowess, and Iconic Auctioneers has now been tasked with selling it. Watch: Honda-Powered Classic MINI Is A Great Thing To Drive… If You Can Fit In Underpinning this wacky creation is the same hand-built chassis GT Developments used for its GT40 replicas. The company then sourced the body of a Mini Estate but chopped off most of the rear half, morphing it into a pickup. However, the bed is not a storage compartment like most trucks. Instead, it houses the engine. Yep, this is a mid-engined Mini. Not only that, but the engine is a Ford 5.0-liter V8 coupled with a five-speed manual transmission. The engine delivers approximately 300 hp, all of which is sent to the rear wheels. There’s no word on how much the car weighs, but it must be extremely light and can probably make you question a few life decisions behind the wheel that not even a new Ram 1500 TRX can compete with. The auction house notes that the Mini has been equipped with coilovers and upgraded brakes. Inside, the cabin is spartan at best: a half-roll cage, racing harnesses, a pair of black seats, and a simple alloy dashboard are about the extent of the amenities. The shifter is mounted on the driver’s side sill, and the exposed linkage runs directly to the rear of the car. If this wild creation has piqued your interest, it will be up for grabs at auction on Saturday, March 22nd. You can place your bid here.",
