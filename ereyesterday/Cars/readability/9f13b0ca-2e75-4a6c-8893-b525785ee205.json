  "text": "Non-car enthusiasts could easily confuse this with a legit Supra MkIV, though it’s actually a replica based on the sixth-gen Celica February 17, 2025 at 19:34 by Brad Anderson The smaller proportions of the Celica work perfectly with the styling of the Supra. There’s no word on whether the original four-cylinder engine has been upgraded. The seller is asking 99,000 Thai Baht for the Supra replica, or a touch under $12,000. Looks can definitely be deceiving, as what you’re looking isn’t an A80 Toyota Supra. Instead, it is an old Toyota Celica that’s been transformed to resemble a fourth-generation Supra. While enthusiasts will be able to easily tell the difference between this car and a real Supra, it could definitely fool the general public. This Celica is a 1995 model, meaning it’s a sixth-generation car, which was one of the more iconic iterations. It’s been listed up for sale in Thailand for 399,000 Baht, or roughly the equivalent of $11,800 in the US. Read: Toyota Trademarks GR Celica Name While the listing doesn’t provide any details about the process that went into building this distinctive Toyota, a previous owner clearly spent a lot of time modifying it. The front end is classic A80 Supra and has a set of replica headlights that look similar to the real thing, but do have a slightly different shape. The original Celica bumper has also been ditched and replaced with one more similar to the one used by its bigger sibling. We’re particularly fond of the proportions of the car. While it’s obviously smaller than an A80 Supra, we think the new design suits the Celica’s pint-sized footprint perfectly. Styling changes continue with new quarter panels, a custom decklid, Supra badges, and new taillights. There’s also a new bumper and a massive rear wing. Rounding out the upgrades are a set of bronze-colored Volk Racing TE37 wheels and upgraded brakes with yellow calipers. Step inside, and it’s pretty much business as usual with a standard Celica interior. However, there’s a new double-din touchscreen with Android Auto, so at least you won’t be stuck in the 90s when it comes to tech. Unfortunately, the listing doesn’t clarify which Celica version this is or which of the car’s four-cylinder engines it might have under the hood. What we do know is that it has a new stainless steel exhaust, so at the very least, it should make a decent noise when you hit the gas. While this Supra replica might be a hard sell for anyone not living in Thailand, there’s no denying that it’s an interesting take on a classic. Who knows? Maybe this will inspire other Celica owners to roll up their sleeves and give their own cars a Supra-inspired makeover.
