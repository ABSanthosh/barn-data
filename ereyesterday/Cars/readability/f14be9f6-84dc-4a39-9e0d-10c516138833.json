  "text": "It’s not a actually a truck or a roadster, but who cares when this YouTuber’s transformation of a wrecked Model 3 looks this good? 3 hours ago by Chris Chilton A YouTuber is building a “CyberRoadster” coupe from an accident-damaged Tesla sedan. The doors are the only body panels left from the donor car, a black Model 3 Performance. Originally scheduled for a 2020 launch, the real Tesla Roadster is now delayed until 2025 or 2026. We’re now four years past the original scheduled launch date for the Tesla Roadster and there’s no sign of it making a debut until 2025 at the earliest. But rather than wait patiently, one YouTuber built his own, and from what we can see he’s done an awesome job. David Andreyev calls his home-built creation the CyberRoadster, though it’s neither a truck nor a convertible. But now dressed in 12 coats of candy red paint, it looks incredible all the same. His starting point was a crash-damaged black Model 3 Performance, though there’s very little left of the external bodywork. Related: Musk Suggests Tesla Roadster Isn’t A Priority, But Thanks “Long-Suffering Deposit Holders” The roof has been chopped in traditional hot rod style, and every body panel bar the two front doors appears to have been built from scratch or heavily modified. Compared with the concept version of Tesla’s real Roadster, Andreyev’s creation is far more muscular, with a blockier front end and a Dodge Charger Daytona-style hood complemented by wide sill extensions. It also has a transverse light bar in a nod to the Cybertruck, something not seen on Tesla’s other vehicles. And there’s a definite Italian supercar feel to the back end thanks to the combination of a wide black panel splitting the bumper from the rear bodywork and a fake “engine” visible through a glass panel in the rear deck. Andreyev says he still needs to finish the interior, but claims it shouldn’t take long. It certainly won’t be as complicated as building the CyberRoadster’s exterior – the rear quarter panels alone took several months to complete and went through more than 30 iterations. Sure, there are some elements you might change – sticking with the sedan’s front doors means they look too narrow, for instance, and the visibility must be terrible – but considering this was all achieved by one man in his garage without a million-dollar budget, it’s amazing what he’s accomplished. And it gives us hope that creative people will always want to modify cars, no matter what’s under the hood in the years to come. Images: David Andreyev/@cyber_hooligan",
