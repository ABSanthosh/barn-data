  "text": "Chevy says the ZR1X is America's first true hypercar, but it doesn't get the Zora name 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Chevy chose the car’s name to reflect its similarities to the ICE-only Corvette ZR1. With 1,250 hp on tap, there’s no denying that the ZR1X is something very special. Unless GM surprises us, this new model will remain the pinnacle of the C8 range. For more than five years, nearly every mention of the long-awaited, ultimate version of the C8, whether from the media or Corvette fans buffing their cars for the weekend, referred to it as the Zora. Earlier this week, the flagship C8 was finally unveiled, but the Zora name was nowhere to be seen. Read: America’s Everyday Hypercar Versus The World Instead, Chevy has gone with the rather uninspiring ZR1X, a name that sounds more like something a Japanese manufacturer would slap on a performance bike. It’s a missed opportunity, especially considering the Zora name would have been a perfect tribute to Zora Arkus-Duntov, the man often hailed as the father of the mid-engine Corvette. So, What Happened? Now, a Chevy spokesperson has shed some light on why the Zora name wasn’t used. While the carmaker has its reasons for not using the name, it appears that much of the internet continues to refer to the new hybridized ZR1 as the Zora, particularly among high-profile influencers. “ZR1X is an extension of the ZR1 family, so we believe ZR1X is a fitting name for the new variant,” a the spokesperson told Road \u0026 Track. When asked why they didn’t use the name Zora, the spokesperson replied: “I know Zora was broadly speculated by enthusiasts, but since it was future product, it was never something we weighed in on,” he said. “What I can tell you is the team felt this Corvette was deserving of the ZR1 designation, and it was an opportunity to show that even though ZR1 and ZR1X are different cars, they have strong familial resemblance and represent ultimate Corvette performance.” It’s a solid explanation if you’re into corporate-speak, but let’s just say not everyone’s on board. For years, “Zora” was the shorthand for the ultimate C8, so calling it ZR1X feels like a bit of a letdown, especially when you consider the car’s historic significance. Part ZR1, Part E-Ray At the end of the day, Chevy has stuck to normal automotive conventions when naming the ZR1X. It’s similar to how Porsche slaps the RS badge on the ultimate versions of already high-performance models, like the 911 GT3. It serves to highlight the connection between the already impressive ZR1 and the even more extreme X. And to be completely fair to Chevy, they never promised the car would be called Zora, that’s just the name enthusiasts decided to run with. As for what the “X” actually stands for, Road \u0026 Track asked if it was a nod to the all-wheel-drive system or maybe shorthand for “Xtreme.” Chevy disappointed by confirming that neither applies, and there was “no grand scheme behind it.” Apparently, it was all about “sticking close to the ZR1.” Hypercar Performance Names aside, the new ‘Vette is remarkable and has been fittingly referred to as a proper American hypercar when it comes to performance. Most of the car takes after the ZR1, and that includes the same 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged LT7 V8 churning out 1,064 hp at 7,000 rpm and 828 lb-ft (1,122 Nm) of torque at 6,000 rpm. Supplementing this engine is a 1.9 kWh battery pack from the E-Ray and a new electric motor with 186 hp and 145 lb-ft (196 Nm) of torque driving the front wheels. All up, we’re talking a combined 1,250 hp and the ability to hit 60 mph (96 km/h) in under two seconds.",
