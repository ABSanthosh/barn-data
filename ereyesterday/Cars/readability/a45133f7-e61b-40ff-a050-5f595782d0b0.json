  "description": "Three-row cars priced under Rs 15 lakh are extremely popular in the Indian market, thanks to their enhanced seating capacity and versatility. We've put together a list of the 10 most affordable SUVs and MPVs that offer three rows of seating - ideal for larger families or those who need the extra space. 1. Renault Triber Rs 6.1 lakh-8.74 lakh 72hp-1.0-litre petrol  The Renault Triber’s mix of practicality and comfort at this price point is simply unmatched. The middle row seats fold 60:40, can be slid back and forth, and the backrest angle is adjustable too. That said, they are recommended for two passengers. Considering it’s a sub-4 metre MPV, things get interesting in the third row of seats. Accessing them is easy after the second-row seats are moved away, and they offer decent space for average-sized passengers. When not in use, the seats can be removed entirely to open up more luggage room. In our Triber review, we found the B-pillar and roof-mounted AC vents for the respective middle and last row travellers reasonably effective on a hot and humid day. Renault Triber featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatDriver-seat armrestSecond row seats: 60:40 split with slide, recline, fold and tumbleThird row seats: fold and tumble functionSecond and third row AC vents 2. Maruti Ertiga Rs 8.84 lakh-13.13 lakh 103hp-1.5-litre petrol The Maruti Ertiga boasts wide-opening doors, which make ingress and egress easy. Front seats are broad and offer a lot of cushioning, while the second-row seats can be slid back for that extra legroom; also reclinable. The middle row also gets massive windows, which let in more light and provide an airy feel to the cabin. Notably, the seats in the middle only fold and don’t tumble, so accessing the last row may be cumbersome for some. Once at the back, passengers will appreciate the good amount of head and shoulder room on offer. Two adults can sit here on long drives without losing circulation in their legs, and make use of the large side armrests, bottle holders and a charging socket for added convenience. Its Maruti XL6 sibling has a more premium interior but is sold only in a six-seater configuration.

Mahindra Bolero Rs 9.80 lakh-10.91 lakh 76hp-1.5-litre diesel Out of all the cars on this list, the Mahindra Bolero feels the most crude and outdated. Due to its high ground clearance, stepping in and out of the off-roader is not easy. The seats at the front are narrow and don’t have much support on offer; the seats behind are no different either and provide limited knee room. Mahindra has equipped the sub-four metre SUV’s third row with side-facing seats, but they are best left for kids. Quality of touchpoints is below par for a vehicle whose price nudges nearly 10 lakh, that too for the base model. The homegrown brand may fix these issues in the next-generation Bolero, which is currently in development and is expected to launch by 2027. 4. Mahindra Bolero Neo Rs 9.95 lakh-12.16 lakh 100hp-1.5-litre diesel Compared to the Bolero, the Mahindra Bolero Neo feels a class apart in every aspect. The interior, specifically, is a far cry from the standard Bolero, featuring chair-like front seats with long squabs and individual armrests. That said, seat cushioning is firmer here. The middle row seats easily accommodate three passengers. Kneeroom and legroom are not as generous as the headroom, and that is deliberately done by Mahindra to have side-facing jump seats at the back. The three space parameters (kneeroom, legroom and headroom) are non-existent in the last row of seats and they are best left folded to make room for more luggage. Mahindra Bolero Neo featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatFront armrests for driver and co-driverSecond row seats: foldArmrest in seconds rowISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row jump seats: fold 5. Toyota Rumion Rs 10.54 lakh-13.83 lakh 103hp-1.5-litre petrol The Toyota Rumion is a badge-engineered version of the Maruti Ertiga, and its interior closely mirrors that of the MPV. From the overall design and layout to the beige colour scheme, the cabin feels familiar and functional. All three rows offer comfortable seating, and the space is packed with storage compartments, enhancing practicality. Buyers choosing the Rumion over the Ertiga may also benefit from a shorter wait time. Toyota Rumion featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatSliding armrest with utility box (front row)Second row seats: 60:40 split with one touch recline and slideSecond row center armrestSecond row roof mounted ACISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row seats: 50:50 split with reclineThird row flat fold 6. Kia Carens Rs 10.60 lakh-19.70 lakh 115hp-1.5-litre petrol, 160hp-1.5-litre turbo petrol, 116hp-1.5-litre diesel The Kia Carens’ cabin scores top marks for its premium quotient, with comfort being a strong point across all three rows. Seats at the front are well-cushioned and offer a great view out. Practicality is thoughtfully addressed too, with a storage tray under the co-driver’s seat. In the second row, the 60:40 split seats can tumble and fold, but the kerbside seat adds an extra touch of convenience with an electrically-assisted mechanism operated by a button, making access to the third row a breeze. While the middle-seat passenger benefits from the near-flat floor on long journeys, those seated by the windows will enjoy the added comfort of factory-fitted retractable sunshades. Our Carens review reported the last row seats to be comfy and not as knees-up as other MPVs of its class. Passengers as tall as six feet can enjoy reasonable comfort here.  Kia Carens featuresHeight adjustable driver’s seatVentilated front seats; back table with cup holder and gadget mountSecond row seats: 60:40 split with slide, recline and tumbleSecond row seat one touch easy electric tumbleSecond row sunshadesISOFIX seat mounts in second rowRoof-mounted second and third row AC vents withThird row seats: 50:50 split seats with recline and flat fold 7. Citroen Aircross Rs 12.46 lakh-14.35 lakh 82hp-1.2-litre petrol, 110hp-1.2-litre turbo petrol The French carmaker is known for offering comfy seats in its cars, and the Citroen Aircross is a testament to just that. First row seats are well-cushioned and supportive; the driver’s seat also gets an armrest. Though the middle row 60:40 split seats also prioritise comfort, they miss out on a central armrest and backrest recline function. The kerbside seat can be tilted and tumbled away to get into the last row. Since the seats here are placed on the boot floor, passengers sit in a knees-up position. Headroom and kneeroom are not generous either, meaning that this space is best suited for kids. These seats can also be removed, just like the Triber, to free up more luggage space.

Mahindra Scorpio Classic Rs 13.62 lakh-17.50 lakh 130hp-2.2-litre diesel Thanks to its high ground clearance, getting into the Mahindra Scorpio Classic needs some effort. A high seating position gives a great view of the surroundings, and the front chair-like seats, upholstered in fabric, are reminiscent of previous models and come with armrests. Headroom is generous, and the second-row bench easily accommodates three passengers. However, the long seat squab may reduce the under-thigh support for some. At the back, Mahindra has included side-facing jump seats similar to those in the Bolero and Bolero Neo, but they lack seat belts and provide no crash protection. Buyers also have the option of captain setas in the second row and bench seat at the back, though the absence of rear air vents is a notable omission in both versions.

Mahindra Scorpio N Rs 14 lakh-24.90 lakh 203hp-2.0-litre turbo petrol, 132hp-175hp-2.2-litre diesel The Mahindra Scorpio N is a clear step up from the Classic in every aspect. It features leatherette upholstery that feels far more premium, and the seats are more relaxed. The front seats are generously cushioned as well and offer plenty of lumbar support, even at their lowest setting. In the second row, the 60:40 split bench seat (captain chairs available in Z8 L top model) folds and tumbles on the kerbside; the right-hand side seat only folds. Although they can’t be slid, there’s tremendous kneeroom as well as headroom available here. Unlike the Classic’s jump seats, the Scorpio N gets a conventional set of front-facing seats with seatbelts in the last row, resulting in a more convenient seating experience. That said, adults will sit in a knees-up position, and space is extremely limited. Also, no AC vents are present here. Mahindra Scorpio N featuresDriver’s seat: six-way electrically adjustable, lumbar support and height adjustableVentilated Seats (driver and co-driver)Second row seats: one touch tumbleSecond row AC ventsISOFIX seat mounts in second rowThird row seats: fold and tumble 10. Mahindra XUV700 Rs 14.50 lakh-25.90 lakh 200hp-2.0-litre turbo petrol, 155hp-185hp-2.2-litre diesel The Mahindra XUV700 boasts an airy cabin with cream leatherette upholstery. Seats at the front are large and well-cushioned, making long journeys comfortable, as noted in our XUV700 review. The same is true for the middle row 60:40 split seats, and despite the panoramic sunroof's thick frame eating a bit into the headroom, tall passengers will be comfy here. Adding to the comfort, the co-driver seat comes with a manual ‘boss mode’ lever at the back, allowing the rear passenger to unlock extra legroom. Mahindra also offers five and six-seat configurations in select XUV700 models. Entry to the third row is made by split-folding the kerbside seat. Like in the Scorpio N, space in the third row is limited, but dedicated AC vents is a welcome touch.

The middle row seats easily accommodate three passengers. Kneeroom and legroom are not as generous as the headroom, and that is deliberately done by Mahindra to have side-facing jump seats at the back.

Headroom is generous, and the second-row bench easily accommodates three passengers. However, the long seat squab may reduce the under-thigh support for some. At the back, Mahindra has included side-facing jump seats similar to those in the Bolero and Bolero Neo, but they lack seat belts and provide no crash protection.
