Police allege the driver had been drinking before the late-night crash occurred. Significant damage was inflicted on the Portofino’s wheels, suspension, and bodywork. For all its speed and swagger, the Ferrari Portofino has never been the most coveted prancing horse in Maranello’s stable. Yet, no true car enthusiast can help but wince whenever one is badly damaged, and that’s exactly what happened in California recently. However, this was no ordinary crash as the sexy convertible found itself humiliated in an unlikely resting place: the shallows of Richardson Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area. Police have revealed that the driver of the silver Portofino thought it would be a good idea to get behind the wheel after allegedly consuming alcohol. Unfortunately, the man missed a turn along Seminary Drive, speared off the road, jumped over a curb, crossed the dirt sidewalk, and tumbled down a small grassy embankment before getting stuck in the mud. See: I Got Stuck With A 4WD Jeep In The Sand And It Was All My Fault Thankfully, no one was injured in the crash, but the Ferrari has been completely ruined. The front left corner of the car appears to have taken the brunt of the initial impact, as the wheel and hub have almost been completely torn from the car. The rear wheel on the same side is also badly busted, and plenty of Portofino’s body panels have been destroyed. Clearly, the car will be heading straight to a scrapyard where it could be auctioned off for parts. The California Highway Patrol’s division in Marin shared footage of the wreckage to Instagram, hilariously set to the tunes of R. Kelly’s I Believe I Can Fly. Local authorities got quite a kick from the unusual crash, but we suspect the owner didn’t find the incident so amusing.

A local towing company later pulled the Portofino from its muddy resting place. So, let this be a reminder to all: Ferraris are built for the road, not for the bay, and certainly not for impromptu airborne experiments after a few drinks.",
