Equipment includes the SportDesign Package, the Sport Chrono Package, a glass sunroof, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, center-locking 20″ and 21″ Turbo S Exclusive Design wheels, a front-axle lift system, a sport exhaust system, heated power-adjustable front seats, a surround-view camera system, a Bose sound system, carbon-fiber interior trim, adaptive cruise control, Lane Change Assist, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. Purchased new by the seller, this 992.1 Turbo S has 6k miles and is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title. The car is finished in Ruby Star Neo and features the SportDesign Package, which added a revised front bumper, lip spoiler, and rear spoiler. Additional exterior details include a glass sunroof, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, contrasting side graphics, and front and rear parking sensors. Center-locking 20″ and 21″ Turbo S Exclusive Design alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyear tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with yellow-finished multi-piston calipers. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system, Porsche Active Suspension Management, and rear-axle steering. The heated power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in Chalk, while Slate Gray leather covers the upper portions of the dashboard and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional features include a surround-view camera system, a Bose sound system, adaptive cruise control, Lane Change Assist, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, ambient lighting, puddle light projectors, dual-zone automatic climate control, and PCM with navigation. The heated GT Sport steering wheel is trimmed in leather and is equipped with paddle shifters and a drive-mode selector dial. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer flanked by configurable TFT displays. The Sport Chrono Package added launch control as well as a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.7L flat-six was factory rated at 640 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an all-wheel-drive system. The car was optioned with the sport exhaust system. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other damage. There is currently a lien on the car, and the seller’s leasing company will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
