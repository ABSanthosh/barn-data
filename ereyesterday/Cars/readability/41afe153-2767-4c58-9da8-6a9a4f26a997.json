  "description": "Royal Enfield will soon be updating the Hunter 350, and the refreshed model will debut on April 26 at its HunterHood festival. The Hunter 350 is the entry point to the RE family and is also the lightest model the company sells today.  RE Hunter 350 likely to get updated shocks, LED headlight New colours are also likely to be introduced Currently priced between Rs 1.50 lakh and Rs 1.75 lakh Royal Enfield Hunter 350 update details  RE’s most affordable bike will soon be updated The Hunter 350 marked Royal Enfield’s entry into uncharted territory, with its lightweight, nimble demeanour aiming to target people who weren’t Royal Enfield traditionalists. Since its introduction in 2022, more than 5 lakh units of the Hunter 350 have been sold worldwide. What has partly helped cement its incredible popularity is that Royal Enfield hasn’t hiked the Hunter’s prices, which range between Rs 1.50 lakh and Rs 1.75 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), since its launch. With this updated model, set to be showcased at the HunterHood festival, we believe Royal Enfield will address one of the bike’s primary shortcomings - its stiff suspension setup. The twin rear shocks of the Hunter are something a lot of people have complained about, and this is likely to be addressed with this update. In fact, last year, we even spotted a Hunter 350 test mule with new rear suspension units and an LED headlight.  This could give us some clues to what RE will change with this update on one of its bestselling models – both in India as well as globally. The company could also introduce new colours with this update, and it remains to be seen if Royal Enfield will raise the prices of the Hunter in the process.  Also See: Triumph Speed 400 vs RE Hunter 350 vs Classic 350 comparison: Retro rivalry",
