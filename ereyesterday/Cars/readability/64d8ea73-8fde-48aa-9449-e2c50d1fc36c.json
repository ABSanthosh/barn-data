We reveal the very best Close What’s the best family car? Answering that definitively is almost impossible, even for a title that has been steeped in all things automotive for almost 130 years.  The best family cars combine a handful of characteristics, including comfort, build quality and practicality, with enough flexibility for both long road trips and quick runs to the shops.  Whether you're a new parent juggling work or someone who's constantly hauling kids and their seemingly endless piles of stuff, there are several cars out there that fit the 'family wagon' bill. Our top pick? The BMW 3 Series Touring. This estate shines with its all-around capabilities, hitting all the high notes of a family car with its practicality, fun-to-drive feel and seriously impressive plug-in hybrid option. But there are many other options well worth considering, from SUVs to estates to saloons. Read on to find out the best family cars you can get in the UK. Design8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Intoxicating balance of ride and handling Super-efficient PHEV models Makes every journey feel like an occasion Cons No diesel optionSmaller boot than rivalsGet dearer with options Best for: Driving dynamicsThe BMW 3 Series Touring estate is the one to take if you’re adamant that family life and enjoying driving don’t have to be mutually exclusive.If the budget allows, you can get yourself behind the wheel of the beguiling BMW M3 Touring, but fear not, because the regular four-cylinder 320i model will still give drivers the sense of feedback and control that makes a routine journey less of a chore. If a four-cylinder lump won't cut it, the M340i is a standout performance estate car that hits the family car brief while also being fun to drive. The plug-in hybrid 330e will appeal to company car drivers and fleets alike and has neatly filled the void left by the diesel 320d, which is no longer sold in the UK. Its blend of performance and economy is still segment-leading. Its low roofline does limit its ultimate carrying capacity, but 500 litres is still enough for several carry-on suitcases. Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs9 Pros Space-efficient box on wheels Incredible value for money Shows very few signs of cheapness Cons Lacks some driver assistance features Small engines lack refinement Third-row seats are awkward to access Best for: Value Those who regard cars as status symbols assume that people will buy the dearest car they can afford — with the associated perception that choosing a cheaper model equates to having less disposable income.It’s an ugly, outdated attitude that needs to change, because, as the Dacia Jogger proves, a great family car needn’t be expensive at all. This estate-cum-MPV is almost half the price of the Skoda Kodiaq yet can seat seven, easily ply scores of motorway driving miles, offers hybrid power and gets Apple CarPlay and an effective air-con system. In other words, much of what most of us need is there. It’s also a pleasure on long journeys, with softer-than-average suspension and a long wheelbase that helps it to deftly deal with nasty road surfaces.  The Jogger isn't a luxury car by any means, but it’s put together well with robust materials and the engines, while coarse at times, are capable and reliable with reasonable economy.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Cheapest models don’t sacrifice quality Recent facelift improved tech considerably Sporty, luxurious versions avail Cons Boot is smaller than most rivals’ Somewhat priceyWe have some reservations about the tech's reliability Best for: Fans of smaller carsWhether it’s a genuine benchmark and an icon based on decades of excellence, for many, the Volkswagen Golf hatchback is still the ‘just right’ family car.With five decades of honing and evolution behind it, the latest Mk8.5 Golf continues to offer family-sized motoring to suit a variety of budget and performance requirements, even in this SUV-dominated age. Those less costly Golfs are far more affordable than you might assume, given the prevalence of budget-branded alternatives, yet even the entry-level versions still manage to feel a cut above the mainstream when you’re sitting inside.One family-friendly trait that’s often overlooked about the Golf is how well-packaged it is, feeling indulgently roomy considering that its shorter than most direct rivals and, at 4282mm bumper to bumper, barely any lengthier than most small hatchbacks.Sure, that results in a boot that’s lacking a bit of capacity, although it’s hardly small. Plus, if you really need more space, Volkswagen will gladly sell you a Golf Estate.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior9Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling10Costs7 Pros Supreme off-road agility and traction Eye-wideningly capable on asphalt One of the most versatile cars in the world Cons Reliability question marks linger Having to pay extra for third row of seats feels mean Bigger models are now particularly large and heavy Best for: All-round utility When upscale family SUVs break £50,000 with little effort expended on the options list, many short of a mechanical link between front and rear axles, the £60,000 entry-point of Land Rover Defender 110 ownership suddenly doesn’t feel unreasonable.Factor-in the lack of on-road refinement of its few rivals that can be considered viable alternatives. It’s such an extraordinarily capable and practical car, yet it also feels satisfyingly special. Not ‘you’re not coming in here with food or drink’ luxurious but in a well-crafted, fit-for-purpose sense.It’s a shame that Land Rover sullies that by charging a further £2000 for a third row of seats in the Defender 110. That's a pricey option but one that does give the Landie an added dimension of versatility to what is an already flexible package. There's impressive performance for its size, the six-cylinder diesel particularly so, but its thirst for fuel and niggling doubts about whether Land Rover is finally on top of its reliability woes will be on the mind of a Defender driver. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs7 Pros Affordable seven-seat flexibility Proven quality and powertrains Efficient, BIK tax-friendly PHEV option Cons Handling talent at expense of comfort PHEV model is five-seat only Not quite as cheap as it looks with options Best for: Daily drivingWith SUVs being the preference of most of Britain’s new car buyers, Skoda – long-time master of blending value for money with quality – occupies a lofty position in the family car rankings with its Kodiaq.Prices start below £40,000 with petrol and diesel models offering seven comfy seats or five plus a cavernous 910-litre load space.  Plug-in hybrid versions are restricted to five seats but compensate with a long electric-only driving range courtesy of a battery that’s a similar capacity of many full EVs from a decade ago. If you want four-wheel drive, the 2.0-litre diesel in SE L or Sportline trim is the answer – or you can go for the punchier Kodiaq vRS, with 265bhp of petrol power and a performance focus, to momentarily regress to those pre-kids sports car days. Ticking the boxes of comfort and value alongside the desirable SUV format and optional 4x4, the Kodiaq fits the needs of the majority of families with consummate ease. Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Space-efficient design Economical engine range Ride quality is impressive Cons Some cheap materials and trim Touchscreen infotainment can be fiddly on the moveLowest-powered model struggles fully laden Best for: CommutingUsing the Volkswagen Golf as a starting point before then making it both bigger and cheaper has been key to the success of the Skoda Octavia this past 30 years, yet rather than the hatchback, it’s the estate version we’ve always felt a greater affinity with. Don’t mistake ‘no nonsense’ for ‘no frills’ when it comes to the Octavia Estate, because it’s packed with technology and clever features that just make life feel that bit easier, regardless of whether your family is in the car with you or not.There’s a lot to be said about how unstressed you feel driving something that’s patently enormous inside yet doesn’t take up a massive amount of bay space or cause you to duck your head in multi-storey car parks. Choosing the Octavia Estate over an SUV saves a useful amount of money both in terms of purchase price and by virtue of its lower running costs. It can be driven so efficiently that the staff at your usual filling station will assume you’ve taken your custom elsewhere. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior7Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Excellent reliability and economy Surprisingly engaging handling Spacious boot with long load area Cons Lacks character or luxury touches Hybrid powertrain sounds coarse under load Tech and trim is lacklustre Best for: Economy For an eminently sensible family car, the Toyota Corolla Touring Sports has one of the silliest-sounding euphemisms for ‘estate’ we’ve seen — and yes, we do remember the Mazda 323 Stretchback.That aside, most people keep their car to the end of the warranty or finance agreement, then move on. For kids who got attached to the family car and adventures it created, that can be tough.But wait! Toyota’s 10-year warranty means the thoroughly dependable Corolla Touring Sports can be part of your life so long as you might be ferrying your grandkids around in it.  Almost entirely devoid of contrived personality, the Corolla is a blank sheet just waiting to be part of your family story, providing reliable, economical and practical transport without demanding much in return, beyond its annual service and routine maintenance. In a rational world, the Corolla Touring Sports’ fuel efficiency, large boot and enviable record for trouble-free running should put it at the top of everyone’s list, but the absence of character from the equipment list counts.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior9Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling6Costs6 Pros Seven seats, even as a PHEV Four-wheel drive on all models Quality feel is more than skin-deep Cons Hybrid models can’t tow much Plug-in hybrid's electric-only range is short Unimpressive ground clearance Best for: SpaceEarly in its UK presence, Kia occupied a strong position, offering British families seven-seater transport and solid peace of mind, but trends change and the spacious Sedona is almost forgotten.Instead, the Sportage SUV has taken on the role of large family car in the Korean brand's range, in the process losing some of its earlier off-roading ability. The emphasis is on the ‘some’ and not ‘all’, as the Sorento remains equipped with mechanical four-wheel drive but with the addition of sophisticated hybrid and plug-in hybrid options alongside the familiar 2.2-litre diesel.Unlike the Skoda Kodiaq, the Sorento retains seven-seater capability and 4x4 grip even as a PHEV, although its electric-only range is less impressive. It’s good-looking, too, having evolved in 2024 to adopt some of the electric Kia EV9’s brutal futurist styling that suits the Sorento’s 4.8m-long bulk well.Interior quality is such that its switchgear will likely be operating just fine long after the Sorento is a museum piece, let alone when its reassuring seven-year/100,000-mile warranty has finally lapsed. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling6Costs9 Pros Impressive value for money Plug-in hybrid model is very capable Quality and style are improving Cons Handling still lacks finesse Interior materials still feel cheap Petrol-only model lacks refinement Best for: Home charging It’s barely related to the sports car brand that cloth-capped enthusiasts remember, yet various elements of car design and the marque’s history have been stitched together to create a modern MG brought to life with electricity.Unlike Mary Shelley’s most infamous creation, there’s nothing monstrous about the budget-focused MG HS SUV, which appeared in its second generation during 2024. It may lack the glamour of the MG Cyberster, but the Mk2 HS is a thoroughly competent family-sized five-seater SUV that has more to its appeal than pure value for money.  Much of that is down to the allure of the 295bhp grunt and 75-mile electric range of the plug-in hybrid version – tempting for company car drivers, with 5% BIK tax and a list price below £32,000.It will also do 0-62mph in 6.8sec, although its handling isn’t up to making that feat enjoyable beyond mastering motorway slip roads. So, it’s a big, cheap, technically advanced family car with trade-offs in patchy material quality and overall finesse. Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior6Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Good value and well equipped Very quiet at speedSeven-seat ability regardless of powertrain Cons Unsophisticated rideHybrid version is a little underpowered Competitive PCP figures but high APR Best for: StyleMaking a large family SUV look striking enough to turn heads is easy: just consider the Ssangyong Rodius. Apologies for reminding you...Making heads turn to look at an SUV and hold their attention is a greater challenge, but it’s one that Peugeot has achieved with its latest 5008.From its bold, multi-faceted grille and lights to the strikingly angled D-pillar and blacked-out tail lights, the new Peugeot 5008 looks rugged while retaining jewel-like detailing.Best of all is that it’s really an MPV in disguise, with a very flexible, adaptable seven-seater interior that can be rapidly switched to medium-sized van mode by tugging on a few levers. Versatile space isn't quite matched by versatile powertrains. The 134bhp mild-hybrid petrol option isn't quite up to moving seven folk at speed, even if it is in style, while the plug-in hybrid version offers a rare combination of seven seats and enough zero-emission driving urban driving and a bit beyond.  You’re not limited to those, either as the electric Peugeot e-5008 offers even lustier acceleration, while its 97kWh battery is claimed to be sufficient for more than 400 miles of driving between charges.Finance this car with DrivenfiHOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST FAMILY CAR Above all, consider your needs for the whole duration of ownership, not just right now. Taking on a PCP finance deal for a massive estate then realising over the first few weeks with it that a compact hatchback would have suited your needs better isn’t ideal.Do your homework thoroughly. You will soon be doing your kids’ homework, anyway, so it’s good practice.   HOW WE TESTED AND SELECTEDNearly all models sold in the UK are family cars of one sort or another, and our team of experienced drivers, road-testers and technical experts are human, so we have a varied pool of ‘family’ experiences to add context and objectivity when assessing a car through that lens. FAQs Do I really need an SUV for a family car?  Probably not, but we get why they’re popular, not least because many have wide-opening doors and higher seat positions, which makes dealing with lugging child seats in and out far less problematic. Not feeling as agitated or achy makes parenting that bit less stressful.  How do I know if my child seats will fit the car?  Simple, you take them with you when you go for your test drive. Make sure they fit and are convenient to get in and out before you contemplate signing-up for a finance package. Any car retailer that’s serious about wanting your custom will be happy to oblige.  Is a hybrid or electric family car a good choice?  Aside from the argument that cutting emissions is the best thing for your family, long-term, immediate benefits include time-saving convenient features such as cabin pre-conditioning for winter school runs or commuting — particularly on EVs. Plug-in hybrids, if plugged in, are great for this blend of short-trip duties with the potential for longer journeys and adventures.  Join our WhatsApp community and be the first to read about the latest news and reviews wowing the car world.
