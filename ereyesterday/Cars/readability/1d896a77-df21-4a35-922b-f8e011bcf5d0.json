  "description": "This 2006 Aston Martin DB9 Volante is finished in Almond Green over Sandstorm leather, and it is powered by a 5.9-liter V12 mated to a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a Sandstorm soft top, adaptive dampers, 19″ alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, heated power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, a navigation system, and a CD stereo linked to a Linn sound system. The car was previously listed on BaT in August 2024 before it was acquired by the selling dealer and was relisted on BaT in November 2024. Work performed under current ownership reportedly included repairing the soft top and digital instrument display along with servicing the ignition system and replacing the battery, intake manifold gaskets, fuel injector seals, and interior wood trim. This DB9 Volante has 16k miles and is offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with an owner’s manual, an umbrella, a tire inflator, a front license plate bracket, two key fobs, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title.",

This DB9 Volante has 16k miles and is offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with an owner’s manual, an umbrella, a tire inflator, a front license plate bracket, two key fobs, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title. The DB9 featured a mix of aluminum and composite body panels installed over an extruded aluminum spaceframe. This car is finished in Almond Green with a Sandstorm soft top and features a Tungsten grille, hood vents, fender vents, LED taillights, rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. The soft top fabric above the rear window was repaired under current ownership. A portion of the photo gallery was captured in September 2024. The 19″ seven-spoke wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza RE050A tires. The car is equipped with active dampers, and braking is handled by four-wheel slotted and ventilated rotors. The heated power-adjustable front seats and individual rear seats are trimmed in Sandstorm leather contrasted by Parliament Green carpets and an Absinthe Green and Sandstorm dashboard. Appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, a retractable navigation screen, and a CD stereo linked to a Linn sound system. The wood trim on the center stack and door panels was replaced under current ownership. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a reverse-sweep tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates just under 16k miles. The central digital display was recently repaired. The 5.9-liter DOHC V12 was factory rated at 450 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Work performed in preparation for the sale included replacing the battery, intake manifold gaskets, fuel injector seals, ignition coils, and spark plugs. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The flywheel is said to have been replaced in 2019. Additional underside photos are presented in the gallery. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
