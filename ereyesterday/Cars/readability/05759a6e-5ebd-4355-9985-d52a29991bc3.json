Powered by a 5.5-liter F116 V12 paired with a four-speed automatic transaxle, the car is finished in Blu Tour de France over beige Connolly leather upholstery. It has 18″ aftermarket wheels, pop-up headlights, a Tubi Style exhaust, fog lights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable front seats, an Alpine stereo, and automatic climate control. A timing belt service was performed in 2016, at which time the right bank intake camshaft was replaced. This 456M GTA is now offered by the selling dealer in Canada with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a British Columbia registration. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum and composite bodywork is finished in Blu Tour de France. Modificata models featured a revised grille with inset fog lights as well as pop-up headlights and polished quadruple exhaust tips exiting through the rear valance. Additional details consist of Scuderia Ferrari fender shields and tinted windows. Paint chips and scrapes are notes on the front bumper cover. The 18″ aftermarket alloy wheels are mounted with 255/40 front and 275/40 rear Bridgestone Potenza tires. Self-adjusting dampers and self-leveling rear suspension were standard equipment. Stopping power is provided by yellow Ferrari-branded four-piston brake calipers over ventilated and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. Curb damage is located on the left-rear wheel. The cabin features beige Connolly leather upholstery that extends from the seating surfaces to the center console, lower dashboard, and door panels. Ferrari-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include power-adjustable front seats, an Alpine stereo, power windows and locks, and automatic climate control. Sticky buttons are noted by the seller, wear is visible on the door panel switches, and shrinking upholstery is visible on the dashboard. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a 10k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 16k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.5-liter F116 V12 features four valves per cylinder, Bosch Motronic fuel injection, and dry-sump lubrication. It was factory rated at 436 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, which is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transaxle. A timing belt service was performed in 2016, at which time the right bank intake camshaft was replaced. A Tubi Style exhaust system has been fitted, and additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery below. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ferrari of Beverly Hills, California, and lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $238,103. Manufacturer’s literature and a tool kit are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The car is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
