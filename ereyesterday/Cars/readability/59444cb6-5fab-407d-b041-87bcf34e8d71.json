  "description": "Skoda has unveiled a concept bike dubbed the Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B. This cafe racer is a modern interpretation of the original Slavia B, which was launched over a century ago in 1899. Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B is an electric concept bike The motorcycle will not enter series production It has been conceptualised by in-house designer Romain Bucaille Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B Concept: a concept bike from Skoda Designed by Romain Bucaille, Skoda’s in-house exterior designer At first glance, it might seem unexpected to see a concept bike from Skoda. However, for those who may not know this, the Czech carmaker actually began its journey with motorcycles and bicycles, originally produced under the Laurin \u0026 Klement badge. With the Slavia B Concept, the brand aims to revive that legacy, launching a new series under the Laurin \u0026 Klement moniker, one that reimagines its iconic vehicles with a modern twist. While these reinterpretations are going to remain concepts, they serve as a fascinating tribute to Skoda’s two-wheeler origins. About the 1899 Slavia B The modern interpretation draws its lineage from the original Slavia B, which was launched in 1899. The motorcycle was a slender machine and featured a 240cc air-cooled engine producing 1.75hp, capable of reaching a top speed of 40kph. Interestingly, it had no gearbox; instead, power was delivered via a flat belt connected directly to the engine. As was the norm at the time, pedals were included for starting and auxiliary propulsion. A total of 540 units of the Slavia B were produced. About the Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B Concept The Slavia B Concept was developed by Romain Bucaille, a French designer who typically works on exterior design for Skoda’s cars. Despite its electric vision, the concept retains the silhouette of early Laurin \u0026 Klement motorcycles, especially the distinctive frame that dips lower than the rest of the structure. While the original Slavia B housed its engine within this frame, Bucaille’s concept leaves this space empty, instead featuring a floating modern reinterpretation of the Laurin \u0026 Klement logo. The front end of the concept pays homage to Vaclav Laurin, who was known for designing motorcycles with exceptional stability and handling.   While this concept will never enter series production, it’s interesting to see manufacturers going down unusual roads to come up with such one-off concepts that give their heritage models a modern interpretation.
