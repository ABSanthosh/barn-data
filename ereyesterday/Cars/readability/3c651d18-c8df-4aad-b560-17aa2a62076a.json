  "text": "The F-150 recently lost its sales crown and now it's going to be sticking around for even longer 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Ford has reportedly delayed the launch of the next-generation F-150. The model was expected in 2027, but may not arrive until mid-2028. Ford has axed or delayed several different models in recent months. Ford introduced the facelifted F-150 in the fall of 2023, but the update didn’t help as sales dropped 5% last year. This enabled the aging Toyota RAV4 to become the best-selling vehicle in America. That was a stunning upset and it appears help isn’t on the horizon as Ford is delaying the next-generation F-150. Citing executives from three suppliers, Crain’s Detroit Business is reporting the redesigned truck has been delayed by at least one year. More: Ford F-150 Refresh Brings New Swinging Tailgate And Cheaper Hybrid The model, which is reportedly codenamed  P736, was slated to be launched in 2027. However, it has now been pushed back to at least mid-2028. Given the delay, it’s not surprising that suppliers were also told Ford is extending production of the current F-150 by another year. The reason for the delay remains unclear and Ford wouldn’t confirm or deny timing when asked by the publication. That being said, the F-150 is one of Ford’s most important products and one that generates healthy profit margins. This makes a delay unusual and one that could give Chevrolet, GMC, Ram, and Toyota an opening to increase their market share as the F-150 ages. While there are more questions than answers at this point, Ford has retimed or axed a number of upcoming models. In particular, the company was slated to launch three-row electric crossovers in 2025, but they were delayed to 2027, before being dropped altogether. Ford also delayed the launch of the F-150 Lightning successor,  known as Project T3, to the second half of 2027. At the time, Ford said the change would enable them to “utilize lower-cost battery technology and take advantage of other cost breakthroughs while the market continues to develop.” 2027 will also see the introduction of an electric medium-sized truck based on a new platform. Tentatively dubbed the Ranger EV, the model will “cater to customers who want more for their money – more range, more utility, more useability.” In other news, Ford CEO Jim Farley recently revealed the company is embracing range-extended electric vehicles. He said they can use smaller and cheaper batteries than traditional EVs, but “still drive most miles all electric.” Farley also suggested the savings amounts to “tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars.”",
