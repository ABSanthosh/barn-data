  "description": "Citroen Basalt, Aircross and C3 Dark Edition prices will be announced on April 10. In the lead-up to the launch, Citroen has released yet another teaser, giving us a glimpse at the Dark Edition models’ interiors this time. Citroen Dark Edition models to get new black exterior colour Interior gets new black leatherette upholstery with contrast red stitching All Dark Edition models will likely be mechanically unchanged Citroen Basalt, Aircross, C3 Dark Edition: what to expect? All black exterior and interior aesthetics New leatherette finish for the Aircross and Basalt’s dashboard. The latest teaser reveals that all the Dark Edition models will get new black upholstery with contrast red stitching and grey inserts on the seats. Moreover, the Aircross and Basalt’s dashboard will get a new leatherette finish with contrast red stitching. All Citroen models in India currently have a plastic dashboard, so this will be a notable upgrade. All cars are also expected to get new illuminated sill plates and ambient footwell lighting. On the outside, the Citroen Dark Edition models will don a stealthy black paint shade, along with dark chrome accents for the grille inserts and badges. However, the dual-tone wheels on all three cars will likely stay unchanged, as would the contrasting silver trims on their bumpers to break the black monotony. The dual-tone wheels on all three cars will be carried over unchanged.   Citroen Basalt, Aircross, C3 Dark Edition powertrain options Expected to offered in turbo guise The Dark Edition variants of the Aircross, Basalt and C3 will likely be mechanically unchanged. All three cars get an 82hp, 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol or a 110hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine; only the latter comes with an automatic gearbox option. The Dark Edition variants will likely be offered in top Turbo guise only and priced Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000 higher than the trim they will be based on. Growing popularity of dark edition models The list of dark edition SUVs seems to be growing constantly. Models like the Hyundai Creta, MG Astor, Honda Elevate, Tata Harrier and Safari, Jeep Compass and Mahindra Scorpio N all have Dark Edition variants, with the Mahindra XUV700 Ebony Edition being the most recent addition. And it’s not just limited to SUVs, as the Toyota Hilux and MG Comet also received dark edition variants recently. Besides these Citroen models, the Tata Curvv is also expected to get a dark edition soon.
