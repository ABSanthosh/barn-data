  "text": "More than 22,000 vehicles were stolen in Memphis over the past two years, with Hyundai and Kia models being the most commonly targeted December 4, 2024 at 19:00 by Brad Anderson Hyundai and Kia’s ignition flaw made their vehicles prime targets for thieves. The two automakers have already paid $200 million to settle a class action lawsuit. Memphis has seen over 22,000 cars stolen, with Hyundai and Kia topping the list. If you thought Hyundai and Kia had left their car theft problems behind, think again. The two automakers may now face lawsuits from the City of Memphis, where a rising tide of stolen vehicles, many of them from these two brands, has the city scrambling for answers. And while these thefts are hardly a new problem, this time, it’s getting personal. A Vulnerable Design Meets a Viral Moment A surge in the theft of Hyundai and Kia vehicles began in 2021 when social media posts went viral, revealing just how absurdly easy it is to steal certain models due to their overly simple ignition cylinders and lack of an immobilizer. Indeed, with a little tinkering, dozens of Hyundais and Kias can be stolen with little more than a USB cable in under 90 seconds. What followed was a viral sensation among car thieves, and for millions of car owners, a rude awakening. Read: Hyundai And Kia Offer New Ignition Cylinder Protector To Help Prevent Thefts Fast forward to today, and the results of that viral discovery are painfully evident. In Memphis, more than 22,000 vehicles have been stolen in the past two years, and cars from Hyundai and Kia were at the top of the list. The sheer volume of thefts has overwhelmed local law enforcement. According to WREG, the Memphis Police Department and Shelby County Sheriff’s Office had to pull staff and create new units to tackle the spike in thefts. On Tuesday, a resolution to approve litigation against the two car manufacturers was approved by a City Council committee, and a special attorney will be hired to handle the case. “We do not take litigation lightly,” said a city spokesperson. “However, the City of Memphis and its police officers have spent significant time responding to thefts of Kias and Hyundais, which is grossly disproportionate to other vehicle theft reports in our city. Responding to these thefts has delayed officers from responding to other calls, increased costs to the city, and left many of our residents and visitors without vehicles.” In response to the theft surge, both Hyundai and Kia introduced several measures. In early 2023, they rolled out a software upgrade to enhance security and began offering steering wheel locks to owners of the affected models. More recently, at the start of 2024, Hyundai introduced an ignition cylinder protector for vehicles that aren’t eligible for the software updates. Kia Pushes Back Despite the mounting pressure, Kia is standing its ground. e automaker has dismissed the potential lawsuit, claiming it’s “without merit.” “As we have said repeatedly, lawsuits filed by municipalities against Kia are without merit,” the company said in a statement. “Like all Kia vehicles, the specific models at issue in this case are subject to and comply fully with the requirements outlined in applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, including FMVSS 114 that governs theft protection measures. Additionally, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has publicly stated that it has not determined that this issue constitutes either a safety defect or non-compliance requiring a recall under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.”",
