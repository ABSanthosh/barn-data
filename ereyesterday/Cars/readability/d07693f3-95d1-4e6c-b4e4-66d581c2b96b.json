  "description": "Ducati has teased the new Panigale V4 via its social media accounts. The caption reads “Gen 7, enroute”, suggesting an imminent launch in India. New Panigale V4 gets redesigned fairing with reworked aero Loses the signature single-sided swingarm Ducati Panigale V4: what’s new for 2025? Powering the motorcycle is a 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, which is now Euro5+ certified. Compared to the outgoing model, it delivers 216hp at 13,500rpm – just a 0.5hp increase but at 500rpm higher. The peak torque is down by 2.7Nm to 120.9Nm and is delivered 1,750rpm later than the outgoing model at 11,250rpm. Suspension duties are managed by Öhlins, featuring the smart EC 3.0 electronic units. Ducati claims it has refined the rear monoshock to shed 600 grams of weight. The bike rides on the new Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa V4 tyres; the sizes remain at 120/70-ZR17 and 200/60-ZR17. This supersport is the first motorcycle in the world to feature the new Brembo Hypure monobloc calipers. The earlier model used Stylema calipers for braking.  The Ducati Panigale V4 for 2025 has received substantial updates in the form of design and internal reworking, marking the biggest change since the model debuted in 2018. The headlights are sleeker, and the refreshed tail-light has two U-shaped LED strips. The aerodynamics have also been reworked. There’s a redesigned fairing, and the winglets have been repositioned while providing the same amount of downforce as before. After a long hiatus, Ducati has equipped the Panigale V4 with a conventional double-sided swingarm. The last Ducati flagship supersport to get this type of swingarm was the iconic 916. The new swingarm-rear wheel assembly is 2.7 kg lighter, and the bike now features 37 percent less lateral stiffness, improving overall handling. In typical Ducati fashion, its flagship is loaded with electronic rider aids. The 2025 Panigale V4 debuts a new feature called Race eCBS, which essentially manages the rear load without the need to tap the rear brake – all thanks to a system that monitors the bike’s lean angle, throttle position and intervening when required. Additionally, the bike has power modes, traction control, launch control, wheelie control, riding modes, a bi-directional quickshifter and ABS. Each of these electronic aids offers extensive customisation via a new 6.9-inch TFT display.  The Ducati Panigale V4’s chief rival is the BMW S 1000 RR, which was also recently updated and launched at the 2025 edition of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. The outgoing Ducati Panigale V4 commands Rs 27.72 lakh for the base model and Rs 33.48 lakh for the up-spec S variant, but we expect an increase in prices.
