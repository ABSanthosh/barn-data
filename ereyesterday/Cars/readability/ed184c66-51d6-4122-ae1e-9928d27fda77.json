It was acquired by the current owner in 2018, and has since been refurbished, including a repaint in blue and a reupholstered interior. The car is powered by a 1,720cc flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, 15″ aluminum wheels, Spax shocks, a front sway bar, polycarbonate side windows, a front hood fuel filler, and an aftermarket center-exit exhaust system. Inside, the cabin houses a roll bar, GT Speedster-style seats trimmed in blue leatherette and tan corduroy, and a four-spoke steering wheel. This 356B coupe is now offered in Costa Mesa, California on dealer consignment with Emory build records and a Montana title. The Reutter-built car received body work on the floors, longitudinal, rockers, door bottoms, and various sheet metal repairs during the initial build in the mid-2000s. Previously repainted yellow, the car was refinished in blue under current ownership. A center hood fuel filler, custom front brake vents, a front oil cooler grille, and polycarbonate side and rear windows were installed during the initial Emory build. The bumpers and mirrors have been removed. The 15″ aluminum wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Advantage T/A tires measuring 205/50. Four-wheel disc brakes have been installed, and suspension modifications include adjustable Spax shocks, Wright de-cambered front spindles, a 19mm front sway bar, and a 356 Enterprises camber compensator. The Fibersteel GT-Speedster-style seats were reupholstered in blue leatherette and tan corduroy under current ownership, and blue leatherette door panels with leather pulls were installed. A body-color roll bar is fitted in place of the rear seats, and tan squareweave carpets line the floors and backs of the front seats. The four-spoke steering wheel frames green-letter VDO instrumentation including a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline, a combination gauge for oil temperature and oil pressure, a voltage gauge, and an hour meter, which shows 366 hours. The car is not equipped with an odometer and total mileage is unknown. The 1,720cc flat-four was built in 2012 and features Shasta 86mm pistons with 10.5:1 compression, an Elgin camshaft, and dual Solex carburetors with velocity stacks. A custom fuel tank is housed in the front trunk and an aluminum oil cooler is mounted behind the front valance. The seller states that a top-end rebuild was performed under current ownership. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle with modified gears, aluminum mounts and a limited-slip differential. A custom center-exit exhaust system has been installed. The Montana title lists “Classic” under the brands section. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
