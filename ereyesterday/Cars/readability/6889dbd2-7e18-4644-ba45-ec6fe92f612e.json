  "text": "The wild body kit was designed by Khyzyl Saleem, drawing inspiration from an earlier BMW concept 1 hour ago by Thanos Pappas Designer Khyzyl Saleem revealed his vision for the ultimate BMW G87 M2. The extensive redesign draws inspiration from the 2002 Hommage Concept. The M2-KS is a digital-only affair but could easily pass for a coachbuilt special. Since its debut in 2022, the BMW G87 M2 has become a canvas for tuners, who’ve slapped on a variety of visual, chassis, and performance upgrades. But none of these modifications even come close to the wild, dramatic stance of the M2-KS, created by independent designer Khyzyl Saleem. What started as a digital project to showcase Saleem’s vision for his personal M2 could very well be more than just a concept. Given the designer’s history of bringing his extreme ideas to life with the help of tuners, it’s not hard to imagine this dream car finding its way into the real world. More: New BMW M2 Racer Channels E30 M3 Spirit With 4-Cylinder Turbo The M2-KS features extensive visual upgrades, drawing inspiration from the BMW 2002 Hommage Concept that debuted in 2016. Though that concept was based on the previous generation M2 and never made it to production, its design ethos clearly lives on in this project. Key visual cues include the wide fenders with integrated vents and the prominent side intakes, both of which give the M2 a more aggressive, track-ready look. At the front, the redesigned bumper and fenders cover the upper portion of the headlights, giving a more aggressive glance to the smallest BMW M. This is accentuated by the larger intakes, and the pronounced splitter, which are joined by a revised kidney grille. Another notable touch is the sculpted vented hood, which ditches the standard model’s typical bulge for a cleaner, sportier appearance. Rear End Gets Even More Dramatic Illustrations Khyzyl Saleem At the rear, Saleem has gone all-in with a significantly larger ducktail spoiler and ultra-wide rear fenders. The diffuser is also larger than what you’ll find on the factory M2, housing a set of quad exhaust pipes for that added visual punch. Smoked finish accents can be found around the extra inlets beneath the taillights, all of which work together to give the M2 a more exotic, high-performance look. The overall shape of the bumpers and aggressive aero elements make this M2 a real showstopper. Saleem didn’t get into details about any proposed performance or chassis modifications, but the model appears to sit on lowered suspension with wider tracks. Furthermore, these looks set the tone for a potential power boost alongside a few track-focused upgrades. More: BMW’s Most Driver-Focused M2 Drops The One Thing Real Drivers Care The Most Currently, the most potent production version of the G87 is the M2 CS, which is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine producing 523 horsepower (390 kW / 530 PS) and 479 lb-ft (649 Nm) of torque. However, tuners like Manhart have been known to push the M2 to as much as 705 horsepower (526 kW / 715 PS), proving there’s plenty of room for improvement. The digital project sparked some serious curiosity about the possibility of a coachbuilt M2. BMW has proven that buyers are interested in low-volume models such as the recent Skytop and Speedtop which share their underpinnings with the 8-Series, or the M4-based BMW 3.0 CSL from 2022. So, will someone please make this little beast a reality? Khyzyl Saleem / Facebook",
