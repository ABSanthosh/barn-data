  "description": "This 1931 Ford Model A roadster was purchased by its late owner, collector John B. McMullen, in 2001 after it had been refurbished in blue with black fenders and a tan soft top over tan vinyl upholstery. The car is powered by a 201ci L-head inline-four paired with a three-speed manual transmission that has been fitted with a Mitchell Gear-Splitter overdrive unit. The car is equipped with yellow 19\" wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a six-volt alternator, a tilt-out windshield, a fold-down luggage rack, a rumble seat, and an Auto-Lite flow-through heater. This Model A is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the McMullen Collection with side curtains and a Michigan title.",

  "text": "This 1931 Ford Model A roadster was purchased by its late owner, collector John B. McMullen, in 2001 after it had been refurbished in blue with black fenders and a tan soft top over tan vinyl upholstery. The car is powered by a 201ci L-head inline-four paired with a three-speed manual transmission that has been fitted with a Mitchell Gear-Splitter overdrive unit. The car is equipped with yellow 19″ wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a six-volt alternator, a tilt-out windshield, a fold-down luggage rack, a rumble seat, and an Auto-Lite flow-through heater. This Model A is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the McMullen Collection with side curtains and a Michigan title. The roadster bodywork was refinished in blue under prior ownership and is accented by black fenders, light blue stripes, and tan pinstripes. The car features a tan convertible top, a tilt-out windshield, a fold-down luggage rack with a trunk, cowl lamps, a radiator thermometer, dual side mirrors, wind wings, headlight visors, and dual taillights. Included side curtains can be viewed in the gallery. Nicks, chips, and scuffs are noted in the paint, and there is discoloration on the soft top. Yellow-painted 19″ wire wheels are mounted with 4.75/5.00-19 Firestone Gum Dipped wide-whitewall tires. Matching spare wheels and tires mounted in the fenders are topped by mirrors. Braking is provided by four-wheel drums. The cabin features a bench seat upholstered in tan vinyl, while the rumble seat is upholstered to match. Interior appointments include a horn, a rearview mirror with an inset clock, and a heater. The four-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a barrel-type speedometer, an ammeter, and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 14k miles, approximately 8k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The 201ci L-head inline-four was factory rated at 40 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. The car is fitted with an Auto-Lite manifold heater and a six-volt alternator. The car is titled by its engine number, A4413183, which corresponds to a unit produced in March 1931. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a sliding-gear three-speed manual transmission and a Mitchell Gear-Splitter overdrive unit. The Michigan title is listed as a duplicate.
