  "description": "This 2001 BMW M Coupe was acquired by the seller in 2001 and subsequently modified for use as a track car. The chassis was stripped, stitch-welded, and fitted with carbon fiber aerodynamic bodywork including a front splitter, rear diffuser, and rear wing in 2016. Power is provided by a 427ci LS-based stroker V8 built by Horsepower Research of McKinney, Texas, which is fitted with a Dailey Engineering dry-sump oiling system in addition to Callies CompStar crankshaft and connecting rods. Shifting is via a rebuilt Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission linked with a 3.73:1 Diffsonline limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes Team Dynamics Motorsport 18\" wheels, polycarbonate windows, Öhlins coilover suspension, AP Racing brake calipers, and a reinforced rear subframe. On the inside, Cobra bucket seats with Schroth harnesses are joined by a 12-point custom-fabricated roll cage, a Holley digital dashboard and ECU, and a MOMO steering wheel. This M Coupe track car is now offered at no reserve with build records, compression test results, a spare pair of wheels, a spare alternator, a Carfax report, and a clean New Hampshire title in the seller's name.",

Additional equipment includes Team Dynamics Motorsport 18″ wheels, polycarbonate windows, Öhlins coilover suspension, AP Racing brake calipers, and a reinforced rear subframe. On the inside, Cobra bucket seats with Schroth harnesses are joined by a 12-point custom-fabricated roll cage, a Holley digital dashboard and ECU, and a MOMO steering wheel. This M Coupe track car is now offered at no reserve with build records, compression test results, a spare pair of wheels, a spare alternator, a Carfax report, and a clean New Hampshire title in the seller’s name. Finished in white with black racing numbers, the car has been modified with a polycarbonate windshield, rear and side windows as well as a vented carbon fiber hood attached via Dzus fasteners, a carbon fiber roof panel, a rear wing mounted via custom aluminum uprights, and an aluminum rear diffuser. The front bumper assembly has been modified and replaced with a carbon fiber air dam/splitter with canards, end plates, and support rods. Most of the body panels were replaced and the chassis was stripped to a bare shell and stitched-welded in 2016 following a rollover on track. The Carfax report lists an accident in 2007. Noted flaws include a scrape on the corner of the front bumper cover. Team Dynamics Motorsport 18″ wheels are mounted to the hubs with replacement OEM wheel bearings and Turner Motorsport 86mm studs  and were recently fitted with 245/65 Toyo Proxes slicks that have not yet been used, per the seller. The brakes consist of four-piston AP Racing calipers and 332x32mm rotors at each corner along with stainless steel lines, a Chase Bays adjustable bias valve, TMS cooling brake back plates, and Wilwood pads. The brake booster has been deleted. Reinforements have been added to the front and rear sway bar mounts, the front and rear subframes, the front X-brace, and rear trailing arms. The rear trailing arms and subframe were modified to accommodate fully adjustable DTM-style spherical bushings, while the front subframe was revised to accommodate an MRT Engineering front suspension kit comprised of a solid mount control arm bushing with spherical bushings throughout and billet aluminum control arms and tie rods with bump steer correction. TMS solid aluminum rear subframe bushings have been installed along with a Rogue Engineering differential cover with TMS solid aluminum bushings. Additional suspension modifications include the following: Öhlins Raceline S36HMRC remote reservoir front coilovers Öhlins Raceline ILX36 rear coilovers Ground Control front camber plates Ground Control rear shocks mounts Ground Control adjustable front sway bar 22mm adjustable rear sway bar Custom front shock tower brace Two spare wheels are included in the sale. The stripped interior has two Cobra bucket seats with Schroth harnesses anchored to the custom-fabricated roll cage, and the driver’s seat has been partially upholstered in reproduction BMW M Rain fabric. The modified dashboard houses a carbon fiber switch panel, above which is mounted an AiM Solo datalogger. Additional equipment includes a four-panel rearview mirror, alloy pedals, and a rear-mounted Peterson Fluid Systems oil tank for the dry-sump system. The MOMO steering wheel sits ahead of a Holley digital dashboard, with additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature mounted in place of the center air vents. A crankcase vacuum gauge has also been added. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and total mileage is unknown. The 427ci LS stroker V8 was built by Horsepower Research of McKinney, Texas, in October 2024, and was dyno rated at 521 wheel horsepower on 93-octane fuel. The engine block was fitted with Darton LS7 dry liners and a balanced Callies CompStar crankshaft before being reassembled with Callies LS CompStar connecting rods, HPR Performance cylinder heads, a 620/632 Comp Cams camshaft, and Wiseco pistons manufactured according to HRP specifications with a gas-ported ring set. The engine is equipped with a rebuilt and upgraded dry-sump oiling system from Dailey Engineering. Fuel is provided by FIC 525 injectors and a Walbro 255 pump controlled by the Holley ECU. Additional equipment includes the following: ARP hardware LS3 intake valves, Manley exhaust valves Holley aluminum valve covers Holley main engine harness Holley crank trigger kit with hall effect sensor Nick Williams 92 mm cable throttle body Pertronix Flame-Thrower ignition coils Radium Engineering coolant overflow tank Radium Engineering breather/ catch can Improved Racing breather check valves CSF aluminum radiator Derale 18″ electric radiator fan Sikky Manufacturing engine mounts All OEM wiring removed \u0026 replaced Post break-in compression test results from November 2024 are provided in the image gallery below. A spare alternator accompanies the car. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rebuilt Tremec T56 six-speed transmission and a Diffsonline limited-slip differential with 3.73:1 gears and solid aluminum mounts. The car is equipped a Monster twin-disc clutch and a 20 lb. steel flywheel. Exhaust gases exit via custom stainless steel headers, dual 4″ resonators, and Borla mufflers with 3″ stainless steel piping. Additional photos taken during the build can be viewed in the gallery. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned accident and lists registration history in Rhode Island and New Hampshire. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
