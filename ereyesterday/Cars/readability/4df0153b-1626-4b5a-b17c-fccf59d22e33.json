Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published November 27th, 2024 5:30 PM Comments Join the conversation TG ventured out today (fuel prices are down somewhat, thank you President Dr. Jill Biden) and the mall/shopping areas are super-dead for some reason today -- I guess all the bad things really did happen to the economy, as predicted by many of you. There is a brand new Tesla supercharger station (12 chargers) right where you would want to have it, if EVs were still a thing. Watched a few vehicles come and go (I was there for maybe 20 minutes but it must have been 17 hours), is that the same white Tesla coming back, I guess the first charge didn't get them very far? That Rivian R1S has out of state plates, they must have towed it here. There were only a few fistfights while I was watching, and surprisingly only 2 of the EVs caught fire (I kept my distance, because of fire risk plus electromagnetic fields). The grid went down twice as 3 vehicles tried to use 12 chargers. Try a little gasoline in your turkey gravy next year, you won't regret it. Is Denver still considering banning right turns on red? I ask because the criminal in the Dodge Charger behind me at the traffic light today (ventured out two days in a row, TG is out of control) with Colorado plates was in an all-fired hurry to swing around me all of a sudden to get into the right turn lane, but then waited there on green before finally turning. Weird. Perhaps the gasoline fumes have affected him, or maybe he was sore about his big investment in petroleum to reach that spot from Colorado. (I hope my town isn't a let-down for him.)
