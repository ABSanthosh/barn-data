  "description": "The Skoda Octavia is scheduled to make its comeback to the Indian market this year, and a diesel engine is going to be part of the line-up. As we reported from Auto Expo 2025, Skoda has decided to bring back the diesel powertrain five years after its parent company, VW Group, discontinued all of its oil burners. On the sidelines of the Octavia RS drive, Petr Janeba, Skoda Auto India brand director, confirmed that the diesel-powered version of the sedan will arrive in India in time for the festive season. India-spec Octavia diesel to get 2.0-litre engine Will be brought as a full import Skoda Octavia diesel India launch date and specifications When asked when the Octavia diesel would arrive, Janeba said, “I think late September should be the date before the festive season comes.” He also confirmed that the model would be brought in as a CBU through the Indian government’s GSR 870 rule and would be the same model on sale in the UK. India-spec Octavia diesel to get 150hp engine and automatic gearbox Skoda India’s brand director also asserted that the UK-spec Octavia diesel being brought to our market has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine, which produces 150hp.
