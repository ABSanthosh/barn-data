  "text": "To close out 2024, we’ve asked our three busiest Speedhunters of the year to highlight their three favorite stories from the past 12 months – from feature cars to events and everything in between. Let’s kick things off with Alen Haseta, our man on the ground in Scandinavia. AH: This year, I was lucky enough to check off a number of things I’ve long wanted to do since becoming a Speedhunter… Firstly, I convinced Olav Haugen Hasdal to take me for a ride in his Mercedes-Benz A-Class drift monster at Gatebil’s 2024 Summer Festival back in July. Sliding around the automotive playground that is Rudskogen Motorsenter, playing cat and mouse with other cars, was an unforgettable experience. The highlight came on the Norwegian circuit’s famous straight, where the first thing you see when initiating the drift is a looming concrete wall – before quickly correcting and heading rearward into the first corner. What a ride. Check out the feature here: Rowdy In Rudskogen: Gatebil’s 2024 Main Event My trip to the annual Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix at Bellahøj Park in Denmark was a major highlight this year. Capturing the 1990s Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) in action isn’t an opportunity that comes around often, at least not for me. Watching these legends battle it out on the tight, tricky street circuit, with the scream of engines echoing off the concrete walls, left a lasting impression. The event has sparked a curiosity about similar events across Europe – I’m hoping to make it to a few more in 2025. Check out the feature here: ’90s DTM Legends \u0026 More At The Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix Finally, my last shoot of the summer took me to Stockholm, where I met up with Daniel Zetterval and his Ford Escort Mk1, which he built with his father, Mats. There’s something especially meaningful about a father-son project, but this one was even more significant. The Mk1 is the sole survivor of a devastating garage fire that destroyed seven cars, some of which had been in the family for decades. The Escort stands as more than just a physical build – it’s a reminder of the late nights Daniel and Mats spent together in the garage, creating what Daniel now calls his “forever car.” Check out the feature here: Family Matters: A Mk1 Ford Escort With Rally Ties Happy New Year to everyone!
