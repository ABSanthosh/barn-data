  "description": "Can this all-new EV shake up the burgeoning electric compact SUV class? The new Skoda Elroq is the Czech marque’s second bespoke EV and marks its assault on the electric compact crossover class – a move that it hopes will help bolster its position as Europe's fourth best-selling car brand.This is effectively the electric equivalent of the Karoq, but it's not a reworked version of the ICE car: it uses the same electrical underpinnings as the larger Skoda Enyaq. Skoda has already found success in the electric car market, with the Enyaq climbing to the very top of EV sales charts. But the Elroq’s task is undoubtedly harder, as it's entering a segment that has mushroomed in popularity. There’s a plethora of rivals already baying for the attention of British buyers, such as the Ford Explorer, Volvo EX30 and Kia EV3. So, is the Elroq up to the task?",

  "text": "At 4488mm long, 1884mm wide and 1625mm tall, the Elroq’s footprint is similar to the Explorer's. It’s underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, which is also used by the Audi Q4 E-tron, Cupra Born and Volkswagen ID 3, plus of course the Enyaq. Overall, it’s about 160mm shorter than its stablemate, the reduction in size coming from the Elroq’s shorter overhangs. But while its underpinnings aren't anything new, its design very much is, because the Elroq is the first Skoda to adopt the brand’s Modern Solid design language – as previewed by the Vision 7S SUV concept. Up front, there’s a new Tech Deck face featuring a distinctive black bar that spans the width of the car. The clamshell bonnet features the ‘Skoda’ name written across its leading edge, instead of the brand's badge.  There’s an all-LED split-light design, with the upper daytime running lights part of the light bar at the front and the headlights flanking a lower gloss-black panel that houses the radars and sensors for the car’s safety systems.  While the new design language has brought clean surfaces and a sloping roofline to the Elroq, its silhouette has also been sculpted to benefit aerodynamics. Various elements in the bodywork, including some active parts, help reduce air resistance for a drag coefficient of 0.26Cd. Opening the Elroq range is the 50 (model names are indicative of battery size), which is powered by a 52kWh battery and 168bhp electric motor and has a range of 232 miles. This will cost £31,500, which narrowly undercuts the EX30 and Peugeot e-3008.  Next comes the 60, with a 63kWh battery, a 201bhp motor and a range of 260 miles.  Finally there's the 85, which gets an 82kWh battery, a 282bhp motor and an impressive 360-mile range.  All Elroqs can be charged from 10-80% in under 30 minutes, thanks to a preheating function that increases efficiency at DC fast charging stations.",
