  "description": "Former Jaguar design chief's firm reimagines classic Mini as £75k hot hatch with modern tech Ian Callum’s eponymous design house has partnered with renowned Mini coachbuilder Wood \u0026 Pickett to reimagine the city car as a hot hatch fitted with modern technology. It is based on the bodyshell of the Mk5 Mini Sportspack – the wide-arched version built from 1997-2001, at the end of the model’s production run – but is overhauled with a rally-spec engine, a new suspension set-up and uprated brakes. The A-Series engine has been upsized from 1275cc to 1310cc and fitted with a new cylinder head, two-point fuel injection and a custom twin-pipe exhaust. This boosts its output from the original 63bhp to 110bhp. The gearbox has also been strengthened to cope with the additional reserves. The new suspension is said to be tuned for road use and is matched with a set of grooved and ventilated 8.4in disc brakes. The original car’s Minilite wheels have been replaced by a four-spoke set of Callum’s design, measuring the same 13in in diameter. Styling tweaks include the fitment of Wood \u0026 Pickett’s wide arches, sportier front and rear bumpers and LED lights. Inside, it gets a wooden dashboard fascia inspired by the walnut panels fitted to Wood \u0026 Pickett’s Margrave Mini in the 1960s, metal foglight and heater switches, and a small touchscreen with Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring. Each of the Callum and Wood \u0026 Pickett Minis will be hand-built to their owner’s exacting specifications, Ian Callum said. Prices start at £75,000. The new restomod marks the return of Wood \u0026 Pickett to the fore of Mini customisation. The company was founded by Bill Wood and Les Pickett in 1947 and established itself as a leading coachbuilder with its Mini conversions in the 1960s.  These were especially popular among celebrities, with commissions from the likes of Mick Jagger, Elton John and Paul and Linda McCartney. Indeed, Callum has tapped the same market for the new Mini: the first owner is model and creative David Gandy. Wood \u0026 Pickett exchanged hands as a company several times over the decades. Notably, it spent 1986 to 1989 under British Leyland dealer the Henlys Group, when it primarily focused on high-value conversions of the original Range Rover. Today, it is owned by Motaclan, the firm that owns the former MG Rover parts division. Motaclan said it will soon offer a range of Wood \u0026 Pickett parts designed by Callum, enabling classic Mini owners to perform their own conversions.",
