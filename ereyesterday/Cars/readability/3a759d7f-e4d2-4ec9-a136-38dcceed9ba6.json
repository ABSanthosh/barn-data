This is a massive drop and now puts the model far below the likes of a Jeep Wrangler with the 392 V8 engine. The only other trim to receive a haircut in terms of price is the four-door Badlands, which shaves a thousand dollars off its sticker to settle at $50,385. Almost everything else rises slightly; base trim is up a grand ($38,995 for a two-door), Badlands two-door gets a small increase, and the Big Bend pads its bottom line by $850. Others such as the Stroppe and Heritage edition see no change. As an aside, it is something of an open secret that Ford selected those convoluted trim names in an attempt to purposely help buyers not be able to compare directly with their buddies. It would have been easy to lord over yer friend that you have an XLT when he only has an XL; but Big Bend versus Outer Banks versus Badlands et al? Much more difficult. Save for Eddie Bauer, the Bronco hasn’t really had those types of trims before - though that one arguably worked well as a standalone in a sea of XLs and XLTs. Also, ‘Bauer Bronco’ was fun to say. Note that delivery charges also go up a hundred bucks, sliding another c-note into the multi-year loan most buyers will arrange for their shiny new Bronco.[Images: Ford, © 2025 Tim Healey/TTAC.com]Become a TTAC insider.
