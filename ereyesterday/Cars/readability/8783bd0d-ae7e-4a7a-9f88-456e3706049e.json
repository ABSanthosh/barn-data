  "text": "This country -- maybe the entire world -- is crossover-crazed. It's been this way for a decade-plus, and I still don't get it.I mean, yes, for some people, maybe a lot of people, a crossover makes sense from a use-case perspective. Some people need the cargo space, or the easier entry, or a third seating row. Some need to or like to sit up high. Some need a bit more ground clearance to get to the campsite. I get it.But sedans aren't useless -- many have plenty of trunk space, many can handle two children with ease, and most will offer better fuel economy than even the thriftiest crossovers.So how do we convince people that don't truly need a crossover or SUV that they might be fine with a sedan? Automakers won't do the job, they have reasons to market crossovers.So it's on us.Note that the question isn't \"can we save the sedans\" but rather, \"how\". The former is a different question for a different day.",
