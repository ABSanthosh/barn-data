  "text": "Stellantis is aware of 533 warranty claims related to the issue, but not of any accidents or injuries 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos are recalled due to a brake system defect. A faulty module could cause these SUVs to roll away unexpectedly when parked. Stellantis is developing a solution for affected models and will notify owners soon. Stellantis has announced a recall of over 206,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango models in the United States, citing three safety issues—including a defect that could result in vehicles rolling away unexpectedly. Not exactly the kind of surprise you want from your SUV. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recall report highlights a critical issue with the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) module. In some cases, the module misreads pressure in the primary brake circuit, enabling the vehicle to start and shift out of park without the brake pedal being engaged. This isn’t the only thing FCA US is worried about. Read: 1.16 Million Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, And Ram Models Recalled For Reverse Camera Fails According to Stellantis, the same faulty module may randomly illuminate the brake lights at up to 4.5 mph, when when the brakes aren’t being applied. The issue can also disable the ABS and electronic stability control systems, increasing the risk of a crash. In total, 206,502 vehicles in the United States are impacted by the recall. These consist of 158,045 Jeep Grand Cherokees built between June 11, 2018, and July 12, 2019, for the 2018 and 2019 model years, as well as 48,448 Dodge Durango models assembled from June 12, 2018, to July 12, 2019. Vehicles that have experienced a HCU/ABS module failure will show various warning indicator lights on the dash. A Déjà Vu Defect This is not the first time the automaker has had to recall vehicles for this fault. In mid-2022, it recalled cars that had brake lights that could stay illuminated. However, it discovered in February this year that the original remedy may not resolve the issue. The company also only recently found out about the potential loss of ABS/ESC function on impacted models. While 533 warranty claims have been filed over this defect, Stellantis says no accidents or injuries have been reported to date. Jeep and Dodge owners will be formally notified about the recall between December 5 and December 12, but the wait for a permanent remedy will continue. The company says a fix is still in development.",
