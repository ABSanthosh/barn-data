  "text": "Registered in January and showing only 14 miles, this luxury SUV still faced a surprising lack of buyer interest at auction 2 hours ago by Chris Chilton A virtually new Mercedes SUV couldn’t get within $20k of its new price at auction. Bidding stalled on the black GLS450 with AMG Line trim at $77,200 this week. If it had sold for $77k, it would have cost the owner $1,500 for every mile driven. New cars depreciate rapidly in the first year of ownership, but a big chunk of the drop in value occurs before they’ve even turned a wheel. The moment its title is issued in your name, before the ink is dry on the check, and before you’ve even gotten behind the wheel your new vehicle has bled dollars, as the owner of a Mercedes SUV discovered. This… as YouTuber Doug De Muro would put it, is a 2025 Mercedes GLS, and it recently put in an appearance on Doug’s online auction platform, Cars \u0026 Bids. Unfortunately for the seller, bids were in short supply, and the action stalled at $77,178, which was almost $21k less than the $97,945 it cost new, and because there was a reserve, it failed to sell. Related: GLS63, GLE63 And GLE53 PHEV Spied Testing As AMG Readies Army Of Facelifted SUVs The lack of bidding interest definitely wasn’t due to it having covered a ton of miles in a short period. In fact, the GLS has recorded just 14 miles (23 miles) since first leaving the lot in January of this year, which is completely within the acceptable bounds of delivery mileage for a new car. And when it comes to condition, the thing is perfect, because it’s never been used. A GLS 450, it comes with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six linked to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that’s rated at 375 hp (380 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque. Mercedes quotes a zero to 60 mph (97 kmh) time of 5.8 seconds, which isn’t bad for an SUV of this size with the entry-level engine. Photos Cars \u0026 Bids But while this GLS might have the base motor, it’s not in base trim. A no-options 450 has an retail price of $90,350 including destination, but the auction listing reveals this one was ordered with add-ons like the AMG Line Package ($3,250), Night Package ($400), head-up display ($1,100) and 22-inch AMG rims ($1,350) that inflated the total cost to $97,945. Cars \u0026 Bids says it’s reaching out to the seller and the highest bidder to try to broker a deal, and if it’s one that comes close to the top bid of $77,718 the new owner will have snagged themselves what’s effectively a brand new six-figure Benz for 20 percent less than it would cost them in a Mercedes showroom. But the new buyer doesn’t want to get too smug – or pay too much – because Mercedes is about to roll out a facelifted GLS with star-shaped DRLs and full-width dashboard display, which could be one of the reasons bids proved hard to come by.
