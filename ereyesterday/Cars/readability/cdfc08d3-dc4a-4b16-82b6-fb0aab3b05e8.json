It is finished in Healey Blue over blue leather with white piping and is powered by a 2.9-liter inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Equipment includes a blue soft top, 15″ knock-off wire wheels, front disc brakes, a top boot, a tonneau cover, a hood scoop, a cabin heater, and bucket seats. This 3000 Mk II is now offered on dealer consignment with a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, service records, and a clean Oregon title. The car came finished from the factory in Healey Blue (BU2) and was stripped to bare metal and repainted during the restoration, which also involved installing a replacement rear fender dogleg panel and repair panels on the door bottom, left front fender, and rear fender. The frame rails were also repaired at that time and the brightwork was re-chromed, and photos from the work are provided in the gallery. Equipment includes a removable blue soft top, a top boot, a tonneau cover, a hood scoop, and chrome bumpers with overriders. The 15″ knock-off wire wheels are mounted with 165R15 Michelin XZX tires. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The cabin was refreshed during the restoration, including reupholstering the seats in blue leather with white piping as well as replacing the foam padding and repairing the dashboard. The banjo-style steering wheel frames Smiths white-dial instrumentation consisting of a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, a fuel-level gauge, and a combination gauge displaying oil pressure and water temperature. The speedometer was rebuilt by Nisonger Instruments in 2005, and the five-digit odometer currently shows 72k miles. The 2.9-liter inline-six featured triple SU HS4 carburetors from the factory for a rating of 136 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. The engine was rebuilt in the early 2000s, at which time Ross forged pistons, hardened exhaust seats, and a replacement wiring harness were installed. The ignition points capacitor was replaced in preparation for the sale, and compression test results are viewable in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission with Laycock-de Normanville electric overdrive, both of which were overhauled along with the clutch, driveline, and rear axle. Photos and records from the restoration are provided in the gallery. The car achieved a gold level certification from the Austin-Healey Concours Registry in July 2007. The British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate lists the factory colors and equipment along with a build date in December 1963. You are not connected to real-time updates.
