  "description": "This 881 mo 2021 Ferrari SF90 Stradale was delivered new by Ferrari of Houston, Texas, and was previously sold on BaT in May 2024. It is finished in Grigio Ferro with a Nero roof as well as a Giallo Modena nose accent and Argento Nurburgring stripe, while the cockpit houses carbon-fiber racing seats trimmed in black leather with yellow accents. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and a trio of electric motors that drive all four wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The Assetto Fiorano package was specified from the factory and added motorsport-derived Multimatic shocks, titanium springs, a titanium exhaust system, and carbon-fiber door and underbody panels for a weight savings of approximately 66 pounds. The car rides on 20″ forged wheels and is further equipped with a Formula 1–inspired drag-reduction system as well as a regenerative braking system with yellow-finished calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. Additional details include a carbon-fiber front spoiler and rear diffuser, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and black ceramic exhaust pipes along with a 7.9-kWh lithium-ion battery, an adaptive front lighting system, and an advanced front driving camera. Acquired by the selling dealer in August 2024, this SF90 Stradale is now offered with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title in the seller’s name.",

Acquired by the selling dealer in August 2024, this SF90 Stradale is now offered with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title in the seller’s name. The SF90 Stradale was designed by director Flavio Manzoni’s team at the Ferrari Styling Center and was introduced to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team. This example is finished in Grigio Ferro with a Nero roof, a Giallo Modena nose accent, and an Argento Nurburgring nose stripe that extends over the hood, roof, and decklid. Scuderia Ferrari fender shields adorn the fenders, and the hood, bumpers, side splitters, under-door covers, and rear diffuser are constructed of carbon fiber. A Formula 1–inspired drag-reduction system utilizes active aerodynamics, a two-piece rear wing, and underbody vortex generators. Further equipment includes an advanced front driving camera, an adaptive front lighting system, LED lighting, front and rear parking sensors, and black ceramic exhaust pipes. XPEL paint protection film has been applied to the front of the car, according to the seller. The car was ceramic coated and paint protection film was applied to the front end in August 2024, per the selling dealer. Forged 20″ wheels featuring diamond-finished accents are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measure 255/35 up front and 315/30 out back, and they are secured with titanium wheel stud bolts. The SF90 Stradale features an aluminum chassis, and Multimatic-sourced shocks and titanium springs were included as part of the Assetto Fiorano package. The electronic Side Slip Control (eSSC) and electric traction control (eTC) systems distribute torque to each individual wheel. The regenerative brake system splits stopping force between the hydraulic system and the electric motors. Yellow-finished calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors are fitted at all four corners. A brake fluid flush was performed in July 2023. The cockpit features large-size carbon-fiber racing seats trimmed in black leather with yellow accents and embroidered prancing-horse logos on the headrests. The seats are fitted atop racing seat lifters, and carbon-fiber trim accents the center console and door panels. Additional equipment includes dual-zone climate control, navigation, and an electrochromic rearview mirror. The flat-bottom steering wheel is trimmed in carbon-fiber and leather with yellow stitching. It sits ahead of column-mounted carbon-fiber paddle shifters and is equipped with an engine-start button, a manettino driving-mode selector, and shift lights. Instrumentation consists of a digital instrument cluster paired with a head-up display. The digital odometer indicates 881 miles. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter F154 FA V8 is linked with a trio of electric motors for a combined power output of 986 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. The two front and single rear electric motors produce an additional 334 horsepower and 322 lb-ft of torque. A 7.9-kWh lithium-ion battery pack is mounted between the engine and the carbon-fiber cabin bulkhead. An oil change was performed in July 2023 along with a software update in February 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ferrari of West Houston, and lists factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $668,982. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
