  "description": "An extremely rare 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 R Stromlinienwagen has been sold at auction for 51 million euros, or approximately Rs 458 crore, becoming the most expensive Formula 1 car ever auctioned. Notably, it is one of the only four known complete examples fitted with a factory-built streamlined bodywork. The bidding took place at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart (in Germany) by RM Sotheby's on February 1, 2025. Details about the buyer were not immediately revealed. Further, it is the second most valuable car in the world after the 1955 Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut coupe, which was auctioned for about Rs 1,266 crore in 2022. Sir Stirling Moss recorded the fastest lap at the 1955 Italian Gran Prix with the W196 R It featured a 2.5-litre straight-eight engine with direct fuel injection, generating up to 290hp  The W196 R, chassis number ‘00009/54’, has a significant racing history. It was driven by five-time Formula 1 World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio to victory at the 1955 Buenos Aires Grand Prix. The same classic Mercedes F1 car was also driven by Sir Stirling Moss at the 1955 Italian Grand Prix in Monza (in Italy), where it recorded the fastest lap of the race. After its competition career ended, Mercedes donated the W196 R to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum in 1965. For nearly six decades, it was taken care of by the museum, occasionally displayed at major automotive events, including the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, a premier classic car show. The W196 R was a key part of Mercedes-Benz’s dominant return to Formula 1 in the 1950s. This legendary F1 race car featured a 2.5-litre straight-eight engine with direct fuel injection and valve actuation, generating up to 290hp. Its streamlined bodywork was designed to maximise speed on high-speed circuits like Monza, making it one of the most advanced F1 cars of its time.
