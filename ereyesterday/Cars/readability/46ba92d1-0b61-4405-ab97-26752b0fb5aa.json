  "description": "If you were around on BaT back in 2017 when we started selling motorcycles on a consistent basis, you probably saw a lot of Honda Trail minibikes in every color and displacement. This pocket-sized collection from 1600veloce, with six nicely presented H0nda Trail CT70s and one Z50A Mini Trail, shows that we haven't let up since. All are refurbished examples being offered at no reserve and will begin going live this afternoon, Thursday, November 21.",

This pocket-sized collection from 1600veloce, with six nicely presented H0nda Trail CT70s and one Z50A Mini Trail, shows that we haven’t let up since. All are refurbished examples being offered at no reserve and will begin going live this afternoon, Thursday, November 21. A brief preview of the collection is below, and a full list of bikes on offer can be found at the end of this post. Two bikes in the collection feature the smaller 49cc single—a Z50A Mini Trail with a three-speed semi-automatic gearbox and a repowered CT70H with a four-speed manual. Two more four-speed CT70Hs are finished in Candy Topaz and Candy Gold. Both were previously held in collections and refurbished under previous ownership. Rounding out the collection is a trio of red, white, and blue CT70s, one of which is an “H” model with a four-speed manual gearbox. All but the Mini Trail hail from the 1970 model year, and all are presented with tool kits and sold on bills of sale. The full collection is listed below and will be updated with links as auctions go live: 1976 Honda Z50A Mini Trail 49cc-Powered 1970 Honda CT70H Trail Candy Topaz 1970 Honda CT70H Trail Candy Gold 1970 Honda CT70H Trail Metallic Red 1970 Honda CT70 Trail White 1970 Honda CT70 Trail Metallic Blue 1970 Honda CT70H Trail",
