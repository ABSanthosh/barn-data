Chassis 20395 was purchased by the seller in 1990, who commissioned a refurbishment carried out in the mid-2010s that involved fitment of a Group 4–style body finished in blue with a tribute livery in the style of the car campaigned by Gérard Larrousse and Christian Delferrier at the 1974 iteration of the Tour de Corse. Overhauls were also carried out to the independent suspension, ventilated disc brakes, Type 365 five-speed manual transaxle, and replacement Gordini Type 807-20 inline-four, the latter of which was built to displace 2.0-liters with Arias pistons, CatCams camshafts, a Renault Clio Williams–specification crankshaft, and twin Weber 45 DCOE carburetors. The car rides on multi-piece 13\" Gotti wheels paired with KW adjustable coilovers at each corner and wears a front spoiler, flared fenders, and Cibié fog lamps with covers.

The car rides on multi-piece 13″ Gotti wheels paired with KW adjustable coilovers at each corner and wears a front spoiler, flared fenders, and Cibié fog lamps with covers. Inside, OMP fixed-back bucket seats and six-point harnesses are joined by a MOMO steering wheel, a Heigo Motorsport roll cage, and an OMP fire-suppression system. This Group 4–style A110 is now offered in Losheim am See, Germany, with a Certificate of Authenticity issued by Renault, refurbishment photos, ownership notes, and German registration in the seller’s name. The A110 berlinette entered production in 1963 with Giovanni Michelotti–styled fiberglass bodywork underpinned by a steel backbone chassis and Renault drivetrain components. Introduced in late 1969, the 1600S variant gained power from an aluminum-block Cléon-Alu inline-four shared with the Renault R16. After FIA Group 4 homologation of the A110 1600 in 1970, the model established itself as a force in European rallies with victories in the Monte Carlo Rally and Coupes de Alpes among its achievements. This example received a replacement Group 4–style body as part of the aforementioned refurbishment and has been finished in blue with a replica 1974 Tour de Corse livery. The chassis also reinforced and powder-coated in black as part of the project. Exterior details include flared fenders, painted rear bumperettes, and an external electrical cutoff switch as well as Cibié fog lamps with covers, a driver-door-mounted Vitaloni mirror, and a Le Bozec fuel filler cap. Multi-piece 13″ Gotti wheels feature orange-finished centers with polished rims and are mounted with Michelin TB5 tires measuring 16×53 up front and 20×53 out back. The steering system is unassisted, while the independent suspension utilizes KW adjustable coilovers, heim-joint radius rods, adjustable tie rod ends, and front and rear anti-roll bars. Stopping power is provided by cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner with braided stainless-steel lines and a hydraulic parking brake. The cockpit houses a pair of OMP fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black cloth and outfitted with six-point harnesses. The Heigo Motorsport roll cage is partially padded overhead, and further appointments include a heated windshield, a reverse-lockout plate, a passenger-side map lamp, and vehicle control switches along the black dashboard. An OMP fire-suppression system is also equipped along with a mid-mounted 80-liter fuel system that incorporates dual fuel cells and Facet electric fuel pumps. The MOMO steering wheel bears a Jackie Stewart signature is mounted on a quick-release hub and fronts green-letter Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 240-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The cluster also includes a Jaeger voltmeter, and a Halda Trip Master has been installed on the passenger-side of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 68k chassis kilometers (~42k miles), and the seller notes that approximately 3k kilometers have been added since completion of the engine rebuild. refurbishment project. The rear-mounted Gordini inline-four was built to displace 2.0-liters as part of the refurbishment with a bore of 83mm and a stroke of 93mm. The engine is comprised of a Type 807-20 block, Arias pistons, CatCams camshafts, a Renault Clio Williams-specification crankshaft, and TRW 43mm intake and 37mm exhaust valves. The seller tells us that the cylinder head was overhauled by Benny Raepers, and induction is via twin Weber 45 DCOE carburetors. The oil filter has been relocated, and a radiator is installed up front along with dual oil coolers. Work performed in June 2024 is noted to have involved replacing the starter, battery, and spark plugs as well as refreshing the fluids. The results of a dynamometer test performed in 2017 are shown above and record approximately 130 kW (~175 horsepower) of power at 6,250-rpm and 216 Nm (~159 lb-ft) of torque at 5,200-rpm. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a retrofitted Type 365 five-speed manual dog-ring transaxle that was rebuilt during the project with straight-cut gears. An AP Racing clutch assembly has been installed. A drilled skid plate shields the powertrain, and the seller notes that the rear of the chassis was widened to accommodate quick-jacks. The Certificate of Authenticity issued by Renault S.A.S. notes that the car left the factory in January 7, 1975, and lists specified colors, options, and powertrain numbers. Photos documenting various stages of the refurbishment process are shown in the gallery below along with ownership notes detailing the car’s technical specifications. The vehicle is being sold on its German registration, which serves as an ownership document in Germany. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
