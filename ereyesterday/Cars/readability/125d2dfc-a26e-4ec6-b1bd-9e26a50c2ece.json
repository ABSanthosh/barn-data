Speaking to Autocar India at the launch of the Temerario in Delhi, Francesco Scardaoni Asia Pacific Region Director Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.said, “The idea was never to be the first ones, but to be the best one when it comes to EVs. So, when we created our electrification strategy, the ‘Direzione Cor Tauri’ we knew it was important to set the right time for an EVs introduction and we think that is still some time away.” First Lambo EV to be a 2+2 GT  Revuelto sold out for over two years Lamborghini customers want hybrids right now, not EVs Indian clients have shown lots of interest in the Temerario The first model is going to be a 2+2 GT which Scardaoni says will only arrive by the end of the decade and not earlier. “We believe hybrids are an important step towards electrification and right now our customers want these (hybrids)”. Scardaoni adds that the Revuelto being sold out for over two years is a clear indication of this customer acceptance. Scardaoni attributes that to Lamborghini approach to hybridization. \"For us, hybridization has no drawbacks, it means instead adding features and capabilities to the car, so more power, more driveability and agility and less emissions”. With the two electric motors driving the front axle the Temerario is able to achieve torque vectoring much faster that traditional systems and the company says it uses brake intervention far fewer times and mostly adjusts torque through rapid motor adjustments. This leads to a more natural driving feel and faster cornering. With the Temerario, Lamborghini’s line up is now fully electrified and Scardaoni says there is already lots of interest from clients in India and he expects 2025 to be a good year building on its record 2024 where it delivered 113 vehicles.
