This 992 S/T was sold new via Champion Porsche in Pompano Beach, Florida, has 130 miles, and is now offered with a transferrable Porsche Approved Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title. The 992 S/T was introduced in 2024 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the 911 and features lightweight construction with carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) panels, lightweight glass, reduced insulation, and magnesium wheels. Taking its name from a series of 911 Group 4 race cars produced between 1970 and 1972 with 911S mechanicals beneath the lighter 911T, the 992 S/T features GT3 Touring styling with a GT3 RS drivetrain. The car is finished in Shore Blue Metallic (R5G) with white lettering and gold badging, and it features ParkAssist rear parking sensors and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are finished in Ceramica and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system. The cabin is trimmed in Black and Classic Cognac Heritage Design Semi-Aniline leather. Amenities include carbon-fiber full bucket seats, Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. A numbered gold plaque notes the car as #447 in the series. Instrumentation with Classic Green accents includes a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. The digital odometer indicates 130 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The selling dealer notes that the car comes with the transferrable remainder of the factory warranty in addition to a Porsche CPO warranty, and the details are outlined on the documents in the gallery. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage. There is currently a lien on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner.
