Work included a rotisserie repaint, an overhaul of the suspension and brakes, refinishing the 15″ Fuchs wheels, reupholstery of the interior, a rebuild of the 915 five-speed manual transaxle, and a refresh of the 2.4-liter flat-six. The car is finished in Pastel Blue over black leatherette and is equipped with Bosch mechanical fuel injection, a 911S-style front spoiler, and H4 headlights. This 911E is now offered in Scottsdale, Arizona on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, refurbishment documents, and a clean South Dakota title. The car was disassembled, placed on a rotisserie, and stripped to bare metal before receiving a single-stage repaint in its factory shade of Pastel Blue (2020) during the refurbishment. Body repairs were completed at that time, and replacement seals, Deco trim, rocker moldings, window seals, door sill plates, and decklid trim were installed. The bumper guards were re-chromed, and alloy trim pieces were polished. H4 headlights and a 911S-style front spoiler have been added. The 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels were refinished by Al Reed Polishing and are mounted with 185/70 Pirelli P6000 tires. The four-wheel disc brakes were overhauled during the refurbishment, including rebuilding the calipers and replacing the pads, rotors, seals, gaskets, wheel bearings, and lines. Suspension components were powder coated and replacement CV joints, bearings, bushings, and Boge shocks were installed. The seats and interior panels were reupholstered in black leatherette, and replacement carpets were installed during the refresh. The dash pad, window crank handles, and headliner were replaced. A battery charger is fitted in the front trunk. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation consisting of a 150-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer was reset to zero at the time of the refurbishment and now shows 1k miles. The 2.4-liter flat-six was factory equipped with Bosch mechanical fuel injection and was refreshed during the refurbishment, including balancing the crankshaft, replacing the bearings, upgrading and modifying the oil pump, and rebuilding the cylinder heads. The rockers were re-bushed, the valve adjusters replaced as needed, the fuel system was overhauled, and the timing chains, tensioners, alternator, spark plugs, and ignition wires were replaced along with additional parts shown on the refurbishment summary provided in the gallery. The cold start injection nozzles were replaced by Porsche Palm Springs in May 2024, and oil seepage from the right timing chain that was noted at that time has reportedly since been addressed. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a 915 five-speed manual transaxle, which was rebuilt and fitted with replacement synchro rings, gaskets, and bearings. The clutch, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing were also replaced. Oil seepage from the bottom of the transaxle has reportedly been addressed in the last year. An undercoating was applied to the chassis, and it was refinished to match the body. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
