I call it ‘Singer Syndrome’ – the idea that modernising a classic car and selling it for several times its market value is a viable and sustainable business model. Some succeed, while others are quickly laughed off the road. What I’ve been enjoying lately aren’t your typical restomods, but builds that retain distinct character while being upgraded with the best tuning and styling parts 2024 has to offer. Throtl’s R34 2 Fast 2 Furious tribute build is a prime example, blending big-screen nostalgia with shattering performance. But for those who prefer their automotive icons a little more…Eastern, John Lau’s 1971 S30 Datsun 240Z might be the perfect reimagination. The otaku among you will likely recognise this car as looking like the ‘Devil Z,’ from the popular manga and anime series Wangan Midnight. While the bodywork is certainly more extreme than its cartoon counterpart, the spirit is unmistakably there. The San Marino Blue hue is commonly found on BMWs and Porsches, and the Jon Sibal-designed body kit brings the car firmly into the 21st century, compared to the Devil Z’s traditional bolt-on overfenders. Bespoke LED headlights and taillights are a modern touch, while carbon fibre mirrors, bumpers, and a giant diffuser create some contrast against the metallic paintwork. Beneath the arches, you’ll find a massive set of 17×11.5-inch and 18×13-inch staggered Work Meister M1 wheels wrapped in Toyo Proxes R888R semi-slick tyres. Apex Engineered coilovers provide the suspension drop while stopping power comes via a custom Turbohoses carbon-ceramic brake setup. Inside, you’ll find custom leatherwork that complements the black and red Recaro Sportster GT seats. A custom roll bar is fitted behind the driver and passenger, and custom gauges are another nod to the Devil Z. John grips a Momo steering wheel and makes gear shifts via a billet knob. The Z’s engine is the real stand-out feature of the build. Unlike many restomodded Datsuns that feature SR or RB engine swaps, John resisted the urge to retrofit a modern motor, instead keeping things OG with an inline-six L-series – specifically, a 2.8-litre L28 bored out to 3.0 litres. He then added a Garrett G35-900 turbocharger for extra punch. The engine has been toughened up with forged pistons and connecting rods, along with Schneider Performance valve springs and retainers. A ported and polished head improves airflow, while the boost is fed through a Protuner Z Turbo manifold and a custom intake plenum with 47mm intake trumpets. The engine runs on E85 biofuel thanks to the Haltech ECU’s programming and ethanol-specific Injector Dynamics injectors. An Infiniti 6-speed gearbox and a Ford differential channel the power to the 315-section rear tyres, with the Haltech ECU offering traction control to keep the S30 in line. The Apex Engineering engine bay strut brace and reinforcement bars are the most obvious structural additions, but under the skin, you’ll find pretty much their whole catalogue for strengthening the 53-year-old sports coupé. To top it all off, the chassis itself has been stitch-welded and has had the frame rails reinforced for extra rigidity. It is a nice touch in an old car running big boost and a Nitrous Oxide Systems N2O kit. For all the mystical powers of the Devil Z, I have a feeling John’s version would leave the anime original trailing in its carbon fibre rearview mirror. While this is a decidedly old-school ‘more-is-more’ approach to building a car, there’s no denying the appeal of modern technology and engineering under a gorgeous ’70s body.
