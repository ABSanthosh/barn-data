  "description": "Tata Motors had presented a near-production version of the upcoming Sierra SUV at the 2025 Auto Expo in January, previewing a triple-screen setup. However, a recent Sierra spy image gives us a glimpse of how these screens may look in the production version of the Tata SUV. Notably, the latest sighting comes before the new Sierra's launch expected for later this year. Triple displays comprise MID, touchscreen and passenger screen  Tata Sierra EV to launch first, followed by the ICE version Tata Sierra interior features Each screen to likely measure 12.3-inch Sierra's floating three-screen setup includes a digital instrument cluster, along with central and passenger side infotainment touchscreens; each unit is expected to measure 12.3 inches. We have previously seen a similar screen arrangement in the Mahindra XEV 9e. Other features like a dual-tone dashboard, Harrier EV-like four-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Tata logo and ambient lights, a Harman sound system, panoramic sunroof, wireless phone charger and ventilated front seats are also expected. On the safety front, the Sierra is likely to feature 6 airbags, 360-degree cameras, electronic stability control (ESC), and Level 2 ADAS. Tata Sierra patent image details B-pillar kink, roof rails absent We had earlier reported about a patent image of the Sierra, highlighting how the production-spec SUV's exterior design will differ from the concept. For instance, the distinct B-pillar kink and roof rails previously seen on the Sierra concept were not visible. Additionally, the alloy wheel design differs from the prototype’s star-like design. However, the wide LED light bar at the front and a split headlamp setup on the bumpers have been retained. Tata Sierra launch Sierra electric may borrow Harrier EV's AWD setup Tata earlier stated during an investor presentation that the Sierra EV will arrive first, followed by the Sierra ICE. As of now, the exact launch timelines of the Tata SUV remain unclear. The Sierra ICE is expected to come with 1.5-litre turbo petrol and diesel engine options, and a choice of manual and automatic transmissions. As for the Sierra EV, it may come with a dual motor setup (like on the Harrier EV), enabling AWD (all-wheel drive).
