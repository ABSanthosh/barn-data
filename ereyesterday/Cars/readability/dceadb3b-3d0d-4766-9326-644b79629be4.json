It was initially sold in Florida and remained registered in the state after the current owner's acquisition in 1995. The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 1.3-liter Wankel rotary engine linked to a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Modifications include an aftermarket air intake, intercooler, exhaust system, high-performance ECU calibration, H\u0026R springs, GAB adjustable shocks, and Trak-Pro sway bars.  The car was optioned with the R-1 Package, which added twin oil coolers, a front strut tower brace, a front air dam, front brake air ducts, and a rear spoiler. Additional equipment includes pop-up headlights, 16\" five-spoke wheels, air conditioning, and a cassette stereo. Work in preparation for the sale consisted of changing the oil and coolant, flushing the brake fluid, cleaning the fuel injectors, and replacing the battery. This FD RX-7 has 28k miles and is offered on dealer consignment with removed factory parts, a set of 19\" Tecnomagnesio wheels and Michelin tires, period sales brochure, an owner's manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title in the seller's name.",

The car is finished in Competition Yellow Mica and is equipped with the R-1 Package that added a front lip spoiler and a rear wing. Additional features include pop-up headlights, front fender vents, a power antenna, and a single exhaust outlet with a polished finisher. Photos of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below. Five-spoke 16″ wheels are mounted with 225/50 Goodyear Eagle GS-C tires. A factory strut tower brace spans the engine bay, and the suspension is modified with H\u0026R lowering springs, GAB eight-way adjustable shocks, and Trak-Pro billet aluminum sway bars. Antilock braking is provided by four-wheel discs with four-piston front calipers and front and rear cross-drilled rotors. The brake fluid was flushed in November 2024. The twin high-backed bucket seats are trimmed in black microsuede. Appointments include air conditioning, drilled aluminum clutch and brake pedals, and a factory cassette stereo. The leather-wrapped airbag steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. A boost gauge is affixed to the steering column. The digital odometer indicates 28k miles, approximately 6k of which were added under current ownership. The 1.3-liter Wankel rotary features sequential twin turbochargers and twin oil coolers and is modified with an aftermarket short-ram air intake, intercooler, exhaust system, and high-performance ECU calibration installed as part of a Turn Key Terror (TKT) package installed by Pettit Racing of Oakland Park, Florida. Work in April 2021 involved repairing the engine wiring harness and cleaning the fuel injectors in addition to replacing the fuel tank, fuel pump hanger assembly, two spark plugs, and the battery. The engine oil and coolant were changed in November 2024, and the associated invoice noted leaking from both turbochargers and the steering rack. Power is transferred to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential. The clutch hydraulic cylinders were replaced in April 2021, while the clutch fluid was bled in November 2024. A Pettit Racing Certificate of Authenticity for the TKT package is included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
