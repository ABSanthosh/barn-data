  "description": "Mahindra has announced that its recently revealed BE 6e electric SUV, which is priced from Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India), will be renamed to BE 6. However, the SUV specialist will contest the right to use the BE 6e name, in court. BE 6e trademark registered in a different class from IndiGo's Mahindra says trademark is for BE 6e, not 6e  Mahindra finds IndiGo's objection to be inconsistent with previous conduct Despite saying that the born-electric SUV, which will rival the Tata Curvv EV and upcoming Hyundai Creta EV, will be renamed to Mahindra BE 6 for now, the company has cited several reasons why it will contest the rights in court. The company has stated that the BE 6e trademark has already been registered under the Class 12 section, which is different from the section where InterGlobe Aviation Limited (which runs IndiGo Airlines) has registered the 6e name. In addition, Mahindra's trademark is for \"BE 6e\", not the standalone \"6E\". Futher, Mahindra also states that they find InterGlobe's objection to be inconsistent with its previous conduct. The SUV-maker pointed out that back in 2005, Tata Motors had objected to the airline company's use of the IndiGo nameplate, as the carmaker had its Indigo sedan on sale at the time. At least until the dispute between Mahindra and InterGlobe is resolved, the all-new electric SUV will go on sale under the BE 6 nameplate. The first of Mahindra's born-EVs comes with 59kWh and 79kWh battery pack options, with MIDC ranges of 556km and 682km. Deliveries will commence towards the end of February or early March 2025, though the full price list is expected to be revealed in January.
