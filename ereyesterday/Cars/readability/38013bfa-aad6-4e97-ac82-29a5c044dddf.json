  "text": "Cool and clad in carbon, the Ducati Panigale V4 Lamborghini is a sight to behold 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Ducati and Lamborghini have presented their latest collaboration, which honors the Revuelto. It’s based on the Panigale V4 S and features carbon fiber bodywork as well as a unique livery. The 207 hp 1.1-liter engine appears to carryover, but the Lamborghini variant is 5 lbs lighter. Ducati and Lamborghini are joining forces once again for a limited edition motorcycle that draws inspiration from the Revuelto. It’s known as the Ducati Panigale V4 Lamborghini and it costs more than some sports cars. Based on the Panigale V4 S, the Lamborghini special edition features carbon fiber bodywork that uses the same twill as the raging bull. The bike also sports a plexiglas windshield as well as an eye-catching livery that combines exposed carbon fiber with Verde Scandal, Grigio Telesto, and Grigio Acheso accents. More: Ducati Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini Debuts As A $68,000 Bike Inspired By The Huracan STO The changes don’t stop there as the two-wheeler has been equipped with a unique wing and tail piece. Both draw inspiration from the Revuelto as do the forged aluminum wheels. Rounding out the highlights are an Akrapovič titanium exhaust, a billet aluminum gas cap, and a dry clutch kit. The model also has a billet aluminum triple clamp with the model name and number. Thanks to the extensive use of carbon fiber, aluminum and titanium, the bike tips the scales at 408 lbs (185 kg). That’s 5 lbs (2.3 kg) less than the Panigale V4 S and this makes it the lightest member of the family. When it’s time to go for a spin, riders sit on a unique saddle that draws inspiration from the interior of the Revuelto. It appears to feature leather and Alcantara upholstery in a contrasting two-tone design. Customers will also find a digital instrument cluster, which features a unique start-up animation. The latter is activated using a special key with a numbered aluminum badge. Each Panigale V4 Lamborghini comes with a certificate of authenticity as well as a special cover and stand that matches the bike’s livery. Ducati even delivers the model in an exclusive wooden crate. The Panigale V4 Lamborghini starts at $78,400 ($88,800 CAD) and production is limited to 630 units. A Unique Variant For Lamborghini Owners If the standard model isn’t exclusive enough, Lamborghini owners can get a Panigale V4 Lamborghini Speciale Clienti. Only 63 are available and they cost $100,400 ($120,000 CAD). So what does the extra money get you? A customized bike as clients work directly with Ducati Centro Stile to create their ideal motorcycle. This gives them the option of getting a color scheme that matches their car or personality. Speaking of which, customers can also get a limited edition helmet, jacket, and leather riding suit. These too are color customizable for Speciale Clienti buyers. North American deliveries are expected to begin in December and both models appear to have a familiar 1,103 cc engine producing 207 hp (154 kW / 209 PS) and 90 lb-ft (121 Nm) of torque.",
