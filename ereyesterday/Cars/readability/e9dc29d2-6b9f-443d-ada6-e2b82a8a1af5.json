  "description": "Skoda's performance flagship has always been an everyman favourite. Does it still stack up? When Skoda launched the fourth-generation Skoda Octavia vRS with an electrified powertrain four years ago, it was a signal of intent from the brand for its future performance models, especially given this flagship’s long association with diesel power.Now, while other car makers look to push their plug-in hybrid offerings, both of those powertrains have been binned as part of the Octavia's mid-life refresh, with just the 2.0-litre turbo petrol remaining.Surprised? Given that the pure-ICE variant was the line-up’s best seller, Skoda says you shouldn’t be.This updated vRS adopts the same engine as can be found in the Volkswagen Golf GTI. It now features upgraded fuel injectors, increasing power by 20bhp to 262bhp and torque to 273lb ft, making it the most powerful Octavia vRS to date.It's also now set up exclusively with front-wheel drive, with power sent to the wheels via a seven-speed automatic gearbox. No more 4x4s or manuals here.The estate, with its 640 litres of seats-up boot space, generally accounts for around 60% of Octavia vRS sales.The chassis has undergone targeted modification to move the Octavia from ‘consummate family car’ to something altogether more toothy, and the cabin has followed suit, with Alcantara and perforated leather underscoring the vRS badge.",

  "text": "Inside is where most of the major changes have taken place, centered on new 13.0in infotainment touchscreen. A cost option on the standard Octavia, this is a major quality-of-life upgrade, especially over the previous car’s outdated display, and immediately adds a more premium finish to the car. The new screen is responsive and clear, with the main functions (such as media and maps) offered via quick tabs. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay also work well, and the main infotainment controls and settings are easy to access while these are in use. Sadly, the three ‘Smart Dial’ controls introduced on the new Kodiaq and Superb (which control the air conditioning, volume and more) haven't been included, with climate settings instead accessed through the touchscreen. The facelift does, however, add a host of USB-C ports and a wireless smartphone charging pad with cooling. Elsewhere, it's a familiar affair, with various racy design cues. Warm Alcantara with red stitching adorn much of the cabin. The multifunction steering wheel, with its volume rollers and many physical buttons, is, as with other Skoda models, brilliant and easy to use. What hits you is the perception of space. In its dimensions, this Octativa vRS is only fractionally larger than its forebear, but the move to shift-by-wire for the stubby new gear selector has uncluttered the transmission tunnel. The more organically shaped panels also make the cabin feel less austere and, to some extent, less poky. It’s soothing in here. However, while the black headlining and aluminium pedals give the vRS an effective sporting lift, there remain some exposed poor plastics, and the plastic-chrome controls are simply not sturdy enough either in look or feel to convince you this Octavia is the truly premium product that Skoda is clearly aiming for. The thuggishly bolstered and decently comfortable modular sports seats, with their integrated headrests, are comfortable for long journeys and the seating position is still excellent, adding to the experience. The Octavia again offers a class-leading boot, sprawling leg room for rear-seat passengers and generous equipment. And that’s part of the appeal: behind the vRS badges remains an exceptionally well conceived family car.",
