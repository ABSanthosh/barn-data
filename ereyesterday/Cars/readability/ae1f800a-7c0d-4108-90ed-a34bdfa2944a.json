  "description": "Contrary to the Mini in its name, the Countryman is a large, four-door, spacious crossover squarely aimed at family buyers. Now in its third generation, it has undergone some revolutionary changes, and for the first time ever, it’ll be sold with an electric heart, along with the ICE versions. For India, though, Mini has only introduced the Countryman EV as an import, which, due to its single-motor, front-wheel drive setup, is priced rather competitively at Rs 55 lakh.  But India’s entry-level luxury EV segment is quite populated, by electric car standards at least. It includes the BYD Seal and Hyundai Ioniq 5 at one end – priced sub-Rs 50 lakh – and the Mercedes-Benz EQA (Rs 66 lakh) and BMW iX1 (Rs 67 lakh) on the other end. So, how does the new Mini Countryman EV stack up? 2024 Mini Countryman: design With dimensions larger than a Jeep Compass, this new Countryman can be termed as anything but small. Think Mini, and you’d visualise a compact hatchback. However, with dimensions larger than a Jeep Compass, this new Countryman can be termed as anything but small. Despite its size, a curvy design language and smooth body lines devoid of cuts or creases make it appear chic and urbane rather than brawny and intimidating. Executed with undeniable panache is the matte champagne-coloured garnishing around its closed-off front grille and on the C-Pillar and the front, side and rear skid plates. Even the Mini logos and the Countryman badge are finished in this shade. Cool-looking 19-inch alloys are a part of the optional Favoured Pack. Our test car was fitted with optional 19-inch alloys sporting the champagne scheme, although 17-inch alloys come as standard. A wraparound glass area and a blackened roof mask the Countryman EV’s height well, lending it a wagon-like silhouette. Adding to its feel-good factor are the (optional) LED DRL eyebrows and matrix LED tail-lamps that have a customisable light show upon locking or unlocking. 2024 Mini Countryman: interior, features Like Minis of yore, its cabin is minimalistic with a circular theme. Like yesteryear Minis, the Countryman EV’s cabin has a minimalistic theme with circular elements. The centre of attraction is a 9.4-inch circular OLED touchscreen, which is exceptional in terms of its usability and responsiveness, and its clarity is second to none. Furthermore, fun themes, funky animations and musical notifications will most certainly make you smile while operating it. This screen also doubles up as the speedometer and driver display, which is inconvenient to read on the move. You could consider opting for the Favoured Pack, which gets you a head-up display (HUD) bundled with several other extras, for an additional Rs 4.60 lakh. And while the HUD does make it convenient to read the speed, the unit is simply too basic, especially when compared to the ones available in hatchbacks at a fraction of this Mini’s cost. Like Minis of yore, its cabin is minimalistic with a circular theme. The dashboard is replete with fabric made out of recycled materials. However, its open-pore texture might not be ideal for our dusty conditions. It is finished in blue and neatly fades into a shade of brown towards the rear half of the car; the seats are also brown. The champagne-coloured theme is carried over on the inside and is the most prominent around the air vents and on the vertical door handles. Optional JCW driver’s seat is too sculpted and firm for comfort. The optional JCW Sport driver’s seat on our test car is too sculpted and firm for comfort; hence, it is an option we recommend you uncheck. It has a seat massaging function, though. Things are a bit better at the rear. Space is adequate, the backrest reclines, and even though the floor height is raised and you’re seated in a knees-up position, it is still quite comfortable. Also, accommodating a third passenger is possible due to a flat floor and a broad seat. Seating position is a bit knees-up at rear, but overall, seat is comfy. Being the more practical Mini, the Countryman has an abundance of storage areas; the central console shelf and door pockets are huge, and even its 460-litre boot is large. Sadly, it isn’t equipped with a spare tyre beneath the floor. Fantastic OLED touchscreen is among the best out there. As far as its equipment goes, the Mini gets the aforementioned OLED touchscreen, LED lights, 17-inch alloys, rear-view camera and panoramic sunroof, among others. Customisable LED lights, electrically operable boot and drive modes are some of the optional extras bundled in the Classic Trim, which costs Rs 2 lakh more. In addition, buyers who want a head-up display, JCW Sport seats, 19-inch alloys and a Harman Kardon sound system will need to opt for the earlier-mentioned Favoured Pack. However, this Mini still misses ventilated seats, a 360-degree camera, side and curtain airbags, and adjustable regen via steering-mounted paddle shifters. 2024 Mini Countryman: powertrain, performance The talking point of this EV is its 66.45kWh (gross capacity) battery, which it shares with its platform-mate, the BMW iX1. But unlike its BMW cousin, which uses a twin-motor setup, the Mini makes do with a single-motor, front-wheel-drive setup. And while its motor makes 204hp, its 250Nm torque output doesn’t impress, especially when compared to turbo-petrol cars available at half its price. There’s no storage area beneath its bonnet. But then factor in the instantaneous responsiveness of its motor, and you never yearn for more pep while ambling around town or when driving in a leisurely manner, which is how most owners would drive their Countryman EV. Demand more out of it, though, and its torque curve flattens quickly. The Countryman’s outright performance is lacklustre, and it doesn’t feel as effortless as its rivals. To put its acceleration into perspective, the Mini will sprint from 0-100kph in 8.6 seconds (claimed), slower than a similarly priced Volvo XC40 Recharge front-wheel drive’s 7.3 seconds or a Hyundai Ioniq 5’s 7.5 seconds. Although adequate, its performance feels muted compared to its rivals. Interestingly, the Mini features ‘Iconic Sounds’, which gives drivers the option to play synthesised motor sounds via the speakers. These sounds are loudest in the Go-Kart mode, wherein it’ll also emit its own version of ‘pops and bangs’ when you lift off the accelerator pedal. These certainly liven up the drive experience and add a degree of fun to the otherwise quiet and drama-free EV experience. 2024 Mini Countryman: ride, handling Its Mini-ness is evident when you find yourself on a winding section of a road.

The suspension noise seriously hampers the driving experience, coaxing you to drive with more caution than what the Countryman EV can actually handle. 2024 Mini Countryman: verdict It’s hard not to be enamoured by the charming new Mini Countryman. Besides oozing character, it carries forward the traditional go-kart-like driving mannerisms associated with Minis, all while being spacious and practical. But the Countryman EV’s proposition isn’t complete – rivals are more comfortable, offer better performance and provide more equipment. So, like other Minis, even this ‘practical’ Countryman is purely an emotional purchase, and if you decide to take the plunge, be rest assured that it’s a car that’ll make you smile every time you’re behind the wheel.

The suspension noise seriously hampers the driving experience, coaxing you to drive with more caution than what the Countryman EV can actually handle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2024 Mini Countryman: verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard not to be enamoured by the charming new Mini Countryman. Besides oozing character, it carries forward the traditional go-kart-like driving mannerisms associated with Minis, all while being spacious and practical. But the Countryman EV’s proposition isn’t complete – rivals are more comfortable, offer better performance and provide more equipment. So, like other Minis, even this ‘practical’ Countryman is purely an emotional purchase, and if you decide to take the plunge, be rest assured that it’s a car that’ll make you smile every time you’re behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-video-reviews/2024-mini-countryman-video-review-432981\"\u003e2024 Mini Countryman video review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mini-countryman-electric-launched-at-rs-5490-lakh-432275\"\u003eMini Countryman Electric launched at Rs 54.90 lakh\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/electric-mini-cooper-jcw-gets-258hp-432891\"\u003eElectric Mini Cooper JCW gets 258hp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-433187\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-433187\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-433187\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-433187\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-433187\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-433187\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
