Equipment includes 18″ alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, power windows, a gated shifter, and a Sony RSX-GS9 head unit. An engine-out timing belt service was performed in preparation for the sale. This 512 TR shows 23k miles and is offered by the selling dealer with a Ferrari Classiche certification, a Ferrari Classiche red book, an owner’s manual, tools, a car cover, a removed exhaust, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Pininfarina-designed 512 TR was introduced as the updated successor to the Testarossa in 1991, with revisions that included restyled bumper covers as well as revised wheels and lighting. This car was refinished in 2024 in Rosso Corsa and features fog lights, pop-up headlights, side intake strakes, body-color rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. The rear window was replaced in 2014. Silver-finished 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact Sport tires manufactured in 2021. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The cockpit is trimmed in Beige Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Appointments include motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. A Sony RSX-GS9 head unit is installed, and is accompanied by a remote. A crack is visible on the center console trim. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,200-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 23k miles. The 4.9-liter DOHC flat-12 received updates over the version used in the Testarossa including Nikasil cylinder liners, a redesigned intake system, and Bosch engine management. Output was rated at 421 horsepower and 362 lb-ft of torque when new, and the car is fitted with a Tubi Style exhaust system and secondary cat-bypass pipes. An engine out service performed in preparation for the sale included changing the oil and coolant, recharging the air conditioning refrigerant, rebuilding the water pump, adjusting the valve clearances, and replacing the following components: Timing belts Exhaust manifold gaskets Cam cover gaskets \u0026 seals Thermostats Fuel filters Air Filters Various seals and gaskets Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch hydraulic fluid and transaxle fluid were changed in 2025. A Classiche certificate and book are included in the sale along with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, a jack, a tire inflation kit, a car cover, a removed factory exhaust, and service records.
