  "text": "Ford Motor Co is recalling roughly 20,000 hybrid crossovers from the 2020–2024 model years over a manufacturing defect pertaining to the battery. Impacted models include plug-in variants of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.The alleged issue stems from high voltage battery cells installed within vehicles using the 2.5-liter PHEV powertrain. According to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Ford is concerned that the separator layer between battery cathode and anode “may be susceptible to damage as a result of the cell manufacturing process.”That’s a fairly roundabout way of saying the company is worried there was a manufacturing defect that could result in the battery pack becoming more damaged over time. While Ford estimates the issue is only impacting around one percent of the 20,484 plug-in hybrid crossovers being recalled, the resulting problem could theoretically lead to incidents of thermal runaway and cause a battery fire.At a minimum, the defect could absolutely cause a short circuit that could disable aspects of the electrical system. But Ford said it has encountered four reports of “thermal venting” which would typically foreshadow an actual vehicle fire. Three of those vehicles were sold on the European market, although the defect is not limited to Europe. No injuries or crashes are known to be related to the problem, however.Ford’s Critical Concern Review Group opened a formal investigation in November and the automaker says it’s been working with Samsung SDI (which supplied the affected battery cells) to find a solution as the recall progresses.As of now, the plan is for the Blue Oval to begin notifying customers starting on January 20th. Dealers will flash the affected vehicles' Battery Energy Control Module software with new code Ford believes should give advanced warning of any potential electrical issues and catch any PHEVs that have already been compromised. Service Centers finding any issues will replace the high-voltage battery pack free of charge.Concerned Escape and Corsair should know that the recall only affects the 2.5-liter plug-in hybrid models assembled between July 10, 2019, and April 17, 2024. However, there’s always a chance that it could expand. Those disinclined to wait to hear from the manufacturer can contact Ford directly (866–436–7332) or use the NHTSA recall website. Just be sure to have your VIN handy. [Images: Ford Motor Co.]Become a TTAC insider.
