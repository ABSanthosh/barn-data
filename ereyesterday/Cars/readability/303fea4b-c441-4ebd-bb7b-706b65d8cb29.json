  "description": "Following its success in the European Rally and Italian Gravel Rally Championships, MRF is now entering the British Rally Championship (BRC) as one of its official tyre suppliers. James Williams’ Hyundai i20 N and Max McRae’s Citroen C3 Rally2 cars will both use MRF tyres during the season, which kicks off with the East Riding Stages on February 23. MRF among the official tyre suppliers for BRC 2025 BRC 2025 season start on February 23 MRF has been using European rallying as a key development ground for its high-performance tyres. The Indian tyre manufacturer has already won the European Rally Championship twice (in 2022 and 2023), and clinched the Italian Gravel Rally Championship title four years in a row (from 2021 to 2024). It will now supply both asphalt and gravel tyres across all the BRC categories. \"We are excited to take on this new challenge and represent India on the global motorsports platform,\" said Arun Mammen Vice Chairman and Managing Director of MRF. “The British Rally Championship is a prestigious event that attracts the best drivers and teams from around the world. Our participation in this event will not only demonstrate the quality of our products but also inspire Indian motorsports enthusiasts and foster a sense of national pride.” “We are confident that our tyres will perform exceptionally well in the BRC 2025. Our engineers have been working closely with rally experts to develop the right products that can withstand the rigors of the sport and provide our drivers with the necessary grip and stability to compete at the highest level,” he added. Williams' Hyundai i20 N Rally2 car will also run MRF tyres   MRF British Rally Championship drivers In the headlining BRC1 category, MRF has recruited James Williams and Max McRae. Williams enters the season on a back of a strong 2024 that saw him win the Rally Isle of Man and the Goodwood Festival of Speed Forest Rally Stage. McRae, meanwhile, is set to compete in his first full BRC season. The 20-year-old tackled four rounds last year, but he’ll be competing in all six rounds this season. While he drove a Ford Fiesta Rally2 car last year, he’s switching to a Citroen C3 for 2025. “Yes, the car is new for me, but the team’s not. I drove with TRT (Tagai Racing Technology) in the Junior European Rally Championship last season. I know the team and they know me. I have full faith in them, they’re great guys!”  said McRae, who happens to be the nephew of late British rally legend Colin McRae. McRae tested his new car for the first time recently in Hungary, with the session also marking his first time running MRF tyres. “I was definitely impressed with the feel from the MRF Tyres – that said, the conditions were pretty tricky,” he said.
