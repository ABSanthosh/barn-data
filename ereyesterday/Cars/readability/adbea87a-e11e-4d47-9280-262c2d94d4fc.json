  "text": "Published:  April 16th, 2025 Kia used this year’s New York International Auto Show as the stage to reveal the new EV4, its first electric sedan. Expected to launch in early 2026, the car will arrive with up to 330 miles of range, a 400-volt platform, and a North American Charging Standard (NACS) port out of the box. The funky car borrows some styling elements from the EV6, including its front-end design and vertical LED daytime running lights. It features an odd roof shape with a two-piece spoiler, and 17-inch wheels come standard. Interior features include LED ambient interior lighting and a unique floating steering wheel design.The EV4 rides on the shared Kia-Hyundai E-GMP platform, which offers a 400-volt electrical architecture. A 58.3 kWh battery is standard, while long-range models get an 81.4 kWh battery. Kia quotes a 235-mile range for the base battery and 330 miles for the long-range configuration. Using DC fast-charging, the car can charge from 10 to 80 percent in 29 minutes with the smaller battery and 31 minutes with the larger pack. Inside, Kia equips almost 30 inches of combined screen real estate, including a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, and a five-inch climate control display. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, along with OTA updates, connected apps, and navigation. Several advanced driver-assistance features are also standard, including Kia’s Highway Driving Assist system, forward collision warnings, and more.[Images: Kia]Become a TTAC insider.
