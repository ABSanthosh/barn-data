All those extra lumens translate into more brightness, which not only helps you see in the dark, but can act as an emergency signal during many different scenarios.  With that in mind, check out the Ggpg Rechargeable Flashlight, which is currently on sale at Walmart for 46% off, dropping the price from $26 to just $14. According to shoppers, it’s “super bright.” Ggpg Rechargeable Flashlight, $14 (was $26) at Walmart This “powerful” flashlight beams out a whopping 100,000 lumens, allowing it to project light for up to 1,640 feet. It has five light modes including low, medium, high, strobe, and SOS and charges rapidly via USB. It can hold a charge for a long time, and has a display showing how much power it has left. Durably built to handle whatever the outdoors throw at it, it’s waterproof, dirtproof, and shockproof. Lightweight and compact, it’s the perfect flashlight to keep in your glove compartment or emergency kit. According to reviewers, this “excellent” flashlight is “very bright,” with one calling it the “best flashlight ever.” It’s “compact, but really bright,” said another, saying it “holds a charge for a long time” and is “way brighter than I had anticipated.” “Just perfect. I have spent three times as much on rechargeable flashlights,” said one reviewer. “None of them [are] as good as this one! I loved it so much I came back and bought another! Super bright! I love all of the functions, the lanyard, and it even has a little case to keep it in, so it doesn’t get lost!”  If you’re ready to light up your life, act fast, because the Ggpg Rechargeable Flashlight is only on sale for a limited time. Order now and get 100,000 lumens of power for 46% off. About the AuthorNick Hilden",
