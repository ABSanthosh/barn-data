Launched just two years after the Accord’s U.S. debut in 1976, this first-generation LX trim represented Honda’s push into the compact luxury market during a period marked by emissions regulations and fuel crises. It was an era when American automakers struggled to adapt, and Honda seized the opportunity. Watch as Drive Culture explains this icon.This specific LX model, preserved in museum-quality condition by the American Honda Collection Hall, exemplifies the brand’s early attention to engineering, efficiency, and practicality. Priced at $5,645 when new, the car featured innovations rare for the segment at the time — air conditioning, a digital clock, and notably, power steering.Powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder CVCC engine (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion), the Accord LX delivered 68 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque — figures modest by today’s standards, but impressive for its emissions-compliant, catalytic-converter-free design. The five-speed manual transmission added a level of driver engagement rare in 1970s economy cars.Inside, the vehicle showcases a Bordeaux red interior that remains well-appointed for its age. Its analog layout, manually operated windows, and minimalist controls contrast sharply with today’s tech-laden cabins, yet emphasize Honda’s longstanding commitment to driver-focused design.On the road, the Accord LX still delivers a comfortable, surprisingly composed ride. While not quick, it handles predictably and provides a clear view into Honda’s evolving engineering philosophy.More than a nostalgic artifact, the ’78 Accord LX illustrates the blueprint for Honda’s future success. It paired thoughtful design, reliable performance, and innovative emissions technology — helping cement the Accord’s place as a cornerstone of the brand. Nearly five decades later, the DNA of this early Accord still resonates in Honda’s modern lineup. Welcome to Drive Culture, a detailed car review YouTube channel hosted by car enthusiast, Jonathon Rivers. Rivers is a 15-year-plus auto industry veteran, born and raised in the Motor City! He lived several years in Japan, speaks and reads Japanese, and now works for American Honda Motor (this channel is his own \u0026 not affiliated). He's owned several fun cars including an Evo IV, multiple Civic Si, Focus RS, and most recently the Integra Type S (which he led planning for Acura). He's also been lucky enough to drive just about every key new product in the market from compact cars, to SUVs, EVs and super cars. If that isn't enough to prove his \"car guy\" status, Jonathon has also been featured in MotorTrend, Car and Driver, AutoBlog, Jay Leno's Garage, Raiti's Rides and the SavageGeese channels.
