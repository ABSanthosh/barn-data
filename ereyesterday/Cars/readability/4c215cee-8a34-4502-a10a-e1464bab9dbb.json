  "description": "Aston Martin is looking to bring the Valhalla plug-in hybrid supercar to India, we can exclusively report. The British carmaker just launched the new Vanquish in India as its new flagship model for Rs 8.85 crore, but should the limited-run Valhalla debut here, it will be positioned even higher in the brand’s line-up. Aston Martin may bring the 1,079hp Valhalla supercar to India The British carmaker is taking India “very, very seriously” Indian customers have been expressing interest in the Valhalla Aston Martin Valhalla possibly coming to India In a recent interview with Autocar India, Aston Martin India’s general manager of sales, Gautam Dutta, spoke about the relevance of the Indian market for the British carmaker. “Globally, India is being taken very, very seriously within Aston Martin,” adding that every Aston Martin model “offered in the global market will surely find its way to India. So, hoping that, yes, Valhalla should also come.” Indian buyers’ queries hint at demand for Valhalla Dutta also stated that Aston Martin has been receiving queries about the Valhalla from prospective Indian buyers, hinting at some demand for the plug-in hybrid supercar here. Deliveries for the Valhalla will commence in the second half of 2025, and it seems fairly possible that at least one of the 999 units will be India-bound. Aston Martin Valhalla details The Valhalla is Aston Martin’s first mid-engined plug-in hybrid supercar. Much like the Valkyrie, the Valhalla incorporates technologies from Aston Martin’s F1 division. The powertrain comprises an evolved form of Mercedes-AMG’s 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 mated to three electric motors, together making 1,079hp and 1,110Nm of torque. 0-100kph in 2.5 seconds Aston Martin also developed a custom 8-speed dual-clutch transmission for the Valhalla, and the 0-100kph dash is dealt with in 2.5 seconds. An EV mode is on offer as well, where the Valhalla can silently trundle along without any V8 assistance for 14km and up to 140kph. The supercar is primarily built from carbon fibre to keep weight down, and its radical aerodynamics-focused styling echoes the Valkyrie. Aston Martin is yet to reveal the pricing for the Valhalla, but the car will go up against the likes of the Ferrari SF90 and Lamborghini Revuelto.
