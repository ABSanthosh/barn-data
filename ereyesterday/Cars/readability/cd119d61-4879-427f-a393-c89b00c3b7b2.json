  "text": "Ah, the Los Angeles Auto Show—what a dazzling display of capitalist excess! To walk among these gleaming monuments to wealth and technology is to feel, for a fleeting moment, like one has stepped into a brighter world. In my native land, where winters bite hard and opportunities for such spectacle are as rare as a passing bread truck, the idea of such a thing—a whole building filled with cars you can’t afford—seems almost comically absurd. And yet, I must confess, there is something poetic about it. The precision engineering, the bold designs, the colors so vivid they seem to mock my drab, threadbare coat. Each car is a statement of ambition, of the human spirit’s desire to move faster, go farther, and leave behind those who cannot keep up. How very American. The electric vehicles intrigue me the most. Where I come from, the power grid struggles to keep the lights on, let alone charge a fleet of Teslas. And yet here, they speak of “sustainability” with such confidence, as if the future has already arrived. Meanwhile, I can’t help but think of my neighbors back home, huddled around their wood-burning stoves. Still, I cannot deny the ingenuity on display. For a disgraced educator like myself—cast out for speaking inconvenient truths—it is a strange sort of comfort. These machines, at least, tell no lies. A finely tuned engine is honest in its purpose, and for that, I begrudgingly admire them. If only life were as straightforward as a perfectly calibrated automobile. But alas, we must all find ways to navigate our own broken roads. BIDEN DOLLARS",
