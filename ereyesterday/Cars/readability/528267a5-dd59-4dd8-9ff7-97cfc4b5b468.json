Now with 2,100 miles, it is powered by an 8.4-liter V10 linked with a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Finished in Gunmetal Pearl over Sepia Laguna leather, the car is equipped with the Laguna Interior Package, Billet Silver GTS racing stripes, 18″ and 19″ Venom alloy wheels, xenon headlights, a back-up camera, power-adjustable Sabelt bucket seats, navigation, an 18-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, and automatic climate control. This Viper GTS is now offered by the seller on behalf of their mother with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, Viper literature, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Ohio title in the name of the owner’s trust. The fifth-generation Viper featured a carbon-fiber hood, roof, and decklid as well as aluminum door panels. This example is finished in Gunmetal Pearl with optional Billet Silver GTS dual race stripes and features xenon headlights, a GTS-specific vented hood, an illuminating Stryker third brake light, LED taillights, an integrated rear spoiler, and dual side exhaust outlets. Polished 18″ and 19″ Venom alloy wheels are mounted with older Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 295/30 in front and 355/30 out back. The car is equipped with adjustable Bilstein shocks and stopping power is provided by red-finished Viper-branded Brembo calipers fitted over slotted and ventilated rotors at each corner. The interior features Sabelt power-adjustable bucket seats upholstered in Sepia Laguna leather, and the optional Laguna Interior Package added matching leather to the door panels, instrument panel, and center console as well as trimmed the headliner in Alcantara. Equipment includes keyless entry, a back-up camera, an 8.4″ navigation system, an 18-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, power-adjustable pedals, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a digital tachometer with an illuminating Stryker shift indicator as well as a fuel-level gauge. The digital odometer indicates 2,100 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The hand-assembled 8.4-liter V10 was factory rated at 640 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque. An aluminum structural X-brace spans the engine bay. The battery was replaced and an oil change was performed in October 2023. The starter relay was replaced in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission and a 3.55:1 limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Bud’s Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep in Celina, Ohio, and lists factory equipment, colors, and a total price of $140,980. A leather-bound hardcover SRT Viper book is included in the sale and is showcased in a hard carbon-look case with the Viper and SRT logos.
