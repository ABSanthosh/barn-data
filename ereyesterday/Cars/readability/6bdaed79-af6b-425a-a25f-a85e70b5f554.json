  "description": "This 1937 Cord 812 is a supercharged phaeton that underwent a refurbishment before it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. Subsequent mechanical work performed by the Alan Taylor Company of Escondido, California, between 2016 and 2018 included rebuilds of the 288ci Lycoming V8 and vacuum-operated four-speed pre-selector transaxle. The car is finished in yellow over burgundy upholstery, and it features a Schwitzer-Cummins centrifugal supercharger, external exhaust pipes, independent front suspension, four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes, a black soft top, manually operated pop-up headlights, Cord-branded yellow-lens fog lights, turn signals, rear-hinged doors, an AM radio, and a heater. This supercharged 812 is now offered on dealer consignment with service records and a clean Arizona title in the owner's name.",

  "text": "This 1937 Cord 812 is a supercharged phaeton that underwent a refurbishment before it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. Subsequent mechanical work performed by the Alan Taylor Company of Escondido, California, between 2016 and 2018 included rebuilds of the 288ci Lycoming V8 and vacuum-operated four-speed pre-selector transaxle. The car is finished in yellow over burgundy upholstery, and it features a Schwitzer-Cummins centrifugal supercharger, external exhaust pipes, independent front suspension, four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes, a black soft top, manually operated pop-up headlights, Cord-branded yellow-lens fog lights, turn signals, rear-hinged doors, an AM radio, and a heater. This supercharged 812 is now offered on dealer consignment with service records and a clean Arizona title in the owner’s name. The Cord 810 was introduced in late 1935 for the 1936 model year and returned for 1937 as the 812 before the Auburn Automobile Company ceased manufacture of the Cord marque. Penned by Gordon Buehrig, styling includes a “coffin-nose” front profile with a louvered wraparound grille, a rear-hinged hood, hideaway headlights raised via dash-mounted hand cranks, concealed door hinges, and a split windshield. Six body styles were offered in 1937, each of which was available as a supercharged variant distinguished visually by external exhaust pipes on each side of the hood. The exhaust pipes on this example were replaced in August 2016. The Central Manufacturing Company-built phaeton bodywork on this example was repainted in its current yellow prior to 2011, and additional paintwork on the firewall and fenders was performed in February 2014. Features include chrome bumpers with overriders, Cord-branded yellow-lens fog lights, turn signals, dual side-view mirrors, rear fender stone guards, and a locking fuel door. The black soft top features burgundy piping and can be seen raised in the gallery below. Body-color steel wheels wear chrome covers and are wrapped in 6.50-16 Goodyear whitewall bias-ply tires. A matching spare wheel and tire are stowed in the trunk. Suspension incorporates a trailing-arm independent front setup with a transverse leaf spring and a solid rear axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs. Stopping is handled by four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. A brake fluid flush was performed in April 2024. The cabin is trimmed in burgundy leather over the front and rear bench seats as well as over the door panels and rear side panels. Replacement front seat padding was installed in 2017 along with color-coordinated Wilton wool carpets with leather piping. Additional equipment includes roll-up side windows, retractable rear quarter windows, a heater, dual lockable gloveboxes, and a dash-mounted rearview mirror. The body-color three-spoke steering wheel features a bright horn ring and shares its column with a Bendix “electric hand” gear selector at the driver’s right. The steel dashboard was repainted burgundy in 2014, and it features a machine-turned panel housing a 150-mph speedometer, a 5k-rpm tachometer, a clock, a rotary-dial radio, and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 83k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The 288ci V8 features three main bearings, aluminum cylinder heads, and side valves angled at a near-horizontal position and is topped with a Schwitzer-Cummins centrifugal supercharger and a single Stromberg carburetor. Output was factory rated at 170 horsepower. The engine on this example was rebuilt by the Alan Taylor Company between 2016 and 2017, with invoices for the work displayed in the gallery below. Additional service performed under current ownership included a rebuild of the water pump and the installation of a replacement thermostat, gaskets, and freeze plugs. An oil change and a coolant flush were performed in April 2024, and a pair of six-volt Optima Red Top batteries were installed in the trunk at that time. A photo of the engine stamping is presented above, and the chassis tag listing engine number FC3004 can be seen in the gallery. Power is transferred to the front wheels by a Detroit Gear four-speed manual transaxle mounted ahead of the engine. Gear changes are preselected via the column-mounted electrical switch and are set into action when the depression of the clutch pedal completes the electrical circuit that actuates vacuum cylinders on the transaxle unit. The transmission was rebuilt in 2017, and a replacement throw-out bearing was installed in 2016. A replacement transmission control unit and interlock switch were fitted in 2023.
