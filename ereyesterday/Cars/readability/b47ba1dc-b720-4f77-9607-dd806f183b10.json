  "description": "Essentially a rebadged Maruti Baleno, the Toyota Glanza is a premium hatchback priced between Rs 6.90 and 10 lakh. Despite offering similar powertrain options, features, and warranty packages as its Maruti counterpart, the Glanza commands a Rs 8,000-35,000 premium in the new car market. However, interestingly, in the used car market, the Glanza often sells at a similar price—or even lower in some cases—than a corresponding Maruti Baleno. Autocar India-Spinny Resale Value Study Baleno resale value highest among premium hatchbacks This finding is based on a joint study conducted by Autocar India in collaboration with Spinny, a leading used car platform operational in 22 cities across India, including Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, and Indore. Spinny provided average selling prices (ASP) derived from actual transactions of 21,944 cars sold across its network during the 2024 calendar year. For the purpose of the study, if a particular model had multiple engine options of the same fuel type, or came in multiple variants, these were merged and averaged. Depreciation was calculated as the percentage difference between a car’s on-road price in its year of manufacture and its resale price in 2024. *ASP stands for average selling price; DEP stands for Depreciation. Among premium hatchbacks, the Maruti Baleno emerged as the best performer in terms of resale value, particularly the petrol-manual variant, which depreciated at the slowest pace. It was followed by the Hyundai i20 and the Tata Altroz. Notably, the Hyundai i20 N Line—available with both iMT (clutchless manual, now discontinued) and DCT (dual-clutch automatic) transmissions—commands the highest resale prices among mass-market hatchbacks in the used car market.
