  "description": "The soon-to-be-launched TVS 300cc ADV has been spotted testing shortly after the brand announced an all-new 300cc engine. Here’s a breakdown of what we could see from the spy shots. Will likely feature the RT-XD4 300cc engine Appears to have a large tank Gets USD fork TVS 300cc ADV: what do the spy shots reveal? From what’s visible so far, it seems like the design will be more a crossover-style ADV rather than an out-and-out off-road bike. This is evident from its alloy wheels and what is likely to be a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear setup. Aesthetically, the bike stands tall and looks like an all-rounder Adventure bike for the streets, offering split seats, all-LED lighting and a beak at the front to complete the look. This test unit was also spotted with a few accessories like auxiliary lighting, a top box and crash protection suggesting a line of accessories will be available alongside the motorcycle when it goes on sale. The ADV features a USD fork as well as a mono-shock at the rear. TVS already offers preload adjustable suspension in some lower 200cc models, so it’s fair to expect at least that much adjustability in both the front and rear suspension units. The bike is expected to include ride-by-wire technology, riding modes and switchable traction control for enhanced versatility. The spied motorcycle looked production-ready and it is expected to launch in the first half of 2025. When on sale, this motorcycle will rival the likes of the KTM Duke 250 Adventure, Yezdi Adventure and the BMW G310 GS. TVS RT-XD4 engine details TVS recently unveiled its latest engine at MotoSoul, the RT-XD4. This engine displaces 299cc and is both liquid-cooled (for the head) and air/oil-cooled (for the crankcases). TVS also stated that this motor can produce a peak output of 35hp at 9,000rpm and 28.5Nm at 7,000 rpm.
