  "text": "The entry-level Crosstrek gets a $435 price hike and an extra 28 hp July 16, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Subaru has introduced the 2026 Crosstrek, which features additional equipment and a new hybrid powertrain. The hybrid starts at $33,995 and features a unique powertrain that delivers a combined output of 194 hp. The entry-level Crosstrek now comes equipped with a larger 2.5-liter engine producing 180 hp and 178 lb-ft. Subaru introduced the 2026 Crosstrek Hybrid six months ago and now the company has announced pricing will begin at $33,995. That’s $7,000 more than the entry-level model, which begins at a mere $26,995. However, like most things in life, it’s not that simple. Quite the opposite as the Hybrid is based on the well-equipped Sport and Limited trims. The Sport Hybrid costs $3,370 more than the regular Sport, while the Limited Hybrid carries a $2,000 premium. More: 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid Arrives With 194 HP And Hopes The Third Time’s A Charm On top of that, the Hybrid trims have more equipment than the models they’re based on. In the case of the Sport Hybrid, it features a lightly revised exterior with unique 18-inch alloy wheels and a moonroof. Buyers will also find a classier cabin with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, GPS navigation, “Hybrid” floor mats, and a 10-way power driver’s seat. They’re joined by Blind-Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, Automatic Emergency Steering, and Emergency Lane Keep Assist. The Limited Hybrid also adds additional equipment over the Limited. This includes a ten-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system and perforated gray StarTex upholstery with contrasting orange stitching. This is on top of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, special floor mats, and navigation. The big news is the hybrid powertrain, which consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine, a lithium-ion battery, and a continuously variable transmission with two integrated motors. This gives the model a combined output of 194 hp (145 kW / 197 PS), although Subaru declined to give a fuel economy estimate. Putting the Hybrid trims aside, the entry-level Crosstrek now comes with a 2.5-liter Boxer engine developing 180 hp (134 kW / 183 PS) and 178 lb-ft (241 Nm) of torque. It replaces the previously standard 2.0-liter engine, which churned out 152 hp (113 kW / 154 PS) and 145 lb-ft (196 Nm). Besides being more powerful, the 2026 Crosstrek gains additional kit including rear side airbags, keyless access with a push-button ignition, and an auto vehicle shut down function that turns the car off if it hasn’t been driven for 30 minutes. That’s a lot of new goodies in exchange for an extra $435. Moving up the trim ladder is the $32,995 Crosstrek Limited, which gains a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, emergency lane keep assist, and a DriverFocus distraction mitigation system. The $33,795 Crosstrek Wilderness also adds a heated steering wheel as well. Lastly, all 2026 Crosstreks have black exterior badging. Non-hybrids also sport a new eight-speed manual shift mode. 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Pricing",
