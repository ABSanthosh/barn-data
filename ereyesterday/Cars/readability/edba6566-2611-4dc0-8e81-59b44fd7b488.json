It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed F1 dual-clutch automatic transaxle and is finished in Rosso Mugello and Argento Nurburgring over Vinaccia leather upholstery. The car is further equipped with 20″ split-spoke alloy wheels, ceramic-composite brakes, an SCM-E magnetorheological damping system, parking sensors, heated power-adjustable seats, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and navigation. This 488 GTB was purchased by the owner in 2023 and is now offered in Colorado on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a Massachusetts title. The car was specified to commemorate the 1959 250 GT Pininfarina coupe, and it is finished in Rosso Mugello with an Argento Nurburgring roof and side mirrors. Additional details include 70th Anniversary badging, xenon headlights with washers, front and rear parking sensors, a matte black rear diffuser, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and a vented deck lid. The 20″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. The car is equipped with an SCM-E magnetorheological suspension control system. Braking is provided by Alluminio-finished multi-piston calipers over ceramic-composite discs at each corner. The heated power-adjustable seats are upholstered in Vinaccia leather with Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests, while color-matching upholstery adorns portions of the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carpeted floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include drilled aluminum pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and navigation. The leather-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted paddle shifters and features an engine-start button and a manettino driving-mode selector. Instrumentation consists of a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by multifunction displays. The digital odometer indicates 4,500 miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 was factory rated at 661 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed F1 dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Algar Ferrari of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $390,306. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
