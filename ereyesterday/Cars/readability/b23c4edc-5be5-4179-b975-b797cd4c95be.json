Powered by a 5.2-liter V10 that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, the car is further equipped with black Alcantara upholstery, LED headlights and taillights, a louvered engine cover, carbon-ceramic disc brakes, three ANIMA dynamic driving modes, a front-axle lift system, a rear wing, heated power-adjustable seats, forged carbon-composite interior and exterior accents, automatic climate control, and an infotainment system. This LP640-4 Performante was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title. The LP640-4 Performante was introduced for the 2017 model year and featured Lamborghini’s Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva (ALA) system with forged carbon-composite active front and rear spoilers, which can adjust downforce to each corner based on driving conditions. This example is finished in Giallo Inti and features LED headlights and taillights, a louvered engine cover, front and rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, and blemishes are noted on the film. The 20″ HRE multi-spoke wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The cross-drilled and ventilated carbon-ceramic brakes feature yellow Lamborghini-branded calipers, and the car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and three ANIMA dynamic driving modes. Replacement brake pads were installed in January 2025. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in black Alcantara with yellow accents, Lamborghini logos on the headrests, and yellow stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Forged carbon-composite trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Performante-logo floor mats, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, and an infotainment system. An engine start button is located in the center console beneath a hinged red cover. The flat-bottom steering wheel features a drive-mode selector, and it sits ahead of column-mounted shift paddles and a digital gauge cluster with a variable tachometer, a speedometer, and a configurable display. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles. The 5.2-liter V10 featured a revised air intake system and low-weight exhaust system in Performante trim and was factory rated at 631 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in May 2024. Power is routed to all four wheels through a Lamborghini Doppia Frizione seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is equipped with a Fabspeed exhaust system. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Manhattan Motorcars in New York, New York, along with factory options, colors, and a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of $319,885.
