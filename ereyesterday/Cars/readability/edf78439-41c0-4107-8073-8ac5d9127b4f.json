  "description": "This 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 began its life as a Berlinetta and is said to have been delivered new to Lebanon before undergoing a conversion into Spyder configuration in Europe. Chassis 16295 was imported to Canada circa the 1980s and is said to have subsequently remained in Quebec for over 25 years before making its way to the US. Finished in red over black leather, the car is powered by a 4.4-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through six Weber carburetors and is paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Borrani wire wheels, a Stebro exhaust system, a black convertible top, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette radio. This Daytona Spyder convertible was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered in Costa Mesa, California, with a tool kit, two spare ignition units, and a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1973 model.",

Finished in red over black leather, the car is powered by a 4.4-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through six Weber carburetors and is paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Borrani wire wheels, a Stebro exhaust system, a black convertible top, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette radio. This Daytona Spyder convertible was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered in Costa Mesa, California, with a tool kit, two spare ignition units, and a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1973 model. The 365 GTB/4 was introduced in coupe form at the 1968 Paris Auto Salon and was joined at the following year’s Frankfurt Auto Show by a convertible variant, which entered production in 1971. Approximately 122 Spiders were produced by the factory and, like its fixed-roof counterpart, featured Scaglietti-built bodywork incorporating a steel shell with aluminum hood, trunk, and door panels riding on a steel-tube chassis with a fiberglass inner tub. This example was refinished in red after its conversion from coupe to convertible form and is outfitted with a black soft top that can be stowed under a color-matched boot. Features include split chrome bumpers, bicolor front turn signals with prancing-horse logos, a driver-side mirror, rectangular rear side markers, and quad exhaust outlets. Borrani wire wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in Michelin XWX tires measuring 215/70VR15 up front and 225/70VR15 at the rear. Servo-assisted braking is handled by ventilated discs at each corner. The cabin is trimmed in black leather over the bucket seats, door panels, console, and sills, while color-keyed carpeting covers the floors. Additional features include black “mouse hair” dash trim, a gated shifter, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette radio. The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, a clock, and gauges monitoring fuel level, coolant temperature, amperage, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 8,700 kilometers (~5,400 miles), approximately five of which have been added under current ownership. The 4.4-liter Tipo 251 Colombo V12 features a 60° bank angle, dual overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank, and a dry-sump lubrication system. Induction is through six Weber carburetors. The all-synchromesh five-speed manual transaxle is mounted at the rear of the car to optimize weight distribution and incorporates a limited-slip differential. The four-wheel independent suspension comprises unequal A-arms, coil springs, telescopic shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars at each end. A safety inspection is said to have been performed under current ownership. A Stebro exhaust system was installed in the mid-2000s. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
