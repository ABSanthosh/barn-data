No fewer than 410 vehicles attended last Sunday’s event held at Autodrom Most, located in the northwestern part of the country. Although the show was mostly about cars, the M 1000 R, M 1000 XR, and  M 1000 RR joined them from the Motorrad division.The few images that BMW’s Czechia division share don’t do the M Day justice. Nearly all current M cars hit the track, along with some greatest hits. Relevant examples of heavy hitters include the M5 CS and the V10-powered M5 E90. One of the rarest cars to attend the event was an M5 Touring (E34). Only 891 units of the original long-roof M5 were ever made, a car widely regarded as one of the last hand-built Ms.Some 33 years after the first M5 Touring saw the light of production day, its modern-day attended the M Day as well. The G99 shared the 2.6-mile (4.2-kilometer) race track with its G90 sedan sibling and the smaller M3 Touring. This year’s event wasn’t just about fast cars, as several non-M SUVs hit the adjacent off-road track. Images show the X3 and X7 kicking up dust in the upper part of the Autodrom Most.The local Czech M Club is happy to report more than 2,400 people attended the 2025 M Day. The fastest driver during the timed events won an entry ticket to the Red Bull Ring in Austria.It won’t be long before the next gathering of M cars. BMW will bring several high-performance models to next month’s Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Aside from current vehicles, it’ll also unveil a new model – quite possibly the M2 CS. A mysterious one-off has also been confirmed. The show takes place May 23-25.Photos: BMW Czech Republic",
