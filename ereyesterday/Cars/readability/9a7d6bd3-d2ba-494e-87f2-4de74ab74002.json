  "text": "Alfa Romeo is wrapping up testing of their latest supercar, ahead of deliveries next month November 25, 2024 at 19:50 by Michael Gauthier Alfa Romeo has released a new video of a 33 Stradale hitting its top speed of 207 mph (333 km/h) on the Nardò Ring. Engineers have been wrapping up testing, ahead of the first delivery in December. The 33 Stradale was introduced last summer and all 33 units have already been spoken for. Work continues on the Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale as the company has released a new video showing a prototype being tested at the Nardò Technical Center. There it was subjected to an “intense session of dynamic tests” to ensure the road-going supercar will be able to hit all its performance targets. As part of the latest round of testing, the team “monitored and validated dynamic parameters such as aerodynamics, top speed, maximum temperatures, propulsive cooling systems, and cabin soundproofing.” While that’s a lot, the real highlight was a high-speed run on the famous Nardò Ring. More: Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale Is A Stunning Flagship That Pays Tribute To The Company’s Original Supercar The company used the 7.8 mile (12.6 km) long track to validate the car’s top speed of 207 mph (333 km/h) and 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) time of less than three seconds. Those are impressive numbers and Alfa Romeo noted they were made possible by a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 developing more than 620 hp (462 kW / 629 PS). It’s connected to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, which sends power to the rear wheels through an electronic limited-slip differential. The Nardò tests follow trials at the Balocco Proving Ground, where the prototype was subjected to “medium- and high-speed tests, with a focus on balance, braking system and road handling.” Alfa said some of these tests involved turning off the traction control system and taking the car close to its top speed to confirm it’s “surprising ease of driving, even for non-professional drivers.” Other tests confirmed the car can go from 62-0 mph (100-0 km/h) in less than 108 feet (33 meters), thanks in part to a Brembo carbon-ceramic braking system that has four- and six-piston calipers as well as ventilated and perforated discs. Deliveries are slated to begin next month and the automaker said the tests “confirm the ease with which the driver enters into symbiosis with the car, enjoying its power, agility and unmistakably Alfa Romeo sound.”",
