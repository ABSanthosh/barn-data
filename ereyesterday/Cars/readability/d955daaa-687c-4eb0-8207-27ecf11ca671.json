  "text": "RML claims its P39 is five seconds quicker than the GT3 RS at the Nürburgring, with a 2.4-second 0–60 mph sprint May 23, 2025 at 21:08 by Brad Anderson The 911 Turbo S-based RML P39 features a fully bespoke, ultra-lightweight carbon fiber body. All-new aerodynamic add-ons allow the car to produce up to 923 kg (2,035 lbs) of downforce. New suspension and upgraded brakes have also been added to the limited production model. There’s no shortage of supercar startups chasing the dream, but few take the scenic route through the Porsche 911 Turbo S. That’s exactly what British engineering firm RML Group is doing, and seven months after announcing its plans, the world finally got a closer look at the results. Also: Porsche Confirms The End Of Production For These Gas Sports Cars RML’s limited-run project, dubbed the P39, is based on the Porsche 911 Turbo S and will be capped at just 39 units worldwide. While testing and development are still underway, the public recently caught a glimpse of the car for the first time in person. During the recent ‘Supercar Fest The Runway 2025’ event in the UK, the engineering outfit brought along a prototype of the P39. Bathed in all-new carbon fiber bodywork, RML’s creation is very far removed from an original 911 Turbo S. In August, it’ll also be showcased during the Silverstone Festival. Big Body, Bigger Intentions The distinctive body of the P39 isn’t only there for aesthetic purposes. It takes inspiration from Le Mans Hypercars and is 170 mm (6.7 inches) longer and 90 mm (3.5 inches) wider than the base car. RML has also widened the track and the fitment of bold aero elements, such as the huge rear wing, the diffuser, and the front splitter, allowing it to produce 923 kg (2,035 lbs) of downforce at 177 mph (285 km/h). One of RML’s major aims with the P39 is to lap the Nurburgring Nordschleife in just 6:45. To try and make this a reality, the 911’s 3.7-liter twin-turbocharged flat-six has been boosted 920 hp and 705 lb-ft (956 Nm) of torque, slightly different figures than what were promoted last year. The peak 920 hp and 705 lb-ft are only available in Sport and Sport+ models, and power is reduced to 600 horses in Wet mode and 750 hp in Normal mode. More Than Just a Power Bump Given that the firm plans to price its conversion from £495,000 (about $670,500 at current exchange rates), excluding the cost of the donor car, it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of other changes going on beneath the skin. For example, the car features bespoke top mounts, new springs, and bespoke dampers to perfect the ride and handling. It also received a four-corner hydraulic lift system and a recalibrated rear-wheel steering system. First customer deliveries are expected to begin later this year, marking the start of what RML hopes will be a very exclusive chapter in the world of high-performance, coachbuilt supercars.",
