Interior details include heated power-adjustable Daytona-style front seats, a surround-view camera, an 8.4″ vertical touchscreen infotainment system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a carbon-fiber steering wheel with LED shift lights. This Canadian-market Roma Spider was first registered in British Columbia and was purchased by the selling dealer in 2024 and registered in Washington State. It has 563 miles and is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve in West Palm Beach, Florida, with factory books, a car cover, a battery charger, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title. Designed under director Flavio Manzoni at the Ferrari Styling Center, the Roma debuted as a 2+2 coupe for the 2020 model year, with a soft-top Spider variant entering production in 2023. This example is finished in Nero Purosangue, an extra-range color, and features LED lighting, an Advanced Front Driving Camera, airbrushed Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, flush door handles, carbon-fiber boot trim, an active rear spoiler, and quad Sport tailpipe tips. The power-operated convertible top is trimmed in red technical fabric, and the car was optioned with a red and black fabric-covered tonneau cover. The 20″ alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires measuring 245/35 up front and 285/35 at the rear. A dual-mode MagneRide suspension was optioned from the factory, and braking is handled by yellow-finished, Ferrari-branded Brembo calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. The Daytona-style heated and power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Bordeaux leather with Nero Alcantara accents. Matching upholstery extends to the dashboard, center console, door panels, and rear seatbacks, and black carpets line the floors. Additional equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control, surround-view cameras, an 8.4″ Infotelematic touchscreen display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, aluminum pedal covers, and an aluminum front passenger footrest. The optional carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel features Bordeaux leather accents, an engine-start button, a manettino driving-mode selector, and LED shift lights. It fronts column-mounted carbon-fiber paddle shifters as well as a 16″ configurable digital instrument cluster. The odometer shows under 600 miles, approximately 20 of which were added by the selling dealer. The 3.9-liter F154 V8 features a 90° bank angle and a flat-plane crankshaft along with two twin-scroll IHI turbochargers paired with air-to-air intercoolers. Factory-rated output was 611 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and an E-Diff 3 differential. The Personalization Specification placard is mounted on the trunk lid and lists factory colors and options.
