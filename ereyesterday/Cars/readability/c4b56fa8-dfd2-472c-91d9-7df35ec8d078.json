The car was an Edmunds longterm test vehicle in 2011-2012 and was acquired in 2017 by its current owner, BaT’s Director of Operations and podcast host, Alex Porter. Work performed in 2018 on the car’s 3.0-liter VTEC V6 included replacing the timing belt, water pump, and valve cover gaskets, and the CV boots and clutch master cylinder were also replaced during current ownership. The car is equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle, limited-slip differential, staggered-diameter forged wheels, and black leather upholstery on power-adjustable seats. Now indicating 90k miles, this NSX is offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with records dating to 1996, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title. The aluminum bodywork on this example is finished in Sebring Silver Metallic, one of three colors available when the NSX debuted for the 1991 model year. First-year production for the US market totaled 3,163 cars, though only about 320 were painted silver from the factory. Both bumper covers were repainted prior to current ownership, and the front cover was refinished again in preparation for sale. The front lip was replaced in May 2024, and the side mirrors were repainted during current ownership along with the driver-side A- and B-pillars. The taillight seals were changed in 2011, and there are chips in the paint on the front hood, headlight cover, roof panel, and side mirrors. The staggered-diameter forged wheels are mounted with Yokamaha tires. The car features a four-wheel double-wishbone suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars. Braking is handled by NSX-branded calipers over 11.1″ vented rotors at each corner. The previous owner installed coilovers and aftermarket wheels, though these were removed in favor of the factory wheels and suspension by the current owner. The power-adjustable sport seats are upholstered in black leather, and interior amenities include automatic climate control, cruise control, and a cassette stereo with CD changer mounted in the trunk. The seatbelt guide update was performed in 1996, and photos of scratches/wear on the e-brake handle button and on the center console behind the shifter are shown in the gallery. Stainless door-sill plates are stamped with the car’s serial number, showing that it was the 743rd production NSX to be built. A leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a tachometer with an 8,000-rpm redline, a 188-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. A speed sensor was replaced in November 2024 to address intermittent functioning of the speedometer, and the cluster now indicates 90k miles. Around 17k miles were added by Alex during his eight years of ownership. Zanardi-style floormats were installed during current ownership, and a trunk-mounted Kenwood amplifier is what remains of a previously installed aftermarket sound system. The mid-mounted 3.0-liter V6 features VTEC variable valve timing and was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Updated coolant hoses were installed in 1996, and the oil pan gasket was done in 2017 along with the VTEC valve gaskets, solenoid gasket, and valve adjustment. The timing belt, water pump, accessory belts, and valve cover gaskets were replaced in October 2018 by Hill Top Auto Service, who cleaned and enlarged all six EGR valve passages in February 2020. The oil was most recently changed in May 2024. The five-speed manual transaxle carries serial number J4A4-1000938, indicating that the unit falls outside the snap ring failure range. The inner and outer CV boots were replaced in 2017, and the clutch master cylinder was replaced in 2018. Two new factory catalytic converters were installed during current ownership along with the factory muffler system, replacing an aftermarket setup that had been installed by the previous owner. The car most recently passed a California emissions test in November 2024, and dry ice cleaning was performed by the selling dealer. Records dating to August 1996 are included with the car, including receipts for over $10k in service performed during current ownership.
