  "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.
