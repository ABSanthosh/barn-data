It is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in GT Silver Metallic with contrasting graphics over Cognac and black leather upholstery. Equipment includes the Heritage Design Package, the Chrono Package, 20″ GT3 center-lock alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a limited-slip differential, a front axle lift system, a black soft top, a carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel, LED headlights with PDLS, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. This 911 Speedster was purchased new by the seller and is now offered with a Porsche Production Specifications sheet, a window sticker, the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Oklahoma title in the seller’s name. The Speedster shares styling cues with the 991 GT3 including a similar front splitter and bumper covers, while features unique to the Speedster consist of a shorter windshield, a manually retractable black soft top, and a body-color carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel. This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and was optioned with the Heritage Design Package, which adds a partially white front section, white motorsport graphics, and gold-colored Speedster badging. Additional details include LED headlights with PDLS, automatically dimming mirrors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. Satin Platinum-finished center-locking 20″ forged alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes with Porsche-branded calipers. Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Porsche Stability Management (PSM), and rear-axle steering were standard on the Speedster, and this example was optioned with a front-axle lift system. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in Cognac, while black leather covers the upper portions of the dashboard and door panels. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger footwell, and additional appointments include carpeted floor mats, a Bose sound system, the Light Design Package, aluminum pedals, Voice Control, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. A serialized plaque located between the seats denotes this example as #1,626 of 1,948 Speedsters produced. The three-spoke leather-wrapped GT sports steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline along with a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The Chrono Package adds a stopwatch to the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 151 miles. The naturally aspirated, GT3-sourced 4.0L flat-six features VarioCam Plus valve timing and was updated for the Speedster with revised individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors. Factory rated power output was 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with an optional 23.7-gallon extended-range fuel tank. The Porsche Production Specifications sheet shows factory colors, optional equipment, and a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $316,910. A window sticker is also included in the sale. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
