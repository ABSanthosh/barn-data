  "description": "Viaterra’s Second Skin is a base layer designed for motorcycle riding in hot weather, where the aim is to wick the sweat and moisture away from the body to help keep it cool.  As the name suggests, this is meant to be the first layer you wear under your riding jacket, and it’s designed to be as comfortable as possible. The material is nice and stretchy, and Viaterra has taken care to design the seams to be as unobtrusive as possible. The seams are quite flat, and they all have a piping of soft material around them to reduce chafing against the skin. The result of all this is that comfort is very good, and you’ll be happy wearing this for long days on the bike. What I did notice is that it’s not a high-compression fit like some of the more performance-oriented products out there. You can try a size smaller, but the sleeves might end up being too short. Ultimately, this isn’t a super snug, body-hugging fit, and I found myself preferring to use the Viaterra Second Skin for more relaxed, touring sort of riding rather than high-intensity track or off-road riding, where a compression fit is nicer. Polygiene tech helps keep odour build-up under control. One area where the Second Skin has fared well so far is in odour management. I have found that some base layers can retain odour even after a machine wash, and that hasn’t been an issue here so far. The company uses Polygiene technology, which is a silica-based solution that captures and removes odours from the material. The Second Skin is available in six sizes, and you have a choice of five subtle colours, including a couple of interesting-looking camo-style prints. There’s also a choice of lower base layers in the same material. Both the top and bottom are available for Rs 1,499 each, which is on par with the competition and a fair amount to pay.
