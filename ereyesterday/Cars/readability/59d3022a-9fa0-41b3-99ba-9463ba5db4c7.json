  "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the go-to luxury car for anyone with money. It’s the German luxury brand’s number one model and the bestselling car in its class, largely thanks to its long wheelbase, which provides the much-coveted legroom rear-seat passengers desire. In India, where luxury sedans are predominantly chauffeur-driven, rear-seat comfort is a top priority. BMW, recognising Mercedes’ winning formula, finally joined the long-wheelbase club with its latest 5 Series. But Mercedes struck back with an even stronger offering – the new E-Class with three engine options, ensuring it covers all bases. The E 450 is priced Rs 14 lakh higher than the E 200. We tested the E 200, the base version, which we loved for its ride comfort, but the engine is a bit anaemic and just doesn’t have the pep customers who want to drive would like. That’s where the range-topping E 450 4MATIC with the M256 engine comes in. The 3-litre, straight-six turbo petrol mill produces a humongous 177hp more than the 2-litre unit in the E 200, and because of that, the E 450, with an ex-showroom price of Rs 92.5 lakh, costs Rs 14 lakh more than the E 200; the on-road price is well north of a crore. However, aside from the upgraded powertrain and all-wheel drive (4MATIC), equipment levels remain essentially the same. So, are the extra horses and traction worth the extra rupees? The answer lies in the driving experience. Mercedes E 450 exterior design Despite the AMG Line package, the E 450 doesn’t look as sporty as the AMG counterparts The E 450 comes in AMG Line trim only, which includes the sportier alloy wheels. Visually, the E 450 LWB maintains the stately limousine aesthetic of its lesser siblings. The only differences are the trapezoid exhausts, the AMG Line-styled front bumpers and AMG alloys, which, wrapped in high-profile rubber in the interests of ride comfort, quite frankly don’t look very sporty. Otherwise, it is unlike its AMG counterparts, which flaunt their muscle with aggressive bumpers, flared wheel arches and loud exhausts. Mercedes E 450 engine and performance Not as loud as full-fat AMGs, but still blisteringly quick Smooth straight-six engine produces 381hp and 500Nm of torque. At the heart of the E 450 is Mercedes’ M256 engine, churning out 381hp and 500Nm of torque. Paired with a mild-hybrid system that adds a temporary 23hp boost, the E 450 rockets from 0kph to 100 in a blistering 4.5 seconds. That’s the kind of acceleration you’d expect from a proper AMG, yet here, it’s delivered in the most refined manner possible. Unlike the full-fat AMG models with aggressive exhausts and crackling overrun sounds, the E 450 remains discreet. It doesn’t shout about its capabilities, but make no mistake – it moves with serious intent. The 6-cylinder engine is silky smooth, and the 9-speed AT is impeccably tuned With a claimed 0-100kph in 4.5 seconds, the E 450 is quick. The 9-speed automatic transmission is impeccably tuned, delivering almost imperceptible shifts in Comfort mode but responding with urgency when you put your foot down. More than just performance, there’s something to be said about a six-cylinder engine, which, quite frankly, is even becoming a rarity in the Mercedes world. A straight-six feels so much smoother, so much more effortless than a four-cylinder, and it’s the velvety punch, the lusty power that marks out this motor. It also sounds so much sweeter and richer than a four-cylinder, reminding you there’s something special under the hood. The other ace up its sleeve is the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, adding a reassuring layer of security when pushing hard or tackling loose surfaces. Mercedes E 450 ride and handling Ride quality isn’t as plush as the 5 Series but strikes a better balance between sporty and comfortable  Only over really big bumps will one have to be careful in the E 450. Ride comfort has always been a core strength of the E-Class, and this latest version, like the E 200, remains absolutely top-class. It soaks up bumps, undulations and everything Mumbai roads throw at it with ease. However, dare I say, the ride isn’t quite as plush as the new 5 Series, which has sacrificed a little of its signature sporty edge for an extra degree of comfort. What’s remarkable about the E 450 is that it hasn’t sacrificed anything. It feels sporty, nimble and agile without compromising on comfort – a rare balance that Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Handling and agility are impressive for a car of this size The E 450 is a nimble handler for its size. Of course, having a strong engine is one thing, but being able to fully exploit that power is another. And that’s where the E 450 truly shines. The body control is superb, the handling precise, and the agility impressive for a car of this size. But what really stands out is the steering. Mercedes has aced it – it’s that perfect blend of accuracy, feedback and lightness, making it effortless to manoeuvre at slow speeds while still being engaging when you pick up the pace. Mercedes E 450 interior and features No other car in its class comes close to the E-Class in terms of rear seat comfort But here’s the question: at slow speeds or in traffic, is it really the driver’s seat you should be in? I ease myself into the back seat to remind myself why the E-Class is the segment’s bestseller in the first place. Step inside, and the E 450’s interior is a masterclass in luxury. The dashboard is dominated by Mercedes’ Superscreen – a stunning combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch central touchscreen and a 12.3-inch passenger display. While the tech is impressive, Mercedes has taken a largely buttonless approach, meaning even basic functions like climate control require navigating menus. It’s sleek but occasionally frustrating. The selfie camera in the dashboard for video calls is neat, though one for the rear-passengers might have been as helpful. Rear-seat comfort is where the E-Class truly distances itself from rivals, especially the 5 Series. In this department, nothing comes quite as close. The long-wheelbase variant offers limousine-like legroom, but it’s not just the space – it’s how Mercedes has used it. The reclining rear seats, which tilt from 24 to 36 degrees, make a huge difference in comfort, allowing passengers to stretch out in a near-business-class position. Pair that with the chauffeur package, which lets you electrically move the front passenger seat forward when unoccupied, and you can comfortably sit cross-legged – just as you would at home. Where the 5 Series falters, the E-Class excels. BMW’s new 5 Series LWB has softened its ride to appeal to chauffeur-driven buyers, but it still doesn’t offer the same seat recline, legroom, or sheer sense of indulgence. One key area where the 5 Series loses out is the lack of rear sunshades–in the E-Class, you get electrically operated sunshades all around, including a rear sunblind, enhancing privacy and comfort. The E-Class is still the reigning champ in terms of rear-seat experience in this segment. The Burmester 4D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos further elevates the experience, turning the E-Class’ cabin into a rolling concert hall. And then, there’s an interesting modern touch – Mercedes has included a selfie and video camera on the dashboard. It’s great for video calls, though one could argue a rear-seat camera for executives attending Zoom meetings would have made more sense. Ultimately, the E-Class is the luxury sedan to beat. For most owners, this will be a chauffeur-driven car from Monday to Friday, but when the weekend arrives, there’s more than enough under the hood to tempt them into the driver’s seat. Mercedes E 450 price and verdict The E 450 blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either    The E 450 4MATIC is the ultimate stealth weapon. It’s got the power and acceleration to rival an AMG but without the loud styling and exhaust theatrics. It delivers everything the E 53 AMG does in real-world driving: effortless power, a rewarding drive and a level of comfort no sports sedan can match. Unless you truly crave the full AMG experience, the E 450 offers 90 percent of the performance with 100 percent of the practicality. It’s the thinking man’s AMG – a car that lets you enjoy serious performance while flying under the radar. The way it blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either is something not even the cheaper 5 Series can match. Pricey it is, but that’s the cost you pay for getting the best of both worlds.

And that’s where the E 450 truly shines. The body control is superb, the handling precise, and the agility impressive for a car of this size. But what really stands out is the steering. Mercedes has aced it – it’s that perfect blend of accuracy, feedback and lightness, making it effortless to manoeuvre at slow speeds while still being engaging when you pick up the pace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMercedes E 450 interior and features\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo other car in its class comes close to the E-Class in terms of rear seat comfort\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut here’s the question: at slow speeds or in traffic, is it really the driver’s seat you should be in? I ease myself into the back seat to remind myself why the E-Class is the segment’s bestseller in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep inside, and the E 450’s interior is a masterclass in luxury. The dashboard is dominated by Mercedes’ Superscreen – a stunning combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch central touchscreen and a 12.3-inch passenger display. While the tech is impressive, Mercedes has taken a largely buttonless approach, meaning even basic functions like climate control require navigating menus. It’s sleek but occasionally frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 infotainment touchscreen\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes_E450_Selfie_Camera.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 infotainment touchscreen\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe selfie camera in the dashboard for video calls is neat, though one for the rear-passengers might have been as helpful.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eRear-seat comfort is where the E-Class truly distances itself from rivals, especially the 5 Series. In this department, nothing comes quite as close. The long-wheelbase variant offers limousine-like legroom, but it’s not just the space – it’s how Mercedes has used it. The reclining rear seats, which tilt from 24 to 36 degrees, make a huge difference in comfort, allowing passengers to stretch out in a near-business-class position. Pair that with the chauffeur package, which lets you electrically move the front passenger seat forward when unoccupied, and you can comfortably sit cross-legged – just as you would at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere the 5 Series falters, the E-Class excels. BMW’s new 5 Series LWB has softened its ride to appeal to chauffeur-driven buyers, but it still doesn’t offer the same seat recline, legroom, or sheer sense of indulgence. One key area where the 5 Series loses out is the lack of rear sunshades–in the E-Class, you get electrically operated sunshades all around, including a rear sunblind, enhancing privacy and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 rear seat\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes_E450_Rear_Seats_Legroom.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 rear seat\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe E-Class is still the reigning champ in terms of rear-seat experience in this segment.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Burmester 4D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos further elevates the experience, turning the E-Class’ cabin into a rolling concert hall. And then, there’s an interesting modern touch – Mercedes has included a selfie and video camera on the dashboard. It’s great for video calls, though one could argue a rear-seat camera for executives attending Zoom meetings would have made more sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the E-Class is the luxury sedan to beat. For most owners, this will be a chauffeur-driven car from Monday to Friday, but when the weekend arrives, there’s more than enough under the hood to tempt them into the driver’s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMercedes E 450 price and verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe E 450 blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 front tracking\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes_E450_Front_Quarter_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 450 front tracking\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe E 450 4MATIC is the ultimate stealth weapon.
