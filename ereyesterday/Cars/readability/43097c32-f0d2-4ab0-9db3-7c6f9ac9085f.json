Finished in Rosso Mars over Nero Cosmus leather and Alcantara upholstery, the car has 5k miles and is further equipped with a limited-slip rear differential, carbon-ceramic brakes, a front-axle lift system, 20” and 21” Dianthus wheels, removable roof panels, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, a carbon-fiber X-frame, a carbon-fiber fixed rear wing, a rearview camera, carbon-fiber bucket seats, and a Lamborghini sound system. This Aventador SV roadster was purchased by the seller in 2024 and is now offered with a window sticker, two keys, the owner’s manual, spare parts, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The Aventador SuperVeloce LP750-4 debuted at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show and approximately 600 coupes and 500 roadsters were produced over the model’s run. The SuperVeloce featured a revised front splitter and rear diffuser as well as a fixed carbon-fiber rear wing in comparison to the standard Aventador. This roadster is finished in Rosso Mars and features removable carbon-fiber roof panels that can be stored in the front cargo area. Additional equipment includes a carbon-fiber composite monocoque shell, scissor doors, SV graphics, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, carbon-fiber accents, a rearview camera, and quad exhaust outlets. Carbon-fiber-look vinyl wrap has been applied to the mirror caps. Forged 20″ and 21″ Dianthus wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with a magnetic push-rod suspension and a front-axle suspension lift system. Stopping power is provided by yellow-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The carbon-fiber bucket seats are trimmed in Nero Cosmus leather and Alcantara with red accents and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard and lower side panels. Equipment includes carbon-fiber trim, cruise control, automatic climate control, a Lamborghini sound system, and an infotainment system with a 7″ TFT display. The Carismo Design steering wheel features a red centering stripe as well as carbon-fiber and microsuede trim. It frames a digital gauge cluster with a central tachometer, a speed readout, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles, approximately 2,600 miles of which were added under current ownership. The removed steering wheel is included in the sale. The mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12 featured a revised exhaust system for the SV as well as a factory-rated output of 740 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber X-frame was optioned from the factory. An oil change was performed and the air filters were replaced in 2024, per the seller. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. A RYFT titanium exhaust system has been fitted, and the removed exhaust components are included in the sale. The window sticker lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $585,615. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
