  "text": "Trust the process Of course, the process isn't at simple as \"rusty red thing goes in, perfectly stripped rust-free thing comes out.\" The process requires plenty of dips and liberal application of a pressure washer, but it's all just so nice to sit down and watch. I want a playlist of every one of these videos on a loop, on mute, whenever I'm just hanging out. It's so nice to just see a process happen, through which an object is changed.  If you liked How It's Made, you'll probably like seeing the hard work of both a factory paint booth and years of rot carefully undone by a big vat of liquid and a high-powered Super Soaker. If you didn't like How It's Made, I fundamentally don't understand you, but give the clip a watch anyway. Who doesn't love to see a process be done — or better yet, undone by yet another process?",
