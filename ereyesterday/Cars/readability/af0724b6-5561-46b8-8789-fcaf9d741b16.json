JohnnyQ90’s RC Chevy truck hits 18 mph, packs a $2,099 V8 that revs to 10,000 rpm, and sounds just like a real small-block.V8-Powered RC Chevy TruckYouTube @ JohnnyQ90Jul 5, 2025 4:40 PM EDTThe world of radio-controlled (RC) vehicles is driven by passion, and it’s gained serious traction over the past few years among hobbyists. YouTube creator JohnnyQ90 stands out in this space, with nearly two million subscribers and a knack for building shockingly realistic, fully functional microscopic machines. In one of his latest videos, he showcases a working RC Chevy truck powered by a tiny 44cc V8 engine. Small Truck, Serious Engineering To most people, an RC car is just a small toy with a minuscule electric motor, barely fast enough to outrun a walking person. Johnny’s V8-powered micro truck is the exact opposite. It has a top speed of 29 kph (18 mph), which is faster than the average human can run. And like any real car, it needs regular maintenance. The video begins with Johnny cleaning off the dust and performing a routine oil change. After draining the old oil, he fills it with 25 ml of 5W-50. It’s a little ritual any gearhead can appreciate, even if the car only weighs 8.8 kg (19.4 lbs) and fits on a table. The $2,099 Small-Block Heart Powering his Chevy truck is a water-cooled, four-stroke 44cc OHV small-block V8 made by CISON Gasoline. It puts out around 4.8 horsepower, revs up to 10,000 rpm, and weighs just 1,700 grams (3.75 lbs). Despite its tiny size, it sounds shockingly similar to a full-size American V8. Engines this intricately engineered don’t come cheap. The CISON V8 costs $2,099 on its own, and that price climbs quickly once you factor in the body, tires, and potential upgrades like a six-speed transmission or alternator. This isn’t a budget-friendly RC build; it’s a mechanical work of art, meant for enthusiasts. Why We Can’t Stop Watching This V8-Powered Toy Sure, it sounds ridiculous on paper: watching a grown man drive a toy truck back and forth. But bear with us. This isn’t just a toy. Watching Johnny clean, maintain, and drive his mini V8 truck is oddly satisfying. There’s something undeniably charming about seeing a scale model treated with the same love and care as a full-sized car. Between CISON’s attention to detail and JohnnyQ90’s passion for his build, it’s easy to get lost in the realism. And the occasional moment where the truck flips over because it’s too fast for its own good? That’s just the cherry on top. About the AuthorMarnus MoolmanKeep Reading",
