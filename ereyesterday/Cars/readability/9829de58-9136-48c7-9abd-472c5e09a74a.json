  "text": "Pricing details haven't been announced by the PureSpeed will cost significantly more than the SL 63 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Like the regular SL 63, the PureSpeed’s 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 delivers 577 hp. Numerous aerodynamic changes have been made to account for the lack of a fixed roof. All PureSpeeds come with a special IWC Schaffhausen analog watch on the dashboard. Roughly seven months after premiering in concept guise at the Monaco Grand Prix, Mercedes-Benz has officially lifted the veil on the exclusive Mercedes-AMG PureSpeed in Abu Dhabi. This is the first model from the new Mythos family and will be capped at just 250 units worldwide. The car is based on the existing Mercedes SL but has been thoroughly overhauled and will be much more expensive, although no official pricing details have been confirmed at this stage. As a speedster, the car lacks a traditional windshield and A-pillars. Instead, it features a Formula 1-inspired halo made from high-strength steel that should keep occupants safe. The design is very similar to the Mercedes-AMG GT Speedster built by German firm Bussink a few years ago. Read: Mercedes-AMG Mythos PureSpeed Is An SL Speedster With An F1 Halo Roof Bar Each PureSpeed has a front fascia very similar to the standard SL, although several important changes have been made. For example, there are reshaped air intakes and a bespoke hood that aids in the aerodynamics. A custom rear diffuser and trunk lid have also been engineered to compensate for the lack of a roof. Unique 21-inch forged aluminum wheels with carbon fiber covers are another key highlight, as is the extendable rear spoiler. An active aerodynamic element is also hidden in the underbody, increasing downforce on the front axle. Interestingly, Mercedes-AMG doesn’t appear to have made any changes to the car’s 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8. As such, it continues to pump out 577 hp (585 PS) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque, just like the regular SL 63 that anyone can walk into a Mercedes dealership and buy. Fortunately, this powertrain gives the car more than enough grunt, allowing it to accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds and through to a 196 mph (315 km/h) top speed. Mated to the thumping V8 is a nine-speed transmission sending power through all four wheels. Like other Mercedes models, the PureSpeed has been equipped with the marque’s Active Ride Control system to optimize the suspension. Carbon ceramic brakes come standard, as is active rear-axle steering. Complementing the exterior changes is a suite of special interior elements. First up are AMG Performance seats with distinctive leather covers and decorative stitching. Mercedes has also adorned the door sills in leather, added a beautiful two-tone leather steering wheel, and affixed a custom IWC Schaffhausen analog watch to the dashboard.",
