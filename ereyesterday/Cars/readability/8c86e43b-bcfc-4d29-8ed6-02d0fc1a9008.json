  "description": "Cast your mind back to early 2017, when Mercedes-Benz India did a mic drop and revealed the long-wheelbase E-Class for India. We all knew instantly that it would change the game, and it did. Yes, it was more expensive than rivals, but that didn’t matter to Indian buyers, who just lapped it up, making it the bestselling car in its segment by a long shot. Rivals responded in different ways, but none were able to stem the E’s mighty tide. Now, as we move into the next generation, BMW has boldly followed down that path, replacing its 5 Series and 6 Series GT with one model – the 5 Series LWB. It’s an expensive path, mind you, requiring a lot of investment from each brand, as ours is the only right-hand-drive market in the world to sell them; they’re not just made in India, they’re made for India. And as luck and lifecycles would have it, the launch of the 5 Series L (code: G68) has coincided nicely with that of the new-generation E-Class LWB (code: V214), which, of course, is going to defend its predecessor’s well-manicured turf. Its traditional rivals – the A6, the S90 and the ES – remain, of course, but the battle of the boss seats is really between these two. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series rear seats Recline function, wraparound ambient lighting and boss mode give the E-Class a proper business-class feel. So, let’s start right there. What’s common in both cars is a ridiculous amount of rear legroom and the fact they’re best for two; a middle passenger has to deal with a big transmission tunnel and raised centre cushion. But from there on, they do things differently. The 5 Series’ 110mm stretch is reflected in its massive doors that also have huge windows attached. The E-Class, as before, has Merc’s ‘Maybach’ doors, in which the quarter glass is fixed to the bodywork, and the door itself – soft-close, incidentally – is smaller. Each has its benefits and drawbacks; the BMW is easier to get in and out of (also helped by a higher seat) thanks to the wider opening, but the doors are a pain to open in tight spaces. The Mercedes doesn’t have this problem and also gives you some privacy as you can hide behind the C-pillar, but then you have to climb around this pillar and lower yourself into the seat. Softer seat cushioning, more room, but no recline in the BMW. Aftermarket sunblinds are poorly executed. You sink into the 5 Series’ seat thanks to its thicker, softer cushioning, both for the base and backrest, with plush outer-side bolstering that hugs you in place. They’ve chosen an up-tilted seat base angle for better support and a fixed backrest angle, rear set at 31 degrees to lay your spine into. The huge fixed glass roof – in combination with the large windows – makes the cabin feel airy. But, while there is a powered shade for the overhead glass, there are no window shades, nor one for the rear windscreen, which is a huge miss. As a quick fix, BMW has fit removable aftermarket shade panels, but their execution is basic. And should you have to remove them to enjoy the view outside or to open the window, they will just sit in the cabin with you. Powered seat and blind controls elevate E-Class’ rear cabin. The E-Class’ seat cushioning might not be quite as soft as the 5’s, but on every other front, it knocks it out of the park. For one, it gets sunshades not only on both rear windows but on the rear windscreen, too, and all are powered and operable from either rear door. Then, there’s the band of ambient lighting that wraps around the rear seats, enveloping you in a glow of your chosen colour. But the real draw is that both seats have a powered recline (up to a generous 36 degrees), as well as a powered seat base extension for better thigh support. All this makes travelling in the E-Class feel like a business-class flight journey. You can even move the front passenger seat forward from back here. In the BMW, your driver has to do that for you via the touchscreen. BMW’s big fixed glass gives better sense of airiness. It’s clear then, while the 5 Series has a slight edge on seat softness and knee room, it’s the E-Class that really pampers you with a more special back-seat experience. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series features Both back seats have the expected set of amenities – four-zone climate control, USB ports, multiple AC vents, cup holders and wireless chargers in the armrests. While both get sunroofs, the Mercedes, as ever, uses a split dual-pane arrangement where only the front glass opens. The BMW, instead, has one large fixed glass and ultimately is the one that makes the cabin feel airier. Though neither gets a rear entertainment system, the BMW does at least offer an accessory for mounting your own device onto the back of the front seat. Merc ‘Superscreen’ with crisp displays is a big draw; third screen adds to the wow factor. Unusually, neither car offers heated or ventilated seats in the back, which feels like a miss when so much effort was expended in stretching them, and in both, all the fancy tech is at the front. For instance, while both cars offer tremendous-sounding, ultra-high-end audio systems, the Merc’sBurmester 4D system has exciters in the front seats that thump to the beat. The Bimmer has ventilated front seats, meanwhile. Similarly, both cars have selfie cameras up front, and while the BMW’s is mainly for the anti-theft system, the Mercedes’ lets the driver do video calls; so, why not in the back? BMW dash is clean but plain; helpful shortcut keys on centre console to access favourite functions. At the front of the E-Class, you can’t miss the ‘Superscreen’, which effectively replaces the dash with screens under a glass pane, and though it means little for those at the back, its wow factor alone elevates it above the 5 Series. All three screens are crisp, vivid and well laid out, and even though the passenger-side screen feels redundant and gimmicky, it’s all part of the occasion. As ever, they are quick and smooth to operate, but the downside is the whole dashboard is easily covered in fingerprints, dust and reflections. As with many modern cars, most functions have now moved away from buttons and into the screen. But what’s particularly annoying is that the AC fan and temperature, unlike the C and S-Class, now require two steps to adjust instead of one. They’ve also given it digital AC vents that can auto adjust based on presets in – you guessed it – the touchscreen, but luckily, they can also be used manually. Merc dials classy, easier to read on the go. The BMW’s AC vents are also technically digital in that you adjust them from electronic toggles placed lower in the dash, but the frustration here is that you can’t see what you’re adjusting. That’s because the vents are concealed behind the ‘interaction bar’, a contextual strip of crystalline LED lighting that flows across the dash and into the doors. Contextual because it changes colour with drive modes and emergency warnings and even has some touch controls built into it. Though the result is a clean, minimalist look, it feels quite ordinary next to the Merc. The 5 Series has a more conventional pair of screens, laid out in a curved array stacked on top of the dash. These are also good-looking and responsive, though we’d have liked a straightforward ‘dial’ option for the driver’s display; the futuristic aesthetic isn’t very intuitive. 5 Series gets an optional tablet holder. Quality in both cars is excellent and a step up from that of their predecessors, and each offers a choice of upholstery colours – cream, black or brown in the Mercedes, and brown on grey or blue on black in the BMW. The front seats are generous in both cars, with plenty of adjustment and soft neck cushions, but the 5 Series has a slight edge again with its softer cushioning. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series performance So, it’s a great place for your chauffeur, too, but what do they have to work with under these cars’ bonnets? Today, we’re driving the E 200 and the 530Li, which are both mild-hybrid 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engines. Mercedes offers a four-cylinder diesel and a spicier six-cylinder petrol, too, and while we’re still to see any other engines in the BMW, there is the hot 600hp i5 EV. Back to the powertrains at hand, the Merc’s engine is now up to 204hp and 320Nm of torque, aided by a generous 23hp and 205Nm of electric boost. As with previous versions, it feels linear in its power delivery, with more than enough pep for sudden overtakes should you need them. There is a Sport mode, but it only makes a marginal difference. As before, the 9-speed gearbox can trip up and hunt for gears at crawling speeds, but in rare high-rev situations, and while very refined in isolation, engine noise creeps in sooner than in the 5 Series. The BMW also has much stronger performance; its engine produces a headier 258hp and 400Nm. And though its e-boost is considerably less, at just 11hp and 25Nm, you can never tell while driving it. In fact, apart from a Sport drive mode, the gearbox has its own sport mode, and then there’s the boost function, unlocked by holding down the left paddle shifter. With all these engaged, prepare for some very un-limo-like performance, the 530Li rocketing to 100kph in our tests in just 6.45 seconds – nearly 2 seconds quicker than the E 200. However, disarm all these modes, and it can do smooth and docile as well, with its ZF 8-speed gearbox handling matters better than the E’s 9-speed unit. The real surprise comes in ride quality. Neither car has air suspension or even adaptive dampers, but they both ride well, and despite their 3m-plus wheelbases, there’s enough ground clearance to get over most speed breakers without making contact. The E-Class feels a bit more tied down through corners and also at expressway speeds, but show it an uneven surface, and you’ll find considerable movement in the cabin, which spoils the otherwise serene experience. BMW’s ride has a softer edge over bumps. In an unexpected role reversal, it’s the 5 Series that has the better ride. Not only is it softer-edged over bumps, it’s more refined, too, letting in less road and tyre noise. And yet, it maintains its composure well at high speeds and is far more engaging through the corners, should you be driving yourself. The E-Class has a well-calibrated and accurate steering, but the 5’s is lighter at low speeds. It’s nowhere near as sharp to drive as its short-wheelbase predecessors, but for something this large, the long-wheelbase 5 Series’ breadth of dynamic ability is impressive. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series design There has been much talk about the way both these cars look, good and bad, and their design philosophies couldn’t be more different. The 5 Series has some seriously cool details, like its large, tipped-forward (and illuminated) grille, peeled-back adaptive LED headlamps with blue accents, sharp creases, slim LED tail-lamps and sporty bumpers. The trouble is, they don’t come together well on the bulky, amorphous and disproportionate sedan, and the aggressive M Sport styling kit feels particularly out of place here. 4cyl E-Class misses projector, adaptive lamps. The perfect example is the wheels, which have a sporty design on their own, but thanks to their deep-dish look, chunky rubber and the vast metal surface they sit under, they look tiny. Fun fact: The E-Class uses the exact same size of wheel and tyre – 225/55 R18, but you’d never guess by looking at them. It’s because of a clever dual-tone design that makes them visually larger, and the wheel arch gap is smaller. Massive doors cumbersome in tight spaces. Moreover, the Merc is a much better-proportioned limousine that has retained a proper three-box shape, giving it a regal stance on the road. There are some overdone details, like the black grille surround and flashy three-pointed-star tail-lamps, but they aren’t enough to detract from the overall classy look, nor are the headlamps that don’t get projector elements. It may be subjective, but we think the Mercedes has won the beauty contest here. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series price and verdict Going into this test, we thought it would be a walkover for the E-Class, but it ended up being closer than anticipated, and that’s largely down to the 5 Series’ better-sorted mechanical package, which only a back-to-back drive could reveal. Apart from being quicker and more fun to drive, traits important to the chauffeur-driven impressed, too, like refinement, ride quality, smoothness, seat comfort and space. And that’s before the Rs 5.6 lakh price advantage it has on the Merc. 5 Series’ powertrain is not just more powerful but also smoother and more refined. But then, a price premium has never stopped people from thronging to the E-Class before, has it? And this time, the package has only gotten better. Where the Merc lags behind the BMW, it does so only by small margins, but where it gets ahead, it does so in style and delivers a tremendous feel-good factor. It can be found in the soft-close doors, the chauffeur package, the C-pillar that you hide behind, the pop-out door handles, the powered blinds, and yes, even the big touchscreen dashboard. Most of all, though, it’s in the way the back seat makes you feel like you’ve got your money’s worth, mainly down to the reclining backrest and extending squab, and also the grandeur it delivers with its wraparound ambient lighting. To sum up, BMW has put up a worthy challenge with this new 5 Series, and it’s worth your consideration. But it’s clear Mercedes has used eight years of the previous E-Class LWB dominance to study its customers and hone in on what matters most, and has thus delivered the better car.

But from there on, they do things differently. The 5 Series’ 110mm stretch is reflected in its massive doors that also have huge windows attached. The E-Class, as before, has Merc’s ‘Maybach’ doors, in which the quarter glass is fixed to the bodywork, and the door itself – soft-close, incidentally – is smaller. Each has its benefits and drawbacks; the BMW is easier to get in and out of (also helped by a higher seat) thanks to the wider opening, but the doors are a pain to open in tight spaces. The Mercedes doesn’t have this problem and also gives you some privacy as you can hide behind the C-pillar, but then you have to climb around this pillar and lower yourself into the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BMW 5 Series rear seat\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW-5-Series-rear-seats.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BMW 5 Series rear seat\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSofter seat cushioning, more room, but no recline in the BMW. Aftermarket sunblinds are poorly executed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou sink into the 5 Series’ seat thanks to its thicker, softer cushioning, both for the base and backrest, with plush outer-side bolstering that hugs you in place. They’ve chosen an up-tilted seat base angle for better support and a fixed backrest angle, rear set at 31 degrees to lay your spine into. The huge fixed glass roof – in combination with the large windows – makes the cabin feel airy. But, while there is a powered shade for the overhead glass, there are no window shades, nor one for the rear windscreen, which is a huge miss. As a quick fix, BMW has fit removable aftermarket shade panels, but their execution is basic. And should you have to remove them to enjoy the view outside or to open the window, they will just sit in the cabin with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class door\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-door-controls.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class door\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePowered seat and blind controls elevate E-Class’ rear cabin.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe E-Class’ seat cushioning might not be quite as soft as the 5’s, but on every other front, it knocks it out of the park. For one, it gets sunshades not only on both rear windows but on the rear windscreen, too, and all are powered and operable from either rear door. Then, there’s the band of ambient lighting that wraps around the rear seats, enveloping you in a glow of your chosen colour. But the real draw is that both seats have a powered recline (up to a generous 36 degrees), as well as a powered seat base extension for better thigh support. All this makes travelling in the E-Class feel like a business-class flight journey. You can even move the front passenger seat forward from back here. In the BMW, your driver has to do that for you via the touchscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BMW 5 Series sunroof\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW-5-Series-sunroof.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BMW 5 Series sunroof\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBMW’s big fixed glass gives better sense of airiness.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s clear then, while the 5 Series has a slight edge on seat softness and knee room, it’s the E-Class that really pampers you with a more special back-seat experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series features\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth back seats have the expected set of amenities – four-zone climate control, USB ports, multiple AC vents, cup holders and wireless chargers in the armrests. While both get sunroofs, the Mercedes, as ever, uses a split dual-pane arrangement where only the front glass opens. The BMW, instead, has one large fixed glass and ultimately is the one that makes the cabin feel airier. Though neither gets a rear entertainment system, the BMW does at least offer an accessory for mounting your own device onto the back of the front seat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class interior\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-interior.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class interior\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMerc ‘Superscreen’ with crisp displays is a big draw; third screen adds to the wow factor.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnusually, neither car offers heated or ventilated seats in the back, which feels like a miss when so much effort was expended in stretching them, and in both, all the fancy tech is at the front. For instance, while both cars offer tremendous-sounding, ultra-high-end audio systems, the Merc’sBurmester 4D system has exciters in the front seats that thump to the beat. The Bimmer has ventilated front seats, meanwhile. Similarly, both cars have selfie cameras up front, and while the BMW’s is mainly for the anti-theft system, the Mercedes’ lets the driver do video calls; so, why not in the back?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BMW 5 Series interior\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW-5-Series-interior.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BMW 5 Series interior\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBMW dash is clean but plain; helpful shortcut keys on centre console to access favourite functions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the front of the E-Class, you can’t miss the ‘Superscreen’, which effectively replaces the dash with screens under a glass pane, and though it means little for those at the back, its wow factor alone elevates it above the 5 Series. All three screens are crisp, vivid and well laid out, and even though the passenger-side screen feels redundant and gimmicky, it’s all part of the occasion. As ever, they are quick and smooth to operate, but the downside is the whole dashboard is easily covered in fingerprints, dust and reflections. As with many modern cars, most functions have now moved away from buttons and into the screen. But what’s particularly annoying is that the AC fan and temperature, unlike the C and S-Class, now require two steps to adjust instead of one. They’ve also given it digital AC vents that can auto adjust based on presets in – you guessed it – the touchscreen, but luckily, they can also be used manually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class instrument cluster\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-vs-BMW-5-Series-instrument-cluster.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class instrument cluster\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMerc dials classy, easier to read on the go.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe BMW’s AC vents are also technically digital in that you adjust them from electronic toggles placed lower in the dash, but the frustration here is that you can’t see what you’re adjusting. That’s because the vents are concealed behind the ‘interaction bar’, a contextual strip of crystalline LED lighting that flows across the dash and into the doors. Contextual because it changes colour with drive modes and emergency warnings and even has some touch controls built into it. Though the result is a clean, minimalist look, it feels quite ordinary next to the Merc. The 5 Series has a more conventional pair of screens, laid out in a curved array stacked on top of the dash. These are also good-looking and responsive, though we’d have liked a straightforward ‘dial’ option for the driver’s display; the futuristic aesthetic isn’t very intuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BMW 5 Series tablet mount\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW-5-Series-rear-seat-screen-mount.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BMW 5 Series mount\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e5 Series gets an optional tablet holder.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuality in both cars is excellent and a step up from that of their predecessors, and each offers a choice of upholstery colours – cream, black or brown in the Mercedes, and brown on grey or blue on black in the BMW.

Today, we’re driving the E 200 and the 530Li, which are both mild-hybrid 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engines. Mercedes offers a four-cylinder diesel and a spicier six-cylinder petrol, too, and while we’re still to see any other engines in the BMW, there is the hot 600hp i5 EV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack to the powertrains at hand, the Merc’s engine is now up to 204hp and 320Nm of torque, aided by a generous 23hp and 205Nm of electric boost. As with previous versions, it feels linear in its power delivery, with more than enough pep for sudden overtakes should you need them. There is a Sport mode, but it only makes a marginal difference. As before, the 9-speed gearbox can trip up and hunt for gears at crawling speeds, but in rare high-rev situations, and while very refined in isolation, engine noise creeps in sooner than in the 5 Series.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series performance\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-vs-BMW-5-Series-performance.png\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series performance\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe BMW also has much stronger performance; its engine produces a headier 258hp and 400Nm. And though its e-boost is considerably less, at just 11hp and 25Nm, you can never tell while driving it. In fact, apart from a Sport drive mode, the gearbox has its own sport mode, and then there’s the boost function, unlocked by holding down the left paddle shifter. With all these engaged, prepare for some very un-limo-like performance, the 530Li rocketing to 100kph in our tests in just 6.45 seconds – nearly 2 seconds quicker than the E 200. However, disarm all these modes, and it can do smooth and docile as well, with its ZF 8-speed gearbox handling matters better than the E’s 9-speed unit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe real surprise comes in ride quality. Neither car has air suspension or even adaptive dampers, but they both ride well, and despite their 3m-plus wheelbases, there’s enough ground clearance to get over most speed breakers without making contact. The E-Class feels a bit more tied down through corners and also at expressway speeds, but show it an uneven surface, and you’ll find considerable movement in the cabin, which spoils the otherwise serene experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BMW 5 Series rear ride\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW-5-Series-rear-wheel.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BMW 5 Series rear ride\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBMW’s ride has a softer edge over bumps.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an unexpected role reversal, it’s the 5 Series that has the better ride. Not only is it softer-edged over bumps, it’s more refined, too, letting in less road and tyre noise. And yet, it maintains its composure well at high speeds and is far more engaging through the corners, should you be driving yourself. The E-Class has a well-calibrated and accurate steering, but the 5’s is lighter at low speeds. It’s nowhere near as sharp to drive as its short-wheelbase predecessors, but for something this large, the long-wheelbase 5 Series’ breadth of dynamic ability is impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series design\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere has been much talk about the way both these cars look, good and bad, and their design philosophies couldn’t be more different. The 5 Series has some seriously cool details, like its large, tipped-forward (and illuminated) grille, peeled-back adaptive LED headlamps with blue accents, sharp creases, slim LED tail-lamps and sporty bumpers. The trouble is, they don’t come together well on the bulky, amorphous and disproportionate sedan, and the aggressive M Sport styling kit feels particularly out of place here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes E-Class headlight\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-E-Class-headlight.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes E-Class headlight\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e4cyl E-Class misses projector, adaptive lamps.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe perfect example is the wheels, which have a sporty design on their own, but thanks to their deep-dish look, chunky rubber and the vast metal surface they sit under, they look tiny.
