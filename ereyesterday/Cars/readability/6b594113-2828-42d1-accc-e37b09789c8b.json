Finished in Rosso Corsa with dual stripes over gray Alcantara and black cloth upholstery, the car has 19″ Scuderia alloy wheels, carbon-fiber exterior and interior accents, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a CD stereo, navigation, machined aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber-backed seats, and automatic climate control. This 430 Scuderia was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered in California at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a tool kit, service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Michigan title. The exterior is finished in Rosso Corsa with optional dual racing stripes, and additional details include xenon headlights with washers, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, dual exhaust outlets, and a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, front splitter, rear grille, and side mirrors. A paint imperfection is highlighted in the gallery. The 19″ Scuderia alloy wheels wear Pirelli tires that were mounted in May 2024. Braking is handled by red-finished brake calipers fitted over Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors. The brake fluid was flushed and the TPMS sensors were replaced in May 2024. The carbon-fiber-backed seats are upholstered in gray Alcantara with black cloth inserts and Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests. Carbon0fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include exposed diamond-plate aluminum flooring, an Alcantara-trimmed dashboard and rear bulkhead, a CD stereo, navigation, automatic climate control, machined aluminum pedals, and power windows and locks. The three-spoke steering wheel features an integrated LED shift light, an engine-start button, carbon-fiber shift paddles, and a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 1,200 miles. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter V8 is housed in a carbon-fiber-trimmed engine bay and features a flat-plane crankshaft, two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank, four valves per cylinder, carbon-fiber intakes, and an 11.9:1 compression ratio. Output was factory rated at 503 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque in Scuderia trim. Work in May 2024 included changing the oil, flushing the coolant, and replacing the transaxle fluid, F1 pump and accumulator, battery, air filters, fuel pumps, and spark plugs. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. The car last passed a California emissions inspection in May 2016. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
