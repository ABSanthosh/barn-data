  "text": "We have no idea what would motivate someone to modify a classic 8-Series like this December 22, 2024 at 19:12 by Brad Anderson This heavily altered 1990 BMW 850i is listed for nearly $20,000 by a UK dealership. The E31’s bodykit, black-yellow interior, and oversized wing clash with classic design. Its 296-hp 5.0-liter V12 engine is paired with a six-speed manual transmission. The first-generation 8-Series is one of BMW’s most timeless designs, a quintessential example of 1990s elegance with a shape that still looks brilliant to this day, despite being 34 years old. But this one? This manual 1990 BMW 850i Coupe has been hacked apart and reassembled into what can only be described as a misguided tuner experiment inspired by the era of 2 Fast 2 Furious gone horribly wrong. More: Manhart Makes The E31 BMW 8-Series Great Again With E39 M5 V8 Manual Swap The 5.0-liter V12-equipped German coupe has been listed for sale through Signature Motor Company in the UK with an asking price of £14,995 (~$18,900), which, if you ask us, is probably £14,994 too much. No details have been provided about the ownership history of this crime against Bavarian engineering, nor how or why it ended up in this state, but we suspect it’ll only appeal to a very small niche of buyers. When Bad Mods Happen to Good Cars Let’s start with the rear because… wow. From this angle, the car is barely recognizable as a BMW. A massive wing has been bolted on, and the taillights of the 8-Series have been swapped out for six, dollar-store-style circular lights. To make matters worse, the rear bumper juts out several inches awkwardly, as if it’s trying to escape, and houses quad tailpipes that look more like a last-minute afterthought than a design choice. Signature The nightmare continues with the wheels. The previous owner fitted the E31 with a set of bizarre chrome rims that don’t suit the design of the 8-Series in the slightest. The front of the car is slightly less over-the-top than the rear but does include a new hood and a bonkers bumper. A tacky yellow paint job adorned with childish graphics seals the deal. Thankfully, the pop-up headlights have managed to survive this questionable makeover. Watch: Moose Crashes BMW Workshop, Wages War On Restored E31 850i Sadly, the interior of the classic 8-Series is just as weird as the exterior. Most cabin surfaces have been retrimmed in black and yellow leather, again cheapening the car and no doubt limiting its appeal. There’s also an aftermarket steering wheel and shift knob. Here’s hoping that whoever purchases this 850i ditches all the weird add-ons and tries to return it to stock. If you’re curious (or daring enough) to explore this heavily modified relic further, you can find the full listing at Signature Motor Company here. Photos Signature Motor Company",
