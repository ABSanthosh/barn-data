  "text": "That works out to about $164 per horsepower for the most powerful and expensive production Corvette ever made 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Chevrolet reveals 2025 Corvette ZR1 pricing starting at $174,995 with destination included. That’s $61,200 more than the Corvette Z06, but the ZR1 has an extra 394 horsepower. Customer orders begin mid-February, though hefty dealership markups seem inevitable. The 2025 Corvette ZR1 is a triumph of American engineering, but one of the biggest mysteries was pricing. That piece of the puzzle has finally fallen into place and it’s a relative bargain. While most cars producing more than 1,000 hp (746 kW / 1,014 PS) cost more than half a million bucks, the Corvette ZR1 will begin at $174,995. The ZR1 Convertible is slightly more expensive at $184,995 but both prices include a $1,695 destination fee. First Look: 2025 Corvette ZR1 Is A 1,064 HP Hypercar With 215+ MPH Top Speed That’s significantly more than the Corvette Z06, which begins at $113,795 before factoring in the $3,000 gas guzzler tax. However, the ZR1 is in a different league as it has a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V8 developing 1,064 hp (793 kW / 1,079 PS) and 828 lb-ft (1,121 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to an upgraded eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, which enables the model to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in as little as 2.3 seconds. The model can also run the quarter mile in 9.6 seconds at 150 mph (241 km/h) when equipped with the ZTK Performance Package. Speaking of options, the ZR1 Carbon Fiber Aero Package costs $8,495 and includes underbody strakes as well as a massive rear wing. They’re joined by a hood spoiler and front dive planes. Customers can build on that by adding the aforementioned ZTK Performance Package for an extra $1,500. It adds stiffer springs, revised dampers, and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires. The base 1LZ trim comes equipped with a 12-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10-speaker Bose audio system, and eight-way power GT1 or Competition sport seats. They’re joined by a rear camera mirror. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops The coupe has a removable carbon fiber roof panel and an Engine Appearance Package with carbon fiber trim. They’re joined by an assortment of other carbon fiber components including a ground effects package and air intake surrounds. The convertible appears to eschew some of these touches, but it sports a retractable hardtop. The range-topping 3LZ starts at $185,995 and features fancier Napa leather GT2 or Competition sport seats with heating, ventilation, and power lumbar support. Buyers will also find a 14-speaker Bose audio system and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with carbon fiber trim. They’re joined by a mix of leather and sueded microfiber accents. Other highlights include a wireless smartphone charger, a memory package, and additional driver assistance systems such as side blind zone alert and rear cross traffic alert. 2025 Corvette ZR1 Pricing",
