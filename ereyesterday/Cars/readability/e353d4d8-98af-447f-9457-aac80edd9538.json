  "text": "The new optional accessory is compatible with any BMW model equipped with a tow hitch May 30, 2025 at 21:03 by Thanos Pappas The BMW Transport Box adds 340 liters or 12 cubic feet of extra storage at the rear. It mounts on the rear bike carrier that includes taillights and a license plate holder. The lockable box tilts open, allowing full access to the trunk even when installed. If you’ve ever tried squeezing a weekend’s worth of gear into a BMW coupe and come up short, you’re not alone. While BMW’s SUV and wagon options cover a lot of ground, sometimes you just need a little extra space, without switching to a whole different vehicle class. In addition to the usual roof-mounted carriers that come in a variety of sizes, BMW now offers another solution: a rear-mounted storage box that attaches to nearly any of its models, including hatchbacks, coupes, and sedans. It’s a new option designed for those moments when the trunk just won’t cut it. More: Who Knew A Super Wagon Could Outsell A Sedan In America This accessory, called the Transport Box, adds 340 liters (12 cubic feet) of enclosed cargo space and can handle up to 45 kg (99 pounds) of gear. It attaches via an internal locking mechanism to BMW’s Rear Bike Carrier, which includes built-in taillights and a license plate holder, so it stays road legal and functional. The Transport Box isn’t just a static add-on. It’s removable and lockable, and comes with a pair of small wheels so you can roll it around like oversized luggage. It also works with the bike carrier’s tilt function, which means you can still get into the trunk even when it’s mounted. Useful, right? For demonstration purposes, BMW shared a video featuring an i4 M50 xDrive Gran Coupe. However, the same accessory is compatible with any BMW model that’s equipped with a tow hitch. Unfortunately, this leaves the M2, M3, and M4 models out of the equation, although there are aftermarket solutions that can make them compatible. As for the bigger M5, it already offers a hitch as a factory option. BMW / YouTube Outside of the Z4 roadster, the smallest trunk in the BMW range belongs to the 1-Series. The five-door hatch holds 380 liters (13.4 cubic feet), so adding the Transport Box nearly doubles your total cargo capacity. Not bad for an add-on. More: The $20,000 BMW M Wheels You Probably Shouldn’t Touch With A Ten-Foot Pole Of course, BMW hasn’t ditched roof-mounted storage. You can still pick from three roof carrier box sizes: 320 liters (11.3 cubic feet), 420 liters (14.8 cubic feet), and 520 liters (18.4 cubic feet). These attach to roof bars and can be bundled as part of Travel Packs, depending on the model. BMW hasn’t revealed pricing for the new Transport Box just yet, but the Rear Bike Rack it mounts to will cost you €810 (about $920). If you’re looking at roof boxes instead, those range from $702 to $1,260 depending on size. They can also be bundled into Travel Packs for certain models, which include the required roof bars to get everything mounted and ready to roll.",
