The car is finished in black (L741, L700, A1) and features revised aerodynamic lower bodywork and an aftermarket RS-style rear wing. Additional features include power-adjustable mirrors, clear side markers, and dual exhaust outlets. The front bumper cover and right fender have been repainted per the seller dealer, who notes that there are blemishes on the roof and that rock chips on the hood and fenders have been touched up. The windshield was replaced in 2024. Photos of exterior imperfections are provided in the gallery. Staggered-width 18″ GT3 wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 235/40 up front and 295/30 out back. The car has been modified with Moton shocks, GMG suspension components, Girodisc brake rotors, Cup-style brake ducts, and StopTech braided brake lines. The cabin features fixed-back Euro-style bucket seats with pass-throughs along with a roll bar, a fire extinguisher, and Rennline pedals and track mats. Additional modifications include a Numeric shifter with Cup-specification cables as well as an AUTO-BLiP Intelligent Downshifts module. The car also has automatic climate control, a body-color center console, and a Porsche CDR23 stereo. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a central tachometer with an 8,200-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer and gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 76k miles. There are shift indicator lights on the steering column. The 3.6-liter M96/79 Mezger flat-six is said to be equipped with EVOMSit engine management software, an IPD intake plenum, Torque Solutions engine mounts, and welded coolant lines. Work performed in 2023 involved replacing the power steering tank, fuel level sending unit, ignition coils, and spark plugs, while the camshaft adjuster solenoid was replaced in 2024. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Multiple dyno sheets are provided in the gallery below in addition to parts invoices, modification documentation, and service records dating from 2008. The six-speed manual transaxle is noted to have been modified with revised gearing, a GT3 RS 4.0-specification clutch, and a Guard limited-slip differential. The car is also equipped with a Fabspeed exhaust system and catalytic converters. The Porsche Production Specifications certificate lists the factory colors, optional equipment, and a production completion date in November 2004. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The Pennsylvania title carries a “Classic” brand. Filed under: 996 You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
