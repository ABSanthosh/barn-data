  "description": "The new Vida VX2 is the all-important family scooter that joins the existing V2 in the company’s electric line up. It packs a more widely-acceptable look, fewer features and a unique pricing strategy with BaaS as an option, but crucially, the fundamentals are largely the same as the V2. Hero Vida VX2 design and quality - 8/10 A clean, appealing design in a choice of seven colours What makes the Vida VX2 stand out from its sibling is its new design and I think Hero has created a rather likeable looking thing. The signature Vida headlamp along with the upper cowl that houses the indicators gives it a sense of identity but without becoming polarising like the Vida V2. The side and rear panels are more conventional, yet cleanly designed and it culminates in a rear section which is unlikely to create any strong opinions, either positive or negative. The VX2 has a clean design and quality has seen a step up as well. The VX2 is based on an updated version of the same chassis as the V2, with some changes made towards weight reduction. It packs fewer body panels, which further assists with reducing the weight to 115kg; around a 9 kilo weight saving over the equivalent V2 Plus.  Weight and dimensionsWeight and dimensionsKerb weight115kgSeat height777mmWheelbase1301mmBoot space 27.2 litres (Plus) / 33 litres (Go)Front storage space5 litres Another advantage of fewer body panels is that Hero has improved the overall finish quality with fewer uneven panel gaps or unsightly rough plastics. There’s new switchgear which looks and feels better than before and the VX2 has the best finish we’ve seen on a Hero scooter to date - hopefully a trend that will continue. There is still ground for improvement, particularly in areas like the fiddly lock for the removable batteries, but overall finish levels are no longer an area of concern. Hero Vida VX2 range and charging - 8//10 Unique removable batteries with multiple charging options Being based on the same platform as the V2, the Vida VX2 also gets the same removable batteries - two (3.4kWh total) in the Plus variant seen here and one (2.2kWh) in the base Vida VX2 Go variant. These batteries can be charged directly inside the scooter or they can be removed and charged indoors. The VX2 can also be charged at the Ather Grid fast charging network of which there are now over 4000 chargers across the country.  The Plus variant has 2 removable batteries, while the Go has only one. Battery and rangeVida VX2Battery capacity3.4kWhClaimed IDC range 142kmClaimed real world range Eco Mode100kmClaimed real world range Ride Mode75kmClaimed real world range Sports Mode60kmCharger wattage580WCharge time (0-100%)5hr39min The scooter is bundled with a 580 watt charger with a 5A three-pin plug that means you don’t need a 15A outlet. Hero claims charging times comparable to a 650 watt charger (0-100%in 5hr 39min) thanks to their charger being able to provide a more steady output.  Even with two removable batteries under the seat, the company has managed to liberate 27.2-litres of storage space. My helmet could just about fit in but it was slightly too tall for the seat to fully close. A smaller full-face or an open face helmet should easily fit. Going for the VX2 Go with its single battery increases boot space to 33 litres. The Plus has a slightly smaller boot than the Go. IDC range for the Plus is 142km, but Hero claims a real world range of 100km in Eco mode. Switching to Ride or Sport modes reduce that to a claimed 75km and 65km respectively.  Hero Vida VX2 motor and performance - 8/10 Uses the same motor and specs as the Vida V2 The VX2 runs a swingarm mounted PMSM electric motor that produces the same 6kW peak and 3.9kW continuous power as the Vida V2 and it has the same 25Nm of torque. Top speed is capped at an indicated 80kph for the VX2 Plus (70kph for the Go). Ride mode restricts the speed to 70kph and Eco to just 45kph, which is too low for life in the city. It is not very sporty in the way it accelerates, but the overall performance is more than enough for a city runabout. However, there’s a neat work around in the form of Boost mode, which effectively unlocks the full performance regardless of which mode you are in when you twist the accelerator wide open. This was a valuable feature, although you can deactivate it in case you are trying to maximise range.

Where it impresses is in just how polished and refined the riding experience is with perfectly judged accelerator response and almost no regen braking on a closed throttle, which makes for a delightfully smooth riding experience.  Hero says the advantage of its setup is that punctures can be easily repaired by a roadside mechanic. You can reverse twist the accelerator for regen braking, but it isn’t very strong even when you do this and it would have been nice to have adjustable regen. As for sound, there is a clearly audible electric whine and while it's not as loud as an Ather, it's also not as silent as the TVS iQube’s hub motor either.  However, Hero says that the advantage of their set-up is that punctures can be easily repaired by any road side mechanic.  Hero Vida VX2 comfort and handling - 8/10 Comfortable and more than capable enough The VX2’s smooth and easy going performance is paired with a chassis that has just the same qualities. The good impressions begin with how you sit on it thanks to a wide, spacious and comfy seat. Short riders will appreciate the low 777mm seat height but even tall folks will find a decent amount of comfort without too much of an issue of the handlebar fowling with the knees.                                         Even taller riders will comfortably fit on the VX2.  Suspension comfort seems to be nicely balanced and the scooter does a decent job of absorbing bumps and potholes. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, there’s a good amount of stability and the scooter feels well-controlled when taking turns. This applies to both low speed tight u-turns (the turning radius is tight) as well as leaning the scooter over in corners at a higher pace.  The display works well for the most part but could stand to be brighter. The Vida VX2 Plus gets a 190mm front disc and braking performance is perfectly judged for a scooter of this type - powerful enough, but not aggressive. From an overall dynamics perspective, this is not a sharp and sporty scooter, but it is very well behaved, more than capable enough and pleasant to ride. Hero Vida VX2 features and BaaS - 9/10 It’s well equipped, and BaaS pricing is a USP The feature that you will interact with most often is the 4.3-inch TFT display, which is simpler than the 7-inch touchscreen on the V2, but still gets the job done well. The layout and graphics are quite neat and it's reasonably straightforward to control this screen using the switchgear although you need to be quite precise with the 5-way joystick. Some people might want a higher max-brightness setting and the animations between menus could be a touch quicker, but neither is a serious concern. There’s also a reverse mode and a number of connectivity features that can be accessed via the mobile app.  The switchgear and 5-way joystick feel tactile. Hero’s USP is its unique BaaS pricing which massively reduces the buy-in cost. Under the BaaS scheme and with the PM E-Drive subsidy and an introductory offer in place, the VX2 Go costs just Rs 44,990 while the Plus is at Rs 54,990. The reason they are so affordable is because Hero is essentially financing the batteries separately. The company offers various schemes from a duration of 2-5 years and the costs are based on a minimum monthly running that differs with each plan. Once the loan period is over, the scooter is completely yours, including the battery. Hero Vida VX2 price and verdict - 8/10 Practical and sorted family EV at a tempting price When you work out the math, the BaaS scheme will end up being a little more expensive than buying outright - which you can also do at introductory prices of Rs 84,990 and Rs 99,990  for the Go and Plus respectively. It's easy to look at this as just a loan on the batteries, but it also comes with benefits like an extended 5 year warranty/50,000km on the battery, a three year assured buyback and free public fast charging for the duration of the selected BaaS scheme.  Overall, the BaaS scheme will end up being a little more expensive than buying it outright. Effectively, Hero is making it easier for customers to make the initial purchase with a lower downpayment and the company says that this is the big hurdle in the entry level two wheeler market. While the BaaS scheme is eye-catching, it is not the main reason behind the Vida VX2’s appeal. Even without it, this is a good looking, practical, and nice-to-ride family EV at a tempting price. The VX2 is something you should seriously consider if you have a similarly priced Ather Rizta, Bajaj Chetak or TVS iQube on your mind.  Also See: Hero Vida VX2 video review",
