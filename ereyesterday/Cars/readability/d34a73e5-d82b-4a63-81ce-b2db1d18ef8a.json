The automaker apparently realizes its flub, and is expected to fire the ad agency responsible for the rebrand, but the damage may have been done. Jag took heat from every corner of the media and car enthusiast worlds over its change, which saw it shift to electric vehicles and abandon any sense of traditional auto design. The vehicles it showed were comically overdone and painted in Easter Egg pastel colors, leading many to note that the automaker had left its core audience behind. Elon Musk even got in on the action, asking Jaguar on X, ‘Do you sell cars?” British MP Nigel Farage went as far as saying the rebrand was a poor move, saying Jaguar deserved to go bankrupt over the campaign. Jaguar refused to comment on the reports, but the automaker will be replacing its current ad partner, Accenture Song, once the contract runs out in mid-2026. As for the rebrand, it’s unclear where Jaguar goes from here. It’s stopped almost all vehicle production activities as it targets a shift to an all-electric lineup, but the company has already invested in the new designs, creating concept cars and other ads to go with the reveal.[Images: Jaguar]Become a TTAC insider.
