Equipment includes the Carbon Fiber Primary Interior Components package, the Exterior Carbon Fiber Pack 1, a vehicle-lift system, an active rear spoiler, carbon-ceramic brakes, dihedral soft close doors, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and Bluetooth connectivity. Purchased by the current owner in 2024, this 720S is offered in Colorado with a clean Carfax report and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The 720S utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded-aluminum subframe, and this example is finished in Glacier White. The Exterior Carbon Fiber Pack 1 includes carbon-fiber hood air intakes, quarter panel air intakes, and door mirror casings. Additional features include engine bay ambient lighting, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and an active rear spoiler with an air brake. Paint protection film has been applied to the front of the car. The  19″ and 20″ Stealth-finished super-lightweight 10-spoke wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car rides on a three-mode adaptive suspension that features double wishbones at all four corners, and a vehicle-lift system was equipped from the factory. Stopping power is provided by red-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The front suspension accumulators were replaced and the brake fluid as changed in July 2024. The heated power-adjustable bucket seats are upholstered in Arizona Tan luxury leather that extends to the dashboard. Features include the Carbon Fiber Primary Interior Components package, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and Bluetooth connectivity. The steering wheel features carbon-fiber trim and paddle shifters. Instrumentation consists of a folding LCD screen that displays a speedometer, tachometer, trip functions, and vehicle information. The digital odometer indicates 7k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 utilizes a flat-plane crankshaft as well as dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to McLaren Greenwich in Stamford, Connecticut, factory equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $334,665.
