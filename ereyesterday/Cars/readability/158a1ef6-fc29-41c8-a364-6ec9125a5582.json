  "text": "The latest aspiring Tesla Model Y rival from China boasts 577 hp, a 300-mile range, and a premium cabin February 16, 2025 at 19:44 by Thanos Pappas The Seres 5 is a compact electric crossover from China, now available in Europe. With 577 hp, the top-spec model sprints from 0 to 62 mph in just 4.2 seconds. It offers a competitive 482 km (300-mile) range, rivaling the Tesla Model Y. Chinese automakers have their eyes firmly set on Europe, aiming to grab market share from established brands with feature-packed, competitively priced EVs, despite the EU’s newly imposed import tariffs. One of the latest contenders in this growing battle is Seres, formerly known as SF Motors, which introduced its answer to the Tesla Model Y in Europe last year. We wanted to see how it measures up against the competition, so we took the Seres 5 press car for a drive. More: Ford Chief Says China Leads US By 10 Years In EV Batteries, Needs Their IP The Seres 5 originally debuted in China in 2019 as the SF5, a project developed with Huawei’s help. In 2023, a heavily updated version called the Aito M5 launched, offering both PHEV and BEV variants. While the Chinese-market Seres 5 has since adopted these upgrades, the global-spec model we’re driving sticks with the original design, featuring its distinctive curved daytime running lights. Targeting Tesla’s Turf The Seres 5 made its European debut at the 2023 Munich Auto Show and gradually rolled out across the continent throughout 2024. Measuring 4,710 mm (185 inches) in length, it takes on competitors like the VW ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and, of course, the ever-dominant Tesla Model Y. Inside, the cabin leans toward premium territory, with a 15.6-inch dashboard display, fine leather upholstery, and wood inserts. The seats come packed with comfort features, offering heating, ventilation, and even a massage function. Photos: Thanos Pappas for CarScoops Performance and Range The version we’re testing is the all-electric, all-wheel-drive variant, as the PHEV has yet to reach Europe. Its dual-motor setup delivers a solid 577 hp (430 kW / 585 PS) and 940 Nm (693 lb-ft) of torque, launching it from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 4.2 seconds. Power comes from an 80 kWh battery pack, providing a WLTP-rated range of up to 482 km (300 miles) per charge. In Greece, where we’re testing it, the Seres 5 is available in a single full-spec trim, priced at €57,500 ($60,400) including local EV subsidies. For comparison, the German-made, pre-facelift Tesla Model Y Performance costs €57,990, while the upcoming 2026 Model Y Launch Edition is priced at €60,990.

Meanwhile, the only Honda CR-V available, the e:HEV hybrid, is priced from €49,900 ($52,400). We’ll be driving the Seres 5 both in the city and on the open road over the next few days. Got questions? Drop them below in the comments section, and we’ll cover as many as possible in the full review. Thanks to Serres Hellas for providing the Seres 5 press car. Seres 5 (Europe) Seres 5 (China)",
