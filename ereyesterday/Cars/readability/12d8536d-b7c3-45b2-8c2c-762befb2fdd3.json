  "description": "Mahindra has begun a teaser campaign dubbed the freedom_nu in the lead-up to its annual Independence Day event, when it will unveil a ‘new platform vision’. Four new concept SUVs have been teased, and the campaign also carries both Mahindra’s EV and ICE Twin Peaks logos, which could be a nod to the platform’s multi-fuel capabilities. Mahindra has previously spoken about developing a house of brands, and each of these upcoming concepts is expected to add to a family of models going forward. Four names have been revealed – Vision T, Vision S, Vision X and Vision SXT – and a recurring theme across all four teasers is a top-angle view of the bonnet. Each of these suffixes, along with its respective design details, hints at the family of SUVs it’ll belong to. Let’s explore them in a little more detail. Mahindra Vision T This was the first teaser in the campaign, and the ‘T’ in the name likely points to the fact that it belongs to the Thar family. In fact, a close look at the top shot reveals details like a square bonnet, pronounced wheel arches, visible bonnet latches and even all-terrain tyres, seemingly hinting at an evolution of the Thar.e concept that the brand had showcased in South Africa back in 2023. This could perhaps be a closer to production version of the Thar.e concept. Also See: Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX image gallery Mahindra Vision S Up next is the Vision S, with the S in the name likely hinting at the Scorpio family. Like the Vision T, this too has a muscular demeanour with an upright nose and flared-out wheel arches, but the bonnet is more flattish, and it also appears to have bonnet scoops toward the edges. The Scorpio family currently comprises the N and the Classic, and this could be a third model in the family. Mahindra Vision SXT It’s unclear what exactly the Vision SXT will preview, but the details seen in the teaser suggest that it is related to the Vision T, which means it could be yet another derivative of the Thar family. It has a very similar bonnet with latches at either edge, a protruding bumper and flared wheel arches. It could even be a new body style, perhaps a pickup truck based on the Thar. Mahindra is not a complete stranger to pickups, having showcased the Global Pik Up concept in 2023.   Mahindra Vision X Last to arrive was the Vision X teaser, which is expected to preview a concept from the XUV family. This one doesn’t look as rugged as the above three, but instead features very stylistic and athletic lines on the bonnet, likely hinting at a more premium and urban positioning. In fact, this could be the long-awaited XEV 7e, which will be a more traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV. The XEV 7e has even been spied on test on several occasions with the top hat of an XUV700 and EV-specific updates and interior bits from the XEV 9e. A lot is still up in the air, and we will only have more details on August 15, when Mahindra officially takes the wraps off the concepts. But one thing is certain: Mahindra’s upcoming Independence Day gala doesn’t seem any less extravagant than any of the previous iterations. Stay tuned for more.
