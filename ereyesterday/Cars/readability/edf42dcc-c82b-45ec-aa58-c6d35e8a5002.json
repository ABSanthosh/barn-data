  "description": "Royal Enfield has substantially increased the price of its cross-spoke wheels offered as an accessory for the Himalayan 450. The price has risen from Rs 12,424 to Rs 40,645. It is no longer as affordable for existing Himalayan buyers, but will continue to be offered at the same price for those who bundle it with their Himalayan purchase. First-time Himalayan 450 buyers can still get the cross-spoke wheels for Rs 11,000 if bundled with the bike. Earlier, it was priced at Rs 12,424 for existing owners Royal Enfield Himalayan 450’s cross-spoke wheel colours It is available in three different colours The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is one of the few affordable adventure tourers offered with cross-spoke wheels. At launch, these wheels received immense appreciation for their pricing. They were introduced at just Rs 12,424 for existing Himalayan owners looking to upgrade from the stock tubed wheel setup to cross-spoke wheels. Royal Enfield had managed to price them so competitively that they even undercut the cost of most tubeless-conversion kits. However, Royal Enfield has now substantially increased the price. Previously priced at Rs 12,424, the cross-spoke wheels now cost Rs 40,645. That said, this revised pricing appears to apply only to existing owners purchasing the wheels as an accessory. First-time buyers who bundle the cross-spoke wheels with their new Himalayan purchase can still avail them at a significantly lower price of Rs 11,000. These cross-spoke wheels are available in three colours—black, black olive, and gold—to better match the variants, with no price difference between them. Given this steep price hike, many existing Himalayan owners who had planned to upgrade to the tubeless cross-spoke setup may now reconsider. The Himalayan 450 is priced between Rs 2.85 lakh and Rs 2.98 lakh (ex-showroom) and is powered by a 452cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine producing 40hp and 40Nm. It comes mated to a six-speed gearbox. Also see: KTM 390 Adventure X to get cruise control and updated electronics soon",
