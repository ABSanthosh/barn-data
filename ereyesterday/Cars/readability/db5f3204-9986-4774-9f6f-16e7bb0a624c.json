  "description": "Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the third generation of the CLA Shooting Brake, making it the very first all-electric estate from the German luxury carmaker. Aside from the paradigm shift in the powertrain department, the new CLA Shooting Brake is larger than its predecessor in every way, and packs in a lot more tech too. 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets connected headlights and tail-lamps, backlit grille cover Cabin is more spacious than CLA sedan; gets triple screens and huge panoramic glass roof 85kWh battery is standard; up to 354hp and 761km of claimed range 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake exterior design Outsizes previous-gen model. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake measures 4,723mm in length, 1,855mm in width, and 1,469mm in height – 35mm longer, 25mm wider, and 27mm taller than the outgoing model. Its 2,790mm wheelbase is also up 61mm over the previous CLA Shooting Brake. Looks identical to CLA sedan up to the B-pillar. Expectedly, the overall design of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake largely mirrors that of the new-gen CLA sedan, which was revealed earlier this year. Up front, there’s a connected LED headlight setup with tri-star DRL signatures, and the grille underneath houses the Mercedes-Benz insignia. Depending on the variant, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets either a conventional grille or a closed-off panel with 142 illuminated stars embedded in it. Coming to the side, you get retractable door handles and aero-optimised alloy wheels, and the rounded rear section includes connected LED tail-lamps with tri-star signatures, a roof spoiler with an integrated stop lamp, and a smooth gloss black bumper. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake interior and features Roomier on the inside. Much like the exterior, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s cabin layout is virtually identical to its sedan counterpart. However, there's 26mm more headroom for second-row occupants, and the 455-litre boot (expandable up to 1,290 litres) is 50 litres more voluminous. Moreover, larger rear door apertures have made second row access easier. Trio of screens take prominence on dashboard. A triple-screen setup – comprising a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, a 14-inch central infotainment system, and an optional 14-inch passenger display – spans the width of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s dashboard. The passenger screen allows you to stream movies/TV shows and play games, and buyers who don’t opt for it get a panel with illuminated star-pattern graphics. Illuminated and dimmable panoramic glass roof. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake also features a massive panoramic glass roof that extends from the windshield to the rear spoiler. This dimmable unit is made with heat-insulating laminated safety glass with an infrared-reflecting and low-emissivity coating, which prevents the cabin from excessively warming up during the summers and reducing heat loss during the winters. The glass surface is also embedded with 158 illuminated stars, colour-matched with the rest of the ambient lighting. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake battery and range Both variants use an 85kWh NMC battery. Initially, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake will be sold with electric powertrains only. The entry-level 250+ variant gets an 85kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery pack coupled to a single rear-mounted motor, developing 272hp and 335Nm, while the stronger 350 4Matic variants throw in an extra motor on the front axle for four-wheel-drive capability, bumping the output up to 354hp and 515Nm. Up to 761km of range. On a single charge, the 250+ variant of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake achieves a WLTP-claimed range of 761km and the 350 4Matic variant delivers a range of 730km – 31km and 40km down, respectively, from the equivalent variants of the CLA electric sedan. Thanks to Mercedes-Benz’s 800V architecture, the CLA Shooting Brake can yield a 310km range in just 10 minutes when charging from a 320kW DC source. AC charging can be carried out at up to 22kW. 0-100kph in as little as 5 seconds. In terms of performance, the CLA 250+ Shooting Brake can complete the 0-100kph sprint in a claimed 6.8 seconds, while the dual-motor 350 4Matic variant achieves the same in 5 seconds dead. Both models have a top speed of 210kph. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake launch details CLA sedan coming to India. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake is set to launch in Europe in March 2026. An India launch of the estate is unlikely given that this body style doesn’t really resonate with customers here. However, the CLA sedan is headed here, and is expected to launch by the end of 2025.
