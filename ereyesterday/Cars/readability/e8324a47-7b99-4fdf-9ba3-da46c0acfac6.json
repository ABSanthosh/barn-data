  "text": "Despite lacking an EV option, Mazda’s U.S. sales continue to soar, setting the brand up for a record year November 5, 2024 at 19:38 by Brad Anderson Mazda’s October sales rose 58.7%, driven by strong growth across every model in its lineup. From the beginning of 2024, Mazda has shifted 350,759 vehicles, an 18.5% increase from last year. The CX-5 topped sales this year, with 10,166 units sold in October alone across the country. Mazda sales continue to soar across the United States, as demand for each and every model in its range has jumped significantly this year. October was another record-breaking month for the brand, with no signs of a slowdown in sight. In October alone, Mazda moved 37,307 vehicles in the U.S. Although there were two extra selling days this month compared to last year, that doesn’t account for the full scope of the 58.7% leap over October 2023, when it sold 23,504 units. Mazda’s year-to-date numbers are equally impressive, with 350,759 vehicles sold so far—an 18.5% jump from the 296,121 units moved in the same period last year. Read: Mazda Set For US Sales Record In 2024 Despite Not Having A Single EV What’s particularly interesting about Mazda’s sales success in 2024 is that it cannot be attributed to the burgeoning demand for one or two models. Instead, sales of all of the automaker’s models have jumped considerably this year. Even the brand’s smaller players, like the Mazda3 Sedan and Hatchback, saw sales shoot up by 58.3%, with 3,490 units sold in October. The CX-5 remains Mazda’s top performer, selling 10,166 units last month—a 27.7% increase from the 7,963 sold a year prior. Taking second place was the CX-50, with 7,771 vehicles delivered. This is a mind-blowing 145.3% increase over the 3,168 sold in October 2023. Rounding out the podium as Mazda’s third best-selling model is the CX-30, with 7,216 units, marking a 22.1% increase from last year. Mazda US Sales Demand for the brand’s flagship CX-90 has also increased by 40.7%, with 5,236 examples registered last month. Mazda also recently launched the CX-70 and sold 2,517 in October. Even the aging MX-5 Miata is holding its own, with sales up 71.6% to 911 units, proving that the roadster’s charm hasn’t faded with time. While all Mazda models performed well in October, there are two that have seen a drop in sales through the first ten months of the year. For example, 17.4% fewer MX-5s have been sold from the beginning of the year, while sales of the CX-5 have declined 7.8% to 114,221 units.",
