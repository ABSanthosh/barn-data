  "text": "Published:  December 16th, 2024 People like John Phillips and Brock Yates and Peter Egan and others. I grew up in the '80s and '90s, when the four buff books -- Car and Driver, Road \u0026 Track, Automobile, and Motor Trend -- ruled the roost. Yes, there were other, smaller titles and niche magazines (Four Wheeler and Off Road often found their way into my home), but those were the four that dominated. As a young enthusiast I started off with MT and then graduated to R\u0026T before shifting over to C/D when I got old enough to understand some of the pop-cultures references -- and when I was old enough for the irreverence to speak to me.I bring all this up to say that back in the day, you knew the byline of just about every writer, not just those who had head shots and monthly columns. I also, of course, knew of the local auto writers -- Jim Mateja and Dan Jedlicka in my neck of the woods -- before getting to know them later when I started doing this job.Between the columnists and certain car reviewers, there were certain folks I really wanted to read each month. I suspect some of you had the same experience. If not with print, then with journalists who worked in digital media once content shifted online. Some of those folks even worked for this very Web site.So, who was it for you? Who were you looking forward to reading each month when your favorite print mag hit your mailbox or the local bookstore or newsstand? Or when you logged on to the Internet at work in order to waste your company's time?You know what to do. Sound off below.[Image: PrinceOfLove/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published December 16th, 2024 6:30 PM Comments Join the conversation Tom McCahill- Mechanics Illustrated: about a Buick: \"Takes corners like a fat lady with bad ankles.\" He took his auto testing seriously, which might not always come through some of the memorable lines:McCahill wrote in Mechanix Illustrated monthly from something like 1947 up into the mid 1960's at least. Let's see... that must be about 200 road test articles. The vendio site has 19 of them apparently for about $2 a pop.Here are a few free McCahill quotes that I picked up somewhere. Wish I had the entire collection, and if anyone ever puts together a book, let me know.On the 1955 Ford V8:\"The '55 Ford has digaway boff by the treeload.\"On the 1962 Plymouth:\" It was raining like tears in a onion cannery when I did my test.......I don't know of a car in its class that can top Plymouth. It offers the best roadability in its class, and this, tied up with good brakes makes it just about the safest. .........the slightly teutonic looks of the Valiant, stand out like a hip flask in a bikini.\"On early 30's Classic Imperials:\"These long-hooded brutes had more sex-appeal than a boatload of starlets anchored off Alcatraz.\"On the Jeep CJ3:\"The standard seats are rumored to be made of foam rubber. For my dough, some stew blew the foam from a short beer between some plastic -- and that was that. Aside from their lack of comfort, they are cut so that with a well-planned wheel spin you could toss Gramp right over a vegetable cart, and into a saloon on one bounce.\"On the 1960 Dodge Dart Phoenix:\"When equipped with the optional D-500 engine, displacing 383 cubic inches with 2 four barrel carburetors, it should be able to chew around a race course with enough stuff to turn the humidity into steam.......... (and) make a helluva ridge-runner for the moonshine boys.\"On the 1959 Dodge:\"The front end is as new as next February's cold.\"On the 1959 Plymouth:\"Plymouth for 1959 is the best car of the low priced three in our bald-headed opinion, and we've tested all of them.\"On the 1959 Imperial:\"This doll was as loaded as an opium peddler during a tong war. Swivel seats make it as easy to get into as a floating crap game with fresh money. On the 31 degree banked turns the big Imp hung in there like oil going through a hose.\"On the 1966 Dodge Coronet Hemi:\"WThis family sized rig has all the belt of a 2 mile swim in a whiskey vat. When you put your foot through the firewall make sure your teeth are well anchored. It is as furry as a mink farm and as snarly as a bengal tiger in a butcher shop.\"On the 1965 Aston Martin DB5:\"Built to do 150 mph, (the DB5's) are real beasts and about as gentle around town as galloping hiccups at a prayer meeting. This Aston is as docile as a puppy with a full tummy in traffic but a snarler when you give it a whip.\"On the 1957 Imperial:\"It will get down the pike like a vaselined arrow, and with no more effort than skipping off a cliff.\"On a 1963 Mercury 427:\"It has more hair on its chest than a middle-aged yak\"On the 1962 Chrysler 300:\"I had the car for over a month, and had as many adventures with it as a Siberian trapper would have in Miami Beach. The new 300 is the old Windsor, sexed up and poured into a sport suit. When you slide behind the wheel you get the feeling that this is a big compact, and not an oversized barge as awkward to handle as wearing moose antlers in a telephone booth. A functional car that gives top performance with lots of room for beaucoup stuff, which might include wine, weazels or women.\"On the 1959 Chevy Impala:\"The rear deck treatment is pure Louis Armstrong: gone, man, gone!\" Eliyahu, Thanks for the comment and excerpts. I was a big fan of Tom McCahill as a teenager and a 1960 Dodge Dart Phoenix was my first car (but not with the big engine). Loved his reviews of all the cars from the late 50's and early 60's. Ah, Satch...yeah, when Autoweek was Autoweek, not Autoweak.",

The new 300 is the old Windsor, sexed up and poured into a sport suit. When you slide behind the wheel you get the feeling that this is a big compact, and not an oversized barge as awkward to handle as wearing moose antlers in a telephone booth. A functional car that gives top performance with lots of room for beaucoup stuff, which might include wine, weazels or women.\u0026#34;On the 1959 Chevy Impala:\u0026#34;The rear deck treatment is pure Louis Armstrong: gone, man, gone!\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\n    \n            \n    \n    \n            \n        \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e                \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli id=\"cid-10517152\" data-c_writer_id=\"65688446\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv data-comment-id=\"10517152\" data-comment-type=\"reply\" data-comment-writer=\"65688446\" data-comment-writer-name=\"Marty S\" data-has-replies=\"\"\u003e\n            \n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n            \n            \u003cspan\u003eEliyahu, Thanks for the comment and excerpts.  I was a big fan of Tom McCahill as a teenager and a 1960 Dodge Dart Phoenix was my first car (but not with the big engine).
