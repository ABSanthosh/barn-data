  "text": "The very last 911 SC/RS ever built is a true rally racer that also happens to be street-legal 4 hours ago by Stephen Rivers The Porsche Type 954 is one of just 21 units ever built and is now available for purchase. Also known as the 911 SC RS, it’s a real street-legal race car with competition heritage. Bidding begins at over $3 million, making it a truly exclusive collector’s item. It’s relatively tough to stump hardcore Porschephiles, but the Type 954 is one car that can do it. Consider this car one of the most hardcore 911 variants to ever leave the Porsche factory in Stuttgart. Now, it can be yours so long as you’re okay parting with some $3,000,000. Up for sale through Broad Arrow Auctions, this 1984 Porsche 911 SC/RS Gruppe B is sometimes called the “Evolutionsserie.” The automaker crafted this car and twenty others just like it specifically to go racing. In fact, it went racing and today is still eligible for road use. More: 2023 Porsche Dakar Is The Slowest 911 Since The ’80s, But We Want One So Badly Think of this as sort of a 911 SC but for World Rally Group B racing. As such, it sports the body of a 911 Turbo. Aluminum makes up the doors, the fenders, and the hood. Lolipop seats from the 935 keep the occupants in place and 917-derived brakes slow this beast. That’s good since the engine is evidently capable of making 270 horsepower (201 kW) and this whole car weighs just 2,160 pounds (980 kg). Notably, this is the very last SC/RS ever built. It raced at the WRC Tour de Course in 1984 and finished 14th, the highest of all Porsches in competition there. Broad Arrow points out that due to this cars racing provenance and street-legal eligibility, it puts it in excellent company. The 904 Carerra GTS and 911 R both share that same dual nature. Interestingly, this same car went up for auction back in May on Bring A Trailer. Bidding rose to $756,000 before the auction ended unceremoniously. Will it actually crest over the six-figure mark and go for anything close to the guidance Broad Arrow suggests? We’ll all have to tune in when it goes over the block on October 12 in Chattanooga to find out. Image Credit: Broad Arrow Auctions",
