  "description": "It’s been a fairly eventful week for the automotive industry, from new details on two upcoming electric MPVs and yet another recipient of Bharat NCAP’s 5-star rating, to lots of motion in the electric scooter space. We glean over the highlights of the past seven days. Details on upcoming car launches MG M9 MG has revealed the full specs and features of its upcoming all-electric MPV, the M9. Bookings are already open for Rs 51,000, and prices for the M9 are expected to land around Rs 65 lakh (ex-showroom). Powered by a 90kWh battery with a 245hp front-axle motor, the M9’s range is a claimed 548km, and the MPV is larger than rivals like the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. As for features, the M9 comes with massaging second-row captain seats, Level 2 ADAS, a 12.23-inch infotainment touchscreen, 7-inch digital driver’s display, single-pane sunroof, JBL sound system, and more. Kia Carens Clavis EV The Kia Carens Clavis EV has finally been unveiled ahead of its launch on July 15. The electric MPV claims a 490km range and features subtle EV-specific design tweaks over the ICE-powered Carens Clavis, with battery pack options expected to be shared with the Hyundai Creta Electric. Interior updates for the Carens Clavis EV include a floating centre console and a refreshed colour scheme, with twin 12.3-inch screens taking prominence. New electric scooter launches TVS iQube 3.1 TVS added a new 3.1kWh variant to the iQube range at Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom, Bengaluru). It offers a 123km claimed range, colour TFT display, and new features like hill-hold assist. The new 3.1kWh version fits neatly between the 2.2kWh and 3.5kWh variants in the iQube lineup. Ather Rizta S 3.7kWh Ather has launched a new 3.7kWh variant of the Rizta S at Rs 1.38 lakh. It offers an extended 159km range, matching the top-spec Z trim’s battery but with a pared-back feature list. Essentials like the 7-inch DeepView LCD, navigation, and FallSafe remain standard on the new Rizta S variant. Hero Vida VX2 Electric Scooter Hero MotoCorp has launched the Vida VX2 electric scooter at a starting price of Rs 59,490 (with Battery-as-a-Subscription). It is available in two variants with 2.2kWh and 3.4kWh batteries, offering IDC ranges of 92km and 142km, respectively. Both versions support fast charging and feature connectivity-enabled 4.3-inch displays. Government policy and safety regulation updates Delhi reverses fuel ban on 'end of life' vehicles After announcing a ban on fuel sales to end-of-life vehicles (petrol vehicles over 15 years old and diesel vehicles over 10 years old) on July 1, the Delhi government has now put the decision on hold due to public backlash and operational challenges regarding the automated number plate reader (ANPR) cameras installed at fuel stations. The ban may return in a few months' time once ANPR systems are fully implemented at fuel stations across Delhi-NCR to better detect end-of-life vehicles. Toyota Innova Hycross scores 5-star BNCAP rating The Toyota Innova Hycross has become the first Toyota, first MPV, and first hybrid vehicle to secure a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP crash tests. It scored 30.47/32 in adult occupant protection and 45/49 in child occupant protection, and the Innova Hycross' 5-star rating applies to the MPV's entire variant line-up. No toll for two-wheelers The government has confirmed that recent reports about toll charges being levied on two-wheelers from July 15 are false. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and NHAI have clarified that there are no such plans currently in the pipeline. All prices ex-showroom, India.
