  "text": "Matching the Purosangue's exterior, the interior features white leather with plenty of green and red accents May 14, 2025 at 21:04 by Brad Anderson The Purosangue features a range of colored forged carbon fiber parts at both ends. Mansory added a second rear wing to the SUV, because one just wasn’t enough. Changes made to the super SUV’s 6.5-liter V12 allow it to deliver 745 hp and 538 lb-ft. Last year, Mansory revealed its interpretation of the Ferrari Purosangue, the Pugnator. If you missed it, consider yourself lucky, because it might just be the ugliest Ferrari makeover ever. But wait, just when you thought Mansory had reached peak absurdity, they somehow outdid themselves at the Top Marques Monaco show, unveiling an even more grotesque version of the Purosangue. Known as the Mansory Pugnator Tricolore, this special edition will be limited to just three units, but that’s assuming Mansory can convince three people to part with their money. It’s supposedly a tribute to Italy, but if Enzo Ferrari were around to witness this, he’d probably be spinning in his grave faster than the V12 on full throttle Read: Mansory’s Purosangue Shows You Can Always Make A Ferrari Louder And Uglier To make the Pugnator even more outlandish, Mansory has painted the exterior in a combination of green, white, and red, reflecting the Italian flag. Many of the new body parts are made from tinted forged carbon fiber, including the green carbon hood, front splitter, and front fender flares. Up front, there are also black wheels with green inner spokes. The Rear Wing Odyssey If the front of the Pugnator Tricolore wasn’t shocking enough, the rear is where things really take a turn for the bizarre. The bodywork has been painted red, and there’s also red forged carbon used for the rear fenders and diffuser. However, it’s the fitment of two massive wings that strips away any remaining elegance the SUV had. The first rear wing has a swan-neck design and stretches out from the tailgate. It’s made from red forged carbon. As with the standard Pugnator, there’s also a secondary rear wing sitting above the rear window. An Interior… That’s Definitely a Statement Then we get to the interior. New plush white leather adorns the seats, steering wheel, door panels, and dashboard, all while being contrasted by green, white, and red accents. This includes patterns on the seats, seat belts, paddle shifters, and the dashboard. The tricolors are also featured on the gear selector panel, except from the driver’s perspective, they are red, white, and green, which is the opposite of what the Italian flag actually is. Oops. Rounding out the upgrades are the same performance modifications as the ‘regular’ Pugnator. These include an ECU remap for the 6.5-liter V12, a new exhaust, and sports catalytic converters, allowing it to deliver 745 hp and 538 lb-ft (730 Nm) of torque.",
