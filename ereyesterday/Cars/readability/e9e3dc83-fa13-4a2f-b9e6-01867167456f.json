  "description": "The TVS iQube has routinely been among the top-selling electric scooters since its launch in 2020, and the very first one came with a 2.2kWh battery. Subsequently, TVS nixed that version and introduced newer variants with bigger batteries, but with ever-increasing inflation leading to larger price tags and a government subsidy that’s all but gone, TVS reintroduced the 2.2kWh option last year. It is now the new entry-level iQube and took over that role from the 3.4kWh variant. But is this 2.2kWh variant a genuinely usable scooter that retains the iQube’s strong points, or is it hamstrung in some way or another like most other budget-friendly e-scooters? After having ridden it extensively for a week, we have an answer. TVS iQube 2.2 design and features (8/10) Staid design and no groundbreaking features, but everything works wonderfully The iQube’s rather innocuous, boxy design hasn’t changed in the last five years, and if one passes you on the road, you’ll likely not give it a second look. All that notwithstanding, what is more pertinent here is that unlike other budget-friendly electric scooters, the iQube’s 2.2 variant doesn’t cheap out in terms of features or usability. It has a large 30-litre boot, a park assist function, a reasonably fast 650W charger, a handy brake-lock clasp, a colour TFT display, a 75kph top speed and even a front disc brake. Most of these features are also seen on the higher variants, so aside from the smaller battery and its lower range, from an end-user perspective, you don’t really get a lot less for your money. The standard 650W charger is quite compact and tops up the battery reasonably quickly. Addressing the boot for just a minute before we move on, the 30-litre unit is slightly smaller than the 32-litre unit on all the other variants. And while that’s still pretty spacious, it is rather shallow, so fitting tall items inside may prove to be a challenge. 30-litre boot on the 2.2 is slightly smaller than the other variants. It’s spacious enough but not very deep. There are a few areas where TVS can polish the iQube even further. For starters, it really should have a multi-function ignition key slot, just like the TVS Jupiter does. Opening the boot via its dedicated key slot is a more cumbersome process than it needs to be, especially if you’ve got your hands full with a bag of groceries or something of the sort. Another little irritant is that if you use the Park Assist function (which can take you both forward and backwards), once you’re done, the motor shuts off, and you again need to press the start button and the brake lever to switch it on once more. The iQube’s charger should also lock into place (like the Ather’s does), so no one can tamper with it when you’re charging it in an open area. And finally, you shouldn’t be forced to use the TVS app for something as simple as resetting the trip meter on the TFT display.  TFT display shows you all the relevant information, but some functions are needlessly complicated. TVS iQube 2.2 ride and handling (9/10) Plush suspension setup and comfortable ergos are hallmarks of the iQube Happily, all those niggles fade away into the background once you (swiftly and silently) get on the move. The iQube is one of the few scooters whose riding experience has always been uncluttered and very similar to a petrol scooter – aside from the pin-drop silence owing to its hub-mounted motor. At 110kg and with a low 770mm perch, this 2.2 variant is one of the lightest electric scooters on sale and is wonderfully manageable for smaller riders. At the same time, the riding position is spacious enough so that taller riders won’t feel cramped, and in general, the iQube’s rider triangle is spot on. Among EVs, the iQube’s riding experience is the closest to that of a petrol scooter. The seat is also generously roomy and can accommodate two full-size adults without a hitch. However, heavier riders will find that the seat’s padding is a little too soft, and they will start sinking into the hard seat base underneath after an hour or so of continuous riding. The seat is spacious but the padding is a little soft, which means heavier riders will sink in after a while. Considering its overarching role as a family scooter, the iQube has respectable handling capabilities, and it feels light on its feet in city traffic without seeming flighty at higher speeds. Credit must also go to its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfortable and will shield you from all but the nastiest bumps Mumbai’s roads throw at you every so often. Braking performance is not lacking either because the iQube 2.2 is one of the only electric scooters at this end of the market to come with a front disc brake. While it doesn’t have hill-hold control like most other EVs do, the brake-lock clasp comes in handy, especially if you park your vehicle on a slope.  Brake-lock clasp is a handy feature, especially since the iQube doesn’t get hill-hold. TVS iQube 2.2 performance and efficiency (9/10) The range claim is extremely accurate, and it is very usable even in Eco mode With a 75kph top speed, this 2.2 variant is slightly slower in outright terms than the others, but never once did it feel like it was unusably slow in the situations we subjected it to. And unlike some other e-scooters where the Eco mode is quite dull, on the iQube, you can easily climb flyovers with a pillion and overtake traffic. Eco limits you to 47kph, and to go faster than that, you need to switch to Power mode, where you get zippier acceleration and can hit the scooter’s top speed. One of the iQube’s hallmarks is its plush suspension setup, which keeps you comfy on our roads. You can easily switch from Eco to Power while you’re on the move by using the dedicated mode switch, but if you want to go back to Eco, you need to slow down to 45kph or less. While initial acceleration from its hub-mounted motor isn’t as energetic as an Ather Rizta’s, the iQube is still a pretty zippy thing, and on most occasions, you’ll overtake everyone else who’s standing at the same signal as you. The motor is very quiet; outright performance is more than enough but initial acceleration lacks urgency. The iQube’s range indicator is ultra-reliable, a factor that greatly aids peace of mind on an EV, and what you see on the screen is how far you’ll actually go. In fact, in our tests, the iQube 2.2 covered 76.4km in Eco when TVS itself claims that the range is 75km. And the fact that you have a reasonably fast 650W charger means that topping up a flat battery to full takes a mere 3 hours and 24 minutes. This combination of a pretty quick charger and a small battery has proven to be a masterstroke, giving this iQube variant one of the quickest charging times in the industry. There are no compromises here, as you see in other EVs at a similar price. TVS iQube 2.2 price and verdict (9/10) The iQube 2.2 is a very compelling option among the affordable EVs currently sold in India Aside from some small UI issues that need ironing out, this Rs 1 lakh iQube 2.2 carries forward all the strong points of the other variants without exception. While it is an affordable machine, crucially, it doesn’t feel cheap. And knowing how reliable our previous TVS iQube S long-termer was, this one, too, should run without any hiccups every time you twist the key – come rain or sunshine. The iQube is one of few EVs at this price to get a front disc brake. Stopping force is decent, and it has CBS. This brings us to the question we posed about the iQube 2.2 at the start: does it feel hamstrung like some similarly priced electric scooters? As we are sure you can tell by now, the answer is an emphatic no. If you are someone whose daily running is under 50km and have secure charging at your home, then choosing this iQube really is a great way to save a lot of money.

This combination of a pretty quick charger and a small battery has proven to be a masterstroke, giving this iQube variant one of the quickest charging times in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/TVS iQube 2.2 rear three quarter static shot.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are no compromises here, as you see in other EVs at a similar price.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTVS iQube 2.2 price and verdict (9/10)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe iQube 2.2 is a very compelling option among the affordable EVs currently sold in India\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from some small UI issues that need ironing out, this Rs 1 lakh iQube 2.2 carries forward all the strong points of the other variants without exception. While it is an affordable machine, crucially, it doesn’t feel cheap. And knowing how reliable our previous TVS iQube S long-termer was, this one, too, should run without any hiccups every time you twist the key – come rain or sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/TVS iQube 2.2 front wheel shot.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe iQube is one of few EVs at this price to get a front disc brake.

As we are sure you can tell by now, the answer is an emphatic no. If you are someone whose daily running is under 50km and have secure charging at your home, then choosing this iQube really is a great way to save a lot of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso See:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-video-reviews/tvs-iqube-22-video-review-435146\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTVS iQube 2.2 video review\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-435547\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-435547\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-435547\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-435547\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
