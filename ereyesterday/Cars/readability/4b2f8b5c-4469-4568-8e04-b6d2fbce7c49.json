  "description": "BMW has said it will build the Skytop roadster in limited numbers, and the concept was shown at the recent Villa d’Este Concorso d’Elegance. The limited-production model appears to draw inspiration from the BMW Z8, resulting in a luxurious two-seat GT equipped with a V8 engine. BMW Skytop is based on 8 Series Gets unique styling, bespoke materials Will be limited to 50 units only BMW Skytop roadster: only 50 units to be made According to the brand, only 50 units of the Skytop roadster will be made now and all of them have been already called for. While the prices have not been disclosed, we can expect them to be sold at nearly $1 million each. While there are no pictures of the production model yet, the car will stick to the concept’s design and powertrain. The stylish Skytop roadster is based on the existing 8 Series and retains BMW’s iconic kidney grille, with two separate illuminated elements and horizontal slats. It gets ultra-thin LED headlights and huge vents on the bonnet. The boot features a distinctive central divider that mirrors the one on the bonnet and curves up into a small ducktail spoiler. On the inside, the cabin is wrapped in brown leather. It gets the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system, a fully digital driver’s display, a familiar shifter for the automatic gearbox, and a conventional multifunction steering wheel.   BMW Concept Skytop: powertrain details Just like the concept, the production model will come with with BMW’s most powerful V8 engine, i.e., the 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged unit that powers the top-end M cars and produces up to 643hp in its highest state of tune.
