Other features include a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle, carbon-ceramic brakes, a power-retractable hardtop, a fixed rear wing, front and rear parking sensors, a four-speaker audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a touchscreen infotainment system. This 600LT has 15k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer in Minnesota with a window sticker, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title. The 600LT utilizes a carbon-fiber MonoCell II chassis, and the body of this example is finished in Cosmos. The car is equipped with almost $11k in optional carbon-fiber exterior trim. Additional features include a power-retractable hardtop, a fixed rear wing, LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, and soft-close dihedral doors. A ceramic coating and clear paint-protection film have been applied to the bodywork. Gloss Black 20″ 10-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyear F1 Supercar 3R tires. Braking is handled by yellow-finished calipers fitted over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors, and the pads were replaced in preparation for the sale. The car features a double-wishbone independent suspension with McLaren Adaptive Damping as well as an optional front-axle lift system. The touring-size carbon-fiber racing seats are trimmed in Carbon Black Alcantara with Cadmium Yellow accents, and the car features optional carbon-fiber interior components. Amenities include a four-speaker sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, a fire extinguisher, and a touchscreen infotainment system. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a configurable digital instrument cluster. The digital odometer indicates 15k miles. The 3.8-liter V8 has been fitted with twin Pure900 turbochargers, ID1050 fuel injectors, an M-Engineering ECU tune, BMC air filters, and an exhaust system without catalytic converters. Fluids services were performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed SSG dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to McLaren Boston in Massachusetts as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $291,716.
