  "text": "There are likely a number of brands that jump to mind when you think “safety.” Now, you might have to think twice.Hyundai Sonata IIHS Crash TestIIHS/HyundaiJun 29, 2025 8:00 PM EDTSearching for the safest cars? Don’t overlook this brand Safety is important to most new car buyers, and one metric customers look at is the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash safety ratings. As an independent non-profit organization that tasks itself with evaluating vehicle safety, the group’s ratings are generally considered more or less synonymous with how safe a vehicle might be in an accident. For 2025, the automaker that takes home the most victories may surprise you. But then, if you’ve been paying attention, maybe it won’t. Hyundai Motor Group’s brands took home the most IIHS Top Safety Awards It wasn’t Volvo, it wasn’t Subaru, and it wasn’t any number of other brands you might have guessed. Hyundai Motor Group earned 15 IIHS Top Safety Pick and Top Safety Pick+ (TSP and TSP+) awards. But you shouldn’t be so surprised, as it’s the group’s second consecutive year winning this award. The Genesis G90 took home a TSP award, and the list of TSP+ winners is considerably longer, including electric models like the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, mainstays of the brand like the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe SUVs, and sedans like the Elantra and Sonata. Earning a TSP or TSP+ rating isn’t easy and hasn’t gotten easier for 2025. In fact, the organization added stricter requirements for second-row occupants just this year, updating the moderate overlap front test. How do the usual suspects compare? Currently, the IIHS lists three Subaru vehicles as award winners: the Forester, Solterra, and Ascent. Volvo’s only winners are the XC90 and XC90 plug-in. While it isn’t even close, there is a small asterisk next to Hyundai’s accolade. Hyundai Motor Group comprises the Kia, Hyundai, and Genesis brands. Most automakers rely on a single nameplate, or at most two, which means there were simply fewer opportunities for awards. Another factor to consider is that some of these vehicles are, underneath, very similar or almost identical. For example, both the Elantra and K4 won TSP+ awards, but are mechanically almost twins. But hey, that doesn’t make them any less safe. The latest IIHS awards are further evidence of how far Korean automakers have come Even with some fine print, the latest round of IIHS safety awards paints a vastly different picture of the Hyundai Motor Group than what you would see even ten years ago. In 2015, Hyundai and Kia each had four award-winning vehicles, and only the Tucson and Genesis took home TSP+ designations. The latter of which, remember, was a standalone model, rather than an entire brand as it is today. A growing portfolio has a lot to do with it. Hyundai had around a dozen models back then, but today, it has 19 to choose from. Final thoughts Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis have taken giant steps forward over the last few years, and safety is just one area where the Koreans have exceeded expectations. Need proof? Look no further than offerings like the IONIQ 5 N, which seems to reinvent what it means to be an engaging-to-drive EV. Remarkable what a few years of progress can add up to, isn’t it?
