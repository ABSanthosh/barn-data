  "text": "Dealers will replace the airbags out of an abundance of caution November 8, 2024 at 19:46 by Michael Gauthier Volkswagen is recalling nearly 115,000 vehicles equipped with Takata airbag inflators in the United States. These don’t pose an “unreasonable risk” to safety, but are being recalled out of an abundance of caution. An assortment of models are impacted including multiple versions of the Beetle and Passat. Takata airbags are some of the deadliest safety devices ever created and they’re back in the news as Volkswagen is recalling 114,478 vehicles. All are equipped with Takata driver’s side front airbag inflators and they reside in the 2006-2007 Passat, 2012-2014 Passat, and 2017-2019 Beetle and Beetle Convertible. There’s also an odd mention of a 2017 Passat Wagon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the vehicles have an airbag inflator that “may explode due to propellant degradation occurring after long-term exposure to high absolute humidity, high temperatures, and high temperature cycling.” If an explosion occurs, deadly shrapnel can kill or injure drivers as well as other occupants. More: 28th Death Linked To Faulty Takata Airbag In The US While issues with Takata airbags are far from new, the Safety Recall Report says “Volkswagen and the NHTSA reviewed findings from various sources … on the safety and service life of desiccated Takata airbag inflators.” Volkswagen’s internal testing of parts showed better performance than other studies and “did not identify any defects.” However, in consultation with the NHTSA, Volkswagen has decided to conduct a recall out of an abundance of caution. This doesn’t sound as serious as other recalls – where owners were told to stop driving immediately – as paperwork says the “airbag inflators … currently do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.” The origin of the recall dates back years and a schedule was laid out in an agreement with the NHTSA. It includes a mix of original equipment and replacement parts, although the automaker isn’t aware of any issues. Owners are slated to be notified late this year and dealers will replace the driver’s side front airbag module with one that doesn’t contain ammonium nitrate.",
