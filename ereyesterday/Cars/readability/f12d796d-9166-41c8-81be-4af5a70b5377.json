  "description": "When it comes to luxury cars, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has long been a benchmark, offering a level of refinement that is hard to beat. The new Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series takes that opulence to another level, combining elevated luxury with distinctive dark accents and the power of a V12 engine. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series exterior Dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver paint 20-inch alloy wheels The Night Series offers exclusive exterior dual-tone paint combinations. While the Maybach S 680 shares much with its lesser S-Class counterparts, the Night Series edition adds a host of unique design features. These include unique paint shades, like the striking dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver pairing. Subtle touches, such as rose gold accents in the headlamps and dark chrome elements in the grille, further add to its exclusivity. The 20-inch wheels, whose seven spokes are surrounded by dozens of Maybach logos, also complement the car’s visually commanding presence. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series interior Aluminium strips run on the dash 31-speaker Burmester sound system Step inside, and the S 680 Night Series instantly envelops you in a world of luxury. The dashboard boasts a herringbone wood pattern, with subtle aluminium strips running through it. A central console area, finished in glossy piano black, features the Maybach logo embossed in a classy, understated manner. The attention to detail continues with a wood-and-leather steering wheel and quilted leather seats; black is the only upholstery colour in the Night Series. The back of the front seats feature the same intricate pattern as the central console. The herringbone wood grain with aluminium accents looks sophisticated. Every element in the cabin has been carefully designed, from the Night Series branding on the door sills to the plush, high-pile carpets. Ambient lights flash lane change alerts When it comes to features, the S 680 Night Series offers a laundry list of cutting-edge technologies aimed at both comfort and safety. One standout feature is the ambient lighting, which not only looks stunning but is also functional. The system is actively integrated with the car’s lane-change warning system: if there’s something in your blind spot, the lights flash as a reminder to check your rearview mirror before changing lanes. The 3D instrument cluster adds a modern touch to the traditional dashboard, providing a floating effect. And on top of that, you have everything from a panoramic sunroof to a 31-speaker Burmester sound system, massage and ventilated seats, rear seat entertainment screens, wireless chargers at the front and rear, and just about everything you can think of. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series engine and performance 0-100kph takes 4.5 seconds Silky smooth V12 engine is the highlight in this variant. The moment you close the doors and start the engine, the S 680 demonstrates its refinement. One of the most noticeable aspects of the car is the silence inside the cabin. It’s as though the outside world fades away as you’re cocooned in a bubble of tranquility. Strong power delivery for a 2.3-tonne car While this may seem like a car built for comfort, it’s far from just that. The S 680 is equipped with a 6.0-litre V12 engine, producing 612 horsepower and an astonishing 900Nm of torque. When you punch your foot down on the pedal, the power delivery is strong. To put it into perspective, this 2.3-tonne car does 0-100kph in just 4.5 seconds. However, the power is delivered in a progressive manner, where acceleration and gear shifts are all delivered smoothly. Nothing ever feels aggressive, staying true to its focus on comfort and luxury. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series acceleration timesSpeed (from rest)Time (in seconds)20kph0.8640kph1.5760kph2.4180kph3.44100kph4.69120kph6140kph7.58 Individual mode customises suspension, steering and performance The S 680 makes high-speed cruising effortless. At triple-digit speeds, the car feels entirely composed, eating up miles without breaking a sweat. This smoothness is further enhanced by its adaptable driving modes. The Maybach mode prioritises comfort, ensuring a pillowy-soft ride, while the Sport mode injects a bit more responsiveness into the car when you need it. For those who like to fine-tune every aspect of their driving experience, the Individual mode allows you to customise the suspension, steering, and performance to suit your exact preferences. Rear-axle steering is great Handling is another area where the S 680 excels. Despite its large size, the rear-axle steering system allows you to manoeuvre the car like a much smaller vehicle, making U-turns and tight spaces a breeze. The steering itself is well-calibrated, providing a light, responsive feel for city driving while offering more weight and confidence when cruising on the highway. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series comfort and ride 180mm extra legroom than standard S-Class First-class levels of luxury; long wheelbase lets you recline fully, with enough room to stretch your legs. Though the S 680 comes with a V12 under its hood, it’s clear that the rear seat is the real star of the show. This extra-long-wheelbase version offers an additional 180mm of legroom, creating an expansive space that’s as comfortable as it is stylish. The Night Series comes with the First Class Suite package, which means rear passengers can enjoy fully reclining seats at the touch of a button, complete with a leg rest that unfolds to provide private jet-level relaxation. Fridge keeps beverages chilled The back seat features large screens for entertainment, a tablet for controlling various features, a wireless charging pad, sun shades and a full suite of massage functions. If that’s not enough, there’s even a fridge to keep your champagne cool, with two champagne flutes waiting to serve. Ultra-soft pillows add to the plush experience, making long trips feel like a retreat. Refrigerator eats into the boot space but is removable. With the car in Maybach mode, the ride is incredibly smooth, absorbing most imperfections on the road. However, larger potholes or deep ruts can still cause a noticeable thud, reminding you that even the finest of cars can’t beat our roads. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series price and verdict S 680 priced at Rs 3.48 crore; Night Series pricier by Rs 40 lakh The Maybach S680 Night Series isn’t just a car; it’s an experience. From the sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology to the extremely refined comfort and smooth, strong performance, this flagship sedan represents the pinnacle of automotive luxury. Of course, such indulgence doesn’t come cheap. With a price tag of Rs 3.48 crore (and another Rs 40 lakh for the Night Series package), the S 680 is truly a car for those who demand nothing but the best. But, as they say, all good things come at a price - and in the case of the Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series, it’s a price worth paying.
