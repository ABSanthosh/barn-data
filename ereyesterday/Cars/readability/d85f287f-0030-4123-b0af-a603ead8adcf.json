  "text": "Photo: Daniel Golson/JalopnikMany electric car startups have started up and then shut down over the past decade or so, some of which went under before producing even one car. Shockingly, Faraday Future, perhaps the most embattled and confusing startup of them all, is still kicking and has actually delivered a handful of its $309,000 FF91 luxury EVs. “I don’t believe you,” I can hear you saying, “where’s the proof?” Well, I saw one last night and took this photo of it.Suggested ReadingIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | JalopinionsOffEnglishSuggested Reading“That photo must be AI,” you retort, “or you faked it like the Bigfoot film.” First of all, Bigfoot is real and he is my friend, but I really did see this Faraday Future for real in real life. Admittedly I didn’t get a great look at the woman who was driving it, so she could have been a robot or a hologram or something, but I would hope a robot would have better sense than to drive one of these things. It was on paper plates too, so this wasn’t a manufacturer test car — someone actually bought it.Well, “bought” is a strong word here. Our friends at InsideEVs reported that Faraday Future has only produced 16 FF91s since production finally started in 2023, six years after it was first unveiled, and all of them were likely delivered to company employees or the celebrity influencers that Faraday Future has paraded around. I’ve seen both racing driver Justin Bell and “Selling Sunset” star Jason Oppenheim driving their FF91s. What’s unclear is whether these people actually spent their own money on the cars, or if Faraday Future just gave them away.Faraday Future somehow keeps getting funding infusions, so it will apparently continue to deliver more FF91s this year, and it’s also working on launching a second brand, Faraday X, that will peddle two different EVs in the $20,000-$50,000 price range. Sure, Jan. I’ll believe it when I see it.",
