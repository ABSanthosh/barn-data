  "description": "This 2024 Porsche 911 GT3 RS is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential, and it was optioned from the factory with the Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. Satin protective film covers the GT Silver Metallic-finished body, and the car is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED headlights with PDLS, a rear wing, rear parking sensors, rear-axle steering, 20\" and 21\" forged lightweight magnesium wheels, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 992 GT3 RS has 1,300 miles and is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean California title.",

Satin protective film covers the GT Silver Metallic-finished body, and the car is further equipped with black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED headlights with PDLS, a rear wing, rear parking sensors, rear-axle steering, 20″ and 21″ forged lightweight magnesium wheels, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 992 GT3 RS has 1,300 miles and is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean California title. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. The CFRP panels are finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave on Weissach Package-equipped cars. This example features satin paint protection film on the GT Silver Metallic exterior finish, and additional details include LED headlights with PDLS, a rear fog light, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, side graphics, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The forged lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 RS center-lock wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering, a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Race-Tex inserts, “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests, and GT Silver stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Porsche-branded floor mats, a fire extinguisher, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features drive-mode selector dials, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 1,300 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. The car is fitted with the optional extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) Plus. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
