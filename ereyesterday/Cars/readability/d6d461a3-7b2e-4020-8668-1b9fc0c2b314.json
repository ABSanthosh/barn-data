  "text": "BMW has launched a new website that catalogs every model it manufactured between 1928 and 2008. It’s suitable for fans of the brand who want to take a trip into the past. But it’s likewise been integrated into BMW’s parts catalog. Whether that makes component hunting more convenient is debatable. But it does showcase that the brand remains mindful of its heritage and it’s something we’d be happy to see from other automakers. The website doesn’t quite cover everything. However, it’s comprehensive and includes every model built by the automaker through 2008 and any relevant details about a particular model. Most cars come listed with photos, production history, relevant features, specifications, and a short description of why it was relevant to BMW. A few even have every available part the manufacturer still offers that will fit the vehicle in question. This is a very BMW thing to do. In fact, the company already offers something similar for its Motorrad division (motorcycles). But the car website clearly has more research behind it, as it looks to cover every single model sold on every single market over an 80-year period. If you’re not a fan of German automobiles, the BMW Group Classics Product Catalog probably doesn’t have much for you. However, if you’re someone who is a fan of the brand — or vintage automobiles in general — you could probably get lost browsing the website for hours. The site is organized chronologically, with the ability to organize searches by specific eras or body styles. There is also a breakdown of the currently available models (e.g. 3 Series), albeit with all information ending in the 2008 model year. It’s not something we really expect automakers to spend their time doing. But we are certainly pleased to see any company giving attention to the models that brought them to where they are today.
