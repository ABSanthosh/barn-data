What does the Trump victory mean for Tesla?And, perhaps, Tesla's competitors? We all know that Tesla boss Elon Musk is buddy-buddy with Trump -- but we also know that Trump has pushed back on the growth of electric vehicles as an option. Tesla, of course, sells only EVs.There are larger market forces to be explored here -- does Musk, for example, convince Trump to become more pro-EV? -- but let's focus on Tesla for today. Will the brand get a sort of \"favored nation\" status within the administration? Will it get an unfair and/or illegal advantage over competitors? Or will very little of consequence happen?Perhaps something in the middle?Again, it's a political QOTD at a fraught time. People are emotional about politics right now, even more so than usual.

More by Tim Healey Published November 6th, 2024 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation Elon will gorge on government contracts for a while, which will help everyone (especially the banks) forget about the financial black hole that was the Twitter acquisition. Tesla will sell lots of cars to Trumpists, which may actually be helpful in teaching them that EVs are usable in many use cases. Then for whatever reason Trump will get pissed off at Elon and he will suffer the same fate as everyone else who has ever worked for Trump. Suddenly Tesla cars will be \"terrible\" and Tesla will be \"failing,\" SpaceX will lose a lot of contracts, and Elon will lose many billions in market cap. Jmo2 13 minutes ago It’s amazing to watch Teslas move from left coded to right coded in real time. Just you watch as the usual suspects change their tune.",
