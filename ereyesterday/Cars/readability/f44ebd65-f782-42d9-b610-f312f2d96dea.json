I want to thank Team MRF Tyres for believing in me from the start. We’ve worked hard together, and achieving this result is a huge satisfaction for all of us,” said Mabellini, who became the eighth different ERC rally winner this season. “A big thanks also to Virginia [co-driver Lenzi], who understands me perfectly, guides me, and without whom I wouldn’t be able to give my best, and to everyone who supported us from Italy. It’s been an incredible weekend, a season finale to remember. We’re enjoying this moment.” MRF Tyres second overall in 2024 European Rally Championship This was Team MRF Tyres’ first win and fourth podium finish this season.
