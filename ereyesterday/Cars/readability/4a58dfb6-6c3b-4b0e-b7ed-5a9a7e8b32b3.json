  "text": "Tesla considers 'overnight' charging between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson The Tesla Electric Fixed Plan usually costs $15 per month for unlimited EV charging. This promotion is only available to select Texans and new Tesla Electric members. Tesla Electric provides household power from 100% renewable sources. New Tesla owners who live in Texas can make use of a compelling charging deal recently introduced by the electric carmaker. Texas residents who take delivery of a new Tesla by December 31 can enroll in the Tesla Electric Fixed Plan, gaining access to one year of unlimited overnight vehicle charging for just $5 per month—or $60 for the year. Typically, Tesla Energy’s fixed plan costs $15 per month or $180 annually for unlimited EV charging, making this offer a $120 savings over the course of a year.

The promotion also includes an annual $400 credit for every Powerwall enrolled in Tesla’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program. Customers using the VPP get fixed rates when selling excess energy back to the grid, enhancing the value of this offer. Not everyone will be eligible for the deal, though, as buyers need to live in an area of Texas where they can choose their electricity provider. They must also be a new Tesla Electric member, and the carmaker notes that the promotion is subject to change at any time. Those willing to spend a little more on home charging can opt for the Electric Dynamic Plan. This provides EV charging for $25 per month and offers month-to-month contracts and real-time pricing adjustments for energy, Drive Tesla Canada reports. Tesla Electric operates exclusively in Texas and is open to anyone who can choose their electricity provider, even if they don’t own a Tesla product. Power is sourced from 100% renewable energy. With the fixed price plan, Tesla provides a flat energy rate between 4 a.m. and 12 a.m. and a lower energy rate between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. Those who want to benefit from the cheapest rates when charging their EVs must do so between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. Meanwhile, homeowners with solar panels can sell excess power back to the grid at 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, offering a neat way to offset costs.",
