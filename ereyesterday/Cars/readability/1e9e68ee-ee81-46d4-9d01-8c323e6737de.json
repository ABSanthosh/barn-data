  "text": "Over 20,000 Foresters are being recalled to have their wheels inspected and replaced, if necessary January 31, 2025 at 19:52 by Michael Gauthier Subaru is recalling 20,366 Foresters over incorrectly manufactured wheels. Impacted vehicles have 18-inch alloy wheels with an incorrect lug seat surface. Dealers will inspect the wheels and replace any faulty ones free of charge. Subaru is gearing up to introduce the new Forester Wilderness at next month’s Chicago Auto Show, but the standard model is the subject of a recall. According to the government, thousands of crossovers from the 2025 model year could be equipped with incorrectly manufactured wheels. The 18-inch alloy wheels were made by Kosei Aluminum and may have an “incorrectly specified lug seat surface.” The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says this could affect vehicle stability, which increases the risk of a crash. More: 2025 Subaru Forester Gets Big Price Hikes Across The Board, Starts At $29,695 Subaru discovered the issue last October after encountering a “wheel attachment concern” during production. This sparked an investigation, which found the lug seats weren’t correct. The automaker isn’t aware of any accidents or warranty claims related to the issue, but decided to conduct a voluntary recall. It impacts 20,366 Foresters and owners will be notified in March. Customers will be instructed to take their vehicle to a dealership for an inspection. If any of the four wheels are found to have an incorrectly specified lug seat surface, they’ll be replaced free of charge. Since this involves 2025 models, Subaru is instructing dealers to immediately identify recalled vehicles and tag them to prevent delivery or use prior to being repaired. However, since this is a simple inspection and replacement, if necessary, it shouldn’t have much of an impact.",
