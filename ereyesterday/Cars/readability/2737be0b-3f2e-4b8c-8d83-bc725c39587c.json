Finished in red with a striped surrey top and wicker seating, the car is powered by an air-cooled 499cc twin paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. It rides on 12″ body-color steel wheels with bright covers and faux whitewalls and is further equipped with safety ropes as well as tubular grab rails and bumpers. This Jolly-style 500F is now offered at no reserve with build photos and Italian registration.",

Finished in red with a striped surrey top and wicker seating, the car is powered by an air-cooled 499cc twin paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. It rides on 12″ body-color steel wheels with bright covers and faux whitewalls and is further equipped with safety ropes as well as tubular grab rails and bumpers. This Jolly-style 500F is now offered at no reserve with build photos and Italian registration. The body was modified in the style of a Jolly model and repainted in red as part of the aforementioned conversion project. A fringed surrey top with white and red stripes is fitted over the passenger compartment, while side safety ropes extend over the door cutouts. A picnic basket is affixed to a removable luggage rack out back, and further details include a louvered engine compartment lid and dual side mirrors as well as tubular grab rails and bumpers. The red-finished 12″ steel wheels wear full covers and are mounted with 125-series Pirelli Cinturato tires wearing faux whitewalls. A spare wheel and tire are stored in the front trunk along with a jack. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums. The interior houses wicker front bucket seats and a matching rear bench, while the floors are lined with tan carpets featuring contrasting binding. A floor-mounted shift lever with a body-color knob sits ahead of controls for the choke and starter. Further details include a dash-mounted rear-view mirror, a passenger-side grab handle, and a windshield defroster. A two-spoke steering wheel fronts a Veglia 120-km/h speedometer with suggested shift points. The five-digit odometer shows 7 kilometers and was reset upon completion of the build. The replacement air-cooled 499cc inline-twin was installed as part of the project. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. Photos taken at various stages of the refurbishment process are presented in the gallery. The vehicle is being sold on its Italian registration, which serves as an ownership document in Italy. The document lists the identification number as 2457864. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
