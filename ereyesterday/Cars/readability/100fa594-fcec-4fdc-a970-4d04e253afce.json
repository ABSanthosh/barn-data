Every week, the secret agent portrayed by Richard Dean Anderson showed audiences that ingenuity, duct tape and a trusty Swiss Army Knife could get you out of just about any problem. While you might not have the brains MacGyver had, he was correct that a good blade can help get you out of a jam. But before you go out to purchase a Rambo-edition bowie knife, you’ll want to make a realistic assessment of what you’ll be asking of a knife you carry on your motorcycle. The first thing to do is hone in on the knife’s application. Is it going to be used for roadside repairs, cooking and camping, or just something on your hip to look the part? Being honest with your application and your abilities will prevent you from carrying around a boat anchor, or sitting on the side of the road wishing for more knife. Considering this tool will be used on the go, it’s important to consider how you’ll carry it. Will this be something you keep on your body via a sheath, carry in a pocket, or are you going to stash it in a bag? You should also be aware of local laws, as certain areas have restrictions on blade length and opening procedures. Having something is usually better than nothing, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a smart play. With our share of miles and mishaps under our belts, here are several knives for motorcycle riders that we’d consider carrying while we ride. Cowboy—Knives Made by Nick Crafted by Nick Huff, a Texas-based tattoo artist turned knife maker, the Cowboy is a rugged, fixed-blade knife made for riders who appreciate traditional function and craftsmanship. Often seen riding his Harley chopper, ‘Jolene,’ Nick brings the same rebellious spirit and precision to his blades. The Production Cowboy is made using one of Nick’s original designs, with each step of production handled by skilled specialists: the blades are water-jetted in Mississippi by Chris Dunn of Top Dunn Jets, batch heat-treated in Pennsylvania by Peters Heat Treat and finished—including bevel grinding, handle attachment and sheath making—at Nick’s shop. Built from durable 1084 mono steel, this knife features a 3.75-inch blade and an overall length of 7.75 inches, making it compact yet capable for road trips and daily carry. For riders seeking a more personal touch, Nick also accepts custom commissions to bring your dream knife to life. [Knives Made by Nick] SlimJim—SOG For motorcyclists looking for a truly slim, lightweight everyday carry, the clip-point SOG SlimJim delivers sleek performance without the bulk. With an overall length of 7.4 inches and a closed length of just 4.22 inches, this folding knife is designed to disappear into your pocket or gear pouch while still offering quick access when needed. Weighing only 2.40 ounces, it’s one of the thinnest assisted-opening knives available. The 3.18-inch blade is made from durable AUS-8 steel, known for its toughness and edge retention. The handle is constructed from 420 stainless steel, giving it both strength and corrosion resistance. Whether you’re on the road or camping out, the SlimJim offers minimalism without compromising utility. [SOG] FREE K4X—Leatherman Leatherman has long been a trusted name in the world of multi-tools, and the FREE K4X continues that legacy by blending the versatility of a multi-tool with the convenience of a pocketknife. More than just a blade, the K4X packs nine additional tools into its sleek stainless steel frame, including spring-action scissors, a pry tool, a package opener, an awl, a bottle opener and three sizes of screwdrivers (phillips, medium, and extra-small). This makes it a perfect companion for motorcyclists who want to stay prepared without overloading their gear. With a closed length of 4.5 inches and a total weight of 5.50 ounces, the K4X is compact yet substantial in the hand. When opened, it stretches to 7.8 inches, revealing a 3.3-inch combo blade made from 420HC stainless steel—ideal for both slicing and tougher tasks. The sturdy stainless steel handle offers a solid grip, and the magnetic locking system ensures smooth, one-handed operation. Whether you’re adjusting gear, opening packages or handling minor roadside fixes, the FREE K4X is a road-ready multitool that delivers serious utility in a single compact design. [Leatherman] Daktyl Slide Lock—Columbia River Knife \u0026 Tool (CRKT) The CRKT Daktyl is an innovative and minimalistic take on the traditional folding knife, designed for those who value simplicity, function and a bit of flair. With a unique slide lock mechanism and skeletonized stainless steel handle, it offers a lightweight yet solid grip, weighing in at just 2.40 ounces. The 3.05-inch blade is crafted from corrosion-resistant 420J2 steel, making it ideal for everyday tasks on or off the road. Measuring 6.81 inches when open and 4.42 inches closed, the Daktyl slips easily into your pocket or gear pouch. Its open-frame design isn’t just for looks—it reduces weight and allows for easy cleaning, perfect for riders who appreciate form and function in equal measure. [Columbia River Knife \u0026 Tool] Whether you’re hitting the open road for a cross-country adventure or just cruising your favorite backroads, the right knife can be an invaluable part of your motorcycle kit. From ultra-light fixed blades to feature-packed multi-tools and sleek folding options, each of the knives featured here brings something unique to the table—just like every rider does. Choose a blade that fits your riding style, your needs and your experience level, and it’ll be more than just a tool—it’ll be a trusted companion. Because when the unexpected happens on the road, it’s not just about having a knife—it’s about having the right one.
