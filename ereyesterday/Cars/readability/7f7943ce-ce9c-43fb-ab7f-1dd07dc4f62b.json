  "description": "This 1967 Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 is one of 455 Series II examples produced between 1965 and 1967.

The car is finished in silver over blue leather upholstery, and power comes from a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 paired with a five-speed manual gearbox. Equipment includes triple Weber carburetors, a limited-slip differential, an ANSA quad-exit exhaust, power steering, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 15” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, and a Becker AM/FM radio. Maintenance performed in April 2025 included the removal and adjustment of the transmission, a rebuild of a power window switch, and a fluid service. This 330 GT is now offered on dealer consignment with copies of build documents, factory literature, tools, spare parts, refurbishment photos and records, and a clean California title.",

  "text": "This 1967 Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 is one of 455 Series II examples produced between 1965 and 1967. Chassis 9129 underwent a refurbishment that was performed by The Vintage Connection of Oklahoma City between 2002 and 2015, and was purchased by the current owner later that year. The car is finished in silver over blue leather upholstery, and power comes from a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 paired with a five-speed manual gearbox. Equipment includes triple Weber carburetors, a limited-slip differential, an ANSA quad-exit exhaust, power steering, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, 15” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, and a Becker AM/FM radio. Maintenance performed in April 2025 included the removal and adjustment of the transmission, a rebuild of a power window switch, and a fluid service. This 330 GT is now offered on dealer consignment with copies of build documents, factory literature, tools, spare parts, refurbishment photos and records, and a clean California title. Designed by Tom Tjaarda at Pininfarina, the 330 GT debuted at the Brussels Motor Show in early 1964 as a replacement for the 330 America. It features a longer wheelbase and a wider grille than its predecessor. The Series II model was introduced in 1965 and featured styling updates that included single headlights, three-louver fender vents, and bumpers with rubber-lined overriders. This example was disassembled and stripped to bare metal before it received bodywork that included the installation of replacement sheet metal. It was subsequently repainted in its factory silver by Joe Hall of Oklahoma City, who utilized three coats of AkzoNobel Sikkens Autobase Plus base coat and four coats of Sikkens clear coat. The brightwork was also rechromed at that time and reinstalled along with replacement body and window seals and a wiring harness. Equipment includes a retractable antenna, front and rear quarter vent windows, and Pininfarina quarter panel badges. Borrani wire wheels were balanced and fitted with coiled lead wire during the refurbishment, and they are secured by three-eared knock-offs and wrapped in 215/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tires. A matching spare wheel that was overhauled by Dayton Wire Wheels during the refurbishment is stowed beneath the trunk floor. An overhaul of the suspension included rebuilds of the shock absorbers and rear leaf springs as well as the installation of custom front suspension cups. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes with a dual-circuit master cylinder and a single Dunlop booster. The Dunlop calipers were also rebuilt, and custom solid discs were installed. The left-hand-drive cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench seat that were fitted with replacement foams and retrimmed in blue leather in 2015 by Dan Kirkpatrick Interiors of Chouteau, Oklahoma. Color-coordinated door panels, carpets, and center console trim were installed at that time along with a replacement dash panel, headliner, and insulation. The wood dash panel and vents were also refurbished. Equipment includes a Becker Europa II AM/FM radio that was rebuilt with modern electronics as well as a Pininfarina-branded ashtray, a locking glovebox, hanging pedals, and lap belts. A power window switch was rebuilt in April 2025. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation, including a 180-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. They were rebuilt during the refurbishment along with the readouts for water temperature, amperage, and fuel level. A clock is mounted in the center of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 83k miles, approximately 900 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter Colombo Tipo 209 V12 breathes through triple Weber carburetors, and it was factory rated at 300 horsepower. The engine and carburetors were rebuilt during the refurbishment, and the following work was also performed: Resurfacing the cylinder heads and the installation of replacement valve seats, Teflon valve guides, and Manley single-piece stainless-steel valves by Autosport Seattle Boring the cylinder walls to 78.2mm Teflon-coating the water pump’s inner chamber Relining and rebalancing the crankshaft damper Installing custom JE pistons and rings as well as custom ARP studs with 12-point nuts and heavy flat washers. A fluid service was performed in April 2025. Engine stamping 209 is presented above, and it matches the number listed on the chassis tag and factory build records viewable in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, which was standard equipment on all Series II 330 GTs. The transmission, clutch, and differential were rebuilt, and the transmission was removed from the car and adjusted in April 2025. The ANSA quad-exit exhaust, ceramic-coated headers, and stainless steel pipes were installed during the project, and the fuel tank was refinished and reinstalled with replacement lines. A pair of winch rings was added to the front cross member during the refurbishment. Included spare parts, tools, and factory literature are presented in the gallery. Photos taken during the project can be seen in the gallery, along with over 120 pages of invoices for work performed between 2002 and 2025. A selling dealer-provided summation of refurbishment costs totals over $300k. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
