  "description": "Hydration packs aren’t just for long-distance riders and desert rallies. With Mumbai’s monsoon in full swing, I’ve been using Rynox’s Navigator Hydration Backpack paired with their Reload 2.5L bladder mainly for commutes and the occasional weekend sprint. During that time, it’s proven itself to be a compact, well-executed bit of kit with a few quirks. Despite its relatively slim profile entry level price tag, the Navigator feels like serious gear. The material quality is robust, with well-stitched seams, premium-feeling zippers and a sturdy harness system. Even in daily urban chaos, it hasn’t shown any signs of wear yet. While the bright yellow accents and reflective strips are practical, they also lend it a racy, trail-ready and dare I say, Dakar ready looks. This backpack has a rather sturdy and premium feeling harness The backpack sits snug and doesn’t bounce around, even when fully loaded. The sternum strap, in particular, adds a sense of security and keeps it planted well along with a waist strap for extra sense of security and stability. However, its tall profile can rub against the pillion seat on motorcycles with a slightly raised tail section, and the hydration hose clips can occasionally make contact with your helmet when turning your head. It’s not a deal-breaker, but something you’ll need to get used to. A brighter colour for the interior would have been nicer. Ventilation and padding are adequate. It’s nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done in humid riding conditions. Total amount of storage is limited and it tops out at just 4 litres in total, with the main compartment swallowing 3.5 litres and two outer compartments offering 0.25 litres each. It’s enough for your wallet, keys, and phone charger, but if you want to carry something bulkier—like a pair of headphones—you’ll need to leave the hydration bladder behind. One silver lining is the external elastic stash made of Hypalon— the same material used to make rafts. This extra external storage is great for carrying items like gloves or even goggles on your ride and it's an idea originated by Kriega.  Smoked finish looks on cool this bladder. With the bladder full, usable space does shrink further, but as you drink through your ride, some of that space frees back up. The bag opens easily enough even with gloves on, though removing it takes a moment due to the secure strap system - a fair trade-off for the fit and stability it offers. Speaking off, the 2.5-litre bladder pairs seamlessly with the Navigator and feels just as well put together. Its smoked finish looks slick, and after a good initial rinse, I never noticed any unpleasant taste. Filling, sealing, and cleaning it are all easy tasks, and I’ve had zero leaks, even when completely topped up. Allows for better adjustment to suit riders with different builds. The hose is long enough to route from under the arm to the mouth, and while there’s no internal channel inside the bag, external clips on either side keep things in place. The bite valve comes with a dust cover and is easy to use on the go, although if you have a full-face helmet with a long chin curtain, it might take a bit of fiddling to get right. Again, subjective to your choice of helmet.  Very handy to store extra things or a wet pair of gloves. At Rs 3,550 for the Navigator Hydration Backpack and Rs 1,350 for the Reload bladder, this setup comes in at Rs 4,900—which undercuts similar offerings from premium brands like Ogio. And frankly, it doesn’t feel like a compromise. It’s well-built, functional, and suited to real-world riding conditions. The lack of a waterproof compartment is a minor letdown in monsoon, but that’s easily solved with a zip-lock or dry pouch. Price: Rs 3,550 + Rs 1.350 Where: rynoxgear.com Also see: Rynox Downtown Pro jacket review Raida UrbanR riding shoes review",
