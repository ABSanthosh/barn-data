  "description": "Mercedes-Benz India plans to roll out eight models this year, majorly comprising top-end and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Notably, the G 580 and EQS 450 SUVs were launched just today. Its current lineup starts with the A 200 priced at Rs 46.5 lakh, going up to Rs 3.64 crore for the AMG G 63. Last year, Mercedes launched 14 new cars in the country, including the locally produced EQS SUV and the Maybach EQS SUV. Mercedes is India’s largest manufacturer of luxury four-wheelers The GT 63 Motorsport Collectors Edition could also arrive in limited numbers Mercedes has already confirmed to bring the G 580, Maybach EQS 680 Night Series and a CLA concept at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Other cars to also be present there include the AMG SL 55, AMG S 63 E Performance and E 450 LWB AMG Line. While we have earlier confirmed that the AMG CLE 53 will launch in the second half of 2025, the below-listed cars could be on the cards for India: Mercedes AMG E 53 The next-generation AMG E 53 plug-in hybrid made its global debut in 2024 and is expected to arrive on Indian shores in the coming months. Previously, we had the Mercedes-AMG E 53 Cabriolet on sale at Rs 1.3 crore; the sedan version was also launched in India in 2021, though it has been discontinued. The new Mercedes PHEV will have a combined output of 585hp and 750Nm, which can be taken up to 612hp with the AMG Dynamic Plus package. Mercedes AMG GT R Image used for representation After making its India debut in 2017 and getting a facelift in 2020, Mercedes pulled the plug on the AMG GT R soon after. The next-generation model is likely to arrive this year but owing to stricter emission norms, it is likely to get some type of hybrid system. The GT R coupe was powered by AMG’s 4-litre twin-turbo V8 making 585hp and 700 Nm, hurling it from 0-100 kph in 3.6 seconds. The top speed came at 318 kph. Mercedes Maybach GLS Night Series While we do have the Mercedes-Maybach GLS facelift on sale right now, the Night Series package will add black chrome elements to the car. Unveiled in 2023, the SUV gets a two-tone paint finish in Obsidian Black and Mojave Silver. There will be a monotone diamond white color scheme on offer as well. Under the hood, the Maybach GLS houses a 4-litre, twin-turbo V8 petrol engine generating up to 579hp and 770Nm of torque.
