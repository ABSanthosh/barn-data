The car underwent a multi-year refurbishment between 2000 and 2004 and was repainted again in 2023. It is finished in Opalescent Silver Blue over black leather and is powered by a 3.8-liter inline-six linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a blue soft top, a soft top boot, enclosed headlights, 15″ wire-spoke steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, triple windshield wipers, and a heater. Work in preparation for the sale involved rebuilding the carburetors and replacing the battery and coolant hoses. This XKE Series I roadster is now offered in Canada by the selling dealer with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, service records, a spare set of wheels, and Alberta registration. The car came finished from the factory in Opalescent Silver Blue and received bodywork during the aforementioned refurbishment, including replacement of the door skins, rear wheel arch panels, and sills along with the floors and front frame rails. A repaint was carried out again in 2023 by Macaw Autobody of Kelowna, British Columbia. A replacement blue soft top was installed in 2016. The 15″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and were mounted with 215/70 BFGoodrich Sivertown Radial tires in 2017. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard-mounted rear rotors, and the brake fluid was flushed in March 2025. A spare set of knock-off wire wheels with tires is included in the sale. Replacement blue carpets were installed and the bucket seats were re-trimmed in black leather in 2016. Interior appointments include textured aluminum dash trim, a sliding rearview mirror, and a heater. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a Smiths 160-mph speedometer and 6k-rpm tachometer, while auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage are located in the center of the dashboard. The speedometer and tachometer were repaired in August 2024, and the five-digit odometer shows 19k miles. The horn was repaired in March 2025. A Nardi steering wheel accompanies the vehicle. The 3.8-liter inline-six features triple SU carburetors and was factory rated at 265 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The spark plugs were replaced and a spin-on oil filter installed in 2022. Work in preparation for the sale consisted of rebuilding the carburetors, changing the oil, and replacing the battery and coolant hoses. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Moss four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Copies of photos taken during the refurbishment are provided in the gallery along with records of the work that total approximately $74k CAD. The Jaguar Heritage Trust Production Record Trace certificate shows the original colors and drivetrain numbers as well as the build and dispatch dates. The vehicle is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
