  "description": "The Delhi government has officially levied restrictions on the supply of fuel to vehicles that it classifies under \"end of life\" status. Starting today, July 1, sale of fuel for petrol vehicles over 15 years of age and diesel vehicles over 10 years of age will be refused in Delhi, and owners caught offending will have their vehicles impounded on the spot. Cameras and alarms will detect end of life vehicles in Delhi fuel stations Enforcement teams deployed at some fuel stations to monitor incoming vehicles Delhi fuel ban for old vehicles explained AI-powered cameras and hooter systems installed at fuel stations At nearly 350 fuel stations across Delhi-NCR, the government has installed automatic number plate reader (ANPR) cameras to detect any end-of-life vehicles that may pull in to refuel. These ANPR cameras are claimed to leverage AI, and work in conjunction with an automated hooter system that sounds an alarm if the cameras read a number plate belonging to an end-of-life vehicle. Offending vehicles to be impounded right away Staff members at fuel stations have been instructed to refuse sale of fuel to end-of-life vehicles, and teams of transport and police department officials were also deployed at some South Delhi fuel stations earlier today to keep an eye out for the same. Should any of these vehicles be caught by the ANPR cameras or enforcement teams, they will be denied fuel and immediately impounded. Following the infamous 2018 Supreme Court ruling that banned plying of petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years in Delhi as part of a concerted effort with the NGT to combat air pollution, this new restriction on fuel sales will make it even more difficult to own an older car or bike in the national capital.
