It is powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black supple leather upholstery. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 18″ Speedline wheels, a power sunroof, a Porsche CD/cassette stereo, air conditioning, heated power-adjustable front seats, and a fixed rear spoiler. This 964 is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with an accident-free Carfax report and a Tennessee title in the owner’s name. The 964 Turbo featured widened bodywork when compared to the contemporary 911 and was fitted with aerodynamic side mirrors and a fixed rear spoiler. The 3.6-powered variant was introduced in January 1993, and this example is finished in black and features a power sunroof, a rear window wiper, and fog lights. The multi-piece 18″ Speedline wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport N-spec tires that have 2023 and 2024 date codes. The Turbo features uprated brakes compared to the standard 964, including larger calipers and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The brake fluid was changed in 2023, and a power steering o-ring and seal were replaced in 2025. Black supple leather covers the seating surfaces, and the front seats are heated and power-adjustable. Turbo-branded floor mats line the footwells, and amenities include air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche CD/cassette stereo. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 20k miles, approximately 8k of which were added during current ownership. A potential odometer rollback is noted in an August 1998 entry on the Carfax report. The turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six was factory rated at 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. The rear hatch struts were replaced in 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L741 – Black paint VN – Black leather C02 – Version for USA 139 – Seat heating, left 340 – Seat heating, right 407 – 18″ Polished three-piece wheels 650 – Power sunroof 935 – Supple leather rear seats 980 – Supple leather front seats The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and lists the aforementioned potential odometer rollback. The Tennessee title lists “Actual Mileage” beneath the Remarks heading. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
