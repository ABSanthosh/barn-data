  "text": "Earlier reports suggested the sedan-style 2 would be phased out in favor of the 7 SUV, but the pair will co-exist January 21, 2025 at 19:44 by Chris Chilton Polestar’s CEO says the new 7 compact premium SUV won’t step into the 2’s shoes. The 2 crossover will get its own replacement before 2030, Autocar reports. Priority goes to the Europe-built 7 SUV, with the second-generation 2 following. Even before Polestar confirmed last week that it was working on a compact premium SUV to rival the Porsche Macan, a flurry of reports suggested this new Polestar 7 would indirectly replace the ageing 2 crossover. But the automaker’s CEO has clarified that in fact the 7 and 2 badges will live side by side. The Swedish brand’s boss, Michael Lohnscheller, told Autocar today’s Polestar 2 would get its own direct replacement “towards the end” of the decade. The new crossover will arrive shortly after the 7, which appears not to be on the cards until at least 2028. When we suggested a 2027 date based on our earlier reports, Polestar asked us to avoid references to the date, without offering any concrete timeline. Related: Polestar Pins Turnaround Hopes On Porsche Macan-Sized 7 SUV Since Lohnscheller told Autocar the 7 gets priority, the 2 surely can’t arrive until 2028 or 2029. So today’s 2 crossover – which dates to 2020 – will have to soldier on for at least another three years. Lohnscheller, seemed unconcerned, told the UK mag the model had “years to go” following a MY25 update and explained that it’s his favorite of the brand’s cars. Both the 7 and the second-generation 2 will ride on a new (probably Geely) platform, and Polestar has already confirmed the SUV will be built in Europe, rather than Asia or the US. Their arrival will boost the brand’s lineup to six cars, and make life complicated for buyers trying to work out where each fits in the hierarchy, the 7 being smaller than the 3 SUV. The other models are the 4 sedan (already here), 5 four-door coupe and 6 sports car (both coming this year). Current three-car lineup will double by 2030 Lohnscheller also told Autocar he had tasked new design chief Philipp Römers with putting more emphasis on Polestar models’ performance when he starts sketching the next wave of EVs. “What we’ve achieved so far is really good,” he told the magazine’s Steve Cropley, “but I’m asking Philipp to highlight the performance of our cars a little more. I don’t believe they look quite as capable as they actually are. They should look a little more confident; they are maybe bit too modest.” And maybe still too Volvo-like, we’d suggest. But where do you think Polestar should look for design inspiration? Leave a comment below and give us your thoughts.",
