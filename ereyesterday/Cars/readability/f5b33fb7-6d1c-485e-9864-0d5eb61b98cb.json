  "description": "Honda has officially entered the Indian electric two-wheeler market with its maiden offerings, the QC1 and Activa e:, launched last month at the Auto Expo. Just a few days ago, we reported that the company is looking to set up a dedicated EV manufacturing plant in India, which will likely be operational by 2028 Now, our sister publication, Autocar Professional, has exclusively learned that these are just the initial steps, and Honda is working on bringing ten new electric vehicles to India over the next five years, of which four will come between 2025 and 2027. Four new Honda EVs coming by 2027 10 new EVs coming in the next five years India will serve as a manufacturing hub for global EV models First things first, why has Honda chosen India as one of its manufacturing hubs for producing its next-generation EVs? The company’s top brass believes that the Indian market will be the fastest-growing in the coming decade, with EV penetration set to rise. Today, the electric two-wheeler market is not the fledgling niche it once was, with models like the Bajaj Chetak and TVS iQube among the top 10 bestselling scooters in the country. Not much is yet known about the future Honda EVs coming to India, but what we do know is that the company has lined up a total of 10 electric two-wheelers over the next five years. People in the know tell us that Honda is targeting a cumulative 3 lakh units per annum with the four models, which will debut in the 2025-27 timeframe. While the Activa e: and QC1 have just been launched, these two are just the first step in the grand scheme of things. Sources tell us that the next wave of EV products from Honda will be better tailored to our needs, as the company will be looking at the limitations of these two models, as well as those of its rivals and noting down the specific requirements of Indian customers.  With inputs from KETAN THAKKAR Also See: Honda showcases electric scooter, e-bike concepts at EICMA 2024",
