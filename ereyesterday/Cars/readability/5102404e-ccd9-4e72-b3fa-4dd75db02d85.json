Equipment includes the Sport Chrono and Light Design packages as well as carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats, a front-axle lift system, a rear spoiler, a Bose sound system, Satin Black 20″ center-lock wheels, aluminum pedals, and LED headlights with PDLS+. The seller acquired the car in 2018 and has since added approximately 10k of the 12k indicated miles. This 991.2 GT3 is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The 991 GT3 featured revised front and rear bumper covers when compared to the standard Carrera as well as a rear wing and dual center-exit exhaust pipes. This example is finished in Chalk with High-Gloss Black door handles and is equipped with LED headlights in Black with the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System Plus (PDLS+). Clear paint protection film covers multiple panels. The photos were taken in August 2024, approximately 200 miles ago. Satin Black-finished 20″ center-lock alloy wheels were mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires in April 2024. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system, and braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The carbon-fiber-backed full bucket seats are trimmed in Black leather and Alcantara with Porsche crest headrest accents as well as Red stripes and stitching. Color-coordinated leather, Alcantara, and stitching adorn the dashboard, center console, and door panels, and further appointments comprise aluminum pedals, a Bose surround-sound system, cruise control, the Light Design Package, illuminated carbon-fiber door sill guards, and PCM with navigation. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger footwell. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features a Red centering stripe and frames a central GT3-branded tachometer, a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and auxiliary gauges. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV). The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. The seller tells us that the serpentine belt was replaced in 2023, and the battery and Porsche Active Drivetrain Mount (PADM) modules were replaced in 2024.
