  "description": "The Maruti Swift has always been known for its efficiency, and the latest iteration, featuring a new three-cylinder Z-series petrol engine, continues this legacy. In real-world tests, it delivers an impressive 14kpl in the city and 19kpl on highways. To further enhance fuel savings, Maruti has introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) variant, priced between Rs 8.20 lakh and Rs 9.20 lakh. This CNG version is available only in mid-level trims and comes at a premium of approximately Rs 90,000 over the petrol variant. Maruti Swift S-CNG design Our test Swift S-CNG is based on the ZXI trim, which is one step below the top-spec ZXI+. This means it lacks features like front fog lamps and dual-tone alloy wheels, instead sporting silver- finished 15-inch alloys. A noticeable addition is the CNG filler cap on the right rear fender that, unfortunately, looks like an aftermarket job, which it isn’t. However, the overall design remains youthful and retains the fourth-generation Swift’s signature curves and silhouette. Maruti Swift S-CNG interior Inside, the Swift maintains its minimalist, all-black cabin layout. While it is functional and user- friendly, certain omissions, such as the absence of cruise control buttons on the steering wheel, are evident. The monochrome multi-information display (MID) looks quite basic, but an interesting addition is the dual fuel gauge – one for petrol and another for CNG. Seat comfort The 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, though nice to use, appears small within its oversized bezel. Seat comfort is good, ergonomics are spot on, and the rear seats offer adequate space for two adults. However, practicality takes a hit due to the 55-litre CNG cylinder occupying most of the boot, leaving just enough room for a soft cabin bag. The visible CNG cylinder mounting and lack of boot cladding don’t make for a pleasing sight. Additionally, the CNG variant does not include a spare tyre. Dual fuel gauge – one for petrol and one for CNG – is a nice addition. Equipment list While on that topic, the Swift S-CNG has a decent list of features. These include automatic LED headlamps, a rear wiper and washer, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with six speakers, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, automatic climate control, rear AC vents, a wireless charger, and crucial safety features such as an electronic stability program (ESP), six airbags, and hill-start assist. However, it lacks fog lamps and a rear-view camera. Maruti Swift S-CNG performance and efficiency By default, it switches on in petrol mode, and later switches to CNG automatically. By default, the Swift S-CNG starts on petrol, and once the engine reaches optimal temperatures, it automatically switches to CNG with an audible mechanical ‘clang’. We’re happy to report that despite being nearly 70 kilograms heavier than its petrol counterpart and 12hp and 10Nm down on power and torque, respectively, the Swift does its urban duties very competently. This 1.2-litre three-cylinder Z-Series engine’s clear focus on drivability and crisp throttle responses (even in CNG mode) ensures that most owners will find no reason to complain. And while it doesn’t warrant constant gear shifts to get a move on, owners are likely to appreciate its light clutch and buttery-smooth 5-speed manual transmission, which not only removes the stress from driving but makes for a pleasurable driving experience. 0-100kph time Maruti Suzuki Swift CNG: performanceSpeedCNG modePetrol mode0-20kph1.23s1.55s0-40kph3.22s3.05s0-60kph6.26s5.57s0-80kph9.77s8.51s0-100kph15.54s13.03s20-80kph (in 3rd gear)14.75s13.22s40-100kph (in 4th gear)21.5s9.26s Performance tests show the Swift S-CNG accelerates from 0-100kph in 15.5 seconds, which is 1.5 seconds slower than the petrol variant. In rolling acceleration tests, too, it was slower than its petrol-only counterpart, taking 1.5 seconds more in the 20-80kph third-gear sprint and 3.3 seconds more in the 40-100kph fourth-gear test. In our real world tests, the Swift S-CNG's overall fuel efficiency is identical to its claimed range. More importantly, the Swift S-CNG excels in fuel efficiency. In CNG mode, it returned 24.35 km/kg in city conditions and an impressive 31.38 km/kg on the highway, averaging 27.85 km/kg, which is close to the claimed figures. Maruti Swift S-CNG ride and handling Even in its CNG avatar, the Swift remains a fun to drive car. The rear suspension is slightly stiffer than the petrol variant to accommodate the additional weight of the CNG cylinder. The ride remains comfortable within city limits, but at highway speeds, sharper movements can be felt inside the cabin. The steering is light and effortless, with a natural returnability after turns. On the whole, the Swift S-CNG remains just as fun and enjoyable to drive as it is expected to be. Maruti Swift S-CNG verdict The Swift S-CNG’s dearth of luggage space and a missing spare tyre make it less practical for long highway journeys. Buyers looking for the absolute top-spec variant with all features may also find it lacking. However, its user-friendly nature, smooth driving experience, and outstanding fuel efficiency make it an excellent economical choice for city commutes.
