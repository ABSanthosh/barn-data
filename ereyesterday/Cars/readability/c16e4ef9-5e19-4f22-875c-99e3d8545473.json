  "text": "The modified Le Mans was customized for 2005’s \"XXX: State of the Union\" starring Samuel L. Jackson and Ice Cube 1 hour ago by Chris Chilton One of five custom 1967 Pontiacs built for a 2005 Samuel L Jackson movie is for sale. This color-shifting GTO-badge Le Mans was used to promote XXX: State of the Union. Modifications include a roof chop, custom interior, 22-inch wheels and fuel-injected V8. Buying a four-wheeled star from your favorite movie can be an expensive business – five years ago someone paid $3.7 million for a 1968 Ford Mustang 390 GT that appeared in Bullitt. But for around 2.5 percent of that bill you could get your hands on another classic 1960s muscle car with Hollywood connections. This 1967 Pontiac is reportedly one of several similar cars built for 2005’s XXX: State of the Union, the second of three pretty awful movies that most of us have thankfully forgotten. Numbers one and three featured Vin Diesel, but Samuel L. Jackson took the lead for State of the Union, which one reviewer described as being so dumb it made “the Road Runner cartoons look like National Geographic specials.” Related: Someone Spent $1.2M Building the Most Twisted Pontiac GTO You’ve Ever Seen Just like Diesel did in the first movie, Jackson drives a ’67 GTO, but while the Diesel’s Goat was only mildly modified, and in a kind of 1980s style, Jackson’s ride fully embraced the custom trends of the mid 2000s, explaining its color-flip paint and 22-inch wheels. Other features include a chopped roof and rockets hidden behind the headlights.  The movie team reportedly commissioned five builds that between them would handle filming duties plus promotional work once the movie was in theaters. Though it’s meant to be a GTO, the VIN on this car decodes to a Pontiac Le Mans, which makes sense. Both cars were effectively trim variations on Pontiac’s Tempest, even though by 1967 they were marketed as separate models in their own right, and it would have been nuts to chop up a real GTO when a Le Mans donor was probably half the price. Motorcar Classics In stock form, details like the different rear lights and the Le Mans’ vents behind the door would have given the game away, but the build was so comprehensive that there’s precious little left of the original car anyway. Under the hood is a fuel injected small-block V8 that definitely wasn’t available in 1967, and the interior was completely re-done with a nasty custom dashboard and a laughable fake digital display (Apple wouldn’t launch the iPad for another five years). Samuel L Jackson has definitely aged better. As movie collectibles go, it’s hardly Bullitt-grade stuff, but then neither is the price. Motorcar Classics in Farmingdale, NY, wants $94,900 for this car, though for $15k less the same garage will sell you a more stock-looking GTO from the first XXX movie. What movie car would you buy given the chance and unlimited funds? Drop a comment below and let us know. Motorcar Classics",
