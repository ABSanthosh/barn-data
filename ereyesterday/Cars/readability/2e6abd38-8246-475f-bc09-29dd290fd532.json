Produced for the Canadian market, it is finished in Grigio Avlon over black leather and is equipped with a limited-slip rear differential, 18″ Speedline alloy wheels, a front-axle lift system, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a Larini exhaust system, a gated shifter, a radar detector, xenon headlights, automatically deploying rear intakes, automatic climate control, and a CD stereo. This Murciélago was purchased by the owner in 2009 and is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, clean US and Canadian Carfax reports, and Alberta registration. The Murciélago was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was publicly unveiled in 2001 at the Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Diablo. This example is finished in Grigio Avlon and features a speed-activated rear spoiler, a pantograph windshield wiper, xenon headlights, scissor doors, rear fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, and automatically deploying rear intakes to aid in cooling. The front bumper cover and rocker panels were refinished in February 2023. The 18″ Speedline alloy wheels were refinished in August 2022 and wear Continental tires that were mounted in August 2024. Stopping power is provided by Lamborghini-branded calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The car is equipped with active dampers and a front-axle lift system. The right-front damper was rebuilt in February 2023, the front-axle lift system was adjusted in October 2023, and a brake fluid was flushed in August 2024. The cabin houses manually adjustable seats trimmed in black leather, while Lamborghini-branded floor mats line the footwells. Interior appointments include a radar detector, automatic climate control, inboard shoulder restraints, a gated shifter, bright pedals, and a CD stereo. The instrument cluster housing leather has imperfections. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 360-km/h speedometer and a 9k-rpm tachometer as well as auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 33k kilometers (~21k miles), approximately 12k of which were added under current ownership. An airbag warning light was addressed in 2023, per the seller. The mid-mounted 6.2-liter V12 was factory rated at 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip rear differential. A Larini exhaust system has been fitted. The spark plugs and ignition coils were replaced in February 2023, and an oil change was performed in August 2024, at which time the air conditioning system and an oil leak were repaired. The US Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. A Canadian Carfax report is provided in the gallery. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates.
