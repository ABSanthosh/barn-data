It is finished in Glacier White over black leather upholstery and is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle. The car is further equipped with a 360-degree Park Assist, a vehicle-lift system, an active rear spoiler, carbon-ceramic brakes, 19″ and 20″ Stealth-finished split-spoke wheels, dihedral soft close doors, and a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system linked with a touchscreen infotainment system. This 720S was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with a digital reproduction window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The 720S utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded-aluminum subframe, and this example is finished in Glacier White. The Exterior Carbon Fiber Pack 1 includes carbon-fiber hood air intakes, quarter panel air intakes, and door mirror casings. Additional details include soft-close vertical-lift doors with Gorilla Glass uppers, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and an active rear spoiler with an air brake. The 19″ and 20″ Stealth-finished split-spoke wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. The car rides on a three-mode adaptive suspension that features double wishbones at all four corners, and a vehicle-lift system was equipped from the factory. Stopping power is provided by yellow-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable bucket seats are upholstered in black leather that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Features include 360-degree Park Assist, a 12-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. The flat-bottom steering wheel features paddle shifters and is mounted ahead of instrumentation consisting of a folding LCD screen that displays a speedometer, tachometer, trip functions, and vehicle information. The digital odometer indicates 7k miles. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 utilizes a flat-plane crankshaft as well as dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is equipped with an optional sports exhaust system.
