Power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 linked with an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission and a locking center differential. The seller acquired the vehicle in 2024 and has since added approximately 1k miles. This Cayenne Turbo is now offered in California with a clean Carfax report and a clean Arizona title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The SUV is finished in Jet Black Metallic and features xenon headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS) as well as a panoramic sunroof, a receiver hitch, quad exhaust outlets, and front and rear parking sensors. The 21″ 911 Turbo II alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Latitude Sport 3 tires. An adjustable air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) were equipped from the factory. Stopping power is provided by red-finished six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers over ventilated rotors at each corner. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable front sport seats and heated rear bench are upholstered in Black leather that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Anthracite Birch wood trim adorns the interior, and amenities include adaptive cruise control, four-zone automatic climate control, Porsche Entry \u0026 Drive, a Bose sound system, Lane Change Assist (LCA), powered rear sunshades, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation. The seller tells us that a rear window sunshade was replaced in December 2024. The wood- and leather-rimmed steering wheel is equipped with shift buttons and frames a 190-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 50k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 features VarioCam Plus and was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission and a locking center differential.
