  "text": "The sixth generation Toyota RAV4 introduces fresh styling and upgraded technology features. The compact SUV now rides on an upgraded version of its predecessor’s underpinnings. The electrified lineup includes slightly more powerful hybrid and PHEV powertrain options. To say the Toyota RAV4 is a big deal would be an understatement. Not only did it help define the modern SUV, but it’s also the best-selling vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck and one of the most popular models worldwide. Now, the RAV4 has been refreshed for its sixth generation. Also: The Tesla Model Y Has A New Rival From Toyota That’s Half The Price While Toyota appears to have taken the same approach it used with the Camry, opting for a heavy redesign rather than an entirely new model, the latest RAV4 rides on an upgraded version of its predecessor’s underpinnings. It also brings fresh styling, modern technology, and an all-electrified lineup, including HEV and PHEV options. And, perhaps the biggest surprise of all, a GR Sport trim for those craving something more dynamic. New, Yet Very Familiar Design Let’s talk design. Toyota didn’t exactly throw a wild curveball here, but they’ve made enough changes to keep it interesting. The RAV4’s exterior blends the same silhouette we’ve known for year with more modern styling cues. You can choose from three different styles, named Core, Sport, and Rugged, depending on whether you want a little more flair or a bit more toughness. Then there’s the new Woodland grade, which ups the adventure factor, and the more aggressive GR Sport grade. More: Toyota Made An Electric Subaru Outback As Powerful As A Supra Up front, the RAV4 now sports sharper, more angular LED headlights, a body-colored grille, and larger intakes for a more aggressive look. The profile is instantly recognizable with trapezoidal wheel arches and similar character lines – albeit slightly more sculpted. The greenhouse has also been tweaked with a straight beltline, while there are new designs for the alloy wheels, available in 17-, 18-, or 20-inch sizes, depending on your trim level. TOYOTA RAV4 WOODLAND Around the back, the rear end now has a full-width cluster with a tinted finish that houses the new LED taillights. There’s a boxier tailgate and a larger spoiler, though the GR Sport version takes it up a notch with a more prominent wing and a sportier grille. The Woodland trim adds a rugged split grille, extra LEDs on the front bumper, bulkier roof rails, and slightly higher ground clearance (+0.5 inch / 13 mm) thanks to those all-terrain tires. The color options include some carry-over single- and two-tone options from the outgoing RAV4, along with a few new choices like Meteor Shower, Everest, and Storm Cloud. Plus, there’s a unique Urban Rock color for the Woodland trim and an exclusive Supersonic Red with a Black roof for the GR Sport. As you would imagine from a model that’s more of a redesign than a complete overhaul, the footprint of the compact SUV remains largely unchanged, measuring 180.9-181.8 inches (4,595-4,618 mm) in length, with an identical wheelbase of 105.9 inches (2,690 mm). However, it stands slightly taller than the previous model, with a height ranging from 66.4 to 67.8 inches (1,687 to 1,722 mm). More Tech, Fewer Buttons Inside The interior of the RAV4 has also been given a refresh, and it’s all about practicality without sacrificing style. The new 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster is standard, joined by a free-standing infotainment display that comes in either 10.5 or 12.9 inches, depending on the trim. You can also opt for a head-up display on higher-spec versions. An important new feature is the introduction of the Arene software, described by Toyota as the first step toward “fully software-defined vehicles”. This platform powers the latest version of the Toyota Audio Multimedia infotainment system with all modern connectivity features, and supports the improved Toyota Safety Sense 4.0 ADAS suite which makes a debut on the new RAV4. Unfortunately, the physical climate controls are gone, but the digital versions are now permanently displayed at the bottom of the central touchscreen, right next to the home button. Practicality gets a boost with a redesigned center console that features two cup holders and extra storage compartments, along with a small toggle switch shifter found on select trims with shift-by-wire. For audiophiles, there’s an available nine-speaker JBL Premium Audio system, upgrading the standard six-speaker setup. More: Toyota’s C-HR Returns To America But It’s Nothing Like You Remember Toyota is also offering a variety of interior materials, including fabric, SofTex, and perforated Ultrasuede. Depending on the trim, you’ll also get unique touches, like all-weather mats and a special Mineral upholstery color in the Woodland trim, or Gazoo Racing emblems and aluminum pedals in the GR Sport. Carry-Over Chassis, Electrified-Only Lineup Despite the “new generation” label, the RAV4 still rides on an upgraded version of the existing TNGA-K platform. That said, Toyota has made some notable tweaks under the surface, reinforcing the frame joints and suspension mounting points to boost structural rigidity. They’ve also introduced a high-damping adhesive, which Toyota claims helps reduce micro-vibrations and road noise. The GR Sport, which is a first for the US market, gets a more rigid chassis and unique suspension and steering tuning courtesy of Toyota’s Gazoo Racing division. Whether these changes actually improve the driving experience remains to be seen, but we’re cautiously optimistic. Perhaps the biggest change is that the RAV4 is now entirely electrified. Gone is the gas-only version of the previous model, making way for self-charging hybrid (HEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) options, both featuring a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. TOYOTA RAV4 GR SPORT The RAV4 Hybrid now delivers a combined 226 hp (229 PS) in the new FWD configuration, and 236 hp (239 PS) in AWD, or 17 more horsepower than its predecessor. Meanwhile, the RAV4 PHEV comes standard with AWD and cranks out 320 hp (324 PS), a boost of 18 hp. Toyota claims that updates to the transaxle, power control unit, a larger battery pack, and the addition of silicon carbide semiconductors in the front axle all contribute to the extra power. On top of the added power, the RAV4 PHEV’s EV-only range has been bumped up by 8 miles (13 km), now reaching an estimated 50 miles (80 km). And if you’re rolling with the high-spec XSE or Woodland trims, you get the added bonus of DC fast charging with a CCS port instead of the standard J1772. This means you can go from 10% to 80% charge in just 30 minutes. Towing capacity kicks off at 1,750 pounds (794 kg) for the FWD models and maxes out at a more impressive 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg) in select AWD trims. So, if you’re thinking of hauling something a bit more substantial than a kayak, the AWD versions will be your go-to choice. Pricing And Availability The 2026 Toyota RAV4 is expected to hit U.S. dealerships in late 2025, with pricing details to follow closer to launch. TOYOTA RAV4 LIMITED",
