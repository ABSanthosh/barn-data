Equipment includes a five-speed manual transmission, a Powr-Lok limited slip differential, a black soft top, grille-mounted Cibie driving lights, independent front suspension, ventilated disc brakes, 15″ BBS wheels, front bucket seats, power windows, and an aftermarket stereo. Now showing 24k miles, this Aston Martin is offered on dealer consignment with an Aston Martin Heritage Trust Vehicle Heritage Certificate, a copy of the car record card, factory luggage, a tool kit, owner’s manuals, service records, two sets of keys, and a clean New Jersey title. Introduced in June 1978, the V8 Volante featured hand-built aluminum bodywork as well as a power-operated convertible top, a mesh grille, twin round headlights, fender vents, and an integrated rear spoiler. This example is finished in Cannock Black and includes grille-mounted Cibie driving lights and hand-crafted aluminum alloy body panels. A replacement Everflex soft top was installed in April 2024 and serviced in December of the same year. The Carfax report notes an accident in October 2003 resulting in damage to the front end. The 15″ BBS wheels are mounted with 235/70 Avon Turbosteel 70 tires. A matching BBS spare is stored in the trunk. The car was equipped from the factory with an independent front suspension, de Dion rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes. The brake fluid was flushed in 2020. The seats are upholstered in black Connolly leather that extends to the center console and door panels. Amenities include wood interior trim, power windows, an aftermarket Alpine stereo, and a heater. Service in 2021 included repairing the glovebox lock, heater sending unit, and heater valve. The glovebox was repaired again in 2023 and the door weatherstripping was replaced. Close-up photos of the wood trim are provided in the gallery. The two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 7k-rpm tachometer, a 200-mph speedometer, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage. The five-digit odometer shows 24k miles. The dashboard relays were replaced in 2024. The 5.3-liter V8 is equipped with Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection. The thermostat was replaced in 2021, and service since 2023 has included changing the oil, repairing the wiring, cleaning the crankshaft sensor, and replacing the hood struts, battery, injector relay, and fuel pump relays. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed dog-leg manual transmission and a Powr-Lok limited slip differential. Service in 2020 included replacing the flywheel, clutch assembly, pilot bearing, and release bearing. The Aston Martin Trust Vehicle Heritage Certificate lists the factory colors and equipment numbers. A copy of the car record card is shown in the gallery below. The original Tanner Krolle luggage is included in the sale as are a tool kit, owner’s manuals, two sets of keys, rear headrests, and a binder of records. The Carfax report notes the aforementioned accident and lists history in New Jersey from new. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
