But with so many models on sale, how do you choose the best for your driveway?  Ever since Ferdinand Porsche released the 356 in 1948, the Porsche brand has become synonymous with performance and quality.  Whether you’re looking for a car to run around a race track, a daily driver or an SUV for school pick-ups, there’s a Porsche that’s tailored to your needs.  We know the Porsche 911 S/T is an incredible five-star car and the Porsche 911 GT3 RS is the ideal track-day toy, but these are our favourites and the best Porsches on sale from each model group. This is the last petrol model to be built on Porsche's mid-engined platform and the most powerful derivative of the Boxster since production began in 1995.The 718 Spyder RS is the drop top-sibling to the 718 Cayman GT4 RS coupé, both sharing the same 493bhp 4.0-litre six-cylinder engine. The Boxster is more focused and slightly less suited to the road than the Cayman, but the engine’s immediacy and dulcet tones make it a must-have if you’re not using your Porsche for day-to-day mundanities.Finance this car with Drivenfi Lightweight simplicity and driver appeal is what the 911 Carrera T is all about. How lightweight? Well, the Carrera T ditches most of the regular 911’s sound deadening and even goes as far as swapping in a more compact battery. This car is the only new Porsche to combine a 380bhp twin-turbocharged flat-six engine with three pedals, too.Finance this car with DrivenfiThere are plenty of options when it comes to the Cayenne, but our favourite is the S, complete with its 4.0 litre V8 engine. It comes with four-wheel drive as standard, a spacious boot and loads of leg room, making it a great family-friendly SUV. Inside, there’s a high-resolution digital dashboard with the option to upgrade to a passenger side touchscreen too. But despite the fancy technology, the car doesn’t miss the mark when it comes to physical buttons, as it has physical climate controls and even an old-school volume dial.Finance this car with Drivenfi If you’re looking for a 718 Cayman as day-to-day transport, the GTS 4.0 is the one for you. The six-cylinder 394bhp engine makes this car thrilling to drive but also offers a linearity that makes it easy to potter around in.Plus, the primary ride control is exemplary and you can really glide serenely over bumps.The steering response of the GTS is seamless too: it feels like there's no interruption between you and the road.Finance this car with DrivenfiThis fast-charging SUV is a worthy successor to the petrol Macan, being an electric car that looks and, crucially, feels like a Porsche.It comes in four different derivatives: Macan, 4, 4S and Turbo. We suggest opting for the regular car, which comes with 365bhp.The motors are positioned behind the axles, in a nod to the 911, allowing for more expressive, rearward-biased handling.And with the option of an augmented-reality head-up display, which projects sat-nav prompts at an effective distance of 10m ahead of the driver, you will be living in the future with this Porsche.Finance this car with Drivenfi As the only V8-engined non-hybrid Panamera going, it would be wrong not to include the GTS in this list. Its 494bhp engine has exhaust tuning that really brings out the aural appeal of a V8.Its handling is poised, level and precise and for a car of its weight (more than two tonnes): there's plenty of cornering balance, which is just what you would expect from a Porsche GT. Finance this car with DrivenfiThe Taycan 4S Sport Turismo is the most powerful Porsche on this list, at 537bhp, enabling it to sprint from 0-62mph in 2.8sec.The electric estate's performance, charging speed and range were all improved with a recent update.Its handling is precise and coherent, too. Team this with a refined ride and efficient powertrain and the Taycan is a great choice of Porsche if you want to go down the EV route. Finance this car with DrivenfiHOW WE TESTED AND SELECTED Our article is written alongside our road testers. Collectively, they have driven every Porsche on sale in the UK. This list includes all Porsche model types, and we include electric, PHEV and ICE cars in this article.
