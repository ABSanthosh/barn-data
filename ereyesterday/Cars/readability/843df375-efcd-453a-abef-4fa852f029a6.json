  "description": "It’s no secret Tesla is not your traditional car company and, as such, does things rather differently. In a fittingly unpredictable and chaotic series of events, the brand went from uncertain about India plans to sudden Mumbai showroom opening to surprise Model Y launch to “your test drive is at noon tomorrow” in the blink of an eye. The media test drive, too, is unlike any other we’ve seen before. 1.5 hours on a fixed route with two Tesla representatives in the car at all times. Suffice it to say, this will be merely a teaser, rather than an outright review, but we relish the opportunity nonetheless. This is, after all, a brand and a model that has sparked intrigue with Indians for years, and it’s finally here in the spec that customers will buy. 2025 Tesla Model Y Exterior Design and Engineering – 5/10 Futuristic, oddball design that is entirely function over form. The shape of the Model Y allows it to cut through the air as cleanly as possible. To call the Model Y an SUV is a stretch; crossover would describe it more accurately. It does appear to have sufficient ground clearance, which on global models is listed as 167mm (unladen), the window sill is high, and though the roof is tall, it arcs down to the edge of the tailgate like a fastback. It’s all in the name of aerodynamics, allowing the Model Y to carve the cleanest possible line through the air, and contributing here are its new, smoothened-out face, flush door handles and 19-inch wheels with aero caps. The new split headlamp treatment features an LED bar that connects the DRLs, with the headlamps moved into slim vestibules below. Surround cameras tucked away in the front flanks and B-pillars. There are some interesting details though, like the surround cameras hidden in the front flanks and the B pillars for more accurate angles of view, and the charging port hidden in the side of the left tail-lamp, motoring open when you tap it. There are some characterful creases in the bonnet and doors, but the coolest addition is the rear light bar that is actually hidden behind the trim piece, but shines onto the tailgate, illuminating the Tesla wordmark. Neat-looking rear light bar is hidden behind the trim piece. Speaking of the tailgate, it’s powered and can be remote opened and closed, and lifts to reveal a positively cavernous 938-litre boot, which expands to over 2,100 litres with the seats folded. You’ll find no spare wheel here, however, thought there is some underfloor storage and a nicely integrated foldable luggage cover. Should you want more storage still, there is a 117-litre frunk under the bonnet. The Model Y boot space is 938 litres, expandable up to a massive 2,138 litres. When it comes to the Tesla Model Y colours, there are 6 to choose from, but there’s a catch. Only Stealth Grey is standard, while the rest are paid options – Pearl White (Rs 95,000), Diamond Black (Rs 95,000), Glacier Blue (Rs 1,25,000), Ultra Red (Rs 1,85,000) and the one you see here, Quicksilver (Rs 1,85,000). 2025 Tesla Model Y Interior Space and Comfort – 8/10 Excellent use of space, though materials don’t befit the price. A huge 15.4-inch infotainment touchscreen takes centre stage in the cabin. You could credit Tesla for a lot of the trends we see in many modern EVs (and cars in general), and that’s plain to see here. The cabin works around a minimalist philosophy, removing as much clutter as possible for a clean and soothing look. It’s dominated by a 15.4-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen that operates almost every single car function. In fact, the only controls outside of it are the hazard light switch, a newly added indicator stalk, and a few controls on the steering wheel. The steering-mounted controls are among the few physical controls inside the Model Y. The effect is staggering; even with the standard all-black interior (black and white is a Rs 95,000 option), it gives a great sense of space, helped no doubt by strategic placement of contrast stitching, grey fabric trim and ambient lighting. However, fit and finish, while good, is not quite up to what you’d expect from a car of this price. And, minimalism aside, it’s quite a conventional dashboard design, with a T-shaped dashboard and a centre console dominated by dual wireless phone chargers and huge storage bins. The concealed AC vents and lack of instrument binnacle take some getting used to though. The front seats are high-set and comfortable with a decent amount of support. Rear seats are quite spacious and comfortable. There’s a second screen, but it’s not where you might think. It’s between the front seats for the rear passengers, and is surprisingly well featured, not just operating the HVAC, but also allowing for video playback, games and other apps. The rear seat itself is quite impressive too, with lots of head and leg room, excellent foot room under the front seats, and surprisingly good thigh support for an EV. Comfort is good, too, with nice cushioning, although there’s no rear-seat recline or window blinds. In fact, there’s no sunblind for the huge glass roof either, which could pose a problem in the summer. 2025 Tesla Model Y Features and Safety – 8/10 Huge and innovative features list but lack of buttons is frustrating. We have to address the lack of physical controls right up front, because clean as it makes the interior look, having to go two menus deep to perform even basic functions while driving is frustrating. Tesla encourages you to leave everything in ‘auto’ and let the car handle it for you, but having to adjust the AC vents via touch, moving the mirrors from the steering wheel, figuring out where in the menu the headlight controls are and even engaging Drive and Reverse via the screen seems like it would never stop being annoying. Main touchscreen is slick and smooth, but virtually every in-car function has to be executed through it. With that out of the way, however, what a screen it is! It looks incredibly crisp, the UI design feels near perfect, and it performs with the speed and fluidity of a high-spec gaming computer. Navigation uses Google Maps overlaid on Tesla’s own interface, and the two merge together seamlessly. It’s a generally clean look, but should you want more data, there’s a wealth of it available just a few menus away. It multitasks without a stutter, letting you run multiple apps free of lag, and you can even keep the crisp surround camera display on at all times. You can adjust the AC, watch movies, and play games on the rear entertainment screen. There are, incidentally, 8 cameras in total – 2 up front, 4 on the sides, 1 at the rear and 1 inside – and they are responsible for powering this car’s (in)famous autonomous driving tech – Autopilot. The feature is a Rs 6 lakh option in India, but one that will only be made available once legislation allows it, though whether it would be able to function here at all is anyone’s guess. Until then, you get ADAS features, like lane-keep assist, lane-watch cameras and blind spot monitoring, which work well. It also renders a scarily accurate real-time animation of vehicles and traffic around the car, which in Mumbai traffic was an amusingly chaotic (and distracting) mess. Massive panoramic glass roof lets in loads of light, but could be troublesome in the summers. The touchscreen appears and functions more like a tablet computer than a car’s infotainment screen, with an app for just about everything. You can pair your phone, yes, but it’s easier to just log into your favourite apps in the car itself, and let it sync up for you. There are games you can play, and even a host of ‘toy box’ apps to amuse you while you wait for a full charge, including a music composer, a sketch pad, a romantic fireplace mode and ‘emissions mode’, which lets you… simulate flatulence. Front seats are heated and ventilated. Other feature highlights include 9 airbags, a ‘sentry’ mode that records suspicious activity, a pet mode which keeps the AC running after you leave, a biohazard mode that purges the cabin of airborne impurities, heated and ventilated front seats, dual wireless phone chargers, the huge glass roof, and yes, that all-encompassing touchscreen. 2025 Tesla Model Y Range and Charging – 8/10 Good WLTP ratings and appears to hold its charge well. Model Y offers up to 622km of claimed range. The Tesla Model Y is available in two versions in India – the RWD and the RWD Long Range. The former uses an 63kWh battery and is rated at 500km of range on the WLTP cycle, while the latter uses an 83kWh battery and is rated at 622km of range. Those are good numbers relative to rivals, and though we were not able to do a range test in our short time driving the car, we did note that with regen activated and ‘standard’ drive mode in use, its indicated range depleted quite slowly. It's also worth noting that while the Model Y uses the NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug in the US, in India, it is equipped with the more commonly used CCS2 charging port. While specifics are tight, Tesla says the Model Y can gain 267km of driving range in just 15 minutes using one of its high-speed Superchargers, which will be installed in key locations across India. The Model Y RWD maxes out at 175kW fast charging, while the Long Range can charge at up to 250kW. 2025 Tesla Model Y Performance and Refinement – 8/10 Silent and strong, but rivals feel more ‘ludicrous’. The Model Y sprints from 0-100kph in as little as 5.6 seconds. Here too, Tesla is shy with the numbers but it says the Model Y RWD does 0-100kph in 5.9sec, while the RWD Long Range does it in 5.6sec. This is because not only are their battery sizes and ranges different, their power outputs are too. Both models use a single motor mounted on the rear axle, but the RWD power output is 299hp, while the long-range produces 340hp, and both cars have a top speed of 201kph. These numbers fall shy of rivals like the BYD Sealion 7 and Volvo EC40 and on par with the Kia EV6, though all the others are offered with dual-motor AWD setups. Again, a more thorough test will reveal more, but our initial impressions of the standard RWD version in Mumbai traffic revealed a benign and predictable power delivery that should be easy to get used to, even for first-time EV owners. There are only two power modes – Standard and Chill – and the latter, as the name suggests, dulls responses. Moreover, there are two regen modes – Reduced and Standard – which feel poles apart. The former appears to offer almost no resistance, while the latter is strong and allows for one-pedal driving. Between the two sets of modes, buyers should be able to find a comfortable compromise. 2025 Tesla Model Y Ride Comfort and Handling – 7/10 Firm but solid ride and predictable handling. 19-inch alloys contribute to clunky low-speed ride, but things gets better as you speed up. On our short urban drive made up mostly of traffic and flyovers, again, there was little that could be ascertained. Steering modes are separate from the drive modes and can be set to three levels, though the differences between them felt minimal. There’s great manoeuvrability on offer, as all steering modes feel light and quick enough around town, though there isn’t a whole lot of feel or feedback. As a bonus, frontal and lateral visibility is great, thanks to that large glass area. While there are no adaptive dampers in the traditional sense, Tesla says the Model Y’s double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension ‘adjusts itself’ depending on the load exerted. Ride quality is on the firm side, giving it a solid, planted, feel that gets better as you go faster. However, at low speeds, it can feel a little clunky over potholes, no doubt in part due to those 19-inch alloy wheels. 2025 Tesla Model Y Price and Verdict – 6/10 Undeniable tech and wow factor, but too expensive for what you get. The Model Y is the right inaugural model for Tesla India. So yes, after a long wait and much uncertainty, Tesla is finally here, and what but the Model Y to kick off its India innings. For a time the best-selling car in the world, it’s a crossover with decent ground clearance and the more affordable of the two in Tesla’s stable. It’s everything Indian Tesla fans had been yearning for, especially after the 2025 refresh, which updated not only the looks, but also several functions. In fact, regular updates (mostly via software) are what Tesla is all about, which lets it keep its cars at the cutting edge, and its this startup-like approach that makes it completely unlike traditional carmakers. The heart, or rather the brain, of the Model Y is that central screen, and it truly is the main draw of the vehicle. Yes, there should have been hard switches too, but purely as a touchscreen, this one is a shining example to all carmakers. It feels like revolutionary tech, but there’s no getting around the fact that rivals are hot on Tesla’s heels, and in other aspects, have even gotten ahead. From a mechanical standpoint, many if not most do things better these days, with more power, more engaging handling and even a bit of character. The Model Y price is at the upper end of its segment. What makes that pill harder to swallow is the price, which is at the upper end of this car’s segment, and that’s assuming you choose the standard interior and exterior colour. Being a CBU import has subjected the Model Y to the full extent of EV taxation and duties, costing Rs 60 lakh for the RWD and Rs 68 lakh for the Long Range RWD (ex-showroom, India). At these prices, customers might expect a bit more in terms of perceived luxury and performance. That said, the Model Y didn’t become the global bestseller without reason, and there will no doubt be those for whom its state-of-the-art tech, spacious interior and bombastic brand value make it worth every penny.

The new split headlamp treatment features an LED bar that connects the DRLs, with the headlamps moved into slim vestibules below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tesla_Model_Y_Side_Camera.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSurround cameras tucked away in the front flanks and B-pillars.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are some interesting details though, like the surround cameras hidden in the front flanks and the B pillars for more accurate angles of view, and the charging port hidden in the side of the left tail-lamp, motoring open when you tap it.

The cabin works around a minimalist philosophy, removing as much clutter as possible for a clean and soothing look. It’s dominated by a 15.4-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen that operates almost every single car function. In fact, the only controls outside of it are the hazard light switch, a newly added indicator stalk, and a few controls on the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tesla_Model_Y_Steering_Controls.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe steering-mounted controls are among the few physical controls inside the Model Y.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effect is staggering; even with the standard all-black interior (black and white is a Rs 95,000 option), it gives a great sense of space, helped no doubt by strategic placement of contrast stitching, grey fabric trim and ambient lighting. However, fit and finish, while good, is not quite up to what you’d expect from a car of this price. And, minimalism aside, it’s quite a conventional dashboard design, with a T-shaped dashboard and a centre console dominated by dual wireless phone chargers and huge storage bins. The concealed AC vents and lack of instrument binnacle take some getting used to though. The front seats are high-set and comfortable with a decent amount of support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tesla_Model_Y_Rear_Seats.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRear seats are quite spacious and comfortable.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a second screen, but it’s not where you might think. It’s between the front seats for the rear passengers, and is surprisingly well featured, not just operating the HVAC, but also allowing for video playback, games and other apps. The rear seat itself is quite impressive too, with lots of head and leg room, excellent foot room under the front seats, and surprisingly good thigh support for an EV. Comfort is good, too, with nice cushioning, although there’s no rear-seat recline or window blinds. In fact, there’s no sunblind for the huge glass roof either, which could pose a problem in the summer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 Tesla Model Y Features and Safety – 8/10\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHuge and innovative features list but lack of buttons is frustrating.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have to address the lack of physical controls right up front, because clean as it makes the interior look, having to go two menus deep to perform even basic functions while driving is frustrating. Tesla encourages you to leave everything in ‘auto’ and let the car handle it for you, but having to adjust the AC vents via touch, moving the mirrors from the steering wheel, figuring out where in the menu the headlight controls are and even engaging Drive and Reverse via the screen seems like it would never stop being annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tesla_Model_Y_Infotainment_Touchscreen.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMain touchscreen is slick and smooth, but virtually every in-car function has to be executed through it.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that out of the way, however, what a screen it is! It looks incredibly crisp, the UI design feels near perfect, and it performs with the speed and fluidity of a high-spec gaming computer. Navigation uses Google Maps overlaid on Tesla’s own interface, and the two merge together seamlessly. It’s a generally clean look, but should you want more data, there’s a wealth of it available just a few menus away. It multitasks without a stutter, letting you run multiple apps free of lag, and you can even keep the crisp surround camera display on at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250721080848_Tesla_Model_Y_Rear_Seat_Controls.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can adjust the AC, watch movies, and play games on the rear entertainment screen.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are, incidentally, 8 cameras in total – 2 up front, 4 on the sides, 1 at the rear and 1 inside – and they are responsible for powering this car’s (in)famous autonomous driving tech – Autopilot. The feature is a Rs 6 lakh option in India, but one that will only be made available once legislation allows it, though whether it would be able to function here at all is anyone’s guess. Until then, you get ADAS features, like lane-keep assist, lane-watch cameras and blind spot monitoring, which work well. It also renders a scarily accurate real-time animation of vehicles and traffic around the car, which in Mumbai traffic was an amusingly chaotic (and distracting) mess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Tesla_Model_Y_Ponoramic_Sunroof.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMassive panoramic glass roof lets in loads of light, but could be troublesome in the summers.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe touchscreen appears and functions more like a tablet computer than a car’s infotainment screen, with an app for just about everything.

The former uses an 63kWh battery and is rated at 500km of range on the WLTP cycle, while the latter uses an 83kWh battery and is rated at 622km of range. Those are good numbers relative to rivals, and though we were not able to do a range test in our short time driving the car, we did note that with regen activated and ‘standard’ drive mode in use, its indicated range depleted quite slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also worth noting that while the Model Y uses the NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug in the US, in India, it is equipped with the more commonly used CCS2 charging port. While specifics are tight, Tesla says the Model Y can gain 267km of driving range in just 15 minutes using one of its high-speed Superchargers, which will be installed in key locations across India. The Model Y RWD maxes out at 175kW fast charging, while the Long Range can charge at up to 250kW.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 Tesla Model Y Performance and Refinement – 8/10\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSilent and strong, but rivals feel more ‘ludicrous’.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250721082908_Tesla_Model_Y_Rear_Quarter_Tracking_1.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Model Y sprints from 0-100kph in as little as 5.6 seconds.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere too, Tesla is shy with the numbers but it says the Model Y RWD does 0-100kph in 5.9sec, while the RWD Long Range does it in 5.6sec. This is because not only are their battery sizes and ranges different, their power outputs are too. Both models use a single motor mounted on the rear axle, but the RWD power output is 299hp, while the long-range produces 340hp, and both cars have a top speed of 201kph.

There are only two power modes – Standard and Chill – and the latter, as the name suggests, dulls responses. Moreover, there are two regen modes – Reduced and Standard – which feel poles apart. The former appears to offer almost no resistance, while the latter is strong and allows for one-pedal driving.

Steering modes are separate from the drive modes and can be set to three levels, though the differences between them felt minimal. There’s great manoeuvrability on offer, as all steering modes feel light and quick enough around town, though there isn’t a whole lot of feel or feedback. As a bonus, frontal and lateral visibility is great, thanks to that large glass area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile there are no adaptive dampers in the traditional sense, Tesla says the Model Y’s double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension ‘adjusts itself’ depending on the load exerted. Ride quality is on the firm side, giving it a solid, planted, feel that gets better as you go faster. However, at low speeds, it can feel a little clunky over potholes, no doubt in part due to those 19-inch alloy wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 Tesla Model Y Price and Verdict – 6/10\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eUndeniable tech and wow factor, but too expensive for what you get.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250721075314_22.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Model Y is the right inaugural model for Tesla India.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo yes, after a long wait and much uncertainty, Tesla is finally here, and what but the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/tesla-model-y-india-price-for-colours-and-options-revealed-436168\"\u003eModel Y to kick off its India innings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. For a time the best-selling car in the world, it’s a crossover with decent ground clearance and the more affordable of the two in Tesla’s stable. It’s everything Indian Tesla fans had been yearning for, especially after the 2025 refresh, which updated not only the looks, but also several functions. In fact, regular updates (mostly via software) are what Tesla is all about, which lets it keep its cars at the cutting edge, and its this startup-like approach that makes it completely unlike traditional carmakers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe heart, or rather the brain, of the Model Y is that central screen, and it truly is the main draw of the vehicle. Yes, there should have been hard switches too, but purely as a touchscreen, this one is a shining example to all carmakers.

Being a CBU import has subjected the Model Y to the full extent of EV taxation and duties, costing Rs 60 lakh for the RWD and Rs 68 lakh for the Long Range RWD (ex-showroom, India). At these prices, customers might expect a bit more in terms of perceived luxury and performance. That said, the Model Y didn’t become the global bestseller without reason, and there will no doubt be those for whom its state-of-the-art tech, spacious interior and bombastic brand value make it worth every penny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/auto-features/tesla-model-y-vs-rivals-price-specifications-comparison-436173\"\u003eTesla Model Y vs rivals: Price, specifications comparison\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/auto-features/cybertruck-teslas-tech-marvel-driven-in-india-436134\"\u003eCybertruck: Tesla\u0026#39;s tech marvel driven in India\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-436284\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-436284\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-436284\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-436284\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-436284\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-436284\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
