    "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment is a crowded space for sure, with contenders that include Kia’s own Sonet. The Korean automaker has now introduced another player in the mix; enter the Syros, positioned above the Sonet and below the Seltos in Kia’s portfolio. Kia Syros platform and engineering Interestingly, while the Sonet is based on Kia’s K2 platform, the Syros is underpinned by the smaller K1 platform that underpins cars like the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios, Exter and international models like the Casper and Inster. The company says that using the newer K1 platform has enabled it to bring in the latest electrical and electronics architecture with abilities like customer-requested remote diagnosis and over-the-air (OTA) updates beyond the infotainment system; for body controllers, for instance. While the Sonet, Seltos, Carens and EV6 do not have controllers that can be updated OTA, the Syros has 16, the Carnival has 26 and the EV9 has 45. The unconventional and funky styling will surely divide opinion.  The company refers to the Syros’ platform as the reinforced K1, given that it has been strengthened with a lot of hot-stamped parts in the body shell. Although Kia is tight-lipped on what crash rating it is targeting, it expects the Syros to perform well. Kia Syros exterior design Kia has bestowed the Syros with a host of tech and safety updates to make it stand out in a sea of sub-4-metre SUVs, and it has smartly chosen a rather unconventional route – the styling; it is very quirky and will displease some, but there’s a lot to like, too. For one, while the looks may be quirky, they also come across as funky and cool – at least to these eyes – as the overall proportions are well-defined. There are many neat styling details around the car like the stacked ‘ice-cube’ headlights, which look cool. They are bracketed by vertical Daytime Running Lamps (DRLs) and the entire unit is pushed to the corners; it could easily sustain damage during parking skirmishes due to its positioning. Stacked ‘ice-cube’ headlights bordered by vertical DRLs look unique. The nose is very upright and has a closed off ‘grille area’ – a nod, perhaps, to the EV version coming next year. The air intake area is set below and split by the number plate housing. Below that is the silver skid plate-like garnish, a treatment which is repeated at the sides and on the rear bumper, too. Wheel sizes vary between 15-inch steel to 16- and 17-inch alloy rims. There’s a chunky black cladding around the wheel arches and the front and rear fenders are chunky, too. The bottom edges of the window line of the B-pillar are curved upwards, giving the lower glass line a rounded-edge profile. The cladding, which starts at the front bumper, runs across the doors and into the rear fenders and rear bumper.And, like the headlights, the tail-lamp units also merge with the cladding and carry LED stop lamps and turn signal bulbs. The rear windscreen and pillars are flanked by cool-looking L-shaped DRLs.Adding to the funky elements are fun body colours like a metallic red and two blue shades, including this ‘Frost Blue’ our test car came in. Kia Syros interior design Three screen display looks cool; centre screen obscured by steering rim.  While the exteriors might be polarising, the interiors will likely find many happy buyers. This is the main focus area and differentiator for the Syros, and it starts with the design. There are some unconventional elements, like the new squircle steering wheel with an off-centre Kia logo, but the overall design like the AC vents, instrument display and centre console, look conventional. There are four different interior colour schemes depending on the variant,and they all have a youthful pallet with lively off-set colour accents all around the cabin.The colour scheme can be further tweaked with 64-colour ambient lighting.There’s a lot of sustainable and recycled materials used, and the look and feel is really very good, which is typical Kia. The mix of colours and textures give off a high-quality feel and you really have to poke at surfaces to look for hard plastics areas, which are few. The cube-like gear knob is nicely styled, and it has a dual-tone design with an accent colour and an illuminated P-R-N-D indicator. Ahead of the gear lever is a wireless charging pad, which is light grey in colour with tiny specks of colour. A wireless charging pad, two USB-C ports and a 12V charging outlet on offer in the front.   Kia Syros space and comfort One look at the tall-boy design and you know the Syros will have good headroom, which it does. Legroom at the rear is excellent as well, with Kia making good use of the 2,550mm wheelbase, which, for reference, is more than the Sonet’s and those of competitors like the Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Hyundai Venue and the Tata Nexon, which are around the 2,500mm mark. First-in-segment rear seat slide and recline; ventilation for seat base only.  Occupants at the rear can further tweak space as the seats slide and recline, and the backrest can be locked into multiple recline angles. The rear seats also boast of a segment-first cooled seats; however, while the front seats get cooling for the base and backrest, only the seat base is cooled at the rear. This isn’t due to a cost issue, but an engineering one; Kia was finding it difficult to package a blower unit into the rear seatbacks and still manage recline and slide to the desired degree. For the update, though, Kia would do well to include seatback cooling, even if it means a lower recline angle. The seats are very comfy, but lumbar support of the front seats are a touch better. Boot space is also large and varies between 390 litres and 465 litres (with the second row seats slidforward completely). With the seatbacks upright and the rear seats in the forward-most position, there's 465 litres of boot space.   Kia Syros equipment and safety As we’ve come to expect of the brand, the Kia Syros’ equipment list is exhaustive. Dominating the dash is a large single glass panel that houses three screens: a 12.3-inch central touchscreen, a 12.3-inch instrument panel with customisable displays and a 5-inch HVAC touchscreen. The IP dials are, thankfully, clear to read. The temperature read out and control surface, however, is obscured by the steering wheel rim. Physical controls for main functions like temperate and blower control sit below, and these are nice,large and easy-to-use toggle switches. Interestingly, lower trims that miss out on the 5-inch screen have a more elaborate button bank.  360-degree camera also has a blind view monitor function. Other feature highlights include an air purifier, an 8-speaker Harman Kardon system, an on-board ‘hey Kia’ voice assistant,a 360-degree camera with a blind view monitor and a large dual-pane panoramic sunroof, which really brightens up an already airy cabin. There are a few clever little details, too, like the ability to lower and raise the windows using the key and the connectivity app. The app also has remote engine start. There are resizable cup holders that click open with the touch of a button and sun shades that flip to the side and slide backward. Large dual-pane sunroof adds to the vast openess of the cabin.  The Syros also comes equipped with camera and radar-based ADAS with all the expected functionality, including smart cruise control with a stop-go function. We tested this and the lane keeping assist for a brief period, and it performed well with smooth interventions; however, we’ll know more when we put the Syros through our exhaustive road test. Other safety kit includes hill start assist, ABS with ESC and brake force assist, and 6 airbags. Kia Syros engine, gearbox options 1.0-litre TGDi and 1.5-litre diesel (shown above) shared with the Sonet and Hyundai Venue. The Kia Syros is powered by the familiar 1.0 litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection (GDi) mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch auto or a 6-speed manual. While Hyundai has offered the 1.0 GDi with a manual, this combination is a first for Kia. Unlike many others in this segment, Kia also offers a diesel engine:a 1.5-litre unit that’s paired to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed sun and planetary (torque convertor) auto. The petrol and diesel autos also have three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sport – as well as three traction modes – Snow, Sand and Mud – that alters the traction control sensitivity to enable better grip on loose surfaces. Kia Syros petrol performance and efficiency The 1.0 GDi engine puts out a maximum of 120hp at 6,000rpm and 172Nm between 1,500 and 4,000rpm. It has enough pep when paired with the DCT auto, and in our initial tests, we clocked a 0-100kph time of 11.63 seconds in Sport mode. There is some turbo lag under 1,500rpm and power drops off at about 5,200rpm. You can use the steering wheel paddles but the gearbox will upshift regardless, even in manual mode. Left to its own devices, the DCT tends to upshift early,and you’ll often find it downshifting when you prod the throttle a little more than normal. You get the impression that the early upshifts are a means to avoid a hefty fuel bill, but its claimed fuel efficiency figures of 18.20kpl for the manual and 17.68kpl for the auto aren’t as high as some competitors, or even the Sonet. Both engines are reasonably quick, but in-cabin NVH levels are high.  At low speeds, gearshifts can be clunky at times, but the powertrain on the whole is refinedso long as it’s driven in a relaxed manner. Go slightly beyond, however, and things get quite vocal; even past 2,200rpm, the engine is quite audible inside which is a downer for a petrol unit. It could be due to low insulation along with the engine’s natural, gruff character as revs climb. We also drove the petrol manual for a short while and initial impressions are of a firm and springy clutch. Gear lever travel is smooth, though, with well-defined gates. For the enthusiastic driver, this powertrain combo will be fun; it’s easy to keep the engine in its power band with no software second guessing you. It’s also very tractable and you can bring speeds down to 25kph in fourth gear and pull away smoothly albeit slowly. Kia Syros diesel performance and efficiency Diesel's low end torque means off the line response is good.  The 1.5-litre diesel engine makes a maximum of 116hp at 4,000rpm and 250Nm of torque from 1,500-2,750rpm. It’s an engine we’ve come to like in the Sonet, Seltos and the Hyundai cars, and it proves to be likeable here, too. Thanks to the low-end power, off-the-line response is very good and the auto gearbox’s shifts are smooth, if a bit lazy. Driving at a relaxed pace is where it’s very happy with ample torque on tap making overtaking easy. You don’t have to reach for the paddles or contend with multiple downshifts. It’s quick enough, too, and our initial tests showed a 0-100kph time of 13.88 seconds. However, like the petrol engine,refinement is an issue here as well. You can hear the engine inside quite clearly post 2,500rpm, and once again, better insulation is the need of the hour.While both engines do not have that outright peppy character, it’s just fine given the clear comfort bias this car has, but that’s the very reason why NVH levels should have been better. Kia Syros ride and handling Tall-boy design means there is body roll while cornering. The Syros is a tall car with a heavy panoramic sunroof on top, so body roll, as expected, is present. If you do drive it enthusiastically around a corner, the body leans, but the damper’s initial compression is firm to limit this. However, this comes at the expense of a firm ride over ruts and potholes. The sharp edge is felt more on the diesel, but in both cars, the ruts never come crashing through. Steering feel is good and it weighs up for a secure enough feel at triple digit speeds, but it could have been lighter at city speeds. Kia Syros price and buying Prices for the Kia Syros are yet to be announced, and it will be interesting to see how Kia positions it between the Sonet and Seltos. Given that narrow brand, Kia has beensmart in looking beyond a price differentiation and chosen instead to substantially differentiate the Syros’ character with a clear singular focus. It’s not your typical upright SUV, not an enthusiastic sporty driver and not really a highway car either, what with the high NVH levels at high speeds. What it is centred on is squarely comfort and conveniences, and it does those brilliantly. The NVH issue is a shame, as, given the comfort orientation, a silent cabin would be appreciated. It checks every other box apart from that, though. The seats are comfy, the cooled function is a welcome addition and the rear has ample leg and headroom, with the handy recline and sliding function. Equipment levels are very good with all the expected bits like climate control, large digital displays, a premium sound system, a full connectivity and ADAS suite, and the dual-pane panoramic sunroof. Air purifier neatly tucked under the front centre armrest. The interior design, too, is modern and fresh and looks nice and premium. The choice of petrol and diesel engines along with manual and automatic ’boxes is another plus point. So, while the radical styling will not go down well with everyone, for those who like it or are willing to look past it, there’s clearly plenty to like. Our cities are getting more congested and people are spending more time in traffic, so if you must contend with this in your own car, the compact, comfy and well-equipped Syros fits the bill perfectly.

    "title": "UK will not achieve 2030 ZEV targets without help, says new Renault UK boss",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-government-and-legislation/uk-will-not-achieve-2030-zev-targets-without-help-says",
    "description": "Car makers must achieve an EV sales mix in 2025 of 28%, rising to 80% by 2030, or face heavy fines The UK will not achieve the government's target of 80% EV sales by 2030 without incentives of some kind being made available to private buyers. That's according to new Renault UK boss Adam Wood, who said that while the new Renault 5, priced from £22,240, can “break the glass ceiling” of mainstream electric car ownership, more is needed before mass take-up is achieved. Currently government legislation under the Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) Mandate demands that 28% of a carmaker's total sales are electric vehicles, rising each year to 80% in 2030. Heavy fines are dished out to those who miss these targets. Last year, 15% of Renault’s 86,000 UK sales were EV, 7% below 2024’s 22% target. Nevertheless, Q4’s EV sales mix of 22%, driven by the new Scenic E-Tech, showed promise “If we're to meet that ambitious target – and I appreciate that it is a delicate balancing act – we need a clear, robust plan, together across industry, with the charging industry as well, and with government, to get us there,” Wood told journalists at his first official briefing. Alongside incentives, Wood says Renault is demanding that installation of chargers be accelerated - especially on-street - as well as better communication between all parties involved in the consultation. This last part is probably the most important in terms of achieving success, Wood said, as “we are not seeing the demand curve hit the same curve demanded by the ZEV Mandate”. This means more dialogue is needed to set achievable targets. “It is a team game,” he added, “We need a system that brings confidence.” When asked which of these demands was the most important to Renault, he said: “I do not think it is an either/or situation. We have to address every customer concern if we are going to grow exponentially.” Another issue faced by car makers and legislators alike is that there is “no historical precedent” to look back on nor benchmark against when it comes to the mandate, said Wood, who added: “Certainly, it's an uncertain future. We just don't know the speed of demand.” To grow that speed, the price of EVs needs to drop, either by car makers bringing to market cheaper products, or incentives - either in the form of public charging VAT cutting or on the buying costs of cars - coming to the fore. “Customers are saying the major objections are, firstly, upfront purchase. Now, you're right that more and more [affordable] vehicles coming to the market are going to address that. Nevertheless, there is a perception there, and we need to listen to it. “What we need, is an acceleration quickly in the demand, which is target.” The Renault 5 and upcoming 4 show there is a demand for EVs, at the right price, says Wood,  and the inclusion of the new Twingo in the UK would help this further. “Cars that break the glass ceiling are always welcome,” he said, adding that he is “pushing for it” to come to the UK. Renault is still weighing up the viability of a right-hand drive Twingo. “The reaction here has been very good,” he added. “I think it makes sense to follow 4 and 5.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-ix-facelift-brings-426-miles-range-92k",
    "description": "New line-up comprises 402bhp 45, 536bhp 60 and 659bhp M70 models Extensive revisions give flagship EV up to 659bhp and a big range boost The BMW iX, the Munich firm’s tech-laden electric flagship, has received a major update with substantial power upgrades and an increase in efficiency that boosts its range to 426 miles. Due to reach the UK in May, with pricing starting from £74,400, the new version of the Audi Q8 E-tron and Volvo EX90 rival has received only a minor styling makeover, but the changes under the skin are more significant. Product manager Marisa Hammersen said BMW has “worked hard to really optimise the efficiency in every area we could”. As an example of that, she cited the use of new headlights that require less energy when illuminated. The German marque has revamped the electric motors with an improved silicon-carbide inverter to reduce power losses, while retuning the drive system and working on the electronics to boost efficiency. There are also new drive modes, including settings that offer extra performance and help to maximise efficiency. As before, the iX will be offered in three variants, each with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain. To highlight the promised performance improvements, the iX 40 and iX 50 have been succeeded by the 45 and 60, while the hot M60 has spawned an even more potent M70. Those new designations bring the iX in line with the i5 electric saloon. The entry-level iX 45 produces 402bhp – an increase of 80bhp – and 516lb ft of torque. Using a new 94.8kWh battery, it offers a range of up to 374 miles with an official efficiency of 2.97mpkWh. Offered in Sport and M Sport trim, the iX 45's £74,400 price marks a small increase from its predecessor. The iX 60 is offered only in M Sport trim, priced from £92,200, and produces 536bhp and 564lb ft. It features a new 109.1kWh battery that boosts its range in UK trim to that 426-mile headline figure – a chunky increase of up to 34 miles on its predecessor, depending on specification. Both the 45 and 60 have a limited top speed of 124mph. The M70 offers 659bhp and up to 811lb ft when launch control mode is deployed. It is powered by a bespoke performance-honed 108.9kWh battery featuring different cells and chemistry, giving it a range of 366 miles. With a top speed of 155mph, it is priced at £113,300 – a significant reduction from the £124,605 price of the outgoing iX M60. While the iX 45 can charge at speeds of 175kW, both higher-spec models can achieve 195kW. The batteries on all three variants feature a new cell technology that, claims BMW, offers around 30% more usable energy content. The firm has worked to optimise the battery pre-conditioning to enable it to reach peak charging speeds faster. The iX can also be charged at 22kW on an AC connection and it has a new heat pump as part of its efficiency push. There are new drive moves, too, including a max range function that optimises the vehicle's settings for efficiency and can boost range by a claimed 25%. Hammersen said “we put a major focus on the driving dynamics” and the chassis and suspension have been tuned for each model to better match their respective power outputs. The iX continues to sit on steel rather than air suspension, with work done on the dampers to make the vehicle more stable during cornering. Buyers will have a choice of 21in and 23in wheels. The flagship M70 also features active rear steering, improved ride control and M Sport brakes as standard. Across the range, the key exterior change is a revamped version of the large kidney grille, in this case a panel that houses many of the sensors for the car’s advanced driver assistance systems. The new design features vertical line elements that run through both the kidney grille and the LED headlights and that, said Hammersen, are intended to “reduce the dominance of the kidney”. Inside, cars fitted with the M Sport package gain new multifunction seats and an M steering wheel, among other styling elements. The revamped iX will continue to be produced at the firm’s Dingolfing plant in Germany and deliveries are due to begin in the first half of this year.",

There really is no other excuse for throwing our fragile meat sacks atop a steaming engine with wheels and rocketing through space like a game of Galaga, sans lasers and no extra lives. It’s fun. That’s where Bixby Moto comes in. Bringing a bit of levity to the often overly-serious culture of motorcycling. To break up the monotony of scowling mugs, airbrushed flames, and duck faces. So we decided to dig a little deeper and found the opportunity to catch up with Drew of Bixby Moto to ask him about the meaning of dreams, a little fashion advice, and what bull testicles taste like. Also, our joke funnel was a little dry.…",

    "description": "The Triumph Speed Triple turns 31 this year. In those three-plus decades, it has evolved in leaps and bounds and built an unrivaled cult following. Scores of riders love it for its unapologetic looks, sharp handling, and characterful triple-cylinder engine—this writer included. The new Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RS takes everything good about the newest incarnation of the Speed Triple and cranks it up another notch. Visually, there’s not much to distinguish the 2025 Speed Triple 1200 RS from the outgoing model—but although the updates are subtle, they’re also impactful. To be fair, last year’s Speed Triple hardly needed a refresh. First released in 2021, it boasted a new 1,160 cc engine and a lightweight, razor-sharp build that made it handle better than bikes half its weight.…",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us.
