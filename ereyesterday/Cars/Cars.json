    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Mahindra has launched the XEV 9e all-electric coupe-SUV with introductory prices starting at Rs 21.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the entry-level Pack One variant. The brand will reveal the complete price list in the latter half of January, just before the electric coupe-SUV shows up in showrooms. Do note that this price tag does not include the cost of the charger. The XEV 9e is the larger and more expensive of the two all-new born-electric SUVs launched by Mahindra today – the BE 6e priced from Rs 18.90 lakh being the other. Deliveries are said to begin in February or March 2025. XEV 9e gets 19-inch alloys (20-inch optional), 665-litre boot and 150-litre frunk  Feature highlights include three 12.3-inch screens, 16-speaker sound system XEV 9e with 79kWh battery has an MIDC range of 655km Mahindra XEV 9e dimensions and styling  The XEV 9e measures 4,790mm in length, 1,905mm in width, and 1,690mm in height. This makes it longer than the 4,695mm-long XUV700, and its wheelbase, at 2,775mm, is also more than the latter’s 2,750mm. Mahindra claims a ground clearance of 207mm and a 10-metre turning diameter.  The XEV 9e's grille area is blanked-out, atop which is an LED light bar that runs the width of the car and connects the techy-looking headlight clusters. The liberal use of piano black on the exterior is meant to give it a premium feel. It also gets flush door handles, a muscular shoulder line, and specially designed aero-optimised 19-inch alloy wheels for added range – 20-inch alloys are optional extras. At the rear, it gets slim, connected LED tail-lights placed right below the boot spoiler. The unique 'infinity Mahindra' illuminated logo will be seen on future XUV models. Mahindra XEV 9e interior highlights The 5-seater XEV 9e gets a unique three-screen setup with each screen measure 12.3-inch units. They are 1920x720 in resolution and run Mahindra’s Adrenox software. The EV also comes with a two-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Apart from this, the XEV 9e seems to carry over some switchgear from the XUV700, such as the HVAC and the centre console controls. It also gets an electronic parking brake, drive modes and brake-by-wire tech. The XEV 9e gets a 665-litre boot and a 150-litre frunk. The top-spec version of the e-SUV also features a panoramic sunroof, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon system with Dolby Atmos, an HUD, safety features such as 7 airbags, a Level 2 ADAS suite, a 360-degree camera and blind spot monitoring. The XEV also features park assist that can park the car for you. However, Mahindra has revealed that the entry-level variant, called the Pack One, will get 6 airbags, a reverse camera, an electronic parking brake and a tyre pressure monitor. Feature highlights will include the three-screen setup, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, connected car tech, 4 speakers and 2 tweeters, push button start, auto headlights and wipers, automatic climate control with rear AC vents, height adjust for the driver's seat and seat belt, tilt and telescopic steering adjust, Type C charging ports and 60:40 split-folding rear seats. Mahindra XEV 9e battery and charging details Just like the BE 6e, the XEV 9e is also underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform. Both also share the 59kWh and 79kWh LFP (Lithium-iron phosphate) batteries and get lifetime warranty on their battery packs. Mahindra claims that the batteries can be topped up from 20 to 80 percent in just 20 minutes using a 175kW DC fast charger. On the MIDC cycle, the XEV 9e with the larger 79kWh unit is said to go 656km on a single charge, while on the European WTLP cycle, Mahindra says the coupe-SUV goes 533km. In fact, the company says that in their real-world tests, the XEV 9e delivered over 500km. Mahindra XEV 9e powertrain details The XEV 9e comes with Mahindra’s ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ that consists of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. A 286hp and 380Nm motor drives the rear wheels when powered by the larger 79kWh battery, with Mahindra claiming a 0-100kph time of 6.7 seconds. The 59kWh unit comes with a 231hp motor. Mahindra claims that the front and rear disc setup, along with the brake by wire system, helps the XEV 9e brake from 100kph to a standstill in 40m. Also see: Mahindra XEV 9e image gallery",

    "description": "Mahindra has launched the much-anticipated BE 6e today with introductory prices starting at Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India). The BE 6e and the XEV 9e are the two new electric coupe-SUVs that Mahindra unveiled today. Apart from the design, which is arguably one of the biggest highlights of the BE 6e, some figures of interest include an ARAI-certified range of up to 682km, 281hp of max power and a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 6.7 seconds. The BE 6e is the first product from the newly constituted electric-only BE sub-brand. There will be more products under this name that have been previously previewed by the BE.07 and BE.09 concepts. Mahindra BE 6e gets 59kWh and 79kWh battery pack options Is available only in rear-wheel drive form at launch Full price list to be revealed in January at the Bharat Mobility Show Mahindra has currently revealed the price of only the base trim of the BE 6e, called the Pack One, and it is exclusive of the charger, which needs to be bought seperately. This variant is available with the smaller 59kWh battery pack; prices of higher-spec trims will be revealed later. Mahindra BE 6e exterior design What’s really impressive about the BE 6e is that it looks nearly identical to its very radical concept. In fact, the only noticeable differences on the production version of the SUV are the conventional wing mirrors as opposed to the cameras on the concept, and slightly different positioning of the flush-fitting door handles. Styling is sharp and edgy all around, and the pronounced wheel arches with the thick gloss black cladding around the sides and on the face creates a nice dual-tone finish for the exterior. A really cool detail is the air duct between the lights that channels air through the bonnet for better efficiency. Other elements that stand out include the illuminated logos, the C-shaped LED daytime running lamps enclosing the main headlamp cluster and the two-part split spoiler and full-width wraparound LED tail-lights at the rear. The high-deck rear with the coupe roofline and a wraparound glasshouse also give it a very distinct silhouette, but that seems to have pinched the rear window line compromising the view out. The rear bumper also gets a diffuser-like effect, further accentuating its sportiness. Mahindra BE 6e dimension The BE 6e measures 4,371mm in length, 1,907mm in width, 1,627mm in height and has a wheelbase of 2,775mm, which is identical to the XEV 9e. In fact, the wheelbase will be identical on all INGLO models to optimise costs and packaging. The coupe-SUV rides on 19-inch aero-optimised wheels with 245/55 section tyres, giving it a very strong road presence. One can also opt for larger 245/50 R20-inch wheels. Mahindra says the BE 6e has a ground clearance of 207mm and a turning circle of less than 10 metres which is pretty impressive. It has a boot space of 455 litres and an additional frunk space of 45 litres. Mahindra BE 6e interior and features The interior design is just as radical as the exterior, carrying forward a lot from the concept. The most distinctive element here is the halo-like trim that wraps around the driver, giving a cockpit-like feel to the interior. It extends from the dashboard to the centre console, houses the driver's AC vents and effectively splits the cabin into two; the passenger side AC vents are also seamlessly integrated in a slim strip on the dashboard. Instrumentation and entertainment duties are handled by dual, 12.3-inch floating screens running a new software called MAIA with 30+ pre-installed apps. The system has has 24 GB RAM, 128 GB storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 processor, which Mahindra claims is the fastest chipset in automotive grade. The infotainment system even gets three pre-set themes – Calm, Cozy and Club – with signature tunes curated by AR Rahman, ambient light and climate control adjustments. The BE 6e also gets a segment-first augmented reality head-up display. Other highlights include a new two-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated Mahindra logo and a floating centre console that houses an aircraft thrust lever-style drive mode selector, a rotary dial for the drive modes, a wireless charging pad and cup holders. Being a born-EV, there’s a nifty open storage area just below the floating centre panel. Another aircraft-style control panel on the roof houses lighting and sunroof controls, and it has unique strap-type interior door handles. Top-spec variants of the BE 6e get dual-zone climate control, a huge panoramic sunroof with integrated multi-colour lighting patterns and laminated glass which can block UV rays, auto park assist, an in-car camera, electronic parking brake, a Dolby Atmos 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, ambient lighting, powered driver’s seat with memory function, 5G connectivity with in-built Wi-Fi, OTA updates, Level 2 ADAS suite, 360-degree cameras, 7 airbags and the works! The 6e also allows for a unique BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) feature where you can plug-in any external device on the front seat backs and stream your desired content. Mahindra BE 6e interior battery, range and charging The Mahindra BE 6e will be offered with two battery packs – a 59kWh unit and a 79kWh unit – with Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. It is underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform which employs BYD’s blade cell technology, and uses what the brand calls a ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ made up of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. The BE 6e will be offered in two states of tune – the 59kWh variants produce 228hp, while the 79kWh variants produce 281hp; torque is rated at 380Nm for both. At launch, the BE 6e is only available in rear-wheel drive form, although an AWD version could be on cards for the future. Mahindra is claiming a 0-100kph sprint time of 6.7 seconds for the higher-spec variant of the BE 6e. The car offers three drive modes – Range, Everyday and Race – along with an additonal Boost mode that provides 10 seconds of max torque. These specs are also identical to the XEV e9.  The larger battery pack has an ARAI-claimed range of 682km, or a WLTP range of 550km; the smaller battery pack has an ARAI-certified range of 535km. Mahindra is also providing lifetime warranty on the battery pack and claims that the batteries can charge from 20 percent to 80 percent in just 20 minutes using a 175kW DC fast charger. As standard, however, the company will be providing either a 11.2kW AC charger (0-100 percent in 8hrs/6hrs for 79kWh/59kWh, respectively) or a 7.3kWh AC charger (0-100 percent in 11.7hrs/8.7hrs for 79kWh/59kWh, respectively), which must be bought separately. Other technical highlights of the BE 6e include adjustable regenerative braking, electric power steering with variable gear ratios, semi-active suspension, brake-by-wire technology and disc brakes on all four wheels. Mahindra will commence deliveries for the BE 6e from late February or early March 2025. Stay tuned for booking details and the full price list.  Also See: Mahindra BE 6e image gallery Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e to be sold through existing dealer network",

    "description": "Naked, supermoto, streetfigher, café racer, super-naked — whatever you want to call it (we’re leaning toward super-naked) — this 2008 KTM RC8 that recently rolled out of Deus Ex Machina’s garage is stark, uncompromising, and muscular. Where the stock RC8 is a fully faired superbike, albeit with some snarling angular character, it’s a race bike through and through. It’s more of a fencer — a scorekeeper, so to speak. “The Scrappier,” as our featured bike is known, is a cage fighter — less about the numbers and more about the experience. When the bike landed in the shop, the intention of Michael “Woolie” Woolaway, Deus’ in-house builder, was to turn this track-ready superbike into a ’roided out supermoto with Deus’ unique custom flavor.…",

One is a Harley Pan America with wild scrambler styling, the other is a classic Triumph TR6R Tiger bobber. The second half of our round-up covers new mid-sized releases from European OEMs; the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, and the KTM 790 Adventure. Harley-Davidson Pan America by Black Cycles This wild creation is the result of a dirt bike guy named Josh walking into a Harley dealership and leaving with a 2022 Harley-Davidson Pan America. Despite what literally every motorcycle manufacturer’s marketing department will tell you, an adventure bike is really not a dirt bike. Josh quickly realized this, but had a plan to remedy this situation: take the Pan Am to Noel Muller of Black Cycles Australia and let him work his magic.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jaecoo-7-upmarket-roader-lands-sub-%C2%A330k-price",
    "description": "First UK-bound car from Chery-owned 'premium off-road' brand targets both mainstream and premium marques The new Jaecoo 7, the first UK vehicle from the new ‘premium off-road’ brand, will arrive in in January, priced from £29,435 to take on rivals as broad as the Range Rover Evoque and Kia Sportage. Created by Chinese car giant Chery, Jaecoo – a portmanteau of 'jäeger', the German word for hunter, and 'cool' – is a sister brand to Omoda, which was launched in the UK earlier this year. While Omoda is focused on urban buyers seeking practicality, Jaecoo has a more upmarket and off-road focus. Affordability will be a key focus for both brands. Chery's UK boss, Victor Zhang, said that Jaecoo offered “the best of traditional off-road and sport utility brands, mixed with cutting-edge technology and style”.  The 7 will be offered with petrol and plug-in hybrid powertrains. At 4500mm, it's slightly shorter than the Sportage, Hyundai Tucson and Volkswagen Tiguan and 100mm longer than the Omoda 5 with which it shares a platform. The entry-level 7 will feature a 145bhp 1.6-litre four-cylinder turbo petrol engine driving the front wheels with 203lb ft of torque and an official economy of 37.7mpg. A four-wheel-drive model with the same power unit will be priced from £32,850. The 4WD plug-in hybrid range-topper combines a 1.5-litre turbo petrol four with an electric motor for total outputs of 201bhp and 229lb ft. The motor draws power from an 18.3kW battery that gives the PHEV an electric-only range of 56 miles. Jaecoo claims a combined economy of 403mpg (47mpg with the battery depleted), which, with a 60-litre fuel tank, gives an overall range of 745 miles.  The 4WD 7 is also claimed to offer genuine off-road ability, with seven driving modes, approach and departure angles of 21deg and 29deg and a breakover angle of 200mm. A Bosch-developed integrated power braking system can simulate a locking differential. It is priced at £35,065. As with the 5, European market versions of the 7 will feature bespoke suspension settings tuned for the higher speeds and roads here. Peter Matkin, Chery’s development chief, said: “We’ve enhanced our internal quality practices to make sure this is up there with the best in the market.\" The 7 features more rugged exterior styling than the 5, including a large front grille and chunky sidelines. Inside, entry-levels Deluxe models feature a 13.8in portrait-mounted touchscreen and Luxury models a 14.8in version. All trim levels include surround-view cameras, synthetic leather seats and a panoramic sunroof.  Luxury adds features including an eight-speaker Sony audio system. Unusually, the ICE and PHEV models feature slightly different interior designs. The ICE model features the gear shifter on the steering column and door handles reset in the door side, while the PHEV has a gear selector in the centre console and larger door rests. Jaecoo said this is to give the ICE car more of a stripped-out EV feel while making the PHEV feel more conventional and rugged. The 7 is available to order now, with first UK deliveries due in January 2025.",

    "title": "Confirmed: Government set to rework EV mandate",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/confirmed-government-set-rework-ev-mandate",
    "description": "Ministers will consult with car makers to find “options for a better way forward” Changes are set to be made to the UK’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, the government has confirmed, following a backlash from car makers over the rules. The decision was announced this evening by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, who said he was “concerned” by how the current “inherited” laws “are working at the moment”. The government will now consult with car makers to find “options for a better way forward”. Reynolds did not indicate what the changes could be, but did confirm the 2030 ban on new pure-combustion cars would remain. “We get the seriousness of the situation and we get the urgency,” he said, adding that a decision would be made by January. “We know that you need certainty and that's why we will fast-track that consultation, giving you clarity on the direction of travel, and assuring you have the answers you need in the coming weeks before you make decisions in January.” He added: “I want to do everything possible to make sure EVs are built here in Britain. The future of EV cars in the UK is not and should not be a negative story. It should be positive because the products are great.” Currently the mandate states that car makers must achieve an EV sales mix of 22% in 2024 (rising incrementally each year to 80% by 2030) or face heavy fines for every non-electric car sold over the threshold. However, EV sales are forecast to achieve only an 18.5% market share this year. A lack of support from the government – such as EV buying or owning incentives – has been the key criticism from car makers, which say that the targets are unachievable without help, especially amid a general downturn in EV interest. Talks held last week between car makers, transport secretary Louise Haigh and Reynolds confirmed the government wouldn’t budge on its 2030 ban date for new ICE cars but left the door open for amendments to the ZEV mandate. In response to today's earlier reports that a decision was imminent, Lisa Brankin, managing director of Ford of Britain and Ireland, said: “Ford shares the UK government’s ambition for 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035, but current market challenges are making the VETS [Vehicle Emissions Trading] scheme unworkable. We welcome today’s reports suggesting that there will be a fast-track review of the scheme and are pleased that the government is listening to industry at this crucial time.   \"The end goal is not in question, but current demand for electric vehicles is lower than expected and not in line with the mandated trajectory. For manufacturers like Ford who have invested billions into new technologies and advanced manufacturing, there needs to be greater flexibility built into the scheme and government-backed incentives to help encourage customers to make the switch.” Vicky Read, CEO of ChargeUK (the body that represents the UK’s major charger providers), added that although she was pleased the consultation would  “bring much needed clarity”, any changes to the EV sales mix targets “risk inducing the uncertainty that all sides agreed is the very enemy of the EV transition”. She added it would be \"foolish\" to redraw the ZEV mandate, because “billions of pounds of investment in the EV charging infrastructure roll-out will be put at risk”. Her comments contrast the statement made last week by Nissan, which called on the UK government to make urgent changes to the ZEV mandate, warning that failing to do so risked \"undermining the business case\" for future investment. The Japanese company, which employs 7000 people in the UK, called the targets “outdated”. Its European chief, Guillaume Cartier, demanded “urgent action”, as the mandate “risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment”.",

The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",
