    "description": "This 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,400 Gullwing coupes built during three years of production and is said to have been completed in September 1955 for delivery in the US via New York. In 1978, chassis 5500733 was sold by an Arizona owner to a California collector who retained it for over four decades, with work during that span including a color change to silver and 2007 overhauls of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six and the replacement four-speed manual transmission. The car was purchased by its current owner approximately a year ago and subsequently underwent a refresh that included a repaint in its original shade of white. Additional features include Bosch direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, red plaid interior upholstery, and a Blaupunkt radio. This W198 Gullwing is now offered on dealer consignment in Austin, Texas, with a copy of its Gullwing Register entry, invoices dating back to 2007, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "Like its predecessor, the KTM 390 Adventure X undercuts its higher-spec counterpart and aims to deliver 90 percent of the experience at a much more affordable rate. For 2025, this motorcycle is all-new from the ground up, featuring more performance, better features and improved handling for just Rs 11,000 more than the outgoing model. The 390 Adventure X misses out on cruise control.   KTM 390 Adventure X design and quality (7/10) High resolution TFT adds to the appeal of this motorcycle What impressed me was the bright headlight that offers commendable illumination, and it might just be the best in class for now. I’m also happy to see that KTM has equipped this bike with the new TFT and ditched the monotone LCD from the older ‘X’ model. This new screen is vibrant and clear, giving the bike a premium feel. Switchgear quality is also solid, aside from the missing rocker switch for cruise control. The seating posture on the 390 Adventure is upright and commanding   KTM 390 Adventure X riding position and comfort (8/10) The X has the same ergonomics as the 390 Adventure, with a slightly lower seat height Apart from a slightly shorter seat height, the X is identical to the regular 390 Adventure. The posture is upright and commanding yet comfortable. However, the large windscreen isn’t adjustable, so you’re robbed of some of that sweet cooling airflow in this scorching heat at city speeds. Also, the seat remains quite firm, leading to saddle soreness after about an hour or two, which isn’t ideal for long-distance touring. While those shortcomings are worth noting, they’re far from being dealbreakers. The X corners surprsingly well and feels quite planted   KTM 390 Adventure X performance and refinement (8/10) In our tests, the 390 Adventure X managed a 0-100kph time of just 6.04s While this motorcycle packs the same motor as the standard 390 Adventure, it feels a lot more tame and approachable. This is because the X runs on what’s essentially the equivalent of Road Mode on the standard 390 Adventure. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does make the bike feel rather mellow and un-KTM-like in its performance.  That said, performance is about the same as the standard 390 ADV, and this is the quickest bike in this segment. Despite the alloy wheels, the X can manage mild trails   Another surprise win? Less tyre noise. It was something I noticed on the standard bike, but here, it’s noticeably quieter. One letdown, though, is the quickshifter that requires a fair bit of force to engage and was mostly unusable on our test bike. That said, the X’s light clutch makes shifting manually easy and enjoyable. Moving on to braking, the X performs nearly on par with its counterpart despite missing out on sintered brake pads. Our braking tests showed nearly identical numbers between the two bikes, although the feel at the lever isn’t as good as the standard ADV. Seat height and weight are slightly down by 5mm and 1kg, respectively, which, while not massive, are both changes in the right direction. Unlike the 390 Adventure, the X uses organic brake pads that perform nearly on par   KTM 390 Adventure X ride comfort and handling (8/10) The X's non-adjustable suspension performs better than the higher spec adjustable suspension Despite running non-adjustable suspension and alloy wheels, the X still manages to feel pretty capable off-road. With the same 200mm/205mm wheel travel at both ends, it’ll do nearly all of what the full-spec 390 Adventure can, just with reduced confidence and feedback from the smaller front wheel. In fact, for on-road comfort, both Rishaad and I found ourselves preferring the non-adjustable setup on the X since it felt less fussy and a little more absorptive of poor road surfaces. Graphics and interface make the TFT feel upmarket.   KTM 390 Adventure X features and safety (8/10) Missing list of features aren't dealbreakers in any way The ‘X’ misses out on features like cruise control, riding modes, cornering ABS, adjustable brake and clutch levers, tubeless spoke wheels and an adjustable front fork. Cruise control was the only feature I truly missed and would’ve appreciated. Yes, it makes highway miles easier, but given the cost savings, I can live without it. The 390 Adventure X is considerably more affordable than the standard 390 Adventure.   KTM 390 Adventure X price and verdict (9/10) The ‘X’ costs Rs 77,000 less than the 390 Adventure Given the price difference, the 390 Adventure X makes a very strong case for itself. It delivers almost everything you’d want from the 390 Adventure platform at a pocket-friendly rate. For those skilled enough to push this platform to its limits, KTM still offers the fully specced 390 Adventure and even the Enduro R for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. But if you’re hunting for an affordable, lightweight ADV that punches well above its price tag, the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure X delivers. And if you’re not exactly ‘Ready to Race’, Royal Enfield’s Himalayan costs about the same and offers more all-around usability and comfort, although it feels much bigger and heavier.

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "Two years ago, we pit the petrol-automatic versions of the Hyundai Exter and Tata Punch against each other. Then, the Exter had the upper hand thanks to its smoother and more refined powertrain. Today, we revisit this rivalry, but with a twist: both sub-compact SUVs are here in their CNG avatars. While they share several traits, like a dual-cylinder CNG setup, a claimed efficiency of 27km/kg and premium features, including a sunroof, this time, the spotlight is on their real-world efficiency. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG interior and ergonomics  Let’s begin with the Punch. It’s easy to understand why this Tata is among the country’s bestselling cars. The basics are done right – its high-riding stance, wide-opening doors and easy ingress make it especially friendly for elderly passengers. The high seating position offers a commanding view of the road, and the visible bonnet edges further help drivers feel in control. The driving experience is enhanced by light steering, gear shifts that are easy to execute (though not as precise as the Exter’s) and a clutch that doesn’t require much effort. Further, individual front armrests enhance long-distance driving comfort, and a surprisingly impressive audio system adds to its appeal. There’s a lot that the Hyundai Exter CNG and the Tata Punch CNG have in common. Switching over to the Hyundai, it’s clear why it continues to earn praise for its user-friendliness. Every control, from the gearbox to the steering, feels lighter and more polished – just right for urban use. While its seating position isn’t as high as the Punch’s, outward visibility remains excellent, thanks partly to its lower window line. The fit, finish and overall cabin quality are marginally better than the Tata, but the dark, monotone theme doesn’t feel as inviting, and the seats leave a bit to be desired. They feel a little too compact and don’t offer the same level of support as the Punch’s. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG engine and performance  The Punch’s engine performance has never been its strong point, and in its CNG avatar, it feels even more sluggish. While it can keep pace with urban traffic, it begins to struggle when asked for more. The Punch’s real strength lies in its composure at highway speeds; it feels stable and reassuring, which is something it does noticeably better than the Exter. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG specsTata Punch icng Accomplished + sHyundai Exter hy-cng duo SX TechL/W/H3827/1742/1615mm 3815/1710/1631mmWheelbase 2445mm 2450mmBoot capacity 210 litres NAEngine 3cyl, 1199cc Petrol + CNG 4cyl, 1197cc Petrol + CNGPower 73.5hp at 6000rpm 69hp at 6000rpmTorque 103Nm at 3250rpm 95.2Nm at 4000rpmKerb weight 1181kg 1093kg On the move, the Exter feels extremely refined. The 4-cylinder engine is quieter and more eager to rev, and its overall smoothness is hard to ignore. Thanks to shorter gearing and smart engine calibration, you rarely need to shift gears. It pulls cleanly from as low as 1,000rpm, making it ideal for stop-and-go traffic. In our acceleration tests, the Exter Hy-CNG Duo sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 14.85 seconds, a full 3 seconds quicker than the Punch iCNG. Moreover, the Exter is significantly quicker than the Tata when accelerating from 20 to 80kph in the third gear and 40 to 100kph in the fourth. The Exter’s shorter gearing improves drivability but hampers highway efficiency to an extent. On the highway, though, the Exter doesn’t feel as composed as the Punch. There is noticeably more vertical movement over undulations. Also, its engine spins 300rpm higher than the Punch’s, at 3,300rpm, while cruising at 100kph in the top gear. This also explains why its highway efficiency is slightly lower at 30.3km/kg in our test, while the Punch iCNG’s is 31km/kg. However, the Hyundai returned 22.8km/kg in the city because of its better drivability, much higher than Tata’s 20.7km/kg. Both cars delivered an impressive overall average, close to their claimed 27km/kg figure.

We first ran both cars until their CNG tanks were completely empty. After that, we refilled approximately 2 kg of gas in each vehicle and drove them around in real-world conditions within the city until they ran out of CNG. Then, we repeated the procedure and ran them on the highway. Since filling the exact same quantity of gas in each car is nearly impossible, we’ve calculated their efficiency based on the actual distance covered divided by the gas quantity. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG features and safety  For the record, the Tata Punch featured here is the Adventure + mid variant, whereas the Hyundai Exter is in its top-end SX trim. That said, to keep this comparison fair, we’re evaluating both cars based on their respective top-spec versions. Interestingly, Tata offers a broader spread of variants with the Punch iCNG. Its entry-level trims are more affordable than Hyundai’s CNG offerings, though its higher trims are pricier than the Exter. Punch iCNG gets a spare tyre, while the Exter only gets a tyre repair kit. When it comes to features, the Punch iCNG impresses with additions like cruise control and a large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which the Hyundai misses. But the Exter hits back with key safety features such as six airbags, a tyre-pressure monitoring system, hill-start assist and electrically folding mirrors, all of which are absent in the Punch.

That said, the Punch’s boot feels a bit more usable, especially if both cars’ parcel shelves are removed. Moreover, Tata provides a full-size spare tyre, while the Exter makes do with just a tyre repair kit. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG verdict  To sum things up, the Tata Punch iCNG is a compelling option for buyers looking for an economical, compact and practical highway cruiser. Its tough build, elevated seating and great audio system add plenty of appeal. Where it falls short is in outright performance and the absence of key safety features like hill-start assist, tyre-pressure monitoring and additional airbags. The Hyundai Exter, on the other hand, is the smoother, more refined and easier-to-drive option in the city. It delivers better fuel efficiency, offers more safety features, and still manages to undercut the Punch on price – despite packing in more equipment overall. It may not lead the sales charts just yet, but it’s the Exter that feels like the better-rounded product, and for that reason, it’s the winner in this comparison.

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/yamaha-xsr900-retro-sportbike",
    "description": "The 90s sportbike revival is in full swing, and custom builders like Marc Bell are setting the pace. A full-time metal fabricator with an unwavering love for retro sportbikes, Marc has built some of the best late-80s and early-90s restomods we’ve seen under the HAXCH Moto banner. If it’s got perfectly proportioned bodywork, a lust-worthy livery, and buckets of retro charm, chances are it’s a HAXCH creation. Marc typically uses period-correct donors, but his latest project breaks the mold. This time, he’s taken a modern machine—a 2023 Yamaha XSR900—and turned it into a snarling, full-fairing homage to the golden age of sportbikes. Dubbed the HAXCH Moto Yamaha XZR900 Thunderbolt, this XSR isn’t a replica of any one classic Yamaha. Instead, it’s an amalgamation of elements from several of Marc’s favorite models, rolled into one.…",

    "description": "Restoring a motorcycle can seem like a mundane task compared to customizing one. But it can also be very rewarding, especially when you’re restoring the right bike for the right person. This 1970s Honda Dax comes from the fine folks at Australia’s Purpose Built Moto. Although the Gold Coast workshop relishes custom projects, the opportunity to restore the tired Dax back to its former glory was too good to resist. It also helped that the bike’s owner was already a customer… and friend. “Jake is a well-known local bloke and a great guy all around,” says Tom Gilroy, PBM shop boss. “I often see him and his wife out for a walk with their dog.” “The backstory on this bike is that Jake uses it to run up to the shops for late-night snacks, grab a coffee, or even pick up a beer on Sundays, hooning around Mermaid Beach and generally keeping his neighbors on their toes.…",

    "description": "Kawasaki has brought back the Versys-X 300 for 2025 at a price of Rs 3.80 lakh. It continues to use the same engine and feature set as the before, and now gets a new colour along with refreshed graphics. Kawasaki Versys-X 300 features the same engine as the Ninja 300 Now gets one new colour and refreshed graphics It continues to get a 19/17-inch (F/R) tubed tyres Kawasaki Versys-X 300 launched The Versys-X 300 now costs Rs 12,000 more than the KTM 390 Adventure The Versys-X 300 was last sold in India a few years ago before being discontinued. Now, for 2025, Kawasaki has brought back the Versys-X 300 to India, featuring refreshed graphics and a new blue-and-white colour option. The engine has also been updated to comply with stricter emission norms. Despite rumors and spy shots suggesting local assembly (CKD) in India, the X-300 is presently sold as a completely built unit (CBU). Powering the Versys-X 300 is the same (now OBD-2B compliant) 296cc parallel-twin, liquid-cooled engine from the Ninja 300, producing 40hp and 25.7Nm. It is paired with a six-speed gearbox equipped with a slip and assist clutch. This engine is housed in a back-bone frame supporting a 17-litre fuel tank. Suspension duties are handled by a 41mm telescopic fork with 130mm of travel upfront and a monoshock with 148mm of travel. Ground clearance stands at 180mm. The bike rolls on a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear spoked wheel setup with tubed tyres. In terms of features, the Versys-X 300 remains basic, offering a digi-analogue instrument cluster with a gear position indicator and dual-channel ABS. Priced at Rs 3.80 lakh, the Kawasaki Versys-X 300 costs Rs 12,000 more than the KTM 390 Adventure. While the KTM boasts more power and additional features, Kawasaki’s offering stands out with its extra cylinder. Also see:  BMW F 450 GS design seen in new spy shots",

    "description": "Nissan has released more details about the all-new Micra that debuted as a full-blown EV earlier this year, particularly surrounding the hatchback’s interior and powertrains. Underpinning this sixth generation of Micra is the same AmpR Small platform that the Renault 5 EV uses, marking the first time that the Nissan hatchback won’t have any ICE setup. 2025 Nissan Micra EV cabin has a dual-screen setup, ambient lighting, 326L boot, and more 40kWh and 52kWh battery packs to offer up to 308km and 408km range, respectively The hatchback will launch in global markets by late 2025 2025 Nissan Micra EV interior and features Centre console is driver-focused The new Micra’s dual-tone cabin has two 10.1-inch screens for infotainment and instrumentation purposes, with the centre console angled towards the driver and physical controls below the air vents.  Alongside features such as an electronic parking brake, wireless charging pad and 48-colour ambient lighting, the new-gen Micra has a couple of quirky Nissan-specific design touches, like unique upholstery and a moulded silhouette of Mount Fuji in the storage space between the seats. Speaking of storage, boot space is rated at 326 litres. 2025 Nissan Micra EV battery specs and range 40kWh and 52kWh battery pack options Nissan will offer two versions of the new Micra EV. The entry-level car comes with a 40kWh battery paired to a 122hp, 225Nm motor, delivering a WLTP-tested range of 308km. The top-spec Micra EV variant has a 52kWh battery pack powering a 150hp, 245Nm motor, extending the range to 408km. Larger battery offers support for 100kW DC fast charging The 52kWh variant supports 100kW DC fast charging, capable of topping up the battery from 15 to 80 percent in 30 minutes. Both Micra EV variants come with vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality, a heat pump and battery temperature control systems. 2025 Nissan Micra EV exterior design Funky design language Heavily inspired by the Nissan 20-23 EV concept, the new-gen Micra features compact proportions (sub-4-metre length) and eye-catching styling flourishes, particularly the circular daytime running lights around its rectangular headlights, a gloss-black body cladding, a blacked-out roof and segmented circular tail-lamps. The hatchback also sports silver inserts in the front bumper and upper window line, 18-inch alloy wheels and column-mounted rear door handles. 2025 Nissan Micra EV launch details Launches later this year in Europe; India launch propects unclear The Micra EV will be manufactured at Renault’s Douai plant in France, with launch expected in late 2025 for European markets. Whether Nissan plans to bring the Micra EV to India is currently unconfirmed. The Japanese carmaker did sell the fourth-gen Micra here from 2010 to 2020, but as it stands, the only Nissan models confirmed to be India-bound are a new compact MPV based on the Renault Triber and a midsize SUV based on the upcoming Renault Duster.
