    "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs. Tata Nexon CNG: performancePetrol modeCNG mode0-20kph1.87s1.72s0-40kph3.92s3.37s0-60kph6.55s6.29s0-80kph9.57s10.44s0-100kph13.97s14.69s20-80kph (in 3rd gear)11.21s12.58s40-100kph (in 4th gear)15.53s16.11sBraking (80-0kph)26.25m, 2.66s26.25m, 2.66s Tata claims an ARAI-rated efficiency figure of 24km/kg, but expect real-world figures to be lower. While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

    "description": "Four years down the road, the Triumph Tiger 900 gets a significant midlife update that aims to fix most of the existing 900’s issues. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: engine, performance, refinement The main improvements are within the 888cc three-cylinder engine, and multiple changes have resulted in not just more power and torque but also the promise of more efficiency. The previous Tiger 900 was far from slow, but the jump from 95hp/87Nm to 108hp/90Nm makes the bike feel even more potent and reactive. It looks familiar, but the side panels have been redesigned. But it’s not just about speed because this engine is also really lovely to ride at a relaxed pace. It’s torquey and very flexible with the gears, so you can ride over speed breakers in third and use sixth as low as 40kph. The fuelling is also beautifully smooth, and you can open the accelerator at very low revs without any signs of protest. This means less clutch use – both off the road and in heavy city traffic, and that’s always nice, even though this clutch isn’t particularly heavy to operate. I’m also a fan of the sound and feel of this engine with its deep, raspy growl. That said, while it’s characterful, it’s also far from perfect. The big complaint with the 900 engine was its high-rpm vibration, and Triumph has tried to improve that. Heavier bar-end weights and rubber-damped handlebar mounts have made some very clear improvements, but this is still not the smoothest engine in its class at high speeds. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: comfort, ride \u0026 handling Wind protection is usually based on your height and helmet, but I find that this height-adjustable windscreen results in some uncomfortable helmet buffeting at high speeds. Thankfully, the rest of the ergos are beautiful. Despite having gone up by 10mm, the 820-840mm seat height is very low for an ADV of this size and capability, and even tall riders will be comfy here. The seat is also new, and the comfort is fantastic. Seat and suspension comfort are both superb. The highly impressive chassis remains unchanged, and some fantastic suspension allows this bike to tear effortlessly through any form of terrible road. Like before, there’s a 45mm USD fork with 180mm of travel and a monoshock with 170mm of travel. The suspension is adjustable, but not fully – compression and rebound at the front and preload and rebound at the rear. The stock settings are good enough, but with a remote rear preload adjuster, you can easily make any changes you need. Even though the GT is the road-biased bike in the line-up, it’s fun to ride off-road and will easily get you through one of those Ladakh adventures. But you must remember that it’s running road tyres on alloy wheels and has no crash protection; Triumph has even removed the earlier GT’s plastic sump guard. For most casual ADV riders, this will be more than capable enough off-road, and I’d only recommend going for the Rally if you really want that hardcore capability or taller seat. Despite being the road-biased 900, it’s still surprisingly capable off-road. Road handling is neutral and easy but not particularly sporty, and you won’t have to work too hard to scrape its footpegs. It’s definitely no Multistrada V2 in the corners, but it’s still good enough that you’ll have fun. The impressive braking hardware is the same, but there’s a new linked-braking system that adds in some rear brake when you use the front. It feels quite natural while bringing some more stability to the braking. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: verdict, price, service cost As for features, the biggest change is the new 7-inch TFT from the Tiger 1200. This one has a great layout and, thankfully, gets rid of those weird layouts from the old Tiger 900. But, like in the Tiger 1200, it takes an eternity to boot up and feels laggy to operate. Triumph really should have fixed this. New TFT looks great, but very slow to boot up. But what’s most frustrating is that Triumph still expects you to pay an additional Rs 43,531 if you want a quickshifter. It’s a feature I really missed, and not getting one in this day and age on a Rs 14 lakh motorcycle is quite annoying. Thankfully, you get most of the essentials you’d want on a big ADV, such as two power outlets, cruise control and heated grips; you can even opt for heated seats. The Tiger 900 has always been the sweet spot in the big ADV segment in India, and this latest update only sweetens that package, especially since it costs just Rs 20,000 more than before. Tigers have also built a great reputation for reliability over the years, and they run fine on regular petrol. However, there are some cost concerns. The first is that the Tiger 900 GT is a CBU, so the on-road price gets very high in certain states that heavily tax CBUs – it’s nearly Rs 18 lakh in Mumbai. The other disappointment is that spares and service costs for the big bikes actually went up instead of down and are now about 20-30 percent more expensive than before since Bajaj took over Triumph’s operations in India. Nevertheless, the Triumph Tiger 900 GT is a fantastic all-round motorcycle, and it continues to be my go-to recommendation for the casual adventure rider looking for a premium midsize ADV.

    "description": "Classic motorcycles attain desirability for any number of reasons, but every once in a while we come across one that checks every conceivable box—in this case—the BMW RS M255 Kompressor. At its core, we’re talking about a Grand Prix-winning motorcycle of staggering mechanical specification—designed with lightweight magnesium hubs and engine cases, and a vane-type supercharger delivering 15 psi. It’s also a witness to one of the most tumultuous periods in history, having been developed and raced in the late 1930s, and surviving the subsequent chaos of the Second World War. Rare from day one, BMW estimates no more than 10 were produced, and just seven are believed to exist today. BMW has always enjoyed a reputation for technological innovation, and considering the firm started experimenting with forced induction on motorcycles as early as the 1920s, it’s safe to say they’ve earned it.…",

    "description": "Building a café racer with an older motorcycle usually involves two phases; getting the bike running, and customizing it. And if the bike is really beaten up, the first phase can be the hardest—especially if the engine is too far gone. Marshall Hewitt had a novel approach to this particular challenge. This ex-police 1991 BMW K100 was a true basket case when he found it, with a seized engine among the myriad issues that needed attention. So Marshall side-stepped the problem entirely, by simply yanking the engine out and replacing it with a modern electric powertrain. An automation engineer by trade, Marshall has been building café racers as a hobby for a few years now. He normally works on bikes with internal combustion engines, but he’s not averse to trying new things.…",

    "title": "Alfa Romeo Tonale update brings refreshed interior",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alfa-romeo-tonale-update-brings-refreshed-interior",
    "description": "Revisions to the Italian family SUV aim to address key criticisms of its interior Alfa Romeo has given the Tonale an interior makeover as part of its 2025-model-year update. This follows criticism of the firm's crucial volume crossover for failing to match the fit and finish of rivals such as the Volvo XC40 and BMW X1. Autocar's road test noted that “primary cabin mouldings feel quite coarse and wobbly in places” and primary features – including air vents, infotainment screen, instrument cowl and armrest cubby – appeared to be “flimsy and a little poorly secured”. Since the Tonale went on sale at the start of 2023, just around 2000 models have been sold in the UK. Although this makes it Alfa’s best-seller, it is 46,000 units behind the XC40 over the same period. In response, the main update to the crossover is a new centre console that is sleeker and better than the pre-facelifted car’s, Alfa says. The Tonale also replaces the more traditional drive selector with a new rotary selector. Elsewhere, the criticised instrument cluster has been improved and the clock and the fuel and battery gauges are now easier to read, Alfa says. As part of the update, the brand has also dropped the top-rung £45,175 Tributo Italiano trim, instead offering just the entry-level Sprint and Veloce. This allows for a “clear and strong customer-oriented approach”, according to the brand.  Two engine options are available: the 158bhp 1.5-litre hybrid and the 276hp plug-in hybrid. Alfa will present the car for the first time at the Paris motor show next week. UK pricing has yet to be announced.",

    "description": "Preview video posted to social media shows the silhouette of a DB12 New special edition will mark the 60th anniversary of the James Bond film’s release Aston Martin is set to reveal a DB12 inspired by the classic James Bond film Goldfinger on Monday 14 October. A post made to the British company’s social media accounts appears to show the silhouette of the GT interspersed with a clip from the 1964 film, which prominently featured the Aston Martin DB5. Aston Martin also posted a quote from the scene in which Bond’s armourer, Q, introduced him to the DB5. “I never joke about my work, 007,” said Q, after explaining that Bond’s car was fitted with an ejector seat. This year marks the 60th anniversary of Goldfinger, which premiered on 17 September 1964.  Autocar published its road test of the star car, the DB5, the following day. It concluded: “Second to his house, a man’s car is usually his most expensive single possession. “But a house is static, and although a car like the DB5 costs as much as a comfortable dwelling, it is very dynamic and free to go anywhere. “It is a car which cries out to be driven, to be driven well, and to be driven far. With a range of comfortably over 300 miles between fuel stops it is definitely the kind of car one would like to drive from, say, our London offices to the south of France without a pause. “And even then, one would probably feel fresh enough to go on to Rome, or Athens. It is a car requiring skill and muscle – a man’s car – which challenges and satisfies and always excites.” The full test can be read in the Autocar archive.   “I never joke about my work, 007.” – Q, GOLDFINGER.14.10.24#AstonMartin pic.twitter.com/zIaNol0VGs — Aston Martin (@astonmartin) October 11, 2024   In 2020, Aston Martin revealed the DB5 Goldfinger Continuation, a £3.3 million recreation of Bond’s car celebrating the release of No Time to Die. It was fitted with replicas of the gadgets used in Goldfinger – including machine guns, rotating registration plate and rear shield – except for the ejector seat. A removal roof panel was offered as a reference to it. Aston Martin’s Q bespoke division, named after the character, also produced a limited 007 Edition of the Vantage and DBS Superleggera.",

    "description": "The Jeep Meridian is set to get a facelift, and as previous spy shots had shown, it’ll get subtle design changes, more features than the outgoing model, and come with an ADAS suite. The big news, though, is that the Meridian will be available in 5-seat and 7-seat forms. Jeep India has announced the commencement of bookings for the refreshed SUV for Rs 50,000. Jeep Meridian facelift gets altered grille design Interior gets new trims and upholstery 2.0-litre diesel engine expected to continue unchanged Autocar India reported in August that the Meridian will get a 5-seat version. The 5-seat Meridian should help Jeep price the large SUV a bit more competitively – the outgoing model’s starting price was Rs 31.23 lakh (the range tops off at Rs 39.83 lakh). However, it remains to be seen how the Meridian will be positioned compared to the Compass (Rs 18.99 lakh-32.41 lakh), on which it is based. This article was published in the August 2024 issue of Autocar India. The teasers on Jeep India’s website show that the Meridian facelift gets a mildly altered grille design – the honeycomb mesh in the seven-slat grille now has chrome studs. New alloy wheel designs for the 18-inchers are also expected, along with other minor tweaks, as seen in the previous spy shots. The biggest change on the Meridian facelift will be the addition of a Level 2 ADAS suite. Other feature additions include an expanded list of connected car tech. The cabin has a three-layer dashboard with a grey finish instead of the outgoing model’s beige one, and the chrome strip has been replaced with a copper finish strip. The 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen will continue, as will the 9-speaker Alpine audio system, wireless charger, front ventilated seats and other creature comforts and tech. Jeep India has confirmed that the Meridian facelift will get a 9-speed automatic option, along with 4x2 and 4x4 variants. We expect the outgoing model’s 170hp, 350Nm, 2.0-litre diesel engine to continue. The brand has been evaluating a petrol engine for the Compass in India, which could feature in the Meridian as well. However, this is unlikely to happen at launch.

    "description": "Tesla has taken the wraps off its all-new product: the long-awaited robotaxi. This vehicle, christened the Tesla Cybercab, gets a design inspired by the popular Cybertruck and comes with the brand's latest autonomous driving tech. It is set to enter production by 2027. The Cybercab project has been in the works for years as part of Elon Musk's bold plan to transition Tesla from a pure car firm to a robotics manufacturer. Tesla Cybercab gets a two-seater interior Gets minimalistic styling inside out No powertrain details revealed so far Tesla Cybercab: what exactly is it? Musk has confirmed that production of the unique Cybercab will begin before 2027. The vehicle will have no steering wheel or pedals, meaning production can only start once all regulatory approvals are in place. Like other Tesla models, the Cybercab gets a minimalist interior layout, with seating for two and a large centrally mounted screen that controls almost all functions, similar to the Model 3 and Model Y. On the outside, the Cybercab gets a single full-width LED light bar similar to the Cybertruck, giving it an equally futuristic look. It shares design elements, creases, and wide rear shoulders with other Tesla models like the Model Y in particular. Unique butterfly doors mark a first for any Tesla vehicle. At the rear, there’s a large boot, but like the Cybertruck, the Cybercab lacks a rear window. It also gets full wheel covers, which Tesla says help with extracting more range. As of now, the brand has not revealed any details about the powertrain or specifications. Tesla earlier hinted on entering the Indian market, but there hasn’t been much progress on that front as of now.

    "description": "In our last Eldorado installment , a reworked and Fleetwood-bodied 1963 Eldorado’s exterior styling was a bit of a surprise. It stepped away from the dowdy and Chevrolet adjacent styling it carried in 1961 and 1962 and became more slab-sided and refined looking. And even though it was not an entirely new car (as claimed by GM), the styling revisions were enough to set the sixth generation car apart from its predecessor. This week we open the long, heavy doors and see what interior updates were made for ‘63.",

Showing only 21,401 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO I example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example is among the lowest mileage ones in the world. The Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO I was developed from DTM racing to challenge BMW in the German touring car championship. Built to meet Group A homologation requirements, it featured a Cosworth-tuned engine producing 202 hp, along with aerodynamic upgrades like a rear spoiler and wider fender flares for improved downforce and handling. With a revised suspension for racing demands, the EVO I set the stage for Mercedes’ later dominance in DTM and paved the way for the more aggressive EVO II. Both models reflect the close link between motorsport and street-legal performance cars.   Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II Location: Miami, Florida Country of original delivery: Netherlands Chassis/VIN: 741313 Mileage: 176.0 kms (109.4 miles) Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this museum-grade, impeccably preserved, and concours-ready 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II. Showing only 176.0 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO II example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",
