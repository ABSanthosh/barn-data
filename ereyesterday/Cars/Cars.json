They’re useful for seeing what’s behind you and keeping the authorities off your back—but the wrong mirrors can easily ruin an otherwise tidy cockpit. I’ve tried my fair share of cheap and nasty bar-end mirrors, many of which are now scattered around various corners of my garage. So when our friends over at Purpose Built Moto offered to send me a set of their universal Scrambler mirrors for my Triumph Bonneville, I was pumped. The Purpose Built Moto Scrambler mirror’s biggest asset is its versatility. Thanks to its neutral aesthetic and compact size it’ll look good on just about any bike and can be mounted in myriad positions. Available in either black anodized or polished aluminum, the mirror sports a short 155 mm stem and a 72 mm lens.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/imperfect-car-often-easier-love",
    "description": "Cars are all flawed in one way or another – but aren't these more interesting than the accomplished alternatives? Just as I watched the last episode of Reacher and feared my television well was running dry, a new series of Bosch: Legacy arrived to make going to the gym less boring. So begins another series in which the star bounds around saving the day, breaking a few rules/laws/bones as necessary, and ultimately gets paid badly or not at all for their trouble. I wondered if it was just people like me who were drawn to this sort of story, but whether it’s Buffy or Ludwig, Harry Potter or Stranger Things, plus about eleventy-dozen superhero films, the theme is the same. See also basically everything from The Littlest Hobo to James Bond. It’s a massively popular genre. Fact is, loads of us like a central character who’s not perfect but who knows what it takes to get things done and, once it’s all over, gets hardly any recognition. Is this because it’s how we see, or would like to see, ourselves? Does it reflect our own personalities, even if our struggles are against jobsworths, unfair parking fines and computers saying no, rather than criminal masterminds? (I mean, same difference, right?) And if that’s the case, I wonder whether that’s why, as many of us do, I find myself drawn to a certain kind of car: something a bit quirky, made by an underdog, probably not the best car around but, for all its failings, something with charm. A car with noble intentions, if such a thing is possible. At the moment, I’m going through a phase of being asked what good cars I’ve driven recently. There have been a number of very respectable, very efficient and extremely effective ones. And when it comes to the moment of answering, I often can’t remember a single one of them. I can, though, remember most of the miles I’ve driven in, say, a Noble M600, an Ineos Grenadier or a Morgan. Even a Citroën Ami. Or my own Audi A2 or old Land Rover Defender. These cars are all flawed or compromised in some way or another (within reason: they haven’t murdered anyone for the greater good), but I find them more compelling than the squeaky clean, goody two-shoes, far more accomplished alternatives. Steve Cropley’s new Jeep Wrangler is another case in point. I don’t just mean it’s possible to like bad cars. It is, of course, but that’s a different conversation that usually involves nostalgia. What I mean is that there’s an attraction to the underappreciated, to a character that’s trying to do a good thing against difficult odds. The film reviewer (and classic Ford owner) Mark Kermode says he would rather a film set out to achieve something noble and miss its mark than achieve its goal of being blandly efficient. One might think differently about cars, I suppose, when you have to live with one for three years and  e confident it will be worth something afterwards, rather than just bearing with it for two hours, so from a reviewing perspective, our approaches may remain a little different. But I do think there is a virtuousness, a pleasing honesty, about a core of people who set out to give a car really positive traits, so that the result doesn’t look like it was designed and engineered by endless committees. And isn’t there something endearing about a flawed character? Some gratification in recognising a positive trait that we don’t think everybody else sees? Maybe appreciating these things is the same as preferring a slightly rickety but pleasingly proportioned old house to a brilliantly insulated new one whose floors are level but which has no aesthetic charm. We know that the one that works properly is better, but we would prefer something that is in some ways – how to put it delicately? – a bit more crap. By cheering on the underappreciated underdog, it positively reaffirms that we have a kindness of understanding, plus it makes us believe we have the nous and intellect to see what others might have missed. In other words, it makes us feel a bit good about ourselves. On the telly, those strings are pulled by design. In automotive terms, I suspect it’s more accidental. But the net effect can be similar.",

    "description": "Want to know more about Google’s popular smartphone mirroring service? Take a look at our complete guide Modern life is about having all the information you need at your fingertips, and driving is no different.  While modern infotainment systems largely cover a lot of bases in this respect, they're not quite as connected to your mobile phone as you might like.  That’s why so many drivers use smartphone mirroring systems, such as Android Auto.  An alternative to Apple CarPlay for those with a Google-based phone from makers such as Google, Samsung and Sony, Android Auto gives quick and easy access to a host of applications to keep you connected.  As car makers develop increasingly convoluted infotainment systems, it's even got to the point where many drivers prefer mirroring services like Android Auto over the standard operating system (OS) fitted to their cars. It's no surprise that around 150 million cars worldwide now have Android Auto installed. But what exactly is Android Auto, what services does it offer, and how can you access it? We've put together this comprehensive guide with all the information you need to know.  What is Android Auto? Android Auto is a car-based driving companion created by Google to bring all the convenience of your phone directly to your car’s dashboard. It was initially introduced to improve safety while driving, but there’s a lot you can do with it. It’s a service that lets you connect your Android phone to the car's infotainment system to display sat-nav apps, legally take phone calls, reply to messages and play audio.  These functions are accessed via large icons on your car's infotainment screen and through voice commands. Google says it intends the software to reduce your levels of distraction as much as possible, so the icons should be easy to reach when you're driving.  Android Auto is accessible, too. It’s free of charge for one, and it streamlines your car’s interface with hands-free voice commands, large, easy-to-read icons and integration with some of the mobile world’s most popular apps, including Google Maps, Waze and Spotify.  Android Auto in 2025 It looks like Android Auto will gain several updates in 2025, with the first major update already rolling out to some vehicles and devices.  One of the biggest upgrades will come to the user interface, bringing stronger integration of your vehicle's own systems. For instance, you will be able to control the radio directly through Android Auto, instead of swapping back to your vehicle's own infotainment system. Android Auto will also add some new apps for improved media playback, such as video streaming via programs such as YouTube, Netflix and TikTok, while web browsing will also be implemented.  We're not quite sure when these updates will be fully implemented, but expect them to begin rolling out later this year.  How to connect to Android Auto If you have an Android phone (one developed by a company such as Samsung, OnePlus, Huawei, Nokia, Sony or Google), Android Auto will come pre-installed on your phone if it's operating on Android 10 or above. It’s also free to install on the Google Play Store.  There are two ways of doing this: via USB connection or wirelessly. Firstly, ensure your car is compatible with Android Auto. You can consult Android's guide to every car compatible with the system here.  Using USB If you're using a USB connection, make sure your phone is in range of your mobile data network and plug the USB into your car's port and your phone. The port can be either a USB-A (rectangular) or a USB-C (oval) connector. Instructions will then appear on your car's infotainment screen; follow those steps to continue. You don’t need a Bluetooth connection if you’re using this method. Wireless Some newer cars offer a wireless Android Auto connection too, through Bluetooth or a wi-fi connection. In these, you should go into the infotainment system to set up your phone connection. Once you’ve got them paired up, both your car and your phone will ask if you want to allow permission to use Android Auto. Select yes, and away you go. If you're unsure of your car’s method of connection, have a quick look at the car's manual. Is my phone compatible? There are a few caveats to this one but stick with us. To connect your phone to Android Auto using a USB cable, it has to be running on Android 8 or higher and have an active data plan. If you want to connect it wirelessly to the infotainment system and you have an Android phone that isn't made by Samsung or Google, make sure it’s running on Android 11 or later.  Samsung or Google phones can use Android 10 or later, while Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Note 8 models work with Android 9 or later. Remember that all phones require an active data plan and 5GHz wi-fi support. Most phones have the latter, but if you're experiencing connection issues, it may be down to this. What are the main features of Android Auto? From navigation to music, Android Auto has a host of accessible features. You can make phone calls using your infotainment system, have messages read out to you and even look for chargers for your electric car.  Several companies have developed apps that are compatible with Android Auto. See our list of our favourite Android Auto apps below:  Amazon Music - An alternative to Spotify for your favourite tunes. Audible - Amazon’s app for audiobook playback. Facebook Messenger - Reply to messages sent to your Facebook account through voice-to-text. Google Maps - Google’s own navigation app. ZapMap - Locate an EV charging station quickly using this app, which lists chargers by maximum charging speed. It also tells you if they’re in use or out of order.  Spotify - A popular music and podcast app. WhatsApp - You're able to hear messages you’ve been sent and send messages, or place and receive phone calls, via voice control. Waze - A third-party navigation app with several useful features, such as incident reporting, police car warnings and more. How much does Android Auto cost? Android Auto is free to use and the app is free to download to your phone. However, you may be subject to some data charges if they’re not already included on your mobile phone plan.  Some manufacturers include Android Auto on higher trim levels only, or as an optional extra on entry-level models; but it’s becoming increasingly common for brands to include it as standard, along with Apple CarPlay.  Pros of Android Auto There are several benefits to using Android Auto - and it’s often down to the software that comes with your car.  In fact, many drivers believe Android Auto’s Google Maps integration is more intuitive, accurate and useful than pre-installed sat-nav systems. Google often updates Android Auto, with the latest round adding artificial intelligence (AI) that can summarise messages, read them out to you and reply on your behalf. It’s very handy to have all of your favourite apps at your fingertips when you’re on the move, and voice integration in apps like WhatsApp are useful for staying in contact with your friends and family during long journeys.  Android Auto’s wide selection of apps is also a plus, meaning you can stick to your preferred music or podcast app of choice.  And, if we’re honest, it often looks better than many of the infotainment software systems from some car brands today. Cons of Android Auto While Android Auto might seem like the ideal solution for most phone users, it’s not for everybody.  The ultimate negative of the system is that it can only be used with an Android phone, so it’s not accessible to every driver.  You also need to keep an eye on your data usage with Android Auto, as apps such as Spotify, Amazon Music, or Audible can sap your data allowance if you’re not set to a specific offline mode.  Plus, if you don’t have the right cable or your car can’t offer wireless connectivity, you might not be able to connect to Android Auto at all. If you’re not a fan of touchscreens, you might want to avoid Android Auto, too, as most functions are controlled via your car’s infotainment system.",

    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "As other premium and sports car makers have already begun to offer full electric models, Lamborghini says its first EV will only arrive towards the end of the decade and this isn’t a delay but all part of the plan. Speaking to Autocar India at the launch of the Temerario in Delhi, Francesco Scardaoni Asia Pacific Region Director Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.said, “The idea was never to be the first ones, but to be the best one when it comes to EVs. So, when we created our electrification strategy, the ‘Direzione Cor Tauri’ we knew it was important to set the right time for an EVs introduction and we think that is still some time away.” First Lambo EV to be a 2+2 GT  Revuelto sold out for over two years Lamborghini customers want hybrids right now, not EVs Indian clients have shown lots of interest in the Temerario The first model is going to be a 2+2 GT which Scardaoni says will only arrive by the end of the decade and not earlier. “We believe hybrids are an important step towards electrification and right now our customers want these (hybrids)”. Scardaoni adds that the Revuelto being sold out for over two years is a clear indication of this customer acceptance. Scardaoni attributes that to Lamborghini approach to hybridization. \"For us, hybridization has no drawbacks, it means instead adding features and capabilities to the car, so more power, more driveability and agility and less emissions”. With the two electric motors driving the front axle the Temerario is able to achieve torque vectoring much faster that traditional systems and the company says it uses brake intervention far fewer times and mostly adjusts torque through rapid motor adjustments. This leads to a more natural driving feel and faster cornering. With the Temerario, Lamborghini’s line up is now fully electrified and Scardaoni says there is already lots of interest from clients in India and he expects 2025 to be a good year building on its record 2024 where it delivered 113 vehicles.

    "description": "Tata Motors has dropped the first teaser of the upcoming Altroz facelift ahead of its price announcement on May 22. The premium hatchback has been periodically updated with new powertrain options and new features, but it hasn’t received a cosmetic makeover since it went on sale in January 2020. An updated design aside, there will also be new features on the inside, but the Altroz is expected to remain mechanically unchanged. Altroz facelift gets new bumpers and lighting signatures Will have a larger touchscreen, 360-degree camera Expected to remain mechanically unchanged Tata Altroz facelift: what to expect? New fascia, larger touchscreen on the inside  The teaser video hints at a significantly revised fascia for the facelift – the split arrangement has been retained for the headlamps, but these are now full LED units and it comes with a new brow-like LED daytime running lamp signature as well. The bumper has been updated with new vertical recesses for the fog lamp housing, and there's a new design for the grille as well. At the rear, the Altroz gets new LED tail lamps with a T motif, and it is connected by an LED light bar. The rear bumper looks much sportier with a dual-tone finish, and it also gets new flush-fitting door handles that are illuminated. There's also a new EV-esque design for the alloy wheels, and new colour options are expected, too.  Tata hasn’t given us a glimpse of the interior yet, but we expect a revised dashboard with new soft-touch materials along with new colour options for the upholstery. The larger 10.25-inch touchscreen will be made available across more variants; currently it is only available with the Racer variant. It will also get a new digital instrument cluster and 360-degree camera. Tata Altroz facelift powertrain options Five powertrain options expected to be carried forward  The Altroz is currently on sale with as many as five powertrain options – the range starts with an 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol that’s offered with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox; a 73.5hp factory-fit CNG version, and a 90hp, 1.5-litre diesel engine option are also available. The CNG and diesel-powered Altroz come with a 5-speed manual only. Meanwhile, the top-spec Altroz Racer shares its 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual transmission with the Tata Nexon. All five powertrain options are expected to be retained. Crucially, the Altroz will continue to be the sole hatchback in the country to be sold with a diesel engine. Altroz update arriving amidst dwindling sales for hatchbacks  Upon launch, the updated Altroz will continue to rival the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and the Hyundai i20. The premium hatchback segment has been steadily losing ground to compact SUVs, with Altroz currently averaging monthly sales of about 2,000 units – down from its peak of about 5,000 units in FY2021-22. The upcoming facelift could be an impetus to sales. Also See: Volkswagen Golf GTi bookings open on May 5 Mahindra Thar Convertible Top variants discontinued",

    "description": "The Fleetwood Eldorado was all new for 1971 , as the model stepped away from sporting pretensions and leaned into the burgeoning brougham and luxury tastes of American consumers. As we saw in our last installment, the angular late Sixties look of the Eldorado (lauded by almost everyone) was replaced with a curved and bloated shape which grew in all dimensions over its predecessor. Today we take a look at the lavish interior accommodations of the 1971 model and talk about cost cutting.",
