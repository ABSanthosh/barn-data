    "description": "BMW reaches for mini-iX design appeal and lots of digital interior tech in renewing its best-selling model BMW’s decision to follow up the groundbreaking X5 with the smaller BMW X3 was a pivotal moment for a firm then best known for sharp-handling saloons and estates, paving the way for the subsequent huge expansion of its Sports Activity Vehicle – you know, SAV – line-up.Now, 21 years later, BMW feels defined by such models as much as its saloons: the X3 was its best-seller last year, with around 1000 sold each day. Really, the only thing BMW got wrong was the SAV tag it still insists on using – although as a publication still known as Autocar, we appreciate persisting with a moniker the popular lexicon has decided against.With typically Germanic efficiency of precise seven-year model cycles, the Mk4 X3 has arrived to offer fresh challenges to premium SUV rivals such as the Audi Q5 (which has just entered a new, hybrid-only generation), Porsche Macan et al.The most significant change for this new X3 is what’s missing: an electric version. While the new model retains the same multi-powertrain CLAR platform as its predecessor, the successor to the iX3 will arrive next year as the production version of the Neue Klasse X concept, the first in a line of radically restyled EVs using a bespoke platform.",

    "description": "Does the introduction of four-wheel-drive and an estate bodystyle dilute the lineage? And which really makes the M3 more usable? This, for the first time in history, is a BMW M3 with four-wheel drive. It's also the very first M3 to be available as a Touring estate model. So if you thought performance cars were in full retreat, thinning down their ranks and ramping up their prices just for the sake of a stay of execution, while all the investment they might have had is poured in PHEVs and BEVs, there you go. There is clearly life to be found, money to be made and new choices to be introduced in at least some of the old wild dogs still.The M3 might be BMW’s most famous sporting icon, with the kind of aura and notoriety that only the most exotic and revered few in motordom can exceed. It will, very shortly, pass 40 years as a production model, having descended through five model generations prior to the current one and, in its time, gone through both fast-revving four-cylinder engines and big-hitting atmo V8s with motorsport derivations; with an electric version mooted for introduction with the next big leap (although this, it’s suggested, will be in addition to a petrol-powered model, not in replacement for one).So exactly how fast do twin turbochargers and four driven wheels make the indefatigable doyen of the performance saloon segment? Keep reading to find out.",

    "description": "To say that Winston Yeh likes the color black would be a gross understatement. The man behind Taiwan’s Rough Crafts has a sense of style that would make Johnny Cash’s wardrobe blush, and seldom builds a custom motorcycle that isn’t swathed in various shades of black. We checked; a mere 10 percent of the Rough Crafts bikes featured on our pages buck this trend. So when Mr. Yeh does deviate from this formula, it’s usually for a good reason—like a special request from a client. “He wanted an old school chopper, he wanted it silver, and he wanted the ‘Rough Crafts’ style,” says Winston of the succinct brief he received for the project. The only other request was that Rough Crafts use a modern bike as a donor so that reliability wouldn’t be an issue.…",

I can get behind that. First was Grand Teton National Park, which encompasses the Teton mountain range, the 4000-meter Grand Teton peak, and the valley known as Jackson Hole. It’s a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, backcountry camping, and fishing. It is linked to nearby Yellowstone National Park by the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway.

    "description": "The Xoom 125 is the latest scooter from Hero and it has all the makings of being the latest success story for the company. Hero Xoom 125 design and style Xoom 125 has a catchy design and good presence The new Xoom makes a strong impression thanks to its design and presence. This is not an excessively large or bulky scooter, but it does stand out. Those big 14-inch wheels wrapped in fat rubber do wonders for the overall silhouette. Hero has also done well to give this scooter its own unique design, and it looks quite different from the Xoom 110, even though the family resemblance is immediately identifiable. Catchy colours and sharp styling help the Xoom 125 stand out on the road. There are four colour options and the matte yellow you see here looks particularly good, even if it's quite clearly inspired by the TVS NTorq 125. Nevertheless, with its sporty stance and striking looks, this is a scooter most young riders would love to be seen on. Hero Xoom 125 engine and performance Motor borrowed from Destini 125 but makes more power here The motor is borrowed from the Destini 125, but it produces a little more power here – 9.9hp and 10.4Nm. On the move, the feeling and sound is of a rather conventional automatic scooter and throttle calibration is very smooth. There is a hint of vibration in the floorboard at around 20kph, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the motor smoothens out beautifully as the speeds rise and it is absolutely refined at about 60kph. Engine is shared with the Destini 125 but is more powerful here. Hero claims a segment leading 0-60kph time of 7.6s, despite the fact that this is one of the heavier 125cc scooters (121kg) and its power figures aren’t segment leading either. It’s hard to verify that claim from the riding experience as well because the power delivery is quite linear. While there is a pretty strong pull at lower revs you have to twist the long-travel accelerator wide open to find it – even then, it doesn’t quite have as strong a surge as you’d find in something like the TVS Ntorq. Just like the 110, the Xoom 125 gets two spacious cubbies on the front apron. The overall performance can be described as quick and refined but not particularly exciting. Top speed should be above a speedo indicated 90kph and the scooter managed to climb up to 80kph without much stress, even on a slight uphill section. As for fuel efficiency, Hero claims 54.9kpl, which is par for the course with this segment.  Hero Xoom 125 chassis, handling and comfort Xoom 125 is one of a handful of Indian-made scooters to ride on 14-inch wheels The Xoom 125 shares the same basic chassis as the Destini 125 and Xoom 110, but with a different wheelbase and steering angle. The big deal here is the use of 14-inch wheels, which makes this the only other locally manufactured scooter to offer them apart from the Yamaha Aerox 155 and the Aprilia SR range.  14-inch wheels lend the Xoom 125 good stability. Big wheels bring in stability and the Xoom feels very well balanced at low speeds, which addresses that nervous feeling you can get from scooters with smaller wheels. Low-speed agility is still quite good despite the long 1,327mm wheelbase, but it certainly doesn’t have the super-light steering feel you’d get from a conventional scooter. There wasn’t a whole lot to judge about outright handling on the crowded Delhi streets we rode on, but this does come across as a confident and fun handling scooter. The Xoom 125 gets a tethered USB charger. The only dynamic aspect I didn’t like was the braking. The actual performance is fine, but the levers feel hard and require some effort to slow the scooter down. As for the suspension comfort, it seems to strike a middle ground between the harsh Aprilia and the soft and plush Ntorq. On Delhi’s smooth, tarmac roads, comfort was good, but we’ll need to see what it’s like on Mumbai’s fast but bumpy concrete surfaces. Hero Xoom 125 seating comfort, features Xoom 125 is a decently comfortable and feature-rich scooter The seating position is decently spacious and while the handlebar will meet a tall rider’s knees at full lock, it’s not bad and is easy to manage. At 777mm, the seat height is low enough, but the seat (and scooter) is fairly wide and riders shorter than 5’6” may not be able to get both feet flat on the ground.  It is decently comfortable but the seat is wide, which could hinder shorter riders from getting their feet on the ground. As for features, unlike the Xoom 110, this scooter thankfully comes with an external fuel-filler cap and there’s even a warning chime in case you forget to close it. Beyond that, some things are nice like the standard LED projector headlamp, or the glovebox with a USB charger and the scrolling LED indicators that come on the top model. However, there are a few missing things like a parking brake lock and a silent-start system. Some may also find the LCD display a bit basic in an age where rivals are moving on to TFT units, but this display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the top model.  LCD display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the ZX variant. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict It could be another win for Hero, priced almost on par with TVS Ntorq 125 What needs to improve is the overall quality and attention to detail, and a closer inspection will reveal uneven panel gaps in a few places and cheap feeling, flexible black plastics in others. That being said, the value is excellent and priced between Rs 86,900 and Rs 92,900, this scooter is on par with the lower variants in the Ntorq line-up and about Rs 30,000 cheaper than the only other 125cc scooter with 14-inch wheels in our market – the Aprilia SR 125. The Xoom has some real desirability to it and it is priced very well too. And with such good pricing, I think Hero has pulled off another win with this scooter, much like they have with the Xtreme 125, which is selling superbly well for the company. Like that bike, this is a very good looking thing, and it has real desirability to it – I’d love to have rocked up to college on this scooter back in the day. But there’s more on offer as well, because, just like the Xtreme 125, the Xoom is quick, fun, practical and very good value for money. Also See: Hero Xoom 125 video review",

    "description": "Traversing Mumbai’s congested streets is already harrowing enough, especially during rush hour. And in the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé, this experience is amplified manifold. Picture being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, with other vehicles precariously close to your oversized luxury SUV that costs more than some apartments.On several occasions, my heart raced as the SUV’s 360-degree camera system lit up, triggered by reckless bikers attempting to squeeze through non-existent gaps. I was on my way to meet my brother-in-law, but I had an ulterior motive. When he moved to Dubai in 2022, I suggested he purchase a GLE Coupé – not the AMG variant but the standard turbo-petrol version. It fit his budget and would have complemented Dubai’s opulent lifestyle. He didn’t heed my advice. Now, driving the 2025 AMG GLE through Mumbai’s Western suburbs, I was determined to prove a point. Feels huge when navigating through congested streets. The GLE’s substantial size, especially its 2.1-metre width, is particularly noticeable in city driving. Despite setting the GLE in Comfort mode (as it lacks an ‘Eco’ setting), the onboard computer never showed fuel efficiency exceeding 5kpl in traffic – unsurprising for an AMG-fettled 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine in a full-size SUV. The ride quality is also less than ideal. Even in Comfort mode, the suspension crashes through potholes, followed by a floaty, vertical movement that tosses passengers around. The front seats are comfortable, but their ventilation is ineffective, and at this price point, the absence of a massage function is disappointing. Moreover, the touch-sensitive steering controls are overly sensitive, often registering unintended inputs. Also, like in most Mercedes models, one must switch off the overly sensitive autonomous braking feature at the start of every journey. Besides sounding sweet, this 6-cyl unit is a strong performer. On the upside, the GLE’s touchscreen interface is one of the best in the business, and the sound quality from the Burmester audio system is equally impressive. Additionally, Mercedes’ integrated starter-generator delivers a seamless and non-intrusive auto stop/start function, making it easier to leave this feature enabled for fuel-saving while idling. After two hours and 20 kilometres, I finally arrived at my destination, relieved to have avoided any scratches on the vehicle. However, it’s worth noting a significant flaw – many modern Mercedes models, including this one, have a noticeable orange peel effect on their paint, giving the body panels an unfinished look that’s unacceptable at this price. When my brother-in-law saw the GLE, he was visibly impressed. The bold LEDs, imposing Panamericana grille and sleek, sloping roofline left him awestruck. The luxurious beige cabin, complemented by wood inlays, silver trims and dramatic ambient lighting, further elevated the experience. While I admired the impeccable fit and finish, I would have preferred a sportier interior with red seatbelts to enhance its AMG character. Also, though the rear seats are spacious, their cushioning is firm, and the upright backrest detracts from comfort. However, the AMG GLE’s highlight is its six-cylinder engine and exhaust note. With the exhaust flaps open, a few solid revs produced a thunderous roar and crackles that disrupted the serene neighbourhood. “I should have listened to you,” my brother-in-law admitted, promptly whipping out his phone to browse websites scouting for used examples in Dubai. Mission accomplished. Firm cushioning, upright backrest angle far from comfy. The following day, we drove the GLE to a popular eatery in Karjat. Traffic on the Western Express Highway was predictably slow, so I opted for the longer but less congested route via the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Coastal Road and AtalSetu before joining the old Mumbai-Pune highway. I’m really glad Mercedes didn’t downsize this six-cylinder turbo-petrol unit. The engine’s performance reserves make highway cruising effortless. It gets to three-digit speeds almost too quickly, and before you know it, you’re well past the speed limit. With the drive mode set to Sport, even the gearbox feels sharper and a touch quicker. The nine-speed automatic performed brilliantly, too, and I never found the need to use the paddle shifters to take manual control. Switching the suspension to Sport mode revealed a firmer yet more composed ride, with the car feeling flat and stable at higher speeds. The steering is sharp, and when driven with verve, the GLE feels surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable for its size. However, its bulk becomes evident during hard braking, with a noticeable nose-dive and a significant weight transfer. Ground clearance in its standard setting is plenty, but the GLE takes it a step ahead with a suspension-lift function to increase ride height further. Honestly, I don’t think this feature is needed for the typical on-road application the GLE AMG will be subjected to. Its bright interiors with wood and aluminium inserts feel luxurious. In conclusion, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé commands attention with its road presence, offers strong performance paired with an exhilarating exhaust note and is a pleasure to drive on open roads. However, its ride quality and rear-seat comfort could have been better, and certain features should have been added to justify its Rs 1.88 crore price tag.

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",

    "description": "Jaguar Land Rover has shelved its plan to jointly produce EVs with Tata Motors in India according to a latest report by Reuters. Last September, JLR and Tata Motors had finalised plans to manufacture the former’s Electrified Modular Architecture (EMA) platform-based EVs in India for the global markets. However, the plans have now fallen through as the economics were not working out, according to sources familiar with the matter. JLR was to produce EVs at Tata’s upcoming Tamil Nadu plant Local suppliers couldn’t meet the price-quality balance JLR local manufacturing plans hit with cost challenges JLR has suspended talks with local suppliers JLR’s EVs were to be built in Tata Motors' upcoming new plant in Tamil Nadu that was slated to produce over 2,50,000 units annually once it reached full capacity in 5-7 years. JLR also planned to source the EV components locally. However, the luxury British carmaker was unable to find the right price-quality balance for its locally sourced EV parts, and hence, has backtracked on its plans. JLR reportedly hosted a meeting with local suppliers in Mumbai last November, where it shared details and plans of locally sourcing the EV components. The suppliers were asked to provide initial information on the pricing of parts, but talks have been completely suspended now. Tata Avinya models likely delayed Tata’s Avinya range of models will use JLR EMA platform This is also expected to delay Tata’s own Avinya range of premium EVs, which are said to use JLR’s EMA platform, helping in economies of scale for both companies. Some components were to be jointly sourced for both companies and Tata's EV unit had planned to firm up orders with some suppliers by the end of January. Tata Motors is now reportedly having to make changes to its designs as the economics of its plan are not working without JLR. The first of the Avinya range of EVs was originally slated to debut in 2025 itself, but, when Tata debuted the second concept in the Avinya range – the Avinya X – in January, we learnt that the first model is expected to hit showrooms in 2026. Now, it remains to be seen if it will be delayed further. In a statement to Reuters, Tata Motors said that the production timelines and choice of models to be built at the new factory will be aligned with Tata and JLR's broader strategy and market requirements.

    "description": "The Delhi government has unveiled an ambitious plan to address growing air quality problems – ensuring that electric vehicles (EVs) account for 95 percent of all new vehicle registrations by 2027. The proposed EV Policy 2.0 is a drastic increase from the previous target of 25 percent EV adoption by 2024. The policy also calls for systematically phasing out CNG vehicles such as auto rickshaws, taxis and light commercial vehicles in order to achieve this target. EV Policy 2.0 targets 95 percent of all new vehicles to be EVs by 2027 CNG commercial vehicles to be phased out and replaced with EVs 90 percent of CNG public buses to be phased out by year-end Delhi EV Policy 2.0 explained The proposed EV Policy 2.0 is expected to take effect in April 2025, and it aims to fast-track EV adoption in Delhi. It will replace the 2020 EV Policy, which set out to achieve 25 percent EV adoption by 2024. That target was not entirely achieved; however, by late 2024, nearly 20 percent of all new vehicle registrations were EVs, thanks to subsidies, tax waivers and campaigns like Switch Delhi.   The new policy aims to build on that and cement Delhi as the leader in EV adoption. As of early 2025, over 3 lakh EVs are registered in Delhi, supported by 4,793 charging points – a number that the policy aims to grow to 18,000 by 2026. The policy plans to achieve this by mandating the installation of EV charging stations in new buildings as well as offering subsidies for private setups. Fast-charging corridors are also planned along major roads.   The policy also specifically targets commercial vehicles that have been identified as significant contributors to the air pollution problem. To that end, the city’s public transit fleet is set to grow to 8,000 e-buses from the current 2,000 by 2026, phasing out 90 percent of the CNG-powered buses by the end of 2025.   Additionally, the policy also plans to systematically phase out other CNG commercial vehicles such as auto rickshaws, taxis and light commercial vehicles while incentivising owners to replace them with EVs. The policy also calls for purchase incentives for two- and three-wheelers that are vital to the city’s transport system.   What does the EV Policy 2.0 mean for you? While the policy has yet to clarify its impact on private vehicle owners, more details are expected as the April 2025 implementation date approaches. This policy could provide a much-needed boost to the EV sector, which has seen a slight decline, with Suzuki Motors recently scaling back its EV plans. Domestic manufacturers like Tata Motors and Mahindra, along with global players such as Tesla, could see increased demand and stand to benefit from the policy’s potential impact.   Also see:   Maruti Suzuki EV launches, target sales volumes scaled down   Tesla restarts scouting for showroom space in Delhi   Delhi Transport Department impounds 2,234 old vehicles to combat air pollution",
