    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ian-callum-reinvents-jaguar-c-x75-new-tech-and-plush-interior",
    "description": "This C-X75 was originally Car 001 built by Williams Advanced Engineering for use in James Bond New commission based on James Bond stunt car is intended to be the ultimate climax for the ill-fated supercar Ian Callum’s self-named design and engineering consultancy has built a second road-legal Jaguar C-X75, described as the “satisfying conclusion” for “the one that got away”. The C-X75, designed by Callum, was unveiled at the 2010 Paris motor show and signed off for production in May 2011. However, it was axed the following year, owing to the global economic downturn. It went on to star in 2015 James Bond film Spectre, as the signature car of villain Mr Hinx. Several stunt cars were built by Williams Advanced Engineering, using a tubular spaceframe chassis and a supercharged 5.0-litre V8 – rather than the twincharged and hybridised 1.6-litre four-cylinder the supercar was originally set to use. A number of those cars ended up in the hands of collectors and, earlier this year, the Callum consultancy unveiled one such example that it had modified to pass individual vehicle approval for use on the open road.  It has now followed this with a one-of-a-kind commission that goes even further, restoring much of the functionality that the C-X75 would have had if it made it to production. For example, Callum has developed its own control electronics and software for the car, meaning it now has two drive modes: one focused on road use and the other for the track, uncorking the exhaust, sharpening gearchanges and improving throttle response. It has also developed an active aerodynamics package that’s said to improve stability above 37mph (60kph), with an airbrake to help with hard stops. It added a hydraulic nose lifter to help with navigating speed bumps and potholes at low speeds, and the supercharged V8 is now mated to a modern seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The bodywork was repainted Willow Green and then realigned to minimise panel gaps, while the rear lights were modified to improve light diffusion. Inside, the barebones cabin from the original stunt car has been swapped for an all-new set-up resembling that of the Bugatti Chiron and Tourbillon. Three small touchscreens (with Apple CarPlay connectivity and integrated dial controls) are stacked vertically along the centre console, and critical controls (such as the ignition button) are placed on a roof-mounted console. The steering wheel was machined from a billet and the leather upholstery was sourced from renowned Scottish firm Bridge of Weir. “Integrating features including air-con and premium audio while also balancing the [noise, vibration and harshness], refinement and hygiene factors such as engineering the door seals to keep the elements out, all while ensuring it still sounded mega, was a formidable but thrilling challenge,” said Callum engineering director Adam Donafresco.  Ian Callum added: “C-X75 was the one that got away – a car brimming with unfulfilled potential. We’ve combined the customer’s wishes with carefully engineered solutions to bring C-X75 to the thoroughly satisfying conclusion it always deserved.”",

The carmaker has sold 2.2 million of them at an accelerating rate since 2010 and currently makes a thousand per day.In 2022, even though the Mk2 was reaching the end of its life and couldn’t offer hybrid power, it became Europe’s most privately bought SUV – and Dacia aims to do even better with this better-looking and even more practical Mk3. The Duster’s drawcard has always been simplicity, practicality and toughness. Dacia has filled this area of the market expertly for the past decade.It nails the fundamentals and saves on the largely immaterial stuff (soft-touch interior mirror, anyone?) resulting in cars that are almost uniquely fit for purpose.The outgoing Dacia Duster was a bit of a breakthrough in this respect, just tipping over the edge from ‘feels cheap, but at least it is cheap’ to being a genuinely good car at an unbeatable price. But can the new Duster live up to the previous edition? Our short answer? The new car is better almost everywhere. Read on to find out why...",

    "description": "Like most skilled craftsmen, Richard ‘Mule’ Pollock can turn his hand to myriad custom motorcycle build styles. But there’s one particular type of bike that sits closest to the center of his wheelhouse; the street tracker. Mule has extensive experience building and racing flat track bikes, and he knows just how to repackage them for street use. So if you’re looking for a Harley Sportster street tracker with a nostalgic American flat track racing vibe, specced for spirited road use, he’ll deliver it with his eyes closed. That was pretty much the brief for Mule’s latest project—with a few special considerations added to the mix. “The customer wanted a Mule-style street tracker with a motor that wasn’t too wacky or high-strung,” the Idaho-based one-man band tells us.…",

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz is on an onslaught in India and wants to leave no segment empty. After EVs, coupe-SUVs, and even sedans, it is now the turn of a convertible. And no, unlike the previous ones (E 53 cabriolet and SL 55), this one does not carry an AMG badge. The CLE 300 is a cabriolet that is far from the usual gung-ho AMG models, and instead, is a convertible for those who want to take it easy. It’s more about style and the feeling of the wind in your hair than about lap times and cornering. Mercedes CLE: design The CLE’s calling card is its top down laid-back character.  In terms of design, there is a faint resemblance to the C-Class, but that’s all it is. Up close, the CLE is very different. The India-spec gets the AMG line treatment as standard, which adds a layer of sportiness to the design. As a result, the only chrome bits on the face are the studded grille and the strip on the front lip. The digital LED headlamps are wider and sharper, the bonnet features two muscular power lines, and the bumpers are sportier with piano black accents. Over to the side, you can tell it’s closer to a C-Class in dimension, thanks to the identical wheelbase. However, it trumps the C in terms of length and width. There is a prominent strip of chrome on the window line, the A-pillars, and the door handles. What also look the part are the sleek 19-inch wheels. A lot of the design will come down to your choice of colour combination. The soft-top can be had in a subtle black shade, but if you want a bit more pop, you can choose a shade of red as well for the roof. At the rear, the LED tail-lamps get a connecting element, and sporty bumpers incorporate the trapezoidal chrome exhaust tips that, like on all modern Mercs, aren’t actually connected to the exhaust system. With the top down, you need to get used to the attention. With the top down, it’s hard to miss the CLE. The long bonnet, raked windshield, sharp wheels and a stunning stance make it a looker. But even with the top up, it’s not like you’ll pass it over as just another Merc. The lines and form factor are properly unique and with the right colour combination, it will stand out. Mercedes CLE: interior Neck warmer acts as a scarf in chilly conditions. The interior of the CLE 300 is quite close to the C-Class when it comes to the dashboard design and layout. The AC vents, 12.3-inch instrument cluster and the 11.9-inch touchscreen are a straight lift, but on the CLE, the touchscreen gets a tilt function to reduce glare, especially when the top is down. Also, like with the soft top on the outside, you can opt for a bold upholstery choice for the interior to add a bit more drama. Wind deflector ensures your hairstyle is unfazed after a drive. There are more exclusive bits in the form of a wind deflector that pops out over the top of the windshield and ensures the airflow isn’t ruining your hairdo. There are vents in the front headrests that channel warm air onto the front passengers’ necks, acting as a virtual scarf in chilly weather. While that may be appreciated up north, the rest of the country is likely to keep it switched off. In terms of comfort, the seats are excellent with the right amount of cushioning and support – long distance drives will be effortless. They also get seat kinetics, along with heating and ventilation, which adds to the overall comfort. The CLE is a 2+2, but space in the back is best suited for children or short drives for adults under six feet. The backrest is upright, underthigh support is near absent and knee room is tight as well. Getting in and out, though, is extremely easy with the top folded away. Spare wheel eats into the already low boot space. What may also pose a challenge for long trips is the lack of boot space. With the soft top down, there isn’t much room; there’s space only for soft bags. Add a spare wheel, which in our conditions is handy, and you’re left with very little space.  Mercedes CLE: performance Relaxed is the one-word description for how the CLE drives. It is laid back, restrained, and perfect for a quiet cruise. With the top up, cabin insulation is excellent and does a great job of muting a lot of ambient chaos of the city. The soft top has multiple layers of sound deadening, which helps keep out the excessive road and wind noise. It can be opened in just 20 seconds at speeds of up to 60kph. The 258hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol is creamy smooth and has dollops of torque that come in gradually. The 258hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol is creamy smooth and has dollops of torque that come in gradually. Instead of lunging ahead each time you flex your right foot, the CLE glides and picks up pace gradually. Though it gets more eager when you change the mode from Comfort to Sport, it still remains close to its character as a Mercedes-Benz rather than an AMG. What adds some zest to the performance is a 48V mild-hybrid system, which provides a bit over 20hp under hard acceleration. Still, nothing about it makes you want to corner hard or drive enthusiastically, and it urges you to cruise and enjoy the top-down experience. At high revs, there is a faint rasp of the exhaust, but nothing more. 0-100kph takes 6.7 seconds and the 9-speed automatic works very well via the paddleshifters. Mercedes CLE: ride, handling Maneuvering the CLE is easy, and despite the heft gained in Sport mode, it remains light on its feet.  Being a long-distance cruiser, the suspension on the CLE is tuned for bad roads. It is soft and supple, and hence, despite the 19-inch wheels, ride comfort is very good. There is no adaptive suspension, so changing the modes won’t change the ride, but the stock setup works very well for our road conditions. One miss would be a nose-lift function as ground clearance is something to worry about, especially with a full load. Handling is effortless with a light steering. Maneuvering the CLE is easy, and despite the heft gained in Sport mode, it remains light on its feet. The 4MATIC all-wheel drive system offers good grip and control in bends, should you end up driving it enthusiastically.   Mercedes CLE: price, verdict At Rs 1.1 crore (ex-showroom, India), the CLE 300 is pricey. However, it has no direct rival as of now. The BMW Z4, at Rs 90.90 lakh, is cheaper and gets more power, but it’s a totally different experience thanks to its sportier character. While the Rs 1.3 crore Mercedes-AMG E 53 cabriolet is a full Rs 20 lakh more – and very good – it isn’t as relaxing as the CLE 300. The CLE 300 is comfy and luxurious enough to use as a daily driver, but can change its character quickly. What the CLE 300 offers is a car that is comfy and luxurious enough to use as a daily driver, but can change its character in 20 seconds and offer a completely different experience. It sits in a sweet spot with no direct competition, and if a smooth, relaxing convertible is what you want, this will be a nice choice.

    "description": "The upcoming new-gen Maruti Dzire has been spied undisguised ahead of its launch, fully revealing its exterior and interior design. The spy shots revealed that the Dzire features significant changes not only over the outgoing model, but also the Swift that it is based on. New Dzire's design to be further distinguished from Swift To get new 82hp, 112Nm Z series engine Price reveal on November 11 New Maruti Dzire: exterior, interior design The compact sedan gets a completely new front-end design that features no resemblance to the new Swift launched earlier this year. It gets a large grille up front, flanked by sharp-looking rectangular LED headlamps. The new Dzire also gets redesigned fog lamp housing along with a chunky gloss black trim connecting the headlamps, with a chrome strip at the bottom. The upcoming sedan looks more mature than the outgoing model, thanks to the sharp styling elements.  The rear-end features Y-shaped LED elements in the tail lamps, with a chrome strip running across the tailgate connecting the two. The boot-lid features a spoiler-like hump, while the rear bumper features some contouring elements. The higher models will get diamond-cut alloy wheels. The interior shot confirms that it will use the same overall layout as the Swift, with a 9-inch free-standing touchscreen system and a new steering wheel. Features on offer will likely include a segment-first electric sunroof, an analogue instrument cluster with a 4.2-inch digital MID. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the new Dzire could even get ADAS – at least in the higher variants. New Maruti Dzire: powertrain  The new Dzire will be offered with the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine as the Swift that makes 82hp and 112Nm. It will also get a petrol-CNG option. A 5-speed manual gearbox will be standard, while the petrol variants will get an automatic gearbox option. Expect Maruti to commence bookings for the new Dzire in the coming weeks, with deliveries starting by around mid-November. Just like the current model, the new Dzire will take on the likes of the Hyundai Aura, Honda Amaze and Tata Tigor. Image source Also see: New Maruti Dzire launch on November 11",

    "description": "The passenger vehicle industry has been experiencing a slowdown in sales for the past few months, and speaking at Maruti Suzuki’s half-yearly results announcement, Chairman RC Bhargava, attributed this overall slowdown to the declining sales in the sub-Rs 10 lakh segment. “The sub-Rs 10 lakh car segment has witnessed a sharp decline in recent years, and if this segment does not grow, there will gradually be less feeders for upper segments as well,” said Bhargava. Maruti Suzuki witnessed 14 percent growth in retail sales in festive season Overall industry outlook is 3-4 percent growth for next quarter Bhargava pointed out that 80-90 percent of all retail car sales in the 2018-19 period were in the sub-Rs lakh segment. However, the pattern has completely reversed post Covid where the Rs 10-20 lakh segment is currently the most booming segment. “This time the slowdown is not due to supply chain constraints or shortages in semiconductors. I think affordability could be a factor as prices of new cars have gone up massively,” added Bhargava. He also noted that first time car buyers have declined for Maruti Suzuki, but it’s the additional and replacement car buyers that have increased in the recent past. Stringent emissions norms and safety regulations have, no doubt, massively pushed up new car prices in recent years. This has also made it more difficult for carmakers to make profits in these more affordable segments, which is why they tend to push for more-profitable SUV categories. Maruti Suzuki, too, has capitalized on this wave with several new models in the Rs 10-20 lakh category which includes the likes of the Fronx, Jimny and Grand Vitara, as well as existing strong nameplates like the Brezza and Ertiga. “We were late to the above Rs 10 lakh segment, but if we didn’t grow here, we wouldn’t have above 40 percent share in the market today,” acknowledged Bhargava.    Bhargava projected the overall industry to grow by 3-4 percent in the next quarter, driven primarily by midsize SUVs and MPVs, and a similar growth rate is also expected at Maruti Suzuki.
