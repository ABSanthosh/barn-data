    "description": "This 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,400 Gullwing coupes built during three years of production and was shipped to the Mercedes-Benz agent in London, England, on July 26, 1955, for delivery to the Right Honorable Lord Terence O’Neill, who later became the fourth Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Chassis 55000545 passed through the hands of two additional UK owners before being imported in the 1970s to the US, where it spent time under the stewardship of two different German natives in California. It was sold in 2004 to Scott Grundfor, whose San Luis Obispo shop subsequently performed a refurbishment for the car’s next owner between 2005 and 2007. Work during the project is said to have included a repaint in the original shade of Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Fawn MB-Tex and red plaid cloth, and an overhaul of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six. The car was later purchased in 2016 by a San Rafael collector who commissioned a further refresh that was carried out over the ensuing eight years. Additional features include Bosch direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, a four-speed manual transmission, a 3.42:1-ratio differential, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, interchangeable sets of Fawn MB-Tex and plaid cloth seat cushions, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 Gullwing was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve with a copy of its factory data card, a Mercedes-Benz Classic certificate, invoices from work performed between 2017 and 2024, a set of Taris Charysyn fitted luggage, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "In the ADV world, the GS moniker carries some serious baggage – but the good kind. A brand that’s instantly recognisable, even in the remotest of trails. But what if you want that GS clout without lugging around upwards of 250kg of flagship girth off-road? That’s where the F 900 GS rolls in. It costs Rs 1.25 lakh more than its predecessor and is now lighter, livelier, and loaded, but there’s also a bit of a catch. BMW F 900 GS design and quality (8/10) The F 900 is now more compact and lighter than its predecessor The F 850 GS looked like a skinnier F 850 GSA. The F 900 GS, however, comes across with a rally-raid aesthetic that looks even narrower and more focused. BMW has redesigned the fuel tank with plastic panels, resulting in a slimmer midsection. The entire silhouette looks leaner, and the motorcycle is now 14kg lighter than before. It appears someone has already kicked the indicator/brake light The bike is currently offered in two variants: Style Passion and Style GS Trophy. The Style Passion variant, which is the one tested here, features 20mm less suspension travel, a more accessible 835mm seat height, plastic handguards, a clear visor and misses out on a bash plate. For an additional Rs 25,000, you can opt for the Style GS Trophy variant, which offers 20mm more suspension travel, a taller 870mm seatheight, rugged metal handguards, a black tinted visor, and a slightly thicker, more comfortable seat. High quality and tactile switchgear make navigating the user interface a breeze While this motorcycle is specced out nicely, it misses out on the Enduro Pro Package available internationally. That would have included a 45mm fully adjustable Showa fork, a black handlebar with aluminium forged risers (20mm taller), and other enhancements that would’ve raised its off-road credentials. The new rally raid aesthetic looks more focused the F 850 GS Everything you see here is standard, except for the engine guard (Rs 40,000 extra). While the overall design is purposeful, the São Paulo Yellow paint may divide opinion. The headlight (same as the G 310 GS) could’ve been brighter, and the brake-light setup, which is integrated into the indicators, also looks like it could be a fall or an accidental snag away from a trip to the service centre. BMW F 900 GS position and comfort (7/10) Overall riding position is better suited for off-road riding The lower seat height of the Style Passion variant will help shorter riders, but this is still a tall bike. While the reach to the handlebar feels slightly stretched while seated, that same reach works well when you’re standing on the pegs. Seat padding and comfort could have been better The tank is now narrower, the seat more rally-style, and the overall ergonomics are off-road-biased. While standing on the pegs feels natural and confident, long-distance comfort is compromised. Another thing worth mentioning is that while the seat height is lower, the seat padding is also thinner, which eventually results in saddle soreness. It isn’t very pillion-friendly either. The advantage of this firm seat is that standing up from it feels a lot easier, but it will come at the cost of long-distance comfort. If height isn’t a concern, pay the extra money and get the GS Trophy variant instead Range is another limitation. The new tank holds 14.5 litres – half a litre less than before. Compared to the F 900 GS Adventure’s 23-litre tank, the standard F 900 GS will likely cover under 300km on a full tank. The lack of grab rails and mounting points also hurt its touring credentials. BMW does offer panniers and luggage racks, but these are optional extras that could set you back over a lakh. BMW F 900 GS performance and refinement (9/10) It has more performance and better refinement than the model it replaces Under the skin, BMW has worked on the old 853cc motor, bumping displacement to 895cc. It now makes 10hp and 1Nm more than before. Fire it up, and the engine has a bit more character, thanks in part to the standard Akrapovič can. Akrapovic exhaust looks great but not much louder than stock On the move, the bike feels livelier across the rev range. The broader torque spread allows for easy chugging in higher gears and confident overtakes. There’s no explosive top end, but the mid-range is very strong, perfect for trails and highway cruising. The F900 GS's motor is pretty refined at triple digit cruising speeds Despite its upright stance, the F 900 GS is deceptively quick and will get into high triple-digit territory with ease. Above 160kph, the blocky Metzeler Karoo 4 tyres become the limiting factor. City commutes don’t reveal much heat despite the season, and it shouldn’t be a problem in traffic. Punchy motor and well calibrated electronics ensure controlled slides Hit the dirt, and power delivery is strong but predictable, with plenty of bottom-end grunt to crawl up rocky climbs or make any overtakes on highways. The off-road traction control system also works well, enabling plenty of slide, but not too much. The six-speed gearbox is slick, but the bi-directional quickshifter requires a firmer foot, especially with standard road boots. It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals. BMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10) It handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage There has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS. It still retains that familiar, planted GS feel, but now with more willingness to play. Despite the knobby tyres the F 900 GS handles rather well At 226kg, it’s not light by enduro standards, but its weight is so well-balanced that it never feels intimidating. The suspension has a soft baseline tune but can feel firm over sharp bumps. Meanwhile, there’s not much you can do about the front on the Style variant as rebound and preload adjustability can only be tweaked at the rear. The F900 GS feels right at home off-road The GS Trophy variant gets an additional 20mm of travel and would be a better pick for serious trail work. Even in this spec, though, the F 900 GS manages light to moderate trails quite well, and it’s predictable and easy to handle on loose surfaces. While there is a lack of feedback, the F 900 GS is quite eager to fall into corners Enduro Pro mode is the only fully customisable mode, and, even with traction control on, it rarely cuts in unnecessarily. ABS, however, cannot be fully switched off at the front, and there were a few instances of it intervening unexpectedly. Early signs of wear are a bit concerning On the road, the bike feels surprisingly light and easy to filter through traffic. Around corners, the chassis feels composed, but the Karoo 4s start to show their dual-purpose nature. These tyres work well off-road but wear quickly, with significant wear already visible with less than 3,000km on the odo. BMW F 900 GS features and safety (8/10) The F900 GS has a whole host of electronic aids that can be fine tuned to suit your style It features a crisp and clear 6.5-inch TFT with an easy to read and use layout. Additionally, this TFF supports Bluetooth connectivity and other app based features. As standard, the F 900 GS gets four riding modes (Rain, Road, Enduro and Enduro Pro). The best TFT in its class with an excellent layout While the other modes cannot be tweaked, the Enduro Pro mode is the only one that allows you to fine tune its parameters. Additionally, this model also gets heated grips for India which should be handy in colder parts of our country. The F 900 GS also gets adjustable gearshift and brake levers to suit riders of different shapes and sizes.  BMW F 900 GS price and verdict (9/10) The F 900 GS significantly under cuts its closest rivals BMW hasn’t just added 50cc and changed the paint; it’s a proper evolution of the F 850 GS. With sharper handling, better ergonomics, and stronger mid-range performance, this is a much more focused machine than its predecessor. Even without the international-spec Showa fork or Enduro Pro pack, the Indian version remains a well-equipped and versatile ADV, especially for those who prefer trails to tarmac. Factor in BMW’s aggressive pricing, despite being a CBU, and this bike undercuts its key rival. If you prefer broken trails and dirt roads over well paved tarmac, the F 900 GS is one to consider If you were to throw in the extra Rs 25,000 to get the top variant and spec in some accessory extras, you’d still manage to undercut the Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro and the Ducati Desert X by a fair margin. If road touring is your goal, BMW has you covered with the F 900 GS Adventure. But if you’re after a lighter, more playful GS that still carries the badge’s spirit, the F 900 GS, particularly in GS Trophy trim, might just be your Goldilocks bike.

    "description": "Yamaha’s FZ family has been around long enough to earn the “old guard” tag in the 150cc space. It’s the motorcycle that brought muscle to the masses when it first launched and has since become a go-to for smooth, reliable everyday riding along with big-bike looks. Over the years, the bike has received numerous updates, and the latest one brings in some interesting new features. Enter the FZ-S Fi Hybrid, a variant that doesn’t promise earth-shattering performance, but what it does offer is more efficiency and a big step up in tech and features. The big question, though, is this: does the hybrid tech make a difference, or is it just a buzzword? Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid design and features (8/10) Muscular design with added TFT, Bluetooth, and hybrid tech Visually, Yamaha has played it safe, and there are no major design changes apart from some new colours and refreshed indicators. This is still unmistakably an FZ, and it continues to have that muscular streetfighter stance that made it so popular in the first place. Build quality is mostly very good, which is typical of Yamaha. A noticeable gap between the seat and the tank However, what caught my attention was a noticeable gap between the seat and the tank that effectively gives you a peep at the cylinder head. This Fi Hybrid variant is also available in an exclusive shade of grey and blue. The new colours, a touch of blue on the engine case, new switchgear and a brand-new TFT are the only ways to differentiate it.  Feature-packed TFT with good legibility is a boon The new 4.2-inch full-colour TFT display is a big step up from the drab LCD units we’re used to in this segment. It’s crisp and well laid out and offers Bluetooth connectivity through Yamaha’s Y-Connect app. The features list includes turn-by-turn navigation, call/SMS alerts, phone battery status, last parking location, and even malfunction notifications. It’s more tech than most 150cc buyers expect, and that’s a good thing.  New switchgear is well-finished but isn’t too tactile The LED headlamp does a decent job with illumination and is reliable for any late-night commutes. While single-channel ABS is standard, Yamaha has even thrown in traction control, which, with this amount of power, feels about as necessary as a raincoat in a desert. You’d have to ride through an oil spill to get it to kick in, and while it is a nice thing to have, dual-channel ABS would have been a more valuable safety feature. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid position and comfort (9/10) It has a relaxed, upright seating position with a spacious, well-padded seat Swing a leg over, and you’ll find that Yamaha gives you a commanding yet relaxed posture, which is ideal for city commutes and short highway stints. The seat is flat, spacious and adequately padded for both the rider and the pillion. At 790mm, its height remains accessible for most riders, and the bike’s 138kg kerb weight means it’s easy to manoeuvre in tight traffic. Add to that a well-judged footpeg position, and what you get is a very accommodating rider’s triangle for daily riding, with a hint of sportiness thrown in. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid performance and refinement (8/10) Refined and smooth in the city, but performance feels more 125cc than 150cc The 149cc air-cooled SOHC engine makes 12.4hp and 13.3Nm; on paper, it’s the same as the regular FZ-S. But the big news here is the Smart Motor Generator (SMG), which supports the crankshaft by delivering assistance at low RPMs. This system is similar to what you’ll find in the likes of the TVS Jupiter, but it’s hard to feel the system at work in the Yamaha.  Our performance tests also show very similar figures to the older model, so it’s safe to assume that there are no real performance gains here. What has improved is the fuel efficiency, but how much of that is down to the hybrid tech and how much is thanks to the new start/stop system is unclear. What we can say for certain is that the start/stop system works well and is one of the best we’ve experienced so far. It restarts quickly and silently when you pull in the clutch, even if you accidentally stall the engine, which is a slick little party trick. Out on the road, the motor is quite refined and tractable, with barely any vibration even at higher revs. The power delivery is rather linear, and the motor will happily pick up from 30kph in 5th gear. The performance is decent till about 80kph, but anything beyond that feels strenuous. Overall, it feels closer to a quick 125cc bike than a 150cc or 160cc one, and while the FZ is effortless to ride, it certainly isn’t exciting.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid ride comfort and handling (7/10) Well-balanced in the city, but its firm suspension compromises comfort over rough roads The chassis is unchanged, and that’s not a bad thing – mostly. The steering is light, the turning radius is tight, and the bike feels nicely balanced in the city. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it, which results in decent handling but comes as a compromise in city comfort. For a motorcycle whose engine has evolved in the direction of being a city commuter, the suspension should have become a bit softer as well. High-speed stability is decent, though this isn’t a bike that eggs you on to carve corners. Braking duties are handled by discs at both ends, and while the bite isn’t razor-sharp, it’s progressive and confidence-inspiring.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid price and verdict (8/10) Tech-loaded, fuel-efficient commuter that feels overpriced for the performance it offers At Rs 1.45 lakh, the FZ-S Fi Hybrid costs about Rs 10,000 more than the standard FZ-S. While you get better efficiency and a TFT screen with Bluetooth, this bike is priced higher than the top versions of the Bajaj Pulsar N160 and TVS Apache RTR 160 4V. Those motorcycles offer vastly better performance, upside-down forks and dual-channel ABS. What Yamaha has created here is a good-looking city commuter that brings premium features and better fuel economy. But that comes at a steep price, and if you couldn’t care less about the TFT and don’t mind being your own stop/start system, you won’t be missing out by settling for a more affordable variant from the FZ line-up.  Also see: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 review: Meaningful changes",

    "title": "Nissan Leaf reinvented as fastback SUV - and we've driven it",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/nissan-leaf-reinvented-fastback-suv-and-weve-driven-it",
    "description": "Nissan says insights from customers can help new Leaf ‘set standard for future EVs’ The Nissan Leaf has been reinvented as a sleek SUV with a range of up to 375 miles thart its chief engineer has vowed will “set the standard for future electric vehicles” – and we've had a first taste. The pioneering EV was launched in 2010 as a mid-sized hatchback but has been entirely reinvented for this third generation to take on the likes of the Skoda Elroq and Kia EV3 in the family crossover class. It will be sold globally and manufactured at Nissan's Sunderland plant in the UK. While the new Leaf has just been revealed, Autocar has already had two runs in prototype versions, first at Nissan's Grandrive test track in Japan and then at Millbrook Proving Ground in the UK. New Nissan Leaf: technical details The new Leaf sits on the CMF-EV platform that's used by the larger Nissan Ariya and various Renault EVs, meaning it’s technically unrelated to the first two generations of Leaf. However, chief engineer Hiroki Isobe told Autocar that learnings from those cars – gained from more than 700,000 global sales that led to more than 17 billion miles of driving – were invaluable. “The aim was to set the standard for future electric vehicles,” he said. “We’re building on the Leaf DNA: it’s created for everyday customers and the goal was to create an easy-to-use EV that can be driven without any discomfort. We have a huge database of information about what customers want.” That put the focus on maximising the efficiency of the Leaf, which resulted in an aerodynamically sculpted body, including flush door handles, a steeply raked windscreen and an underfloor cover, combining for a drag coefficient of just 0.25. There’s also a revamped ‘three-in-one’ electric motor and a separate heat pump to optimise the efficiency of the heating system. It sits on 18in or 19in tyres, depending on spec. Two battery options will be offered, with usable capacities of 52kWh and 75kWh, giving the car an official range of 271 or 375 miles. But Nissan emphasises its efficiency at motorway speed, claiming it can cover more than 200 miles at an 80mph cruise. Unlike previous Leafs, the new car will be equipped in the UK with a CCS charging system, rather than a Chademo one, which can take DC rapid-charging rates of up to 150kW. The interior has also been completely reinvented, with the dashboard built around a pair of 14.3in screens running a Google-based infotainment system. Despite the Leaf’s new fastback bodystyle, Nissan claims it has plenty of rear head room, while the boot capacity is put at 437 litres. The Leaf will be offered with a range of semiautonomous driving technology and a 3.7kW vehicle-to-load outlet. It will be built and sold globally, including at Sunderland. That plant has been heavily upgraded and expanded to house production of the Leaf along with the next-generation Juke and Qashqai crossovers, which are both set to sit on the same CMF-EV platform. While the new Juke is expected in the coming years, the next-generation Qashqai has been delayed. First drive: Nissan Leaf prototype The new Nissan Leaf feels like a bit of a milestone moment: it’s the first mainstream mass-market EV to reach a third generation. Although that really depends on how you define such things: to all intents and purposes, the new Leaf is an entirely new model. The only thing it has in common with its pioneering predecessors is a name. The original Leaf arrived in 2010 as a mid-sized five-door hatchback with a Chademo charging port, a 24kWh battery, a 124-mile range, a price tag of £23,350 after a government grant and a whole load of novelty about whether a car powered by batteries could actually find mainstream buyers. The Mk2 Leaf followed in 2018, eventually featuring a 60kWh battery that gave it a range of up to 239 miles and priced from £21,990 (again, after a government grant). Fifteen years after being launched and the Leaf is as unrecognisable compared with its predecessors as the concept of a government grant is to UK EV buyers. For this third generation it has grown substantially and is now firmly a crossover – albeit a very sleek one – rather than a hatchback. That shift in size helps make way for the new Renault-built Nissan Micra but is also designed to position the new Leaf as the primary car of a household. The Leaf now sits on the same platform as the larger Ariya EV and has a strong family resemblance to that model: it’s determinedly less frumpy than the Leafs of old. That’s in part because of the brief the development team was set, described by chief vehicle engineer Hiroki Isobe as: “Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.” Plenty of sleek aerodynamic elements help the new body to achieve that improved drag coefficient of 0.25 (the Mk2 Leaf’s was 0.28) and thereby maximise range, and there’s now a bespoke heat pump for the heating system. With the biggest 75kWh (usable capacity) battery pack fitted, the Leaf has an official range of 375 miles. But the main focus has been on offering real-world range at speed, and indeed Nissan claims it can cover more than 200 miles at an 80mph cruise. When you do reach your destination, it will charge at up to 150kW via – gasp! – a CCS plug. At which time, can we all please spare a moment to remember Chademo, forever to be remembered as the Betamax of EV charging? Any judgement on that will have to wait, though, because so far our running in the Leaf has been far more limited. I sampled a prototype version under a long embargo at Nissan’s Grandrive test track in Yokohama, then last week editor Mark Tisshaw tackled the Hill Route at Millbrook Proving Ground in one. Both tracks gave hints at the new Leaf’s dynamic prowess but little more. Mechanically, the Leaf has a new ‘three-in-one’ electric motor (meaning it combines the inverter, motor and reducer into a single package) that sends up to 214bhp and 261lb ft of torque to the front wheels. There’s MacPherson-strut suspension up front and a multi-link arrangement at the rear, while wheel sizes range from 18in to 19in. Nissan says the Leaf has been set up for a comfortable ride in order to better fit its family car brief. And even on a short drive, what’s instantly apparent is the refinement: it’s really quiet and calm, with strong noise isolation. The power delivery feels linear and smooth as well: it’s not an EV for showing off with dramatic acceleration, but it has strong pick-up, as you would expect. The Mk2 Leaf’s one-pedal mode returns, plus there’s now adjustable brake regen controlled by paddles on the steering wheel. They work well, but I suspect most drivers will end up using the one-pedal mode most of the time. When it comes to dynamics, the new Leaf is fairly typical among crossovers of this size: our initial experiences have revealed no real foibles or annoyances that would put you off, but those searching for pure driver engagement will be left wanting. Still, the steering is well weighted and it’s a very relaxing car to drive. It’s also a pleasant place to sit: the dashboard’s twin digital screens are crisp and clear and there are useful physical buttons for key functions, although we didn’t have enough time to really find out how well either worked. The layout is a little more traditional than the Ariya’s, but in terms of practicality that’s not a bad thing at all. Back in 2010, there were no rivals for it if you were looking for something electric, but today the electric crossover market is incredibly crowded. Nissan will be relieved, then, that these early drives suggest the reinvented Leaf should find itself near the sharp end.",

    "description": "Boxy new Super EV Concept hints at a rival to the Hyundai Inster, Renault Twingo and Fiat 500e Honda will show a concept car hinting at a new city-focused EV at next month’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. Named the Super EV Concept, it is an A-segment hatchback to rival the Hyundai Inster, Fiat 500e and upcoming Renault Twingo, with styling that draws on the previous Honda E supermini. Technical details remain thin on the ground, but Honda said it is intended to show how a small, affordable EV can be fun to drive. It has already been tested in the UK as part of a broader international roll-out. The Super EV Concept will be unveiled in full at the Festival of Speed, which will take place between 10 and 13 July in West Sussex.  Honda will also use the event to showcase the radical 0 Series SUV concept in Europe for the first time, as well as the Civic Type R Ultimate Edition. The new Prelude coupé will also run up the famed Goodwood hillclimb. Any production version of the Super EV would likely represent the entry point to Honda's future EV line-up, sitting opposite the upmarket 0 Series range. The Japanese brand plans to launch seven new EVs in the coming years, with these using a new platform, new batteries and new motor technologies, in an effective reset of its approach to electrification compared with the old E and current e:Ny1. “As society is starting to move from the early stage to the widespread adoption stage, the time has come to invest in our EV strategy,” Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told Autocar last year. However, Honda is also going big on hybridisation, with 13 new models due globally by 2030 in a bid to bridge the gap to mass-adoption of battery-electric cars. These will use what the brand has claimed to be the most efficient combustion-engined powertrains yet.",

    "description": "Some images of a new camouflaged Mahindra test mule recently surfaced on the internet. Autocar India can confirm that the spotted prototype is a major facelift for the Mahindra Bolero Neo that’s scheduled for a debut on August 15. While initial spy images were quite blurred, new spy shots now give us a clearer look at some of the design details on the upcoming Bolero Neo facelift. Update for Bolero Neo to bring completely new body shell Will come fitted with six airbags as a safety update Will debut on August 15 Mahindra Bolero Neo facelift: what to expect?  Completely new body panels all around  First thing first, this is not an all-new generation, but a heavily facelifted version of the Bolero Neo. So, it will continue to be underpinned by a ladder frame chassis, but Mahindra has opted for a completely different top hat with this update. None of the body panels seem to have any resemblance with the existing Bolero Neo, and that’s not the usual approach with facelifts. At the front, the test mule can be seen with the distinctive Mahindra grille and a new logo, but the bigger highlight are the circular headlamps that seems to have come from the Thar Roxx. It also gets a more upright nose, a newer and more rugged looking bumper and new LED fog lamps, too. In profile, it continues with very short overhangs and squared-out wheel arches, but the keen eyed among you will notice a new glass house, new flush fitting door handles, more pronounced body cladding and new multi-spoke alloy wheels that look very similar to that of the XUV700’s. At the rear, it continues with a side-hinged door and a tail-gate mounted spare wheel, but the rear quarter view also reveals a more prominent shoulder line and new vertically-stacked tail lamps. In fact, the rear quarter almost has a Land Rover Defender-like profile, while the front end looks much like a Mercedes G-Wagon. Overall, it seems to have moved up in positioning, and appears a lot less utilitarian. On that matter, sources say that Mahindra will also equip the Bolero Neo facelift with six airbags, among several other changes to the interior. The interiors were not seen in these images, but it could get an all-new dashboard, a larger touchscreen and even a sunroof, among other features. Mahindra Bolero Neo facelift: powertrain options Mahindra currently offers the Bolero Neo with a 1.5-litre, three-cylinder diesel engine that produces 100hp and 260Nm of torque, and it solely comes mated to a manual gearbox. It is unclear if Mahindra will introduce any mechanical upgrades with this facelift, although an automatic gearbox can be expected to be added to the powertrain lineup.  The updated Bolero Neo is expected to debut at Mahindra’s annual Independence Day gala on August 15, perhaps in a near-production guise. The launch is expected sometime next year, as was corroborated by Mahindra at its earnings call earlier this year.

    "description": "Happy tenth birthday to the Bentley Bentayga! It’s hard to believe the SUV has been around this long, and over the years, it has seen many powertrains, a much-needed facelift, and the addition of an extended-wheelbase version. But while it was a pioneer of sorts when it was launched, a decade on, the market is flooded with super-luxury sports SUVs. So, as a sort of birthday present to itself, the performance-oriented Speed variant has been reintroduced, albeit repositioned slightly to help it stand out better in a crowded marketplace. Where the previous Speed represented the ultimate in Bentley excess, the new one leans more into its sporty side. The W12 engine has been replaced by the twin-turbo V8, albeit without the hybrid system of the Continental GT Speed, the suspension has been stiffened, and almost all mechanical aspects of the car have been retuned to make it more agile, more responsive and more emotional. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed exterior design and engineering – 8/10 Bigger wheel option adds drama to an SUV already high on road presence. Optional 23-inch wheels are largest ever on a Bentley. You’ll have to be well versed in Bentley’s various model lines to identify the Bentayga Speed, because the visual cues are few and subtle, and much can be changed in customisation. For example, red brake calipers are standard on the Speed, but you can specify other colours. You can also specify silicon carbide brake discs – the largest in the world, measuring 440mm at the front. You can also option 23-inch wheels for the first time ever on a Bentley – finished here in Grey Satin – and these do well to highlight the Speed’s added performance. There are ‘Speed’ badges on the front doors of course, and by default, bright chrome is replaced by dark chrome, the headlamp internals are dark, while the tail-lamp lenses are clear. Headlamp internals get a darkened finish on the Speed variant. These changes aside, there are of course different bumpers on the Speed compared to other Bentaygas, and the options list does include a few unique extras. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed interior space and comfort – 8/10 Classy place to spend time, enhanced with a few sportier trim options. The Bentayga Speed is not available in EWB guise, but don’t think that means it is short on space, comfort or luxury. The rear seat can be had as a single bench or a split, two-seat layout with powered chairs, heating, ventilation and massage, and a fixed centre console between them. These offer exceptional support and comfort, ‘Speed’ embroidered into the seatbacks and the option of sportier upholstery options, like Alcantara. You get the option of a panoramic sunroof as well, and powered window blinds and a touchscreen controller are also part of the package. The Speed is not available in EWB guise, but there's no shortage of space or comfort.  Quality is, expectedly, exceptional, save for the front centre console, which as in all Bentleys, continues to be plagued by very ordinary-looking plastic buttons. Elsewhere though, you’ll find thick hides, generous cross stitching, shiny chrome and vast customisation possibility (although not quite as much as in the range-topping Mulliner variant). This includes a huge choice of trim levels, including stone instead of wood – something unique to Bentley. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed features and safety – 8/10 Good amount of standard features, and lots more possible via the options list. As with any luxury vehicle these days, prepare to spend for additional specification and personalisation, but in the Bentayga Speed, the upgrades are more performance oriented. That said, the standard specification for the SUV appears to be pretty generous as well. It includes a 590W, 12-speaker audio system (20-speaker Naim audio is optional), Matrix LED headlamps, 8 airbags, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, park assist, onboard Wifi and a digital assistant. Centre console still retains tactile physical controls for essential functions. The 10.9-inch central touchscreen will be familiar if you’ve used other VW Group luxury cars, and the layout is generally simple and easy to navigate. Bentley must be credited here for providing tactile physical controls on the centre console for all essential functions and then some. The digital driver’s display has also come a long way in a decade and now has several customisable displays, including some unique to the Speed, all of which look sensational. There’s also a heads-up display, and while clean looking, it doesn’t show you a whole lot of information; there’s an ADAS suite on offer as well. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed performance and refinement – 8/10 Feels strong and surprisingly aggressive, but not quite up there with the peak super SUVs. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed specsEngineTwin-turbocharged V8Displacement3996ccPower650hpTorque850NmGearbox8-speed automaticDrive layout Permanent all-wheel drive0-100kph (claimed)3.6 secondsTop-Speed (claimed)310kph Yes, the venerable 6.0-litre W12 that Bentley introduced in 2003 is no more – it was simply too expensive and low-volume to keep upgrading for newer emissions norms. Bentley says customers have been very accepting of the 4.0-litre V8, including its PHEV versions, but for the Bentayga, it will be non-hybrid only. This not only saves over 200kg in an already heavy car, but wound up to 650hp and 850Nm in the Speed, it’s more powerful than the W12 ever was. And it’s not just bigger turbos that have brought them to these figures. The V8 uses higher-flow fuel injectors, the compression ratio has been lowered and lag is said to be reduced too, thanks to greater turbo control. The throttle map has been made more responsive, and the gearshifts quickened, and there’s also launch control for the very first time. Venerable W12 has made way for a non-hybrid, 650hp 4.0-litre V8 engine. The result is 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 310kph, making this the quickest and fastest Bentayga ever, and Bentley says all this comes into play only in Sport mode; Comfort and ‘Bentley’ mode remain as refined as they ever were. What can’t be put into numbers is the effect the new sports exhaust has. By default, the Speed gets a steel sports exhaust different to the rest of the range, but as an option, there is a titanium Akrapovic option that saves 12.5kg. It also sounds utterly wild, especially from the outside; almost unbecoming of a car with the Flying B on its nose. Inside, they’ve chosen not to enhance the sound through the speakers, so though a little muted by all that sound insulation, what you hear is real. Acceleration is forceful in Sport mode, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes. Performance is every bit as strong as you’d expect, with launch control, in particular, feeling almost comically aggressive in a luxurious barge such as this. And, as Bentley said, there is a huge difference between Sport and the lesser modes. Acceleration is forceful, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes, and when you’re ready to rein it in, those massive brakes haul you back down with ease. It’s, of course, not as strong as some of its PHEV rivals like the Cayenne Turbo S e-hybrid or Lamborghini Urus SE, or even its stablemate, the new Continental GT Speed, but they’ve managed to deliver an eagerness and potency far greater than any previous Bentayga has delivered. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed mileage and efficiency – 6/10 The kind of efficiency you’d expect from an ultra-luxury performance SUV. Standard Bentayga V8 has a WLTP-rated fuel efficiency of 7.5kpl. Of course, mileage in a 2.5-tonne twin-turbo V8 SUV is not going to wow you, and at no point on our test drive did we even look at the figure. As the product is brand new, Bentley has yet to reveal an official fuel economy figure for it. However, for reference, the WLTP rating of the standard V8 variant is 7.5kpl, while the Speed’s W12-powered predecessor was rated at 6.99kpl. If you are after reasonable running costs, though, there is the V6 hybrid version of the Bentayga, rated at a solid 33.33kpl on the WLTP cycle. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed ride comfort and handling – 9/10 Deftly hops between limousine plush and razor sharp at the flick of a switch. More impressive than even the performance of the Bentayga Speed is its dual dynamic nature. Here too, there have been several key tweaks. Rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll bars are standard, as is a limited-slip differential. The suspension tune is 15 percent stiffer overall than the base Bentayga, and as mentioned before, silicone carbide brakes and 23-inch wheels (with Pirelli P Zero rubber) are optional. The torque vectoring system has been tuned to be far more aggressive, while the ESC system has been slackened to allow for far more slip. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight.  The results of these tweaks are easy to see, as they imbue the big Bentley with an agility never seen before. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight, and more akin to its sportier VW Group counterparts – the Urus and the Cayenne. It’s far more eager to turn in, and it now has a greater affinity for oversteer. This was made even clearer on the dirt track that Bentley had laid out for us, across which the large SUV bounded gleefully like a bucking bronco, kicking its tail out at every opportunity. On a dirt track, it was eager to kick its tail out at every oppurtunity. Even on the tarmac, though, you can feel the active roll-suppression system working overtime to keep the Bentayga level, as the rear-axle steering cuts the turning radius down to hatchback size. While luxury is what most of us associate Bentley with, the Speed wants to remind you that the brand has a history of sport too. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel plush; on the contrary, its air suspension manages the difficult task of oscillating between comfort and sport, and it does it seamlessly. You do feel the 23-inch wheels over bumps, though. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed price and verdict – 7/10 Bentayga’s new-found naughty side elevates it above the rest of the range. We’ll admit Bentley’s decision for the Bentayga Speed to forego the potent new 780hp PHEV powertrain, which its two-door Continental GT stablemate had recently received, left us a little confused. After all, the ultra-high-end performance luxury SUV, where a few 100 kilograms could easily be added or removed without anyone noticing, seems ideally suited to such a powertrain. And the Speed models have always been about excess, so why not give this Bentayga the most excessive powertrain? Foregoing the 780hp PHEV V8 gives the Speed a purer, more engaging experience. Bentley says that it wanted to go deeper into sports SUV territory, following customer feedback that cried out for a purer, more engaging experience. To that end, they’ve succeeded, and have also cleverly filled a void in the market vacated by VW Group’s own Lamborghini Urus. With the Urus having moved up into ludicrous 800hp PHEV hyper-SUV territory, Bentley’s decision not to follow it and instead fill the void might just be a masterstroke. Perhaps this should have been the new ‘Bentayga S’, which, fun fact, has been phased out by the Speed, since the two would have been too similar in proposition. While we do not have the Bentayga Speed India price just yet, expect it to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom, before options). It sounds ludicrous to think of such vehicles in terms of segments and rivals, but the Aston Martin DBX 707 does come to mind, an SUV which seems like it might be a tad more engaging, but not quite as plush and cossetting as the Bentley. Bentayga Speed India price expected to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom). The Bentayga, and indeed Bentley as a brand, has always been about the delicate confluence of luxury and sport, and should you have forgotten its storied and spirited motorsport history in recent times, the Speed’s slightly wilder approach is here to remind you of just that.

    "description": "In the end, no matter how well a car is engineered or how smartly it is priced, it’s the market that passes the final judgement. The customer is the ultimate arbiter. And our market is littered with examples of good cars that should have done better. The Hyundai Exter, it seems, is quietly joining that list. Spending a few weeks with our long-term Exter has left me a little perplexed. It’s a well-rounded package in nearly every respect, yet it doesn’t sell in the numbers it should. In contrast, the Tata Punch, which the Exter beats in several key areas, outsells it by a healthy margin. In fact, it emerged as the bestselling car in the country for several months. Yes, the Punch has a more upright, squared-off stance that gives it a mini-Tata Harrier look, and there’s no denying its presence. The Exter, in contrast, is a bit more funk than brute, with split headlamps, a busy grille, and lots of design elements fighting for attention. But still, it’s far from unattractive. If anything, it’s distinct and modern and stands out in a sea of safe, conservative shapes. All-black interior makes cabin gloomy. But the real story of the Exter begins once you get inside. First impressions matter, and while the cabin is well-laid-out and logically arranged, the all-black interior, with its shiny surfaces and hard plastics, does rob it of a sense of airiness and premiumness. It’s not bad per se, just rather dull. Lighter cabin tones, even as an option, would go a long way in making the interior feel more inviting. That said, the build quality is solid, and there’s good attention to detail in terms of fit and finish. What I particularly appreciate is the smart use of space. Storage is generous, and the wireless charging pad is one of the best I’ve used – it snugly fits my large iPhone 16 Pro Max without fuss. There’s even a thoughtful slot to route the cable cleanly in case you’re not wireless charging. A bit of a disappointment, though, is the very ordinary audio system, which lacks the clarity or ‘punch’ of rivals like the Punch. Audio system delivers average sound quality. But where the Exter genuinely comes into its own is out on the road. This is a car that thrives in the city, and the more I drive it, the more I appreciate just how easy it is to live with. The 1.2-litre, 4-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine won’t win any drag races, but it’s smooth, refined and delivers its power in a linear, predictable manner. You don’t need to keep wringing it out to get moving briskly in traffic, and that’s exactly what you want in a city runabout. Our long termer comes equipped with an AMT (automated manual transmission), and while I’m usually a bit sceptical about these clutchless manuals, the Exter’s unit is surprisingly good. Sure, there’s still that tell-tale pause between gearshifts, especially at low speeds. But it’s smoother and less jerky than in other AMTs I’ve driven. Hyundai has clearly worked hard on the calibration here, and it shows. Most of the time, it just does its job quietly in the background – exactly what you want from an urban automatic. AMT calibration is one of the best. The ride quality is another high point. There’s a certain tautness to the way the Exter goes over bumps – it doesn’t feel soft or wallowy like some of its rivals. In fact, there’s a bit of a ‘big car’ feel to the way it handles rough patches. And yet, it’s never uncomfortable. It soaks up potholes with a mature, composed feel, and that adds to your confidence when navigating Mumbai’s unpredictable roads. The steering also deserves a mention – it’s light, accurate and makes parking in tight spaces a breeze. But it doesn’t go numb at higher speeds either, which is encouraging when you do get the chance to stretch its legs. Speaking of which, I’m keen to take the Exter on a longer run. While it’s clearly built with urban use in mind, I suspect it might surprise me on the highway. Sure, you won’t be munching miles at triple-digit speeds in this, but with its decent ride comfort and a willing engine, it should do the job just fine. Well-thought-out cabin has good storage spaces. As I settle in for the next few weeks with the Exter, I’m genuinely looking forward to seeing how it fits into my daily life – and beyond. It’s already winning me over with its practicality, ease of use, and calm and composed character. And I can’t help but feel that more people need to give this car a second look. It may not shout for attention, but it quietly gets the job done – and sometimes, that’s exactly what makes a car a keeper.
