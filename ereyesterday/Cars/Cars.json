    "description": "Nothing exists in a vacuum. An old idea augmented by new means—it plays itself out over and over again in every facet of society, culture, technology, and art. The balancing act between the novel and the familiar is ever-present in the artwork of Hans Sures, a creative director, designer, and illustrator based in London. He’s found the sweet spot where his art is recognizable, yet challenging in technique, presentation, and subject matter, leaning on Renaissance masters like Titian and da Vinci for stylistic inspiration. Though his work is influenced by ’60s and ’70s motor culture, the visual cues are from a different period altogether, removing the viewer from a particular place in time. It’s modern yet remains steeped in familiar stylistic tropes, enabling it to transcend its timestamp.…",

    "description": "News from Hinckley this week, as Triumph unveils the new limited edition Speed Triple 1200 RX. We then look at a Stark Varg Alpha electric motocrosser dressed as a Honda CR500, a modern classic electric scooter from Germany, and a radically modified Honda VTR1000F from France. Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX The Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RS is a tour-de-force—a pure hooligan machine with excellent ergonomics and a rowdy triple-cylinder power plant. Its 1,160 cc mill kicks out 180.5 hp at 10,750 rpm and 128 Nm at 8,750, and it handles like it’s on rails. The brand new, limited edition Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX takes everything good about the RS model, but adds a generous helping of sportbike style. The catch?…",

    "description": "Hot version of talented electric saloon or estate is intended to be not just rapid but also engaging When the GTX badge was launched by Volkswagen in 2021, it was tipped as an electric equivalent of – and eventual successor to – the GTI line. But it has suffered by comparison: adding power and straight-line speed is easy on EVs and doesn’t make for an everyday performance hero. Now, with new management in Wolfsburg committed to GTI, it’s GTX that’s being phased out. Some irony, then, that the Volkswagen ID 7 GTX showcases exactly what the badge could stand for: a compelling take on what a warmed-up VW EV can be, with a distinct nod towards grand tourers and a different feel to GTI cars.It helps that this new model has an excellent base to work from: in entry-level Pro form, the Vokswagen ID 7 was named Autocar's Best Saloon of 2024 and the best in a competitive class that also includes the Tesla Model 3. It's a refined, understated and well-rounded car, a better base to create a GTX model from than the earlier ID 4 and ID 5 SUVs.So is the ID 7 GTX a true electric performance car or, as is often the car with hot EVs, would you be better off sticking to the base model?",

    "description": "New creation appears to be a rakish shooting brake based on last year’s Skytop convertible concept BMW has released the first images of a new model set to be revealed at the upcoming Villa d’Este Concours, seemingly fusing last year’s Skytop concept with the famed ‘Clownshoe’ Z3 M Coupé. Images posted to social media show the silhouette of a model with the same rear lights as the Skytop, a rakish open-top GT unveiled at last year's Villa d’Este Concours, but a reworked tail section. Rather than a long deck housing a convertible roof panel, it appears to be a shooting brake with a rakish glasshouse and a prominent ducktail-style roof spoiler. Its form appears to reference the Z3 M as well as the Z4-based Touring Coupé concept that BMW revealed at Villa d’Este in 2023. The Touring Coupé never made it to production but the Skytop, on the other hand, is being readied for a limited run of 50 road-going cars. Testing of these cars – based on the CLAR platform that underpins every BMW from the 3 Series upwards and packing a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 – recently ramped up ahead of this year’s Villa d’Este Concours, which opens on 23 May. Discussing the impact of Villa d’Este, BMW M chief Frank van Meel last year told Autocar: “It is a little bit like a test balloon: you show the cars and, if there's enough demand, it can be built. “I think the demand is quite high, so [the] probability is quite high. We will see over the next few weeks if that interest translates into purchasing orders. “The probability is there. It shows [that] we always want to try new things and see if there is a demand. Even though we’re a big company, it’s not the main purpose to build a small series. “But if you listen to your customers and they say every now and then to do something like this and we do it, I think it’s a nice gesture, to show that we aren't only into, let's say, the cars we build everyday, but we can also do something special if demand is there.” BMW design director Adrian van Hooydonk added that “there’s no need to turn [the Skytop] into a big series production car” and that it is “maybe an instant classic”.",

    "description": "Like its predecessor, the KTM 390 Adventure X undercuts its higher-spec counterpart and aims to deliver 90 percent of the experience at a much more affordable rate. For 2025, this motorcycle is all-new from the ground up, featuring more performance, better features and improved handling for just Rs 11,000 more than the outgoing model. The 390 Adventure X misses out on cruise control.   KTM 390 Adventure X design and quality (7/10) High resolution TFT adds to the appeal of this motorcycle What impressed me was the bright headlight that offers commendable illumination, and it might just be the best in class for now. I’m also happy to see that KTM has equipped this bike with the new TFT and ditched the monotone LCD from the older ‘X’ model. This new screen is vibrant and clear, giving the bike a premium feel. Switchgear quality is also solid, aside from the missing rocker switch for cruise control. The seating posture on the 390 Adventure is upright and commanding   KTM 390 Adventure X riding position and comfort (8/10) The X has the same ergonomics as the 390 Adventure, with a slightly lower seat height Apart from a slightly shorter seat height, the X is identical to the regular 390 Adventure. The posture is upright and commanding yet comfortable. However, the large windscreen isn’t adjustable, so you’re robbed of some of that sweet cooling airflow in this scorching heat at city speeds. Also, the seat remains quite firm, leading to saddle soreness after about an hour or two, which isn’t ideal for long-distance touring. While those shortcomings are worth noting, they’re far from being dealbreakers. The X corners surprsingly well and feels quite planted   KTM 390 Adventure X performance and refinement (8/10) In our tests, the 390 Adventure X managed a 0-100kph time of just 6.04s While this motorcycle packs the same motor as the standard 390 Adventure, it feels a lot more tame and approachable. This is because the X runs on what’s essentially the equivalent of Road Mode on the standard 390 Adventure. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does make the bike feel rather mellow and un-KTM-like in its performance.  That said, performance is about the same as the standard 390 ADV, and this is the quickest bike in this segment. Despite the alloy wheels, the X can manage mild trails   Another surprise win? Less tyre noise. It was something I noticed on the standard bike, but here, it’s noticeably quieter. One letdown, though, is the quickshifter that requires a fair bit of force to engage and was mostly unusable on our test bike. That said, the X’s light clutch makes shifting manually easy and enjoyable. Moving on to braking, the X performs nearly on par with its counterpart despite missing out on sintered brake pads. Our braking tests showed nearly identical numbers between the two bikes, although the feel at the lever isn’t as good as the standard ADV. Seat height and weight are slightly down by 5mm and 1kg, respectively, which, while not massive, are both changes in the right direction. Unlike the 390 Adventure, the X uses organic brake pads that perform nearly on par   KTM 390 Adventure X ride comfort and handling (8/10) The X's non-adjustable suspension performs better than the higher spec adjustable suspension Despite running non-adjustable suspension and alloy wheels, the X still manages to feel pretty capable off-road. With the same 200mm/205mm wheel travel at both ends, it’ll do nearly all of what the full-spec 390 Adventure can, just with reduced confidence and feedback from the smaller front wheel. In fact, for on-road comfort, both Rishaad and I found ourselves preferring the non-adjustable setup on the X since it felt less fussy and a little more absorptive of poor road surfaces. Graphics and interface make the TFT feel upmarket.   KTM 390 Adventure X features and safety (8/10) Missing list of features aren't dealbreakers in any way The ‘X’ misses out on features like cruise control, riding modes, cornering ABS, adjustable brake and clutch levers, tubeless spoke wheels and an adjustable front fork. Cruise control was the only feature I truly missed and would’ve appreciated. Yes, it makes highway miles easier, but given the cost savings, I can live without it. The 390 Adventure X is considerably more affordable than the standard 390 Adventure.   KTM 390 Adventure X price and verdict (9/10) The ‘X’ costs Rs 77,000 less than the 390 Adventure Given the price difference, the 390 Adventure X makes a very strong case for itself. It delivers almost everything you’d want from the 390 Adventure platform at a pocket-friendly rate. For those skilled enough to push this platform to its limits, KTM still offers the fully specced 390 Adventure and even the Enduro R for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. But if you’re hunting for an affordable, lightweight ADV that punches well above its price tag, the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure X delivers. And if you’re not exactly ‘Ready to Race’, Royal Enfield’s Himalayan costs about the same and offers more all-around usability and comfort, although it feels much bigger and heavier.

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "Two years ago, we pit the petrol-automatic versions of the Hyundai Exter and Tata Punch against each other. Then, the Exter had the upper hand thanks to its smoother and more refined powertrain. Today, we revisit this rivalry, but with a twist: both sub-compact SUVs are here in their CNG avatars. While they share several traits, like a dual-cylinder CNG setup, a claimed efficiency of 27km/kg and premium features, including a sunroof, this time, the spotlight is on their real-world efficiency. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG interior and ergonomics  Let’s begin with the Punch. It’s easy to understand why this Tata is among the country’s bestselling cars. The basics are done right – its high-riding stance, wide-opening doors and easy ingress make it especially friendly for elderly passengers. The high seating position offers a commanding view of the road, and the visible bonnet edges further help drivers feel in control. The driving experience is enhanced by light steering, gear shifts that are easy to execute (though not as precise as the Exter’s) and a clutch that doesn’t require much effort. Further, individual front armrests enhance long-distance driving comfort, and a surprisingly impressive audio system adds to its appeal. There’s a lot that the Hyundai Exter CNG and the Tata Punch CNG have in common. Switching over to the Hyundai, it’s clear why it continues to earn praise for its user-friendliness. Every control, from the gearbox to the steering, feels lighter and more polished – just right for urban use. While its seating position isn’t as high as the Punch’s, outward visibility remains excellent, thanks partly to its lower window line. The fit, finish and overall cabin quality are marginally better than the Tata, but the dark, monotone theme doesn’t feel as inviting, and the seats leave a bit to be desired. They feel a little too compact and don’t offer the same level of support as the Punch’s. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG engine and performance  The Punch’s engine performance has never been its strong point, and in its CNG avatar, it feels even more sluggish. While it can keep pace with urban traffic, it begins to struggle when asked for more. The Punch’s real strength lies in its composure at highway speeds; it feels stable and reassuring, which is something it does noticeably better than the Exter. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG specsTata Punch icng Accomplished + sHyundai Exter hy-cng duo SX TechL/W/H3827/1742/1615mm 3815/1710/1631mmWheelbase 2445mm 2450mmBoot capacity 210 litres NAEngine 3cyl, 1199cc Petrol + CNG 4cyl, 1197cc Petrol + CNGPower 73.5hp at 6000rpm 69hp at 6000rpmTorque 103Nm at 3250rpm 95.2Nm at 4000rpmKerb weight 1181kg 1093kg On the move, the Exter feels extremely refined. The 4-cylinder engine is quieter and more eager to rev, and its overall smoothness is hard to ignore. Thanks to shorter gearing and smart engine calibration, you rarely need to shift gears. It pulls cleanly from as low as 1,000rpm, making it ideal for stop-and-go traffic. In our acceleration tests, the Exter Hy-CNG Duo sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 14.85 seconds, a full 3 seconds quicker than the Punch iCNG. Moreover, the Exter is significantly quicker than the Tata when accelerating from 20 to 80kph in the third gear and 40 to 100kph in the fourth. The Exter’s shorter gearing improves drivability but hampers highway efficiency to an extent. On the highway, though, the Exter doesn’t feel as composed as the Punch. There is noticeably more vertical movement over undulations. Also, its engine spins 300rpm higher than the Punch’s, at 3,300rpm, while cruising at 100kph in the top gear. This also explains why its highway efficiency is slightly lower at 30.3km/kg in our test, while the Punch iCNG’s is 31km/kg. However, the Hyundai returned 22.8km/kg in the city because of its better drivability, much higher than Tata’s 20.7km/kg. Both cars delivered an impressive overall average, close to their claimed 27km/kg figure.

We first ran both cars until their CNG tanks were completely empty. After that, we refilled approximately 2 kg of gas in each vehicle and drove them around in real-world conditions within the city until they ran out of CNG. Then, we repeated the procedure and ran them on the highway. Since filling the exact same quantity of gas in each car is nearly impossible, we’ve calculated their efficiency based on the actual distance covered divided by the gas quantity. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG features and safety  For the record, the Tata Punch featured here is the Adventure + mid variant, whereas the Hyundai Exter is in its top-end SX trim. That said, to keep this comparison fair, we’re evaluating both cars based on their respective top-spec versions. Interestingly, Tata offers a broader spread of variants with the Punch iCNG. Its entry-level trims are more affordable than Hyundai’s CNG offerings, though its higher trims are pricier than the Exter. Punch iCNG gets a spare tyre, while the Exter only gets a tyre repair kit. When it comes to features, the Punch iCNG impresses with additions like cruise control and a large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which the Hyundai misses. But the Exter hits back with key safety features such as six airbags, a tyre-pressure monitoring system, hill-start assist and electrically folding mirrors, all of which are absent in the Punch.

That said, the Punch’s boot feels a bit more usable, especially if both cars’ parcel shelves are removed. Moreover, Tata provides a full-size spare tyre, while the Exter makes do with just a tyre repair kit. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG verdict  To sum things up, the Tata Punch iCNG is a compelling option for buyers looking for an economical, compact and practical highway cruiser. Its tough build, elevated seating and great audio system add plenty of appeal. Where it falls short is in outright performance and the absence of key safety features like hill-start assist, tyre-pressure monitoring and additional airbags. The Hyundai Exter, on the other hand, is the smoother, more refined and easier-to-drive option in the city. It delivers better fuel efficiency, offers more safety features, and still manages to undercut the Punch on price – despite packing in more equipment overall. It may not lead the sales charts just yet, but it’s the Exter that feels like the better-rounded product, and for that reason, it’s the winner in this comparison.

    "description": "I’d be lying if I said EVs aren’t perfect for the urban grind, which is where I do pretty much all my driving. Quiet, peppy off the line, seamless progress uninterrupted by gear shifts, and the ability to ‘fill up’ while I’m sat at my desk in the office – it’s a no-brainer, really. But I’d also be remiss not to point out that they feel monotone and soulless, and yes, that matters even on my commute. So, when the Autocar India Swift rotated into my possession after a series of back-to-back EVs, it proved to be a much-needed injection of attitude on my mundane Monday morning. Petrol, manual, and wrapped in the pretty and petite package of a premium hatchback, just looking at it makes me wonder why we, as a car-buying populace, have strayed so far from the light. Cute, sporty look with sufficient space; a Swift hallmark intact on new car. I burst out of the gate on a chirrup of clutch-popped wheelspin, just because I can, though I stop myself short of pulling the handbrake as I turn out onto the main road. But that’s what the Swift does to you after just a few metres of driving. After one-note EVs and big, fat SUVs, this feels small, feisty, and ready to be wrung out. The steering may have gotten lazy lately (it pays off in traffic), but the chassis is as tight as ever. The new Z12 three-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine, which has caught mountains of flak from keyboard warriors everywhere, is nowhere as bad as it’s made out to be. At its worst, it feels sluggish at low revs, which I do have to suffer through as I crawl my way to the office, but you soon learn to drive around it. This is likely a case of conservative fuelling at low revs to give the best economy, and boy, does it deliver on that front. Even in constant traffic, it rarely dips below 13kpl! Hilariously good fuel economy, even in rushhour, start-stop traffic. Let it rev, however, and it feels nice and peppy. What it’s lost in outright smoothness compared to the old K12 four-cylinder, it’s made up for with greater potency in the mid-range. Apologies for getting all road testy for a moment there, but it’s nice to enjoy a simple, honest-to-goodness petrol engine after a long time. Where the Swift disappoints is in Maruti’s obstinate obsession with cost trimming, which has made a fun, premium hatchback feel like a budget item in places. The sticker price has certainly gone up, and leaving aside the decision to go with a cheap AMT for the auto gearbox (a decision I mercifully don’t have to suffer), it’s small things that also pinch in the long run. Like the lack of an auto-dimming mirror, low-quality fabric for the roof liner, and just one (very weak) cabin light placed up front, which in turn highlights the lack of backlighting on the switches and USB ports. No backlighting on switches, USB ports makes them hard to find in the dark. On the topic of annoyances, Maruti’s idea to show turn-by-turn navigation directions from Google Maps in the MID display is noble, but it completely overrides all other information (including that amazing fuel economy meter), and it cannot be turned off unless you end the navigation. Unlike other fleet cars that I try to keep for as long as possible, I know I’m not going to hold on to the Swift for much longer. Apart from being quietly coveted by the rest of the team for being small and relatively hassle-free to live with, it’s also a regular feature on shoots as the camera car, and with good reason. Fun as this was, it’s back to the silent treatment for me. Navigation directions in MID handy but can’t be switched off; blocks other data.

    "description": "Maserati’s Stoffel Vandoorne and Nissan’s Oliver Rowland emerged as the big winners as the Tokyo E-Prix served up two very different races. Mahindra Racing held on to third place in the teams’ championship, but it was a round of missed opportunities for the Indian team. Despite being in podium contention for both races, it scored just eight points. Vandoorne wins Race 1, ahead of Rowland and Barnard Rowland wins Race 2, ahead of Wehrlein and Ticktum Maserati aces strategy Vandoorne scores first Formula E win in three years With qualifying cancelled due to heavy rain, the drivers’ Free Practice 2 times set the grid for the first race. Polesitter and championship leader Rowland held on to the lead initially. But a red flag stoppage caused by Maximilian Guenther’s car stopping on track flipped the script. Vandoorne was the only driver to have taken his Pit Boost fast-charging stop at the time. Anticipating a mid-race stoppage due to the difficult weather, Maserati was running an alternate strategy, with Vandoorne burning through his energy early on. It turned out to be a masterstroke, handing Vandoorne the lead as the rest of the field pitted for the mandatory Pit Boost stop. “I forgot what it feels like to win! It feels weird because it’s a little bit unexpected, but at the same time, I knew it was 100 percent possible,” said Vandoorne, who scored his first race win since Monaco 2022.    “We had a very bold strategy: to spend so much energy in the beginning to open our pit window very early, being able to be first into the pit lane and offset ourselves from the rest, which we managed to do. I love it when a plan comes really into play, every little thing that you discuss before the race actually happens. It’s very rare that it comes together like that in Formula E, but today was one of those days.” Rowland settled for second place, followed by McLaren’s Taylor Barnard. Nissan wins on home soil Rowland extends Formula E championship lead Rowland bounced back in the second race, which was held in dry conditions. He slipped to P6 as he jumped for Attack Mode later than his rivals. But he timed his second Attack Mode deployment just right and used the added power to move up to P2, behind race leader Pascal Wehrlein. The Nissan driver still had 40 seconds of Attack Mode remaining when Wehrlein ran out of his boost. A tense wheel-to-wheel battle followed, with Rowland ultimately emerging on top. Dan Ticktum finished third, securing his first-ever podium finish in Formula E. Frustrating round for Mahindra Racing Indian team holds on to third place overall   Mahindra Racing’s call to focus on one-lap performance in Free Practice 2 paid dividends since qualifying got cancelled, placing Edoardo Mortara second on the grid for the race start, with teammate Nyck de Vries in fifth place. Issues with Attack Mode activation denied Mortara a podium finish, but he was able to salvage a P6 result, scoring the team’s only points over the weekend. De Vries finished P8 on track but was handed a 5-second time penalty for contact with Mitch Evans, which dropped him to P11. In the second race, Mortara was once again in podium contention. But he got hit with a 5-second penalty for an encounter with Barnard and ended up in P12. Having picked up damage early on, de Vries opted to conserve energy, hoping for a Safety Car intervention. The Safety Car did come out with three laps to go, but it was too late, and de Vries could only finish P15. Reflecting on the round, Mahindra Racing CEO and team principal Frederic Bertrand said, “We have had incredibly strong form all season, but this is still a team and a car which are developing and growing together. Inevitably, there will be weekends where we have learnings to take away, but for me, this is a positive – you learn more from the tough times than success, as we showed all of last season.” Nevertheless, Bertrand added that there were “plenty of positives” for the team at Tokyo, as they scored points and are still third in the World Championship, “ahead of some huge global manufacturer brands, which, compared to this time last year, is a huge step forward. It’s one small setback, but the journey goes on.” 2025 Formula E championship standings Having picked up his fourth win of the season, Rowland now holds a 77-point lead over Wehrlein in the championship.
