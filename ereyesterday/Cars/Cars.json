    "description": "This 2021 Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series is a Canadian-market example finished in AMG Magmabeam Orange over black Exclusive Nappa leather and Dinamica. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and is equipped with an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, ceramic-composite brakes, a Burmester high-end sound system, 19\" and 20\" AMG Black Series forged wheels, and heated power-adjustable AMG Performance seats. The car spent time in British Columbia until it was brought to the US in 2024, and it now has 402 miles. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this AMG GT Black Series is now offered with the owner's manual, a car cover, a clean US Carfax report, and a clean Washington state title.",

So when he recently moved his operation to the US, choosing a BMW R100R café racer as his first project on fresh soil was a no-brainer. “After building more than 60 motorcycles in Spain, and due to the restrictions we have when making substantial modifications to our motorcycles, I had it in my head for a long time to move to the United States,” Antonio tells us. “Three years ago, I was on vacation in Houston and fell in love with the passion they have for all things motoring.

Sure, there are plenty of places to buy motorcycles, but none cater to customization. BringaTrailer tends to scoff at diversions from OE hardware, and eBay often feels like the Wild West, where anything goes and the thing you’re looking for is lost in a sea of related goods.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/i-love-planes-driving-just-better",
    "description": "The irritations of flying makes it more appealing to drive to and from Europe, argues Prior Steve Cropley recently said he’d rather have driven than flown home from an event, even though it would have taken longer. He absolutely, resolutely, talked my language. As I write I’m on an aeroplane. I love planes, enjoy being in the air and think modern aviation is one of humankind’s greatest achievements, shrinking the planet, letting us share knowledge, culture, you name it, like never before. Yet it also gets on my tits like you wouldn’t believe because the experience is being continually pared back until it’s as close to the line marked ‘just bearable’ as customers will stomach. Compare that with what the car industry tries to do. A new car won’t be more sparse than its predecessor. Every iteration will offer more features, more refinement, more polish, more ‘stuff’ whether you truly want it or not, and I think that counts for something. There are regulators and policy makers who, it feels to me, are trying to make the experience of driving as miserable as possible. But in a car, I always feel more in charge of my destiny, and that I’m in something whose creators and vendors, at least, want me to have a good time. Noises off In case you find new car tech obstructive and think nobody’s listening, here’s a heartening tale from Kia, which had come in for some stick over the way it had set up bongs for this, that and the other, to comply with the latest round of safety regulation requirements, GSR2. Warning bongs for speed limit breaches, frequently called wrongly, and bongs accompanying speed limit changes, even though you can (and in fact must) spot them through your windscreen, were particularly annoying and ranged from difficult to nigh-on impossible to switch off. But you and I complained, and Kia listened. In an over-the-air update for the latest Sorento and EV9, the audible speed limit warnings are now easier to disable (and, as importantly, re-enable), by pressing and holding the mute button on the steering wheel. This will turn the audible warnings off, or back on again should you want the extra help. Visual cues remain. And the bongs default to being on, as they must every time the car’s started, according to regulations. Manufacturers are starting to get a handle on how customers prefer to use these systems, many of which are still too fallible to be left alone. How did it go, elon? Elon Musk, boss of Tesla, seems to have changed his mind about concept cars. “Really hate it when companies bring out an awesome new show car and then you can never actually buy it,” he said on Twitter in 2015. “So lame.” With those sentiments still relatively fresh in the mind, just two years later, in 2017, we were first teased the idea of a second-generation Tesla Roadster. But you still can’t buy one today, so sentiments clearly have changed. There have been other bold Tesla pronouncements since too, some of which have entered the market, like the Cybertruck, and others, like unsupervised Full Self-Driving, which as yet have not.  Then, last week, Musk announced the creation of, and climbed into, a new Cybercab, a two-seat autonomous minicab with painted tyres to make the wheels look bigger, driven in a very controlled environment. Musk said it will be available in 2027. Tesla has achieved remarkable things since its inception. And many of the company’s bolder pronouncements have, historically, been good for the company’s share prices. But not this one. After the robotaxi event, Tesla rapidly shed more than £50 billion from its stock value. Musk might have changed his tune about demonstrating cars you can’t actually buy, but investors seem to have come around to his earlier way of thinking.",

    "description": "Bag yourself a slice of greatness for less. John Evans explains how From luxury saloons, to blue-blooded V8 sports cars, the British car industry has been the birthplace of some of the finest cars ever made. And the good news keeps on coming because you can now bag a slice of British greatness for as little as £500.  Here, then, are the best British bargains you can buy today.  British heroes For flying the flag and showcasing British production at its best, these five cars are hard to beat. Range Rover Evoque Mk1 The compact Range Rover Evoque was an instant hit, which is why today’s classifieds are awash with them at prices starting from £5000. Diesels are economical and Euro 6 from 2015; petrols are smooth and less prone to particulate filter issues. What to look for: Any rust is likely to be accident repair-related; DPF problems Price: From £2000 to £26,000 Range Rover Mk3 The Range Rover has been Britain’s unofficial ambassador for more than 50 years. Our favourite is this third-generation version. It was developed by BMW and offers a fine blend of performance, luxury and off-road ability, and prices for this model are fair. What to look for Check it is mechanically quiet, it sits right and rust isn’t an MOT issue Price: from £1000 - £70,000 Bentley Continental GT Mk1 (2003-11)  New Bentley owner Volkswagen was determined to get its high-performance, four-seat coupé right, sweetening the deal with a ‘low’ £110,000 sticker price. The GTC convertible arrived soon after, while 2008 heralded the introduction of key updates. What to look for Well-maintained high-milers are best; check for mechanical and suspension issues and paint damage Price: from £6000 to £63,000 Lotus Elise S1 (1996-2001) Rear-wheel drive and weighing just 725kg, even the least powerful Elise cracks 0-62mph in 5.5sec. There are quicker ones, but the basic 118bhp model is the sweetest. What to look for Wayward panel gaps, rusty rear subframe, track-day accident damage, paint crazing, head gasket leaks Price: from £12,000 to £30,000 Mini Mk1 (2001-2006) Size-wise, the first-gen Mini hatch is the closest to BMC’s original. The One is slow, the Cooper a little quicker and diesels are economical, but the supercharged petrol Cooper S is the one you want. What to look for Cabin damp, gearbox and supercharger noises, irregular maintenance Price: from £350 to £23,000 British eccentrics From the nation that gave the world cricket, these motors do it their way and in style. Mini Paceman (2013-16) The Paceman had big ambitions, with hatchbacks, coupés and even SUVs in its crosshairs. Buyers were confused, though, and with sales falling, BMW dropped it after just three years. It’s a heavy car and at its best in Cooper S form. What to look for Missed oil changes, worn brakes, peeling decals Price: from £1500 to £13,000 Lotus Elan SE (1989-1992) With its front-wheel-drive layout, the Elan SE was, in the context of Lotus, almost wilfully perverse. A thrash in the 163bhp turbo version usually won over sceptics. The model returned in S2 form from 1994-95. What to look for Mechanicals are strong but composite body and interior can be tired Price: from £6000 to £13,000 Range Rover Evoque Convertible (2016-2018) Heavier, more expensive and less practical than its five-door sibling, the two-door Evoque convertible was a bonkers derivative that was binned after just three years. Used ones are rare today, but they are at least reasonably priced. What to look for Check for cabin damp, creaks and groans and DPF issues on diesels Price: from £13,000 to £26,000 Ineos Grenadier (2023-) Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s take on the original Defender is no rich man’s vanity project. Used Grenadiers are now more sensible although options-sensitive. What to look for Desirable options; check the underside and that everything works Price: from £43,000 to £96,000 British value  Great design and innovation for a lot less than you might think. Land Rover Freelander 2 (2006-2015) The second-generation Freelander was well built, powerful, practical and comfortable. It’s good to drive on road and off and has high-tech chassis systems including on-demand four-wheel drive and Terrain Response. Cars from 2012 are the best. What to look for Underside damage and oil and coolant leaks, wonky steering, transmission noises Price: from £1300 to £17,000 Jaguar I-Pace (2018-) Used EVs have nosedived in price in recent months, and few have done so more steeply than the handsome, comfortable and tech-rich I-Pace. Four-year-old cars with fewer than 30,000 miles start at £17,000; SE trim is the sweet spot. What to look for Check charge cables are present, that the battery and brakes are in good condition and that all the updates have been carried out Price: from £14.000 to £75,000 Jaguar XF MK2 (2015-2024) The Mk1 XF is cheap but long in the tooth, so check out this, its good-value Mk2 successor: a prettier and better-finished car with new underpinnings and engines. There are even versions with four-wheel drive, but the regular rear-drive cars go well enough. What to look for Oil dilution in diesels, infotainment glitches, water leaks into the cabin Price: from £1500 to £48,000 Jaguar XE (2015-2024) The XE has a class-leading blend of comfort and agility. There’s a wide choice of petrol and diesel engines, too. With good build quality, fair prices and an interior brimming with nice touches as standard, what’s not to like? What to look for DPF issues on diesels, infotainment gremlins, irregular tyre wear Price: from £2500 to £40,000 MGF (1995-2002) The MGF was an affordable, mid-engined, rear-drive roadster with engaging handling and a supple ride. It was facelifted in 1999 and offered in 110bhp, 118bhp and 145bhp outputs, and it went on to become Britain’s best-selling rag-top. What to look for Hydragas suspension and head gasket leaks, underbody corrosion, steering issues Price: from £500 to £7000 British sports Six of the best for road or track – and sometimes both Lotus Exige S2 (2004-2011) Buoyed by the success of the Elise, Lotus followed up with the more powerful Exige two-seat coupé in 2000 and the Exige 2 four years after that. Its 1.8-litre Toyota/Yamaha engine produces from 187bhp in standard form to 256bhp in the supercharged 2011 S. What to look for Unblemished service history, coolant leaks, gearbox wear, signs of tracking, tired body Price: from £20,000 to £35,000 Jaguar F-type coupe (2013-24) More than 10 years since it was launched, Jaguar’s homage to the E-Type continues to thrill in terms of both performance and value for money. Good 5.0-litre V8-engined cars start at around £28,000, 3.0-litre V6s cost from £18,000 and the sweet (2018-on) 2.0-litre four-pot model is around £25,000. What to look for Interior rattles, seized centre air vent and door handles, faulty active exhaust, leaky rear differential Price: from £17,000 to £145,000 Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005-2017) The baby in Aston Martin’s range when it was launched proved to be one of the brand’s finer offspring, possessed of a charismatic and reliable 4.3-litre V8 (increased to 4.7 litres from 2008), an aluminium body and a well-designed cabin. What to look for Full service history, worn clutch, suspension and alignment issues, oxidation on early cars Price: from £14,000 to £175,000 Jaguar XK (2006-2014) Like its predecessor the XK8, the XK is a pretty 2+2 coupé powered by a choice of V8 petrol engines. Some of those are supercharged, which means the XK is quick but also comfortable. If you can, buy the better, post-2009 facelift version. What to look for Bulletproof service history, supercharger leaks and noises, warped wheels, faulty parking brake, aluminium oxidation Price: from £3500 to £50,000 Mini 2.0 Cooper S (2013-2024) Most models improve over the generations, and the third-gen Mini Cooper S is no exception: it’s quicker, usefully roomier, more refined and more ‘grown-up’ than its predecessors. Prices are very colour- and option-sensitive. What to look for Heated seats and the larger sat-nav and upgraded stereo, peeling decals, budget tyres suggesting penny-pinching Price: from £3500 to £34,000 McLaren 570S (2015-2019) Autocar’s road testers awarded McLaren’s rival to the Porsche 911 Turbo S the full five stars. Today, with prices for 2016-reg examples starting from £70,000, or half their price before extras when new, perhaps a bonus sixth star for ‘good used buy’ is now due. What to look for A trickle charger, broken suspension springs, leaky dampers and coolant hoses, wayward panel gaps and bubbling on panel edges Price: from £67,000 to £104,000 British brutes Meet the Brits that pack a punch Jaguar S-type R (2002-2007) Prices for this cool-looking, rear-wheel-drive 395bhp V8 super-saloon now span from around £7000 to £15,000. In a head-to-head with like-minded rivals, Autocar rated it not far behind the E39 BMW M5, the prices of which start where the Jaguar’s leave off. What to look for Rotting sills, supercharger rattles, missed oil changes, hunting transmission, baggy suspension, faulty electrics Price: from £3000 to £17,000 TVR Griffith 500 (1993-2002) Prices have risen for this 5.0-litre, 340bhp version of the original hairy-chest express, with the cheapest cars now around £15,000 and the most expensive double that. TVRs have a poor reputation but, fortunately, by now the few Griffs for sale have had most issues sorted. What to look for Electrical problems, mechanical noises and cooling issues, quiet reverse gear engagement, suspension and bodywork faults, rotting chassis outriggers Price: from £17,000 to £40,000 Range Rover Sport 5.0 Supercharged (2009-2013) With 503bhp and 416lb ft, this most powerful of the first-generation Sport can sprint from 0-62mph in just 5.9sec. Thanks to adaptive suspension and active anti-roll bars, it rides and corners comfortably and securely too. What to look for Supercharger noises, failed water pump, weak battery, sitting oddly at rest, irregular tyre wear, underbody damage Price: from £7000 to £15,000 Jaguar XFR (2009-2015) Son of S-Type R also has a supercharged V8, but in this case it produces 503bhp to give 0-62mph in 4.7sec. In its road test, Autocar awarded the 2012-facelift version the full five stars. There’s an even more powerful and dramatic XFR-S with 542bhp, but they’re hard to find and prices for them are high. What to look for A failing timing chain (the engine might sound like a diesel tractor on start-up), fuel and coolant leaks, perished pipework Price: from £7000 to £21,000 British luxury  Probably the finest quartet of pre-owned motorcars in the world. Bentley Arnage (1999-2010) New owner Volkswagen’s first stab at a Bentley was a bit wobbly, with the company ditching the car’s modern 4.4-litre BMW V8 in favour of the old Bentley Turbo R’s 6.75. Cabin is a bit plasticky, but a tidy car still cuts a dash. What to look for Full Bentley or specialist service history, correct batteries, galvanic corrosion, weak interior trim Price: from £11,000 to £45,000 Jaguar XJ (2009-2019) The XJ’s last hurrah is a stylish and capable saloon worthy of the name and, as a used car, good value. Ride and handling, performance and refinement are top-drawer, and prices begin at just £5000. What to look for DPF issues on diesel cars, six-speed gearbox issues on pre-2012 update cars, sagging suspension, infotainment gremlins Price: from £3500 to £32,000 Range Rover (2012-2021) The fourth-generation Range Rover again demonstrates the model’s uncanny ability to combine workhorse and luxury limo in one. JLR is updating models from 2018 with better security and has relaunched a dedicated insurance scheme. What to look for A solid gold warranty and courtesy car provision – some problems can be fixed in a day while others take months Price: from £11,000 to £120,000 Rolls-Royce Ghost S1 (2009-2014) It may be the ‘baby’ Rolls-Royce, but when it comes to satisfying expectations, the Ghost is a grown-up: see its twin-turbo, 6.6-litre V12 for evidence. It’s a car for the owner rather than their chauffeur, and that, as the Ghost ages and becomes cheaper, can only be good news. What to look for Idling problems possibly caused by faulty injectors, gearbox oil leaks, tired suspension, signs of clocking Price: from £54,000 to £100,000",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

But there were changes on the exterior too. Cadillac shrugged off the protruding tail fins it wore since 1948 in exchange for sleeker integrated ones, and newly stacked headlamps gave the brand’s lineup an all-new look.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "The Renault Kiger CVT has been my ride to work for a year. It replaced the Kiger Turbo MT in our fleet, which I used in the last few months of its tenure with us. Of the two, I enjoyed the CVT more, thanks to its relative effortlessness. The long-term cars that I take home are mostly hatchbacks due to tight parking spots in my locality, and the Kiger, with its sub-four-metre footprint, is one of the few SUVs I can manage. I love the high seating position and its commanding view, which makes it easy to get used to very quickly, especially if you are upgrading from a sedan or a hatchback. This also means you’re less prone to direct eye contact with the bright and misaligned LED headlamps found on many two wheelers, which can be very annoying. Front seats are comfortable for long periods of driving. For a compact SUV, its cabin is very spacious and I have had five full-size adults in the car without any hassle. There have been many airport trips and multiple intra-city drives with five passengers and I have never heard any complaints about space. I loved the three-spoke steering wheel with its backlit controls, but there was some noise coming from the steering rod in the last few days, especially when turning the wheel to more than one lock.  The 1.0-litre turbo engine with the CVT is well suited to city use, which is where our long term Kiger munched most of its kilometres. The pedals are positioned well and unlike the manual, the CVT version gets a proper dead pedal, which is a blessing on longer drives. The trip meter resets itself randomly. The digital driver’s display changes with the drive modes, and strangely, you don’t get a tachometer in Normal mode, which is the one best suited to the city. Sport mode adds the tachometer (and better responses) but the fuel economy drops quite a bit. I tried the Eco mode a few times, but it’s not something I would recommend, unless you are on a really tight fuel budget. In this mode, the engine response is horribly weak and I found the car almost undriveable. The CVT gearbox does not get any manual shifting option (it has no ‘gears’ to begin with), but all you need is just a slight tap on the accelerator to bring it into the torque band for a quick overtake. What I did not like much is the engine noise intruding in the cabin. It sounded sporty initially, but it has since gotten annoying. Swallowed four medium suitcases easily. What I also liked about the Kiger are its unique looks. You still don’t see too many of these on the road, but when you do, they are unmistakable. The wide nose with sharp-looking LED headlamps make the Kiger look much more expensive than it actually is. Many people ask me about it’s price and are stunned to learn it’s cheaper than most other mainstream rivals.  The low-placed headlamps have an excellent throw and light up corners well. The Kiger’s AC performed well, especially during the heatwave earlier this year. The cabin does take a tad longer to cool at first, but it maintains the temperature throughout your commute. The Kiger’s infotainment system did, however, give us an overheat warning quite a few times. That said, it connects swiftly and seamlessly with wireless Android Auto. Handbrake located next to the front passenger instead of the driver. Much like its sister car, the Nissan Magnite, which recently got a facelift, the Kiger is due for one soon. After driving the SUV for a considerable amount of time, here are my suggestions for the update. First up, Renault should add a sunroof, atleast on the higher variants. While not a necessity, it’s an important feel-good feature, going by current market trends. The interior upholstery or trim pieces could be lighter to brighten up the cabin, much like what was done with the Magnite. The much-loved CVT experience can be enhanced by addition of paddle shifters, at least for the higher variants. Lastly, Renault could also add cooled seats on the Kiger. In its time with me, I had passengers of all age groups, both family and friends, who experienced the Kiger, and they all had good things to say. My experience with the SUV has been good, too, and it’s a car that I would surely recommend for a buyer who wants a comfortable and spacious city commuter.  Also see: Renault Kiger long term review, 11,500km report New Renault Duster spied in India for the first time Renault Kiger, Triber, Kwid Night and Day editions launched",

    "description": "The Toyota Innova Hycross has been a popular choice not just for private buyers but also for fleet owners. According to the latest update, customers booking the Innova Hycross petrol can get their vehicle in around six months, while the more sought-after petrol-hybrid variants can be delivered in around eight months. While these waiting periods may seem high, not too long ago, buyers had to wait for close to a year. Top-spec Hycross ZX has a waiting period of under six months  Not too long ago, the waiting periods were as high as nearly a year Toyota has been adjusting production capacity for the Innova Hycross depending on demand. The company had paused bookings for the top-spec ZX and ZX(O) variants earlier this year due to “overwhelming demand”. However, bookings for these variants resumed in August. The demand for Innova Hycross petrol-hybrid remains comparatively higher, and a majority of the production capacity has been allotted for the petrol-hybrid iteration, say sources.   Toyota Hycross waiting period at dealer level While the above waiting periods have been released by Toyota, according to a quick check with some of the dealers, both petrol and hybrid variants are being delivered sooner than what the company has conveyed.    For example, Innova Hycross petrol variants are being delivered at most outlets within 45 days to two months at most. Also, waiting periods for the Innova Hycross hybrid vary depending on the variant. The Hycross hybrid VX 8-seater, which comes with a second-row bench seat, is in higher demand than the 7-seater model; hence, it commands a waiting period of nearly four months. The VX 7-seater’s waiting period is around three months. The top-spec Innova Hycross ZX range, including the ZX(O), can also be delivered in under six months at most locations, depending on the demand. Disclaimer: Waiting periods are subject to change, depending on the dealer and region. Please check with your local dealership for the exact waiting periods in your area. Toyota Innova Hycross price, powertrain details Entry-level variants of the Toyota Innova Hycross feature a 172hp, 2.0-litre petrol engine mated to an automatic gearbox, while the higher variants come with a 184hp, 2.0-litre petrol engine with strong hybrid tech. Prices for the Innova Hycross start at Rs 19.77 lakh (ex-showroom) for the entry-level pure petrol line-up and Rs 30.98 lakh for the petrol hybrid range.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz India has announced that prices for its entire line-up will go up by 3 percent starting January 1, 2025. Mercedes GLC price to increase by Rs 2 lakh Mercedes-Maybach S680 V12 sedan prices to go up by Rs 9 lakh Price hike not applicable to units built by December 31 Mercedes price hike not applicable to models booked by December 31 The brand has clarified that the price hike will apply to vehicles not in stock by December 31, 2024, as well as to existing bookings and those made before this date. Mercedes-Benz India further says that the price hike has been conducted due to higher material costs, inflationary pressures, and logistic expenses, which lead to higher operational costs. This has been creating “substantial pressure” on the Mercedes-Benz business and its overall bottom line. The brand further says that it is “absorbing” most of the cost pressures and passing on a “nominal” portion to the market. Prices for the GLC SUV, which starts at Rs 75.90 lakh, will increase by around Rs 2 lakh, while prices for the Mercedes-Maybach S 680 V12 sedan, priced from Rs 3.43 crore, will go up by up to Rs 9 lakh.
