    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-audi-a6-saloon-revealed-201bhp-%C2%A350k",
    "description": "Wide-reaching overhaul includes fresh face, new interior and £65,830 range topper Audi says it has taken inspiration from its past for the new A6 saloon.  The ICE model has gained a wide-reaching overhaul for its sixth generation and become a curvier proposition with a drag coefficient of just 0.23, which makes it the most slippery combustion-powered Audi to enter production.  Most notably, in pursuit of improved aerodynamics, it has gained the same style of curved rear end that marked out the Mk2 ‘C5’ A6. To make this design a reality, Audi used steel instead of aluminium for the bootlid because it can be shaped more easily.  Arriving hot on the heels of the substantially identical A6 Avant wagon, the saloon - which was due to be called the A7 until Audi recently changed its naming strategy – has historically had greater global success than its sibling. For example, of all A6 Avant models, just 4% are sold outside of Europe and North America. However, that figure rises to 40% for A6 saloons, for which South Korea is the biggest market. Like the Avant, the saloon comes with either a turbo petrol engine or turbo diesel hybrid power. Cars will be badged TFSI (for petrol) or TDI (diesel). The non-wagon EV, badged e-tron, is sold as a sportback rather than a saloon. For the ICE car, both engines are 2.0-litre four-pot units that put out 201bhp, with the petrol offering 251lb ft and the diesel 295lb ft of torque.  Each is paired exclusively to an automatic gearbox and the diesel can be had with Quattro all-wheel drive. The 48V diesel powertrain also offers limited electric-only driving from step-off or at a cruise. Like the Avant, the combustion-powered A6 Saloon is a big departure aesthetically from the cars they replace. While its front end has been given an extensive refresh – with the Audi rings straddling a new-look grille and bonnet lip, in a similar way to the E-tron GT – more generally, it is a bulkier and sportier proposition. Inside, the car gets the same three-screen set-up as the Avant and the new Q5, as well as a sunroof that can switch from translucent to clear via a press of a button. While the Avant has 503 litres of boot space, the saloon’s is 492 litres – although hybrids will offer only 452 litres.  Deliveries of the A6 saloon will start in the coming months. Prices start from £50,560 and top out at £65,830",

Ducati Panigale V4 Lamborghini Ducati and Lamborghini share more than just proximity in the Motor Valley region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. They’re also both owned by the Volkswagen Group—and they both feature prominently on the bedroom walls of petrolhead adolescents. The two Italian marques have collaborated in the past, so we’re glad to see that they’ve teamed up for yet another limited edition, high-end motorcycle: the Ducati V4 Panigale Lamborghini.

    "description": "You are probably already familiar with the Suzuki Access 125 because it is a common sight on our roads. Ever since its launch in India in 2007, the Access has been an extremely popular choice in the 125cc scooter category because it offers a practical, efficient and ultra-reliable scooter experience combined with zippy performance for a decent price. In nearly two decades, this is only the second major update the Access has received. So, what has Suzuki changed? Catering to this end of the Indian scooter market is tricky because traditional consumers identify with the established body style that is prevalent, but, at the same time, the company needs to keep its product fresh against its rivals. Which is why Suzuki has not strayed very far from the previous Access’ design ethos. The underseat storage space has grown by 2.6 litres to 24.4 litres. Park the old and new scooters side by side, and the 2025 model looks just new enough to differentiate itself but not so much that the average consumer will mistake it for anything else. We think the Access manages to cut a pleasing figure with its neo-retro aesthetic, and this shade of sea green only helps things further. It has two front cubbies now, but their opening is rather narrow. While not much is new in terms of features and technology, the 2025 Access has improved upon its predecessor in the storage capacity. The boot measures 24.4 litres (up from 21.8), and this scooter now has two slim cubbies on the front apron. Do bear in mind that these cubbies have a rather slender opening, and you cannot fit a 1-litre water bottle like you could in the previous scooter’s single cubby.   The Suzuki Access is very much a family scooter, but unlike most of its rivals, it never feels dull to ride. And its fun character doesn’t come at the expense of any sacrifice in practicality or handling. True to its family-scooter roots, the Access has a plush suspension setup, which never feels out of sorts unless you turn up the wick to the point where seldom any staid rider will venture. Neutral ergos, a spacious seat and balanced suspension keep you comfy. For 2025, Suzuki has given the Access a new frame and heavily reworked the engine – we will address the chassis first and the motor a little later. To be perfectly frank, ride this 2025 model and a previous-gen scooter back to back, and you will be hard-pressed to tell the difference – we actually did just that, so you can take our word for it. That’s really no bad thing because the 106kg Access feels light in traffic (despite its weight having gone up by 2 kilos) and is manageable for riders of all sizes, both attributes expected of a family scooter. Seat has grown slightly longer, and cushioning is on the firmer side. However, for all that has changed, we would have liked to see a 12-inch rear wheel on the Access with this update. Because it still rides on an archaic 10-inch unit (just like it did way back in 2007), at higher speeds and while going through turns, the Access doesn’t feel as stable as its Indian rivals that use 12-inch wheels at both ends (think TVS Jupiter 125 and Hero Destini 125).   That small gripe aside, we are happy to report that the Access retains its zippy, playful demeanour. And a big part of that is down to the tried and tested 124cc engine. This mill is energetic right from the get-go. Even if you’re holding a steady 70kph on the highway, if you open the throttle, there’s still enough left in reserve to manage a reasonably quick and effortless overtaking. Heavily revised engine retains its pep and turbine-smooth character. By and large, Japanese engines are known to have two major USPs: refinement and reliability. As for the former, the most vibration is actually felt only when you are at a standstill, as is typical for scooters. It disappears as soon as you get moving. In fact, it is so smooth that even at an indicated 90kph, there is absolutely no buzz either in the floorboard or the handlebar. Disc brake is reserved for the top two variants and has sufficient bite. In our tests, the new Access was quicker than the BS6 version in roll-on acceleration as well as the sprint to 80kph, which is impressive considering it is a little heavier now and has to comply with stricter emissions norms. Moreover, along with its energetic performance, the Access continues to have great fuel efficiency. In fact, these numbers could have been even better if the Access had start/stop tech like the Burgman, but you can’t opt for that feature here.   The 2025 Access has stuck to the same formula as its predecessor but with minor refinements all across. While it doesn’t have any one standout feature, it blends frugality, practicality and comfort with a dash of zippiness wonderfully. Another important factor to consider is that Suzukis are generally light on the pocket to purchase as well as run, which now brings us to the price. Round chrome mirrors look nice, but the field of view isn’t the best. With prices ranging from Rs 81,700 to Rs 93,300, the new Access is Rs 1,000-1,500 more expensive than the outgoing model. It is also nearly on par with competitors in pricing. The aforementioned factors are why the Access has achieved such widespread success. Even today, if you’re in the market for a new 125cc scooter, the Access remains a really compelling option. Also See: 2025 Suzuki Access video review",

    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

    "description": "As Kia’s flagship SUV, the EV9 stands as the brand’s largest, most luxurious and most technologically advanced model yet. Since it comes to India as a fully imported unit, it is pricey at Rs 1.30 crore ex-showroom. We got a brief opportunity to experience it on Kia’s test track. Here are the first few impressions. Kia EV9 Exterior Plus-sized SUV with impressive aerodynamics Upward sloping window line and sleek LEDs add flair to an otherwise clean design. The EV9 certainly commands attention with its plus-sized proportions and upright stance. It’s larger than the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV and even boasts a longer wheelbase. The LED daytime running lamps appear to be neatly embedded into the front grille panel. Other interesting design details include bumper flaps that automatically open to cool the battery. The 20-inch wheels are definitely eye-catching as well. Its LEDs appear to be neatly embedded in the bodywork. The EV9 also features flush-type door handles, which, along with the clean body lines, are designed to improve aerodynamics. In fact, the EV9 has a drag coefficient of 0.28, which is impressive for such a large SUV. The upward-sloping window line and sleek LED tail-lamps add flair to the otherwise clean and minimal body styling. While the styling is futuristic and elegant, the paint quality leaves room for improvement, with an evident orange-peel effect on the gloss-black cladding and main body panels. Kia EV9 Interior Comfortable and luxurious, but not German-grade Extremely comfortable captain chairs, with ottomans. Get heating, cooling and a massage function. Step inside the EV9, and you’re met with a sophisticated black and dark brown theme. The dashboard is clean and horizontal, and the throne-like front seats feel luxurious, with comfort being enhanced by ventilation, heating and massaging function options. The EV9 is typically Kia – it impresses and is very well-loaded. The trouble is, at this price point, expectations are high. While the interior feels premium, it’s not to the level of its German rivals; there’s a noticeable use of hard plastics, which detracts from the luxury experience. The 360-degree camera system is clear but lacks the level of detail in the UI presentation and animations that you see at this level. With all three rows in place, 333L boot space is rather respectable. Appreciably, there are physical switches to control fans and temperature for the air-con, as well as a high-quality volume scroller for the infotainment screen. However, all’s not perfect. The dedicated screen for the air-con controls is hidden from the driver’s field of vision, and the row of touchscreen shortcut keys requires serious effort to click and operate. In India, the EV9 is offered only as a six-seater, featuring second-row captain chairs, which, just like the front seats, are extremely luxurious. To start with, they are placed higher than the front seats, so unlike most EVs, you are not seated in a knees-up position. Further, these get electrically powered ottomans as well, and to enhance comfort, they offer heating, cooling and massage functions. However, you can hear all that work, as it’s noticeably loud, but the good news is that it offers a proper high-intensity massage much akin to home massage seats. This function can be activated using a tablet controller, too. While clarity is fine, the camera display lacks detailing in terms of user interface and animations. Middle-row passengers benefit from a dedicated sunroof, sunshades, boss mode to adjust the front passenger seat, a large centre console with a built-in fridge (optional), and wireless charging, to name a few comforts. Access to the third row is easy thanks to the powered captain seat movement. And while headroom is ample even for tall adults, you are forced to sit at an angle to make space for the large (optional) middle-row console. As for boot space, it is rather respectable at 333 litres with all seats up. Of course, it is expandable by folding the third row of seats. A 52-litre front luggage compartment further adds to the practicality. A 52L front loading area further adds practicality.   Kia EV9 Performance, Ride and Handling Brisk performance and even quicker charging capabilities The EV9’s twin motors – one for the front wheels and one for the rear – draw energy from a 99.8kWh battery. Combined, these produce 384hp and 700Nm of torque. As a result, it accelerates briskly. However, you are not pinned to your seat as the power delivery is measured. Based on our GPS-based testing, it accelerated from 0 to 100kph in merely 5.36 seconds, which is respectable for a 7-seater EV weighing over 2.6 tonnes. Even regenerative braking feels quite natural and predictable. Column-mounted drive selector is very easy to use. Kia claims a range of 561km (ARAI-rated), and thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, it supports ultra-fast charging. With a 350kW charger –provided you can find one– its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 24 minutes. The EV9 feels mature and composed from behind the wheel. Ride quality, based on a brief stint on Kia’s test track, was surprisingly comfortable even without air suspension (it uses steel springs). Handling is impressive for such a large vehicle, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds. However, under hard braking, the SUV’s 2.6-tonne mass is noticeable. Handling is impressive for such a large car, with excellent grip and a reassuring sense of control at high speeds.   Kia EV9 Price and Verdict A lot of car for a lot of money The Kia EV9 is spacious, comfortable, luxurious and tech-rich, and it performs well. Middle-row comfort is a major highlight, arguably surpassing what’s offered by rivals like the BMW iX and Mercedes-Benz EQE. That said, at Rs 1.30 crore, the EV9 is priced at par with these two, which, besides their badge, also deliver the whole luxury experience. So, even though the EV9 is a lot of car, it’s a lot of money, and the question is, are you willing to look beyond its badge?

    "description": "The government has increased its target for ethanol blending in petrol to 30 percent in the next five years. Initially, the goal was 20 percent ethanol blending by 2030, but this milestone was achieved five years ahead of schedule. As of April 1, 2025, fuel stations nationwide must sell E20 (20 percent ethanol) petrol. Govt reviewing whether to deploy E30 fuel in a phased or a unified rollout The initial goal of 20 percent ethanol blending was achieved 5 years ahead of schedule Ethanol blending in petrol to increase to 30 percent by 2030 According to a report from InCred, Deepak Ballani, director general of the Indian Sugar \u0026 Bio-energy Manufacturers Association, confirmed the development, stating, “This year, we’ve already done around 19-20 percent. This is five years earlier than the target for 2030.” Govt deciding between phased and unified rollouts for E30 fuel The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has also given an inter-ministerial green light for the revised 30 percent ethanol blending target. To achieve this goal, the government is evaluating whether to go with a phased or a unified strategy. The former would likely entail E30 fuel being dispatched to cities tier-wise in stages, while the latter would see a blanket deployment across the country. How E30 fuel bodes for current and older petrol cars While higher ethanol-petrol blending helps increase jobs for farmers, lower tail-pipe emissions and decrease India’s reliance on crude oil imports, it may spell bad news for petrol car owners. At present, all petrol cars sold in India are compatible with E20 fuel. However, should the ethanol content in petrol rise, especially beyond 25 percent, the engine’s power output and fuel efficiency can take a hit. Older petrol cars that aren’t E20-compliant stand a greater risk of the same. Ethanol is also corrosive in nature as it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and can damage rubber and plastic parts such as the fuel tank, seals, gaskets, and fuel lines in cases of prolonged exposure.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz became India’s first luxury car brand to assemble 2,00,000 passenger vehicles locally. This milestone was achieved with the rollout of Mercedes’ electric flagship, the EQS SUV, from its Chakan plant in Pune, Maharashtra. While the first 50,000 units took 19 years (1995-2014) to assemble, the remaining 1,50,000 four-wheelers required just a decade (2015-2025), translating into a 470 percent jump in production. The last 50,000 units took 2.3 years to manufacture In 2018, the E-Class LWB (V213) became the 100,000th car to come out of this factory “Mercedes’ remarkable milestone underlines India’s potential as a key manufacturing hub in the long run. The [Chakan] plant has achieved a high level of production agility, manufacturing world-class ICE and EVs under one roof,” noted Dr Jorg Burzer, a member of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, while rolling out the EQS SUV. \"We will stay invested in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, catering to growing market demand,\" said Santosh Iyer, Mercedes India MD and CEO. The production facility has received an investment of over Rs 3,000 crore over the years, including a fresh Rs 200 crore funding in 2024. In 2015, the Chakan facility became the first to produce the Mercedes-Maybach S500 outside Germany. Local assembly of the EQS sedan began in 2022, the same year the plant made a full transition to using renewable energy. It was followed by the EQS SUV in 2024. Mercedes India's current portfolio has 11 completely knocked down (CKD) models, which is the highest for a luxury car manufacturer in the country. Mercedes India FY2025 sales E-Class LWB bestselling model The German car brand sold 18,928 cars during FY2025 in the country, registering a 4 percent YoY growth compared to the year-ago period. As per Mercedes, this was its highest-ever sales in a financial year, with the new E-Class LWB being the top seller. The top-end vehicles (TEVs; cars with above Rs 1.5 crore price tag) saw a 34 percent increase with strong demand for the AMG G 63, Maybach Night Series models and the new electric G-Class. The EQS SUV was its bestselling electric vehicle in the last FY, with overall EV sales rising by 51 percent. SUVs dominated the sales charts, occupying a 60 percent share of the total.  However, in the quarter that ended in March 2025, retail sales fell by 11.8 percent to 4,775 cars. The decline was attributed to weaker performance in the entry-level segment; its TEV segment grew by 6 percent in the same period.  This year, Mercedes will be introducing eight models in the Indian market. Some, like the G 580, EQS 450 SUV and Maybach SL 680 roadster, have already been launched.
