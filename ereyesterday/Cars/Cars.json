    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mercedes-cla-gets-15-litre-petrol-diesel-level-efficiency",
    "description": "First car on new compact car platform can be had with 440-mile EV powertrain or super-efficient petrol MHEV The new Mercedes-Benz CLA will be revealed in the coming months with the choice of two battery-electric powertrains or an all-new petrol engine that promises diesel levels of efficiency. The first car on Mercedes's new MMA platform has been engineered as an EV first, with heavy technical and design influence from the record-breaking EQXX concept, but in recognition that \"the wishes and mobility needs of customers in different regions determined the pace\" of the switch to EVs, it will also be offered with a bespoke mild hybrid powertrain engineered with a stringent focus on efficiency. Inside Mercedes's new diesel-baiting petrol MHEV The CLA's new 'M252' 1.5-litre four-cylinder has been designed to be as small as possible, because MMA is an EV-native architecture so it has to take up not much more space than the electric car's front motor. It is, though, described as modular in its construction, with the general design able to be scaled up for larger applications. The cylinders are positioned as close together as possible to keep the block compact, the exhaust manifolds are housed within the cylinder head itself rather than outside it, while the gearbox, electric motor and inverter are all integrated into one tightly formed unit.  All in, the motor is said to be smaller in every dimension and some 17% lighter than Mercedes's current four-cylinder engine. A four-pot was chosen over a triple because of the heightened refinement offered by an even number of cylinders. A comprehensive array of insulation measures including foams and covers have been installed to further mitigate unwanted noise and vibration to a minimum.  The engine will send 134bhp or 161bhp through the front axle, or 188bhp to both ends in the range-topping CLA 4Matic - which Mercedes notes is a \"considerable output per litre\". Indeed, this will be among the most potent engines of its size. For reference, the same-sized four-pot in the Mini Cooper C produces 154bhp, and the 1.5 in the Volkswagen Golf is capped at a 148bhp maximum.  Mercedes has suggested the engine will later be made available with different outputs, and though powertrain lead engineer Karsten Krebs would not be drawn on a realistic maximum power figure for the four-pot, he did tell Autocar that the three initial tunes are \"where we start\", suggesting there is the possibility for uptuned sporting derivatives in the future. Mercedes is still homologating the engine ahead of the CLA's launch next year, and has not yet given any projected MPG figures, but when asked for a hint, Krebs said \"we feel you're reaching diesel levels of fuel efficiency with the hybrid powertrain\".  The outgoing CLA is officially capable of around 55mpg when equipped with a 2.0-litre diesel engine – and Autocar's testers found it easy to achieve 60mpg+ at a cruise – and if the new M252 gets close to that, it could be one of the most efficient petrol engines in its class.  The 27bhp EV motor is able to power the car for short distances on its own at speeds of up to 62mph, drawing its power from a 1.3kWh 48V battery – also packaged as tightly as possible – under the front passenger seat. Charging is via recuperation at up to 25kW under deceleration. Using the electric motor to start the engine means Mercedes could do away with the need for a conventional starter motor, so the start-stop function is \"almost imperceptible for the driver\". Electric CLA bids for efficiency crown The quest for efficiency has underpinned every facet of development for the MMA platform and its electric drivetrains, which have been engineered with heavy influence from the EQXX concept, which recently travelled 628 miles across the Arabian desert at a whopping 8.4 miles per kWh. Shortly after, the CLA proved its efficiency credentials by breaking the record for the longest distance covered in 24 hours by an EV, with a prototype driving 2410 miles around Italy's Nardò ring.  Mercedes says the new drivetrain has potential to achieve 5.18mpkWh in real-world usage – a hugely competitive figure for its segment – and returns a battery-to-wheel efficiency figure of 93%. It is, the firm says, the \"one-litre car of the efficiency age\". The MMA architecture underneath the CLA is equipped with 800V hardware as standard, for charging at up to 320kW, giving 10-80% top-ups in as little as 10 minutes - as proven during the Nardò run. The CLA – and the EQA and EQB replacements that will follow – will be offered with a choice of 58kWh or 85kW (both usable capacity) batteries - the latter with silicon oxide anodes which are said to boost gravimetric energy density by 20% compared to the cells current in use.  The firm has not given an indicated maximum range figure yet, but if the CLA does crack 5.18kWh, the larger battery should be enough for around 440 miles on a charge - outpunching the Tesla Model 3, BMW i5 and even the larger Mercedes EQE it will be sold alongside. Those batteries power a newly designed electric motor on the rear axle with up to 268bhp, with 4Matic models adding a second motor with 107bhp on the front - which only contributes when needed and is otherwise decoupled from the drivetrain to minimise power wastage.  The rear motor forms part of an all-new electric drive unit dubbed EDU 2.0, which contains a two-speed gearbox for optimum efficiency at low speeds and motorway cruises, and can recuperate energy at up to 200kW under deceleration.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/1950s-british-cars-export-prospects-seen-foreigner",
    "description": "We asked a Swiss journalist whether Britain could recover its post-war lead as the European industry got going again \"If you chance upon a new Austin with foreign numberplates, it isn’t really chance at all. For since the war tens of thousands of Austins have gone abroad. Why so? Two reasons mainly. \"First, because Austins are very properly known as the dependable cars. Second, because there’s something young and very lively about them.” Those words are from May 1957, but not words written by Autocar, rather Austin itself, in an advert featuring the Swiss scene pictured above. Were they truthful? For the answer, flick through the same magazine to find a ‘neutral analysis’ of British cars’ foreign prospects by Swiss journalist Robert Braunschweig. He wrote: “For a number of post-war years, the British industry’s export figures were far higher, both in absolute figures and in proportion to their total production, than those of their competitors. \"The spectacular rise of the German industry and, lately, the very much increased export activity of the French and Italian firms have changed the situation in many markets where British firms had enjoyed freedom of action. In addition, many economical and political barriers have been erected in countries which formerly absorbed British cars without restriction. Enjoy full acccess to the complete Autocar archive at themagazineshop.com “The very successes of the post-war years created problems for the British firms. Whereas the general scarcity of cars made sales very easy, their quality and durability was not always entirely satisfactory. Non-British [cars], with which these were replaced in the early 1950s, did not suffer from these defects. Even today the after-effect of this period has not been overcome entirely. “The British industry alone offers nearly as many different models as all its competitors taken together. Not all categories seem equally well represented, however, and there is a notable absence of vehicles capable of holding their own against the [burgeoning] new minicar class. \"There’s another lack of choice in the light medium-sized category, where only two British models have to carry the weight of battle against seven Continental models. But in all other classes, the British industry is numerically well represented. “It seems the various national industries tend to improve features in which they have always excelled [and] find it much more difficult to make progress in [other areas]. Thus the power, sweet running and reliability of British engines have even more improved of late. \"The interior dimensions and the appointments of the medium-sized British car are unsurpassed today as much as in the past. [But] a different situation prevails [regarding] handling and riding. Beyond any shadow of doubt, the behaviour of [British cars is] much better in their native ground than anywhere else. “Even styling is subject to geographical influences. In England, the reticent and often slightly conservative styling of even some of the newest cars is in keeping with their surroundings, and some of the Continental cars which one has praised seem rather crude and blatant; but back home the refined British saloons suddenly seen rather old-fashioned and drab. “As far as prices are concerned, [British cars] are not badly placed. This is not always the case, however, [as regards] actual export prices. Whereas some industries enjoy substantial export assistance from their governments, this does not appear to be the case [in Britain]. “These ideas seem to show that the status quo can be maintained without undue effort. Winning back lost markets, however, requires a prolonged and nearly superhuman effort from all concerned.” You may be expecting this article to end with damning, depressing stats – but not quite. In 1957, Britain built 0.86m cars and exported 0.43m. Production peaked at 1.9m in 1972, but just 0.61m went abroad. Both metrics sank thereafter, bottoming out at 0.9m and 0.2m in 1984. But they soared back up again through the 1990s and in 2016 peaked at 1.7m and 1.35m. Covid seriously damaged the industry’s health, of course, but it has recovered before and has both the ability and the opportunity to do so again.",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

    "description": "The Renault Kiger CVT has been my ride to work for a year. It replaced the Kiger Turbo MT in our fleet, which I used in the last few months of its tenure with us. Of the two, I enjoyed the CVT more, thanks to its relative effortlessness. The long-term cars that I take home are mostly hatchbacks due to tight parking spots in my locality, and the Kiger, with its sub-four-metre footprint, is one of the few SUVs I can manage. I love the high seating position and its commanding view, which makes it easy to get used to very quickly, especially if you are upgrading from a sedan or a hatchback. This also means you’re less prone to direct eye contact with the bright and misaligned LED headlamps found on many two wheelers, which can be very annoying. Front seats are comfortable for long periods of driving. For a compact SUV, its cabin is very spacious and I have had five full-size adults in the car without any hassle. There have been many airport trips and multiple intra-city drives with five passengers and I have never heard any complaints about space. I loved the three-spoke steering wheel with its backlit controls, but there was some noise coming from the steering rod in the last few days, especially when turning the wheel to more than one lock.  The 1.0-litre turbo engine with the CVT is well suited to city use, which is where our long term Kiger munched most of its kilometres. The pedals are positioned well and unlike the manual, the CVT version gets a proper dead pedal, which is a blessing on longer drives. The trip meter resets itself randomly. The digital driver’s display changes with the drive modes, and strangely, you don’t get a tachometer in Normal mode, which is the one best suited to the city. Sport mode adds the tachometer (and better responses) but the fuel economy drops quite a bit. I tried the Eco mode a few times, but it’s not something I would recommend, unless you are on a really tight fuel budget. In this mode, the engine response is horribly weak and I found the car almost undriveable. The CVT gearbox does not get any manual shifting option (it has no ‘gears’ to begin with), but all you need is just a slight tap on the accelerator to bring it into the torque band for a quick overtake. What I did not like much is the engine noise intruding in the cabin. It sounded sporty initially, but it has since gotten annoying. Swallowed four medium suitcases easily. What I also liked about the Kiger are its unique looks. You still don’t see too many of these on the road, but when you do, they are unmistakable. The wide nose with sharp-looking LED headlamps make the Kiger look much more expensive than it actually is. Many people ask me about it’s price and are stunned to learn it’s cheaper than most other mainstream rivals.  The low-placed headlamps have an excellent throw and light up corners well. The Kiger’s AC performed well, especially during the heatwave earlier this year. The cabin does take a tad longer to cool at first, but it maintains the temperature throughout your commute. The Kiger’s infotainment system did, however, give us an overheat warning quite a few times. That said, it connects swiftly and seamlessly with wireless Android Auto. Handbrake located next to the front passenger instead of the driver. Much like its sister car, the Nissan Magnite, which recently got a facelift, the Kiger is due for one soon. After driving the SUV for a considerable amount of time, here are my suggestions for the update. First up, Renault should add a sunroof, atleast on the higher variants. While not a necessity, it’s an important feel-good feature, going by current market trends. The interior upholstery or trim pieces could be lighter to brighten up the cabin, much like what was done with the Magnite. The much-loved CVT experience can be enhanced by addition of paddle shifters, at least for the higher variants. Lastly, Renault could also add cooled seats on the Kiger. In its time with me, I had passengers of all age groups, both family and friends, who experienced the Kiger, and they all had good things to say. My experience with the SUV has been good, too, and it’s a car that I would surely recommend for a buyer who wants a comfortable and spacious city commuter.  Also see: Renault Kiger long term review, 11,500km report New Renault Duster spied in India for the first time Renault Kiger, Triber, Kwid Night and Day editions launched",

    "description": "The Indian monsoon is nothing to be trifled with when it comes to waterproof gear, so a little before its onset this year, I purchased the Viaterra P300 waterproof liner. I’ve used enough Viaterra products by now to know that they work as intended, which is why I splurged on the P300. There are more affordable rain liners from Viaterra if you’re on a tight budget. Wearing a rain liner over an armoured riding jacket is cumbersome – there’s no two ways about it. But the P300 eases things to quite an extent. For example, the cuffs are nice and wide, enough so that even if I’m wearing my Grid full-gauntlet gloves, my hand can also slip through without a second thought. Then, there is the inner mesh lining, which helps with comfort as it lets the P300 slide over your jacket instead of bunching up in areas. It also makes the rain jacket easier to get on and off. But by far, the most helpful feature is the zipped vents on the front of the jacket. I’ve found that even in the heaviest of downpours, it’s best for my comfort to keep them fully open, and since there is a Velcro closure that keeps the top and bottom of the zip closed, there’s no water ingress at all. Vents allow good airflow, and the zipper is easy to use. In fact, I remember using this exact trick when I was efficiency-testing the Bajaj Freedom CNG bike at slow-moving Mumbai city speeds for nearly three hours with the P300 on in the pouring rain, and I remember being pleasantly surprised by the airflow that was allowed through to me. This is what makes it worth the extra money for me. My only gripe is that this jacket is slightly shorter at the front, which Viaterra has done to prevent the jacket from bunching and pooling water. On the one hand, Rishaad liked this feature in his P300, but I found that the bottom two inches of my riding jacket got wet in continuous heavy rain. Perhaps the next iteration can have a slight increase in the length. Another point is that the hood is removable, which is a great feature, but it would be nice if there was a pocket or some provision in the jacket to store it. At Rs 2,499, the Viaterra P300 is the most expensive of the made-in-India rain liners, but after staying dry as well as reasonably cool for this past monsoon, I can confidently say it’s well worth the investment.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

But there were changes on the exterior too. Cadillac shrugged off the protruding tail fins it wore since 1948 in exchange for sleeker integrated ones, and newly stacked headlamps gave the brand’s lineup an all-new look.

    "description": "Jorge Martin clinched the 2024 MotoGP World Championship after finishing third at the Circuit de Catalunya-Barcelona. The title decider was initially slated to be held at Valencia, but was shifted to the new venue after the region experienced catastrophic flooding. With this, Martin becomes the first independent team racer to win the title in the modern 4-stroke MotoGP era.  Francesco Bagnaia won both races of the weekend but lost the title by a slender 10-point margin. Martin defeats Bagnaia by 10 points Marc Marquez finishes third in the championship Aleix Espargaro, Takaaki Nakagami bid farewell to full-time racing Martin defeats Bagnaia Bagnaia and Martin were evenly matched for the entirety of the season but a few crucial DNFs have denied the Italian rider from clinching three back-to-back titles.  In fact, the Ducati rider was at his dominant best at the final round, but all Martin needed to do was finish ninth or higher to take home the title. While Bagnaia stormed to victory ahead of Marc Marquez, Martin played it safe and finished third.  Martin’s staggering consistency is what has earned him the 2024 MotoGP World Championship. He took a staggering 32 podiums out of the total 40 available this year and it is this feat that has helped him become the first independent MotoGP World Champion. For 2025, he will join the factory Aprilia MotoGP team alongside Marco Bezzecchi.  Marc Marquez third overall Having crossed the chequered flag in second place, Marc Marquez successfully defeated Enea Bastianini to bag third place in the standings. He’ll be racing alongside Bagnaia at the factory Ducati team next year. Alex Marquez passed Aleix Espargaro for fourth place in the closing laps.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki witnessed around a 10 percent rise in sales of its entry-level models in October 2024. The company’s small car line-up includes models such as the S Presso, Alto K10, Celerio and the popular Wagon R, which are sold via the brand’s Arena dealerships.     Affordability is a major factor impacting small car sales Small car sales have been on a decline in India since the pandemic Maruti’s small car sales grew 12 percent in April-October  Maruti small car sales fueled by rural demand  The sales growth reflects strong consumer sentiments in the country’s rural parts, while there is a weakness in the urban markets, according to the brand. “In the first quarter, we saw a decline. But we were able to arrest the decline in the second quarter with sales remaining the same. We saw good traction in October, with a growth of almost 10 percent,” the senior executive officer for marketing and sales, Partho Banerjee, told our sister publication, Autocar Professional. India’s small and affordable car market has been declining since the pandemic, with entry-level hatchbacks losing their market share steadily. SUVs are now driving the overall passenger vehicles industry sales, accounting for around 50 percent of the volumes. Affordability is the biggest factor that impacts the sales of small cars, and the rural market, which accounts for a significant share of their sales, is now gradually recovering. “Rural did pretty well in October. We had a strong growth of 31 percent in the rural market last month, while between April and October, we had a growth of 12 percent,” Banerjee said. Maruti Suzuki recently highlighted the stress in the urban market. The recent monthly economic survey by the finance ministry has also pointed out a slowdown in overall urban demand, while rural consumption is witnessing some revival. Banerjee had said that the automaker witnessed growth of around 8 percent in the rural market during the first half of the financial year, while the urban market declined by 2 percent. The weakness in the urban market can be attributed to factors such as the impact of several state elections and heavy monsoons in certain areas. Heat waves in the earlier part of the financial year also affected the traffic across dealerships.

The born-electric SUV made its global debut recently and will also spawn a Toyota-badged derivative that will go on sale a little later.
