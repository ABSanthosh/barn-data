    "description": "McLaren’s Oscar Piastri won the Saudi Arabian GP after polesitter Max Verstappen was penalised for leaving the track and gaining an advantage on the opening lap. With his third win of the season secured, Piastri has now overtaken his teammate Lando Norris to claim the 2025 F1 championship lead. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc fended off Norris to finish third and claim his first podium appearance this season. Piastri wins 2.843 secs ahead of Verstappen Leclerc P3, Hamilton P7 for Ferrari Both Williams drivers in top 10 Piastri takes 2025 F1 championship lead Piastri made a blistering start from second on the grid. He drew level with Verstappen on the run towards Turn 1 before the Red Bull driver cut across the apex to hold on to the lead. With Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly’s crashes bringing out the Safety Car soon after, Verstappen didn’t quite get the chance to give the position back to Piastri and he was ultimately handed a five-second penalty for the incident. Piastri acknowledged that he had a tough time staying with Verstappen in the first stint on medium tyres. Nevertheless, he took the race lead once Verstappen served his penalty during his sole pitstop. The Australian took his third win of the season 2.843 secs ahead of Verstappen. “It wasn't the easiest of wins. I think the start was tough, the first stint was tough behind Max. And then once I had some clean air, it was a bit easier to manage. But I still couldn't afford to take my foot off the gas,” Piastri told media after the race. “It was a difficult race, and Max was quick behind me, so I had to keep pushing. And, yep, I think I could control it reasonably well, but it was a little bit tighter than I would have liked.” Verstappen “positively surprised” by Red Bull’s Jeddah turnaround It’s been a rollercoaster of a season so far for Red Bull. But despite losing out on victory, Verstappen admitted he was“positively surprised” with Red Bull’s race form, specially given the struggles faced in Friday practice. “On Friday it was very, very tough. It didn't matter what I was doing in terms of driving [or] management, the tyres would just fall off,” said Verstappen. “The car was a lot nicer [in the race]. [There are] still limitations, but it was much more promising” The Red Bull driver doesn’t want to get carried away with the result, though, and pointed out that the Jeddah Corniche Circuit didn’t have a lot of tyre degradation. “We know that when we go to tracks where there's higher degradation, we just struggle more. We still need to work on that. But the changes that we made already yesterday also worked for today. So, I'm very pleased with that,” he added. Leclerc: “We maximised everything we could” Leclerc opted for a longer opening stint on medium tyres before switching to hard tyres on Lap 30. He held off a charging Norris in the closing laps to finish third. “I feel like we've maximised absolutely everything we could have this weekend. There wasn't anything more in the car,” The Ferrari driver revealed after the race. “I think we need to focus on qualifying because it's been a very long time I haven't been as happy with the car balance.” Leclerc added, “we were all surprised by our pace in free air on the first stint. That was really good. Everything else was perfectly executed.” Norris bounded back from his qualifying crash to finish fourth, followed by the Mercedes duo of George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli. Lewis Hamilton was next for Ferrari, claiming seventh place. Both the Williams drivers also scored points, with Carlos Sainz taking P8 ahead of his teammate Alex Albon. Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar completed the top 10. 2025 F1 championship standings Piastri now holds a 10-point lead over Norris in the championship. Verstappen remains third overall, 12 points behind Piastri. Over in the teams’ championship, McLaren has already pulled 77 points clear of second-placed Mercedes in the standings. After a one-week break, F1 will now head to the USA for the Miami GP on May 2-4. 2025 Saudi Arabian GP results 2025 Saudi Arabian GP resultsPosDriverTeam1Oscar PiastriMcLaren2Max VerstappenRed Bull Racing3Charles LeclercFerrari4Lando NorrisMcLaren5George RussellMercedes6Andrea Kimi AntonelliMercedes7Lewis HamiltonFerrari8Carlos SainzWilliams9Alex AlbonWilliams10Isack HadjarRacing Bulls11Fernando AlonsoAston Martin12Liam LawsonRacing Bulls13Oliver BearmanHaas14Esteban OconHaas15Nico HulkenbergStake Sauber16Lance StrollAston Martin17Jack DoohanAlpine18Gabriel Bortoleto Stake SauberNCYuki TsunodaRed Bull RacingNCPierre GaslyAlpine Also see: F1 2025: Piastri takes commanding Bahrain GP win to join title fight",

    "description": "Red Bull Racing junior Arvid Lindblad became the youngest winner in F2 history (at the age of 17 years, eight months and 11 days) after inheriting victory in the Saudi Arabian GP sprint race. MP Motorsport’s Richard Verschoor crossed the chequered flag first, but was handed a penalty for forcing Josep Maria Marti off the track. Marti finished second behind his teammate Lindblad, handing Campos Racing its first 1-2 finish in the F2 championship. Rodin Motorsport’s Alexander Dunne completed the podium. Lindblad youngest F2 winner at 17 years, 8 months, 11 days Marti, Dunne complete sprint podium Verschoor penalised for forcing Marti off track Lindblad wins F2 sprint after Verschoor penalty Starting from sixth on the grid, Lindblad was already up to P4 at the end of the first lap. He then used DRS to get ahead of Gabriele Mini on Lap 3. Ahead of him, Marti passed polesitter Verschoor around the outside at Turn 1 to briefly take the race lead. Verschoor re-took the place on the next lap, but stewards eventually deemed that he had forced his rival off-track and handed Verschoor a five second penalty. On Lap 8, Lindblad moved up to second place as Marti ran wide at Turn 8. He held on to the spot till the end of the race, and since Verschoor’s penalty was confirmed on the final lap, Lindblad inherited victory ahead of his teammate Marti. “Really happy with the result today, youngest ever F2 race winner. A huge thank you to the team, a really good race coming from P6 to P1. A shame to Richard for the penalty, but super happy to win and looking forward to tomorrow now,” said Lindblad The penalty dropped Verschoor to P4, followed by Roman Stanek. Mini overtook Leonardo Fornaroli on the final lap to take P6, while Victor Martins grabbed the final point with a P8 finish. Maini misses out on points Jeddah has usually been happy hunting grounds for Kush Maini, who was recently also announced as part of the Alpine F1 team’s roster of reserve and test drivers. The Indian racer started from pole here last year ended up second in the F2 feature race. More recently, he even set the fastest time in the Formula E rookie practice session with Mahindra Racing, albeit on a shortened version of the track. However, this time around, his weekend has been hampered by what appears to be engine problems and he could only qualify P12. He ended up finishing P10 in the sprint race, just missing out on scoring points. Speaking to Autocar India ahead of the sprint race, the Indian stressed that it’s still early in the championship though, and there are some positives to take away despite the setbacks faced early on at Jeddah. “The way I felt in qualifying with car, I haven’t felt in a while. So. I’m positive for what’s to come. It was just a pleasure to drive and even though the result wasn’t there, that feeling in the car won’t go away and now we know what it is. We’ve figured it out as a team and we have a lot more of the championship for when the engine is falling into place all the other pieces come into place; we know we’ll be there,” he said. 2025 F2 Saudi Arabian GP sprint race results 2025 F2 Saudi Arabian GP sprint race resultsPosDriverTeam1Arvid LindbladCampos Racing2Josep Maria MartiCampos Racing3Alexander DunneRodin Motorsport4Richard VerschoorMP Motorsport5Roman StanekInvicta Racing6Gabriele MiniPrema Racing7Leonardo FornaroliInvicta Racing8Victor MartinsART Grand Prix9Luke BrowningHitech TGR10Kush MainiDAMS Lucas Oil11Oliver GoetheMP Motorsport12Joshua DurksenAIX Racing13Sebastian MontoyaPrema Racing14Amaury CordeelRodin Motorsport15Dino BeganovicHitech TGR16Sami MeguetounifTrident17Rafael VillagomezVan Amersfoort Racing18Max EstersonTrident19Ritomo MiyataART Grand Prix20John BennettVan Amersfoort Racing Watch this space for more updates from the Saudi Arabian GP.

    "description": "The Himalayan has now completed a year with us, and it’s time for the bike to be returned to Royal Enfield. Over the past year, the bike has gone on a couple of long rides out of the city, but most of the 6,648km on the Odo have been clocked within the metropolis. During this time, the bike has made my 70km round-trip commute far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. I’ve spoken about this before, but the Himalayan’s size, seating comfort, and superb suspension have won me over. With the engine, it’s not quite so straightforward, and I find myself wishing for more character after a few days of continuous commuting. However, the moment I take a break from the bike (which happens far more often than I’d like with the travel schedule), I get back on it and find myself enjoying the mid-range punch. That being said, RE still has work to do when it comes to damping out the handlebar vibrations at highway cruising speeds. Seating and suspension comfort are both outstanding. That I have enjoyed riding the Himalayan 450 is without doubt, but the experience has not been free of flaws. First, there was the issue of the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released. This took ages and multiple visits to the showroom to be sorted, and I was given to understand that it came down to correctly torquing some of the bolts that connect the engine to the frame. 17-litre tank is top-heavy, but it also makes the bike feel big. We also had the toggle switch on the left-hand switchgear fail, and it was replaced under warranty. But even when it works, I find the switch fiddly enough that I avoid using it altogether. This means that even though there is quite a bit of tech within all the menus on that pretty circular TFT display, I never bother with it. Thankfully, this has had no negative effect on the riding experience. The joystick switch is fiddly to use and needs redesigning. Finally, there’s the infamous cone-set issue. It first started to get loose at about 5,000km, which I reported on in the previous report. I was told by the folks at the service centre that it was tightened, as the bearing didn’t need to be replaced. However, less than 1,000km later, it has gotten loose again and is now considerably worse than it was the first time. For something that was such a well-known issue with the old Himalayan 411, it’s surprising to see it continue in the all-new model. It’s also been disappointing that the service centre has not reset the service warning after two separate services, and it shows up every time I start the bike. The steering cone set bearing keeps getting loose. But as I write this, I’m reminded that while there have been niggles, there have never been any serious breakdowns (or letdowns). The bike has always started when I’ve asked, and every ride has been enjoyable. Whenever I conclude a long-term review of a motorcycle, I always ask myself if I’d buy one. Usually, the answer is no, but here, I could see it being a yes because this bike fits my particular needs for a large, quick and super comfy bike that can steamroll through the mess of our local road system. The Himalayan has truly excelled at that role.

    "description": "Ever since it came out back in 2011, the erstwhile Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX has been one of the most well-rounded sport touring packages. Fast forward to 2025, and while this breed is sadly all but extinct, Kawasaki has determinedly stuck to its guns and brought out the new Ninja 1100SX. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX changes for 2025 Most of the changes have happened under the largely familiar skin Kawasaki has chosen to focus only on updating the internals, and the main change comes in the form of this new 1,099cc four-cylinder motor, which was birthed by stroking out the erstwhile 1,043cc powerplant by an additional 3mm. However, since this engine complies with Euro 5+ norms, peak output figures are slightly different. Save for the new paint and graphics, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the older 1000. With 136 ponies on tap, the 1100 is down 6hp compared to the 1000, although with 113Nm of torque available, it does have 2Nm more. And since this is a sensible sport tourer and not a headbanging supersport, Kawasaki has wisely given this mill taller 5th and 6th gear ratios. However, to ensure acceleration is not humdrum, the final drive gearing is slightly shorter, courtesy of the one-tooth-larger rear sprocket.  The TFT display is crisp and the UI is uncomplicated. Other changes include an improved, butter-smooth bidirectional quickshifter (which works literally from just above idle!), a 10mm-larger rear disc brake (which should come in handy because this bike will likely be ridden with luggage and/or a pillion), and a USB-C charger near the left-hand switch cube.  Charging port's housing could have been executed in a neater, sleeker manner. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX performance, ride comfort It is both supremely comfortable and blazingly fast As evident from these pictures, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the 1000, save for the stealthy black paint job and green graphics. This is the only colour you can buy it in, as the green paint is currently exclusive to the higher SE variant, which is not sold here. Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. All of the above-mentioned changes aren’t very drastic, and the impact they’ve had on the riding experience isn’t landmark either. But who’s complaining about that? The Ninja 1000SX was a smooth, comfortable, and polished sport tourer to begin with, and this 1100 carries forward all its strong points (save for one, which we’ll address later). It can be both blazingly quick and amazingly mellow when needed. Over the 750-odd kilometres I clocked on the Ninja, never once did I miss the six ponies it has relinquished to Euro5+ (unlike those pesky spec-sheet warriors). There’s no other way to say this – 136hp is a LOT of power. And since the midrange has been bolstered, in the 3,000-7,000rpm zone, you could argue that this is a more effortlessly quick bike than before. On that topic, you’d better have your wits about you before whacking the throttle open because the Ninja will catapult you toward the horizon with surprisingly calm yet undeniable ferocity. All the while, the motor was belting out a smooth inline-four scream, but what I enjoyed more was the intake howl every time I twisted the accelerator. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX handling Given the right inputs, this 238kg bike can handle very well And even in the city, the Ninja 1100 is perfectly composed, and you can just as easily commute as you can travel from Mumbai to Manali on it. The only trouble within city limits is that the mirrors stick out a little too much, and even for 5’11 me, reaching them in my natural riding position isn’t possible. The 135mm of ground clearance available is on the lower side, but you can make do if you exercise a little caution. Wide-set mirrors demand caution when filtering. But can this Ninja slice through a corner properly? 238kg is a lot, let’s make no bones about it, but once you adapt your riding style to the Ninja’s heft, you’ll be able to go just as fast as your friend who’s on the ZX-10R (on the road, at least) without any of the agony of having to sit like a gargoyle. So, is this the perfect road-going superbike for India? In a word, yes. It’s tantalisingly fast, fabulously comfortable, and superbly capable. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX price and verdict Its an accomplished machine but its no longer the VFM big-bike it once was The only caveat is that, at Rs 13.49 lakh, the big Ninja is no longer the VFM big-bike proposition it once was. Not long ago, the BS4 ZX6R and the 1000SX were priced almost on par. Today, the price difference between the BS6 ZX6R and the 1100SX is nearly Rs 2 lakh! Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. The fact remains that this is still a wonderfully sweet and capable machine (and the only one of its kind in this class), so if your pocket permits, I’d recommend you make a trip to your nearest Kawasaki showroom. I know I would if I could. Also See: Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX video review",

    "description": "Sometimes, timing is everything. Just when I need a compact but quick-ish car to get from one end of the city to the other, in walks the Toyota Urban Cruiser Taisor Neo-drive – Toyota’s version of the Maruti Fronx but with a name that does its best to confuse the hell out of you. Still, semantics and onomastics apart, what makes my eyes light up is that the Taisor Turbo is a relatively light car with a nice 1.0 turbo engine and a sufficient amount of boost. So, while the crossover-like profile may help it look bulky, the Taisor with a Boosterjet engine and a 5-speed manual weighs in at just over one tonne: 1,030kg, to be precise. And it isn’t just the 100hp; it also has 147.6Nm of torque that the engine puts out between 2,000rpm and 4,500rpm. The presence of a turbo, along with extra power and torque, makes this a fun crossover. This is primarily why it’s a happy camper in the city. Driving across town in start-stop traffic, what impresses is the relative lack of turbo lag. Sure, there is a zone where engine responses are relatively slow – around 1,200rpm – but responses are better by 1,500rpm, and power keeps getting stronger. This is primarily because this is a direct-injection engine (the only one in the Maruti range) that makes peak torque relatively early. The small turbo can be spooled up quickly due to the lower resistance it offers, and the engine even gets a small amount of e-boost from the mild-hybrid system. Light, easy and precise, the manual gearbox is good to use. Needs a sixth gear, though. This is why the 1.0 turbo is quite friendly to drive even in start-stop traffic, and unlike most turbos, I don’t mind letting it off the boil. In addition, the relatively responsive bottom end is also a reason why this engine delivers some good economy numbers, especially if you can resist squeezing down on the throttle. The dead pedal sometimes comes in the way when I press the clutch. Not nice. However, the latter is something I find difficult to resist, and that’s because, after 2,000rpm, the Taisor ramps up its power delivery in a linear push that gets stronger and stronger as you wind up the powerband. Sure, Suzuki’s Boosterjet could have had 10-15hp more, and power delivery doesn’t have that spike of boost that makes turbocharged cars so much fun. Still, the additional performance and light weight make this one of the most fun compact cars around, the ramp up in performance carrying on till around 6,000rpm. And that means my early morning drives from one end of Mumbai’s new inner-city highway – the Coastal Road – to the other en route for our Modern Classic Rally in Kalina are especially fun. The sweeping elevated sections and light traffic allow me to wind through the gears, and what’s nicer is that there is a real tachometer, a real dial and a real needle to follow. It helps that you can see all around, but the resolution needs to be better to see obstacles. While the 5-speed gearbox is slick enough, and you can heel and toe easily, the clutch is placed too close to the dead pedal and often comes in the way when I am trying to depress the clutch fully. Also, don’t much care for the plastic quality on the dash or quality levels in general. The seats are a bit too soft, and the cabin lacks a secure place to put my phone. The Toyota-Maruti screen, however, is much improved and has been relatively glitch-free, as is the voice quality on the carphone. What also makes this car quite practical is that it has a decent-sized boot, good ground clearance, and it’s easy to park with its 360-degree camera. The resolution, though, could have been better. And though it isn’t uncomfortable per se, the ride could have been more comfortable. Still, the Taisor is one of the most characterful, practical and enjoyable cars to drive in its class. The cherry on the top – the Taisor looks more balanced and interesting, especially with those headlights and the two-tone bodywork.

    "description": "We’ve had the Skoda Kodiaq in India before, but never the sporty RS version. That, however, is set to change with the arrival of the second-generation model. The regular Kodiaq will launch here in the April quarter, and the RS version will likely arrive by October, but unlike the regular Kodiaq, the RS will come in as a CBU import, meaning it will be pricey. Skoda Kodiaq RS exterior design and engineering (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq is less SUV-like than before, but you won’t mistake it for an estate. Segmented grille DRL is exclusive to the RS version. The Skoda Kodiaq – named after the Kodiak bear – was first unveiled in 2016, with the second generation coming in late 2023. It’s built on the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform, a derivative of the previous car’s MQB platform. The new car has grown 60mm longer but is about 10mm lower, giving it a more elongated stance. But while it is less SUV-like than before, you won’t mistake it for an estate. The RS version stands out with a blacked-out grille, lower bumper air intakes and a cool-looking segmented DRL that runs between the grille’s slats and extends into the headlight daytime running lamps (DRLs). Like the standard car, the headlamps are split LED Matrix units. Kodiaq RS comes with exclusive 20-inch alloy wheels Alloys are designed with aero efficiency in mind. Exclusive to the RS are two 20-inch alloy wheel designs with red brake calipers, black cladding around the wheels, and black accents on the lower sill, wing mirrors and the B, C and D pillars. At the rear, the tail-lights have a cool split and mirrored look, the lower half extending into a reflector bar across the boot lid, with Skoda’s lettermark replacing the logo. The rear windshield is topped by a deep spoiler and flanked by fins that are finished in black. Skoda says these aid airflow around the car, helping reduce the drag coefficient of the new-gen Kodiaq from 0.31 to 0.28. Skoda Kodiaq RS interior space and comfort (rating 8.5/10) Interior space is plenty and its comfortable too inside the Skoda Kodiaq RS There’s loads of space all around; the rear legroom and headroom are impressive. The inside is an all-black affair, from the headliner to the carpets. You can choose between suede or leather trim on the sports seats, dashboard, door pads and centre armrest, but only in one colour – black. And what really sets it off is the lively contrast from the red stitching all around the cabin. The 3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in perforated leather looks neat, with RS badging at the bottom. It’s nice to hold and has the familiar and easy-to-use scroll wheels. Skoda has put the extra length to good use. There’s ample headroom at the front and rear, and even with the front seats set rearward for taller passengers, second-row occupants will have plenty of legroom. This can be adjusted further, given that the second row slides and reclines. Like the previous car, the new Kodiaq can also be had as a 7-seater, with the third row stowing away neatly in the boot floor. Our car was the 5-seat variant, so we’ll reserve judgement on the third row, but the boot space is enormous. Without the third row, boot space is a massive 910 litres, and even with it in place, there’s 340 litres. There’s also a spare tyre and a space for the cargo cover beneath the floor. Most of my time was spent driving, but having inspected the second row, it seemed comfy enough despite the 40:20:40 split, which sometimes tends to make the individual seats too small. The front sports seats on the RS are really nice, and the bolstering held me nicely in place during some spirited driving in the hills. Skoda Kodiaq RS performance and refinement (rating 7.5/10) The Kodiaq RS is not firecracker quick but it’s just enough to justify an RS badge 2.0 TSI is a happy cruiser and can deliver strong acceleration, but you can feel it working hard. The Kodiaq RS packs the VW Group’s familiar 2.0-litre TSI engine. This unit also powers the regular Kodiaq, but under the hood of the RS, the output is bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm. Incidentally, the power is identical to the Octavia RS, which has the same engine, but the torque is 30Nm more here. The output is enough to propel the Kodiaq RS’ 1.8-tonne mass from 0-100kph in 6.3 seconds, which is plenty quick for what is also a genuine family SUV. Drive it sedately, and the Kodiaq RS is happy to cruise steadily all day with the engine nicely relaxed. And, should you need a quick overtake, mashing the throttle will drop a few gears, giving you momentum quickly enough. The 7-speed DSG gearbox did trip up occasionally while trundling through some low-speed traffic. In Sport mode, the shifts are quick, and the engine is kept nicely on the boil, so overtaking at any point is very quick and easy. Engine is aurally enhanced with artificial soundtrack The engine note does sound nice, but it’s enhanced with what Skoda calls Dynamic Sound Boost, which augments the car’s real exhaust note with an artificial soundtrack. Skoda Kodiaq RS mileage (rating 6/10) The Skoda Kodiaq RS fuel efficiency will not be very high, expect a single digit range only. We didn’t get to test the mileage of the Kodiaq RS in Croatia but given the engine’s output, the car's 1.8-tonne weight, and the fact that you can feel and even hear the engine working hard, don’t expect fuel efficiency to be impressive at all. Skoda Kodiaq RS ride comfort and handling (rating 7.5/10) In comfort mode, there is some float, but in all other areas ride and handling is good in the Kodiaq RS The body does roll in corners, but Sport mode tidies that up nicely. Putting down the RS’ power is an 4x4 driveline with impressive grip. We had some snowy weather, and driving to a mountain ski resort over wet roads, I always felt confident and was able to maintain a good pace. The RS has adaptive dampers, and in Sport mode, they do a good job of keeping body roll in check. What’s nice is that the ride does not get lumpy. In fact, I found myself using the firmer damper setting even on highway stretches, as in Comfort mode, there’s some body float over undulating surfaces and lean in corners. There’s a variable-rack steering, which adjusts the ratio for less steering input around bends. These systems often corrupt the feel, but that’s not the case here, with Kodiaq RS’ steering providing enough weight and precision. Skoda Kodiaq RS features and safety (rating 8.5/10) You can expect the Kodiaq RS to be well-equipped The all-black interior looks sporty, and vibrant red stitching is plenty but not overdone. The touchscreen is a new 13-inch unit that’s slick to use. Equipment-wise, there are all the expected bits, including 3-zone climate control, a 10-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel and a free-standing 10-inch infotainment screen or an optional 13-inch unit like we had on our test car. India-spec model should come with sunroof What was not on our test car was a sunroof, but given the popularity here, expect the India model to get one. Being a Skoda, the Kodiaq packs in a lot of ‘Simply Clever’ bits, like specific storage spots for the key fob and phones and even a handy little duster to wipe the touchscreen clean. You can expect the India-spec car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. Skoda Kodiaq RS price and verdict (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq RS isn’t a wild child, it’s a family SUV with a nice sporty side to it. If everything goes according to plan, Skoda says we can expect the Kodiaq RS in India by October, and, importantly, local manufacturing is a possibility later on. So, while its everyday sibling could be competitively priced, the RS will most definitely not be, as it will come in as a CBU for now. Expect an asking price of around Rs 60 lakh, which is wading into traditional luxury-brand territory, and for some, that would seem like a lot of money for a Skoda. But the Kodiaq RS does a lot to entice you to look past all that. There’s a massive amount of space all around and the option of three rows of seats. It’s comfortable and rides well, and you can expect the India car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. So, it’s got ‘family SUV’ off pat. But what about the sporty side that the RS badge promises? It’s not light and nimble for sure, but it’s plenty quick in a straight line, and the 4x4 drivetrain gives you ample grip in corners. Plus, the engine sounds fun. So, for that money, then, there really is nothing quite like it.

    "description": "“Pass me more tyres, these ones have melted” We talk to current and past staffers, including Matt Prior and Chris Harris to discover their favourite moments The Autocar was the very first motoring magazine to use a standardised series of tests to deliver a verdict, and nearly 100 years on, we're still doing it. Things have changed since those early days, of course. Sadly our early road testers are unfortunately no longer with us, but some of the magazine's more recent alumni have shared their memories. Below you'll find the ones we could actually legally use. John Barker “I was a bit surprised to find myself going backwards at 100mph. One moment I was steering the Nissan Maxima gently left onto the wet asphalt apron at the end of Millbrook’s mile straight, the next I was fast reversing towards a steep grass bank, bracing for impact... “An impact that was thankfully soft. I got right to the top of the 30ft bank, the wipers gave a flick, I breathed a sigh of relief – and then gravity asserted itself and we started back down on the wet grass. The Maxima nosed heavily into a French drain and was stuck but, incredibly, unscathed. \"The recovery truck driver said as much, before adding ‘we found this on the driver’s seat’ and presenting me with a sizeable turd that was, in fact, part of the soil sample the Maxima’s tailpipes had made on impact and chugged out on the way back down.” Chris Chilton “Tyres tests were an Autocar regular in the early 2000s and as a junior road tester, I was tasked with taking a Ford Transit full of fresh rubber to Michelin’s Ladoux track in the middle of France in preparation. “Naively/stupidly taking as read Chris Harris’s dubious assertion that I’d easily be able to get there, dump the tyres and get back to Teddington in a day, I set off for France with no spare clothes, no hotel and, this being 2002, no smartphone to book one. By the time I’d arrived, the facility was closed and I spent the night driving back and forth between autoroute toll booths to stay warm. “Years later as road test ed I made up for it, sending my rookie to deliver the rubber and then flogging the lot to a part-worn tyre dealer three weeks later.” Gavin Conway “It's May 1994. The McLaren F1 Autocar was testing sat before me, V12 ticking as it cooled on a remote Welsh road. At the time, road test supremo Andrew Frankel said the magazine would never run figures on a faster car (he hadn’t anticipated the Bugatti Veyron). \"The F1’s 627bhp magnificence could reach 100mph in 6.3sec and top out at 240mph, and 25 years ago it cost a staggering £627,000 (we also didn’t anticipate that today you won’t get change from £11 million if you want a good one). “I hadn’t been a road tester for much more than a year and I didn’t really expect to be more than a passenger in the McLaren. So I was baffled when the half dozen or so road testers and snappers piled into the support van. \"The last of them, Autocar superhero Steve Cropley, walked over and handed me the keys to the F1: ‘See you back at the hotel. And take your time.’ Alone, with the keys to a McLaren F1 – I don’t believe I’ve been so trusted since then. Thank you, Autocar.” Jamie Corstorphine “In 2008, I was running a long-term Caterham 7 and, in search of a destination for a farewell journey, I ended up touring the Isle of Man. \"I was so impressed by the quality of the roads and hospitality of the locals that I returned with a pitch to base our annual Britain’s Best Driver’s Car contest there. The fact that the local officials had offered to close a road sealed the deal with the editor.  “It turns out that closing a road on the Isle of Man is as simple as completing a form, turning up at the transport depot to pick up a few cones and ‘Diversion’ signs and setting to work yourself. \"At the time, the whole thing felt somewhat unreal. Five of the year’s best driver’s cars and one spectacular mountain road all to ourselves. Even the rain held off. “Until the next morning, that is, when a huge storm blew in, resulting in the single worst ferry journey I have experienced.” David Vivian “Two enterprising guys – I forget their names – had travelled to Germany to buy an Amphi-Ranger, a sizeable, angular amphibious 4x4, with a view to marketing the vehicle in the UK. \"After taking delivery, they drove it back to Blighty. Thing is, when they came to the English Channel, they didn’t stop, and spent the next 21 miles dodging ferries and cargo ships. How could we resist the offer of a spin to the Isle of Wight?  “A day that starts with a bump across a Portsmouth pavement and a sandy slither past open-mouthed beach dwellers towards the sea has a certain surreal promise, although the anxiety aroused by the sight of my hosts’ legs dangling through the open sunroof and a brick on the accelerator to provide forward thrust was rivalled only by the urgent flashes of bilge pump warning light. \"No matter. We gatecrashed Cowes week, trundled across Ryde and eventually, back in the briny at low tide, got stuck on a Solent and bank. At which point I opened the door, removed my shoes, leapt into six inches of water and walked to the nearest pub.” Andrew Frankel  “It's the launch of the original Ford Mondeo in 1993. For Autocar readers, the first group test was probably the story of the year and, as road test editor, it was my job to deliver it. \"Ford had hired the Byblos hotel in St Tropez, so we drove the rivals down for the showdown the next day. Then an American called Jack Daniels got involved, after which I remember nothing. “The next day, I was so ill I’d pretend to take each car for a blast in the hills, only to drive out of sight, park and sleep for an hour. Then one of our number inverted the Primera, while another threw up three times on the way to the airport. \"Proud? No, and 25 years later I still cringe at the thought. But we got the test done and, most importantly, got the verdict right. That Mondeo was a landmark, so much so that not even the hangover from hell could disguise it.” Chris Harris  “June 1999. I flew into Stuttgart and took a taxi to Zuffenhausen – home of Porsche and a place I’d wanted to visit all my life. Just seeing the signs near the factory triggered spasms of joy, but the reason for my visit was almost too much to comprehend: to collect a new sports car called the GT3, a faster, more track-savvy version of the water-cooled 996. \"I signed the collection document and primed the map book to take me to Calais via every possible type of road. I drove at 180mph on autobahns and zipped through France on N-roads before landing in the UK, in the first GT3 ever to do so. \"I was 24 and thought – still think, in fact – that I had the best job in the world. “These would go on to be the cars I would grow to love above all others. That was one of the happiest days of my life, because I was never happier than when I worked at Autocar. I still have that collection document.” Simon Hucknall “There's a reason why Autocar uses one of the UK’s two proving grounds for recording road test numbers: both have arrow-straight sections of at least one mile, allowing testers to pick off important ‘accel’ figures with ease, including the standing kilometre. \"But neither was free the day I had to run figures on the then new Maserati 4200 in 2002, so I headed for the Longcross test track instead. Longcross doesn’t have a mile straight; in fact, the only straight section it has is barely a kilometre, ending in a banked 180deg bend. \"Overshoot and you’re on the M3. The near-400bhp Maser was, Chris Harris assured me, a ‘sub-24-second car’ over that kilometre. At 125mph, I was two seconds shy of that target; at 130mph, I nearly spun braking so hard into the turn; and at 132mph/24.7sec, I received a ‘reckless’ warning from track control and had to call it a day. So, close, Mr Harris, but no cigar.” Matt Prior “Sometimes, when we performance test extremely fast cars at MIRA, its maker will send a support crew, who diligently check pressures and temperatures and offer new tyres every few minutes. \"Occasionally, they even send a driver to advise how to get the best from the car. Once Ferrari sent ‘Marc’, who turned out to be Marc Gene (who was utterly charming and thought our wet handling circuit was hilarious). “When Porsche said it would support the 918 Spyder test, then, we thought we knew what to expect – which wasn’t one bloke in a 4x4 with some wheels in the back that stayed precisely where they were. \"His idea of checking the 918’s tyres was to put a cigarette down for just long enough to place a hand on a tyre to see how warm it was and shrug. “Thus approved, the 918 went around our dry handling circuit a full second faster than a McLaren P1.” Matt Saunders “Morgan's elegant 'aero' series of flagship sports cars had escaped the full road test treatment until 2012, when Matt Prior and I took delivery of one of the factory’s ‘supersport’ Aero Coupe at MIRA. “We watched it roll off the delivery trailer. It looked lovely. We cracked on with our numbers – until halfway through our dry handling lap times when there was a nasty lurch, the engine cut out abruptly and the brake pedal went worryingly dead. \"Turns out an engine mounting had failed, and the wayward motor had snagged and tugged loose the car’s brake lines while it was thrashing around. And so, contrary to our plans, it left MIRA the same way it had arrived. “Three years later, I was figuring Radical’s Radical RXC500 Turbo when, at almost precisely the same point on MIRA’s Dunlop circuit where the Morgan came to rest, the Radical’s gearbox seized, ejecting me off across the damp grass, at speed, towards the tyres (which, pleasingly, I missed). It’s not my favourite corner. “You will recall reading neither test, because neither car completed the process, neither could be photographed and so neither appeared. That’s the thing with low-volume British sports cars: you never quite know what’s going to happen.”",

    "title": "Best hot hatches - driven, rated and ranked",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-hot-hatches",
    "description": "There are no hitches with our top 10 hot hatches – but which pocket rocket claims the number one spot? Hot hatches are the Goldilocks performance cars – they're fast, mischievously good fun, whole-heartedly practical and some are even quite affordable. What is not to like? The best hot hatches come from a recipe that has been around for decades: take an otherwise ordinary hatchback, up the performance and upgrade its powertrain and chassis technologies.  Some car makers even hand them over to their own in-house performance sub-brands to work their magic. Think Mercedes-AMG, Hyundai N, Toyota's Gazoo Racing and Ford Performance. Hot hatchbacks are equally capable of zipping through city streets or tackling winding roads, offering exhilarating driving experiences without sacrificing everyday usability.  You should make the most of them while you still can. Increasingly strict emissions regulations mean hot hatches are no longer the overtly affordable performance machines they once were.  Although internal combustion still rules the roost, there’s a definite sense that these petrol-engined machines are the last of the breed. Two cars on our list are actually electric.  But which should you choose? We think the Toyota GR Yaris is the best hot hatch money can buy today, offering stunning cross-country pace, engaging handling and compact proportions.  Read on for our full top ten list of the best hot hatches on sale today. Whether you're after speed, style, or versatility, these cars have it all.",
