    "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.

    "description": "Sending off 2024 with a bang, from Jaguar XJ220 racing to Sherman tanks Have you ever seen footage of a Jaguar XJ220 racing series? I recommend it if you haven’t. Called Fast Masters, it was run in 1993 in the US as a way of building the Jaguar brand there – and, helpfully, it occupied some of Jaguar’s supercars, which after the recession of the early 1990s weren’t exactly leaping out of showrooms. (Some people who ordered them, finding themselves suddenly cash-strapped, walked away from their deposits rather than buy the finished article.) Jaguar and broadcaster ESPN attracted mostly retired big-name drivers in the US and invited them to race in this one-make series. The XJ220 wasn’t designed as a race car and didn’t seem to become much less of a handful when race-prepped. The series was nicknamed Crash Masters and remains a great watch. It remained a single-line entry in my notes app throughout 2024, worthy of mention in a column but apparently not so worthy that I could big it up to 700 words of its own, so it sat there neglected. But, as ever, I’m keen to empty my notes for the new year, so here it is. See also a single-line entry: ‘Paula Radcliffe Way’, which is a bypass near Bedford named to celebrate the area’s famous world-champion runner. Amazing to have something named after you, I’d have thought, notably when you’re alive and can still enjoy it. Most things named after people only get so once they’ve died. But I wonder: how does any celebrity in question feel about it if it’s scruffy or neglected, as is likelier with a road than, say, a bridge or a race-track corner or a stadium? Would you feel hurt to see it strewn with fast-food packaging? Would you organise a litter pick? Do you hate being contacted by phone but feel okay about texting or meeting in person? I’m told this is a thing that affects young people more and is looked down on. But I wonder: is it actually reverting to humans’ natural type? Once we could signal from afar or send written messages or meet in person, but the idea of meeting sort-of in person while still miles away from each other was an impossibility. Maybe phone calls or online meetings are now being shunned because actually they feel unnatural? Anyway, I couldn’t find a fit with cars, so I didn’t manage to put this into a column. One notepad entry for which I did think of a car angle still needs more research. When Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe took a stake in Manchester United FC, it was reported that he called people back into the office because fewer emails were sent on Fridays, when people worked at home. That stat may be true, but it’s incredibly simplistic if it happened as reported. It’s possible that I write fewer emails when I’m not in the office, but it will be because I have several thousand words to write and people tapping me on the shoulder every 20 minutes isn’t conducive to productivity. But I’ve thought – and this is why I need to bury my head in some stats – about how it relates to smart motorways. Some proponents of them say they’re the safest stretches of road in the country, despite how badly the public feels about them. What they don’t say is how safe those stretches were beforehand and whether accident rates have gone up or down since. Smart motorways were designed to ease congestion, so it stands to reason that they were first introduced on the busiest (and therefore the slowest and probably safest per passenger mile) bits of road. I will revisit this one, so it will stay in my notes app. On stats: the Sherman tank. Some media outlets think it’s a winning argument to say pick-up trucks are a similar size to a Sherman. It’s not a winner. Truth is the Sherman was an incredibly compact tank, at just 5.8m long. The contemporary Churchill tank was 7.4m long and the modern Challenger tank is over 11m long. While the Sherman could and did carry quite a lot, you couldn’t put a pallet in the back of one. Cars are now too big, yes, but this is a silly stat. And with my notes largely clear, I feel better about stepping into 2025. Happy new year.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/radio-gaga-wild-and-wonderful-world-rc-racing",
    "description": "RC cars come in all shapes and sizes. 1:8-scale RWD Touring Cars cost up to £3k Radio-controlled car racing could be among the best motorsport you will find in the UK This may be the most sideways circuit racing I’ve yet seen. Some of the hardest to keep track of, too: here’s a world of motorsport in which cars can hit 60mph long before any Tesla – and with considerably less fuss and online bluster. It’s made all the wilder when you squint for a look inside the cockpit and see no one grasping the wheel. Welcome to national radio-controlled (RC) car racing, a world that is as focused as it is fun. Crucially, it’s a sport without a penny in prize money for the drivers, who stand in a control booth overlooking all eight corners of the Halifax Track. This 280m-long Yorkshire circuit accommodates all manner of RC classes, from 1:18- to 1:5-scale cars and across a wide budget, and today it hosts a crucial point in the season for the bulky two-wheel-drive Touring Car shells – worth up to £3000 a pop. Yet tensions aren’t bubbling over: a television series about this lot would be more Detectorists than Drive to Survive. Racing means a lot to them, but kinship within the paddock is clearly just as important. “Like every form of motorsport, Covid had an impact here,” says John Russell, chairman of Halifax Track. “But we now have more people in every class. Folk looked at what they had in the loft and thought ‘I used to race this’ and they found their hobby again. And it is a hobby. We offer no cash prizes, only trophies, and there are very few sponsored drivers. Even then it’s primarily to help test and develop technology for the RC car manufacturers.” The ‘lockdown effect’ of cars being dusted off also coincided with a rejig of the rulebook, led by former European and world champion Ian Oddie. “We relaxed the rules a few years ago and made everything a bit more fun and it all kick-started again,” he says. “The European championships are a bit tighter and more regulated. You need rules to make it fair, but you must make them balanced to keep it fun and entice people to take part.” I’m enthralled by the paddock, at once rudimentary and resolute, benches covered in implausibly large RC cars and their numerous parts as fastidious owners do some final tinkering ahead of their heats. The age span is broad, too, from mid-teens well into retirement. Nevertheless, Oddie, 58, humbly plays down his successes among the group: “I used to drive around Europe, testing tyres and shocks for a week to perfect my set-up. But now I don’t do any testing – just the national races. It’s an excuse, but I’m getting too old! I’m nearly 60 now, and against the younger competitors it all comes down to hand-eye co-ordination. Just like with full-size cars, there’s no advantage to being old here. Europe has an over-40s class because of the difference.” Two classes are racing today. The four-wheel-drive Minis sit at the ‘beginner’ end of the spectrum for large-scale 1:5 cars and will set you back around £600 second-hand and in fully working order. Plastic construction keeps them relatively affordable, while a 4WD chassis is a mite easier to control. The rear-wheel-drive Touring Cars heading up the weekend are something of a step up. Costing several grand, weighing 10kg (minimum) and with a top speed of around 55mph, they’re mighty things. And that’s before their devoted drivers have lifted off their robust outer shell – primed to take an impact at the end of the rapid back straight – and let snapper Max and I have an excitable poke around. While the grid perhaps lacks a little variety, the tried-and-trusted nature of the bodyshells on the market means the Alfa Romeo 156, Audi A3 and BMW 3 and 4 Series designs lead the way. The Alfa remains a favourite for its handling capabilities almost 20 years after its full-scale equivalent departed top-flight motorsport. There are lots of them here today. “Aerodynamics and downforce are crucial,” says Craig Orman, 46, one of Oddie’s key rivals – and mates. “If your wing falls off, your car is undrivable.” He guides us round the intricacies of his car, at its heart a buzzy 26cc two-stroke engine making around 7bhp. He shows off its CNC-machined aluminium chassis, steel brake discs and bespoke pads, its trick differential (a key to controlling these things in all weathers) and its generous stack of tyres. Priced at around £35 a pair, they resemble adorably scaled-down versions of proper racing rubber, with slicks, treads and wets available. The most focused competitors even plug in tyre warmers to prime them ahead of each race. Told you it was serious. Others simply pin their car down and smear the rubber to the floor with a liberal use of throttle, which I have to admit looks more fun. Two minutes of warm-up laps before a rolling start provides an opportunity to observe whose tyre prep was most successful: one BMW pirouettes repeatedly into the grass. Stricken cars are returned to the circuit throughout practice and race sessions by corner marshals. This is a role played by the drivers themselves, the grassroots feel of a sport never more evident than when its competitors quickly shuffle into volunteer roles between their own events. “If you can already drive a model car, it’s not a step up, more a step across,” says Orman when I ask how easy the Touring Cars are to drive. “With a Tamiya, you have an electric motor, whereas here you have a clutch to engage. But it’s fundamentally an RC car, so you can use sticks or a steering wheel control just like anything else on the market. What’s trickier is learning how to set up the car. Fuel and tyre management, engine tuning, castor, camber, roll bar thickness and positioning… You can get very lost very quickly. Most people who get into the sport have someone they know already doing it.” The youngest competitor today is Sonny King, aged 15, who has travelled almost 300 miles from Kent. His dad got him into racing smaller, cheaper Tamiya models at Crystal Palace when he was just 10, and he’s since graduated through the 4WD Minis and into 2WD Touring Cars. “There are people here triple my age,” he admits. “It feels like an achievement beating people with so much more experience. But it’s one big family. I see everyone here as my friends.” Chairman Russell admits competitors typically fall either side of their twenties – keen to compete in their teenage years when they discover the sport before typically disappearing until they’ve settled down in their thirties (or beyond) and begun to crave a hobby again. But hobby culture – and its myriad benefits for mental health – has clearly led a minor resurgence in paddock sizes and diversity. And next summer the European Championship for the Can-Am racer-esque 1:8-scale Circuit Cars will come to Halifax for a five-day extravaganza. Those are the devices that will beat a full-size electric car to 60mph on their way to an 80mph maximum. Crikey. Back to today and the clouds have rolled over, rain starting to plip-plop on the smooth surface and sending even the 4WD Minis into minor oblivion; the marshals are busier than ever plonking them back into place. It’s hard to know where to look: the cars are fast and spread out, performing in a simultaneous time-trial fashion to avoid too much pricey contact. Rubbin’ ain’t racin’ here.  Some of the slides would put an Autocar ‘Handling Day’ shoot to shame, however, so how do you even go about controlling one? “You have to countersteer and use opposite lock, but you’re doing it without feel and just by sight,” admits Orman. It’s all the more tricky when you’ve adopted an almost bird’s-eye view of the circuit and the concept of left and right visually switches around a clockwise lap of the track. Some drivers have dabbled with forward-facing in-car cameras and first-person-view screens to aid their control, but it limits awareness of cars nearby or immediately behind.  “More experienced competitors have honed techniques for the rain too,” continues Orman as we duck back into the paddock for cover. “They will do tyre prep, add ballast, even play with their radio signals and programming. You can in effect add a delay or curve to the power delivery, or make the brakes apply with your steering inputs to shift the weight around.” It really does replicate full-scale motorsport, right down to stringent scrutineering of each car to ensure weight limits and tech regulations are being followed scrupulously. But all the competitors agree that infringements are rare and usually resolved simply. With no prize money, there’s less to fall out over. And all the more reason to keep the racing lively.",

They’re adored by chopper and bobber riders, fans of vintage café racers and scramblers, scooterists, and anyone who loves the feeling of the wind in their face (and bugs in their teeth). Sure, an open face helmet won’t protect your face in a crash—but a good one can still safeguard the soft grey stuff between your ears. So if you do insist on riding in one, at least pick a decent three-quarter lid and leave the novelty ‘piss pot’ at home. Here are three options that I’ve tested extensively. Biltwell Inc.

I learned a lot of lessons on that bike, and the toughest one cost me some plastics, a little pride and a fat ding in my pickup truck box. That poor Honda ended up on its side plenty of times, but it’s no fun when the ignition’s off and the incident was 100% preventable. It’s far from the most exciting aspect of owning a bike, but sooner or later you’ll have to transport your motorcycle and there are plenty of ways to get it wrong.

    "description": "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUU5nb1jAw[/embed] The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel or the embedded video up top and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

The Transvaal Highway, Route 66, the depths of Patagonia, and Iceland’s Route 1 - they’re all on there but I feel it’s smart to tick off those closer to home first. I’ve enjoyed the NC500 in Scotland, crossed the Lake District, and plowed through Snowdonia, but Southern Ireland, with its wild coastline and craggy rocks, has always been on the list and finally, I had the good fortune to tick it off. And I didn’t just ‘tick it off’ - I did it in style, with luxury, culinary treats, and a few rather decent Italian cars.
