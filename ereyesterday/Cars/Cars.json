    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "title": "Triumph Speed T4 road test, review",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "Audi has been on an electric onslaught in India with the e-tron models. The last RS was an EV in the form of the violent but silent RS e-tron. Now, though, the grapevine has it that Audi is considering entering the hot hatch segment with the baby RS – the RS 3. And not just that, Audi is expected to bring in the RS 3 in both hatchback and sedan forms as a double whammy for Merc’s baby rocket – the AMG A 45 S. The RS 3 packs in the legendary 5-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, over 400hp and a secret trick (find out in a bit) under its sleeve that transforms its character. We drive it in Spain to get a hint of what to expect next year. 2025 Audi RS 3 design At first glance, the RS 3 carries all the typical Audi cues, with straight lines and a serious look. The sharp LED headlamps feature four types of DRL themes, including a racy, chequered flag look to go with the character. The wide and gloss black hexagonal grille takes up a majority of the real estate up front, with air intakes on the aggressive-looking bumpers and some carbon-fibre bits to keep weight down. The profile (in this case, the sedan) looks sleek and superbly proportioned. Fans of the three-box design will appreciate the balance and subtle use of lines, and the 19-inch wheels do the trick and fit in very well. Wrapped around them are Pirelli P-Zero R tyres, which are standard, but one can also opt for the more track-focused TrofeoRs for best track performance. You’d also notice flared wheel arches that also feature vents within for better aero. There is carbon fibre on the ORVMs and door sill, too. 19-inch alloys and a low tyre profile. At the rear, the only shouty bits, pun intended, are the oval exhaust tips poking out. Wrapped around them is a gloss-black diffuser with some more carbon fibre. LED tail-lamps add a final touch of bling. There is also a carbon-fibre spoiler, and given that this is an RS, there is not a speck of chrome to be seen. You want bling? Stick to the As. 2025 Audi RS 3 interior and features Inside, the RS 3 is all about sportiness, thanks to a blacked-out interior that is bathed in Race-Tex and leatherette. It gets sports seats as standard, but Audi also offers carbon-fibre bucket seats (as seen on the test car here) as an option. The latter hold you tight in place and feel like a nice, warm hug. That said, while the support and bolstering are incredible, the cushioning has a softness that results in better comfort, too. More on that in a bit. Then, we have the steering that gets a flat top and bottom, along with dedicated buttons for Performance and RS modes. The steering-mounted controls are on a haptic touchpad, but thankfully, the centre console features proper physical buttons for basic controls. Carbon-fibre bucket seats are hugely supportive and also very well-cushioned. There is no dual-screen layout here like on the bigger Audis, just a basic 10.1-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and all the features you’d expect. The AC vents, media controls and auxiliary functions all have dedicated buttons that are very easy to use. There is also a sweet-sounding, high-end SONOS audio system, but nothing that can top the sweet and raspy exhaust note of the five-cylinder engine. In the back, the RS 3 struggles for room, especially if you measure over six feet. The kneeroom is at a premium, and while there is some space under the front seats for your feet, the short squabs rob away under-thigh support as well. The headroom is just about enough, and a hump in the centre prevents a middle passenger from sitting comfortably, thereby making it a four-seater realistically. There are AC vents and charging provisions, but you’d be comfy in the rear only for short trips. Not spacious in the rear: two adults can just about fit, and three would be very tight. The boot space in the sedan is a decent 321 litres, with 281 litres for the hatchback version. 2025 Audi RS 3 performance A 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbo-petrol engine with 400hp and 500Nm powers the RS 3, and while 400hp might seem low for an RS badge, the 1.5-tonne weight means the power-to-weight ratio is a healthy 255hp per tonne. 0-100kph takes just 3.8 seconds, and the top speed is locked at 250kph – strong numbers and a very impressive fact sheet, but the RS 3 is all about the experience from behind the wheel. The raspy exhaust of a five-cylinder is distinctive even when idling. But get going, and the sound just gets better and better as the needle climbs. On a race track in performance mode, the RS 3 can utilise a lot of that 400hp, but the real surprise is how adept the engine feels out on the streets. The 7-speed gearbox mellows down, the shifts are smooth, and the engine dials down the adrenaline; it can putter around with little drama. However, the strengths of the RS 3 can be found in corners. The 5-cylinder engine sounds glorious and has plenty of power.   2025 Audi RS 3 handling and ride quality When it comes to tech on the RS 3, Audi took their very own “VorsprungdurchTechnik” (progress through technology) very seriously indeed. It might seem like a basic job for a light car with a powerful engine, but hidden away is incredible tech that helps put all that power down. The RS 3 also holds the record in its class at the Nürburgring, with a time of 7 minutes and 33 seconds, which is obviously quicker than its predecessor. But more importantly, it is a whopping 15 seconds quicker than the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S. The reason? A new torque vectoring system, which allows for variable torque on the rear axle. Essentially, the power that goes to the rear wheels can be altered depending on which wheel needs it more. It uses data from the steering angle, throttle position, wheel-speed sensor and the handling gods to rotate the car better on its axis and absolutely negate any understeer. As the outside wheel gets more power, it brakes the inner wheel to avoid grip losses and gain better control. Apart from this complex Quattro system, there is something called “RS Torque Rear mode”, which sends nearly all of the power to the rear wheels and allows for controlled slides like a full-blown RWD car. It is similar to the Drift Mode you get on the A 45 S, but since the power goes mainly to the rear, it’s a lot more natural. Few cars are as fun to drive as the RS 3. You can hoon it around a track and also use it as a daily driver. While the tech for handling is impressive, the suspension is also responsible for a lot of the advancements. The RS 3 gets RS Sport suspension with adaptive dampers, which, in Dynamic mode, ensures the car is level and stuck to the tarmac for best traction. However, out on the road and cobbled streets, Comfort mode changes its nature and results in a relatively soft ride, with none of the typical harshness that you see from low-slung hot hatches or small performance sedans. This will be handy in India, where you can have the suspension in Comfort and the engine in Dynamic. But we’ll test that once the car makes it ashore. 2025 Audi RS 3 verdict and estimated price  Torque Rear mode powers solely the rear wheels and can induce drifts. Prices for the RS 3 are expected to range between Rs 85 lakh and Rs 90 lakh, and the fact that there will be two versions in the form of the hatchback and sedan is only music to our ears. After a plethora of silent EVs with fake sounds, a proper hot hatch comes as a breath of fresh air. But the RS 3 is more than just a fast and loud little car. It is a car that yearns to be taken out and driven. One exception for which you don’t mind waking up early, escaping the city and having a blast on a ribbon of tarmac. No matter how crazy EVs get with their sharp looks and AI-generated sounds, a 1-2-4-5-3 firing sequence will always have them on toast.

    "description": "Think electric cars can't be truly engaging? Take this seminal EV hot hatch for a slide... Minutes after a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N been dropped off with me, it was off to a Gatwick Airport car park. I got back late the next night, a bit jaded, and then… two wheels kerbed, brutally so. It happened at opposite corners on a spiral down ramp towards the exit of the car park. The ramp was tight: the nearside rear was done first, and in trying to correct it I overdid it and took out the offside front. This was far worse than the nearside gloss white alloys of a Vauxhall Adam I took out on the North Circular one night getting out the way of an ambulance, or even the McLaren 570S I created a new alloy wheel design for on the Channel Tunnel, having so carefully edged through the first 95% of the carriages and their raised metal kerbs.  Too big, too heavy, too wide: that’s where my mind went with the Ioniq 5 N on the drive home. The road testers had already given it five stars, so I’d just take their word for it and try and not do any more damage to it before the nice man from Hyundai could come pick it up again, and mark up the sheet with my indiscretions. The train to the office isn’t too bad, anyway. But it was with me for a shoot at Bedford Autodrome, and the show had to go on. I’m so glad it did. Even Geoffrey Boycott’s stick of rhubarb could get this car sideways within only a corner or two, and not feel out of control or like the car is getting away from you.  Plenty will dismiss the ‘manual’ gearbox and ‘engine’ sound as gimmicks, but they are part of the car’s charm. There’s no such dismissing of the real star of the show: the electronic limited slip differential, which gives the car its quite incredible agility and adjustability, and playfulness on the throttle. The best thing about the Ioniq 5 N is that it’s the first attempt from anyone at making a hot hatch-style electric car that’s about far more than power. And for it to be so good first up bodes reassuringly well for what is to come.",

    "description": "Now that our digital archive is complete, the possibility of taking a long-term view of inflation is intriguing Inflation has been a subject on everyone’s lips in 2024, not least with regards to new car prices, which we were recently told had risen 129% over the past 15 years. Goodness gracious! Now, with the few gaps in Autocar’s digital archive having been filled, the possibility of taking a long-term view is intriguing. Working out an average price of the cars featuring in our weekly road test (which admittedly is probably skewed towards the higher end of the market) since World War II reveals that car prices remained fairly flat until the 1980s, when they suddenly soared and have since maintained that trajectory. Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at the magazineshop.com Of course, that the average road test subject cost £1016 in 1950 doesn’t tell us much, because it seems an absurdly small amount of money today. Unless you can remember life back then, you have no concept of how much that sum was actually worth. So let’s adjust that £1016 for historical inflation, giving us an equivalent in modern money. That’s £28,781, the Bank of England’s calculator tells us. Wow: it seems remarkably cheap, considering that the average road test subject in 2022 was £70,054. Or, to put it another way, a Jowett Jupiter roadster in 1950 cost essentially the same as a Mazda MX-5 does today – which might seem reasonable to you. Yet anyone who was around in the 1950s will tell you that the Jupiter was hardly an affordable option for most people. My own grandmother recalls that when she was a child, merely the distant sound of an engine signalled that her stepfather was arriving home from work, because his Austin A90 was the only car that lived on their south London street. So, not only did her neighbours not each own a Morris Minor Tourer (the cheapest car we tested in 1950), despite one costing the equivalent of only £11,080 in today’s money (actually £2715 less than the cheapest car of today, the Dacia Sandero), but also someone as affluent as a surgery-owning dentist would proudly have been able to own a Nissan Qashqai equivalent. What gives? Well, the method we’ve been using to adjust the prices is based on a blend of the Bank of England’s modern Consumer Price Index and older Retail Price Index data – measures of the cost of living. But the growth of the UK economy over the decades has increased people’s real income, meaning that even though commodity prices have continually inflated, people have had more and more to spend. In 1950, people simply consumed a lot less; that A90 would have been a much more significant investment for old Gordon than a Qashqai would be for a dentist today. Measuring Worth is a fascinating academic project that has created an inflation calculator to provide some illustration of this. One of the measures it offers is a labour value – calculated as the multiple of the average wage that a worker would need to buy a commodity, such as a car. All of a sudden that A90 was really worth more like £122,600, the same as a Mercedes S-Class today, and the Morris more like £43,200, or a BMW 4 Series. Look at the graph below and you can see that the gap between our two measures of inflation closes rapidly through the 1950s as Britain rebuilt its economy after the war, closed up significantly through the 1980s and 1990s and converged in the mid-2000s – about the time when the UK’s economy and the increase in the average standard of living entered the period of stagnation that persists today. An interesting side note to all this is the comparison to that other major investment that we all wish to make: a home. According to data from Nationwide, the average house price tracked almost equally with the average road test car price until 1970, when it started gently climbing away; by the mid-1980s, it was three times higher, from a low base level; and since the late 1990s, it has rocketed away, such that it’s four times higher from a high base level – all while wages have stalled. It seems, then, that the best time to have settled down with a house and a nice car was in the late 1970s – so congratulations if you lucked out there.",

We’ve tweaked our formula this time around. Our data was pulled from the start of December until the end of November—leaving us more time to process it, without missing any zingers that might pop up late in the year. We’ve also left social media out of it, focusing purely on the ten machines that made our servers work the hardest in 2024. Once again, the final selection is eclectic, with no one build style dominating the charts. Grab your favorite beverage, enjoy the selection, and tell us which bikes made your 2024 hit list. 10.

    "description": "STG Tracker is one of the most versatile custom workshops in operation today. The Argentine duo of Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp works on myriad makes and models, constantly flitting between different build styles. So if you give them carte blanche on a project, you can bet they’ll deliver something highly imaginative—like a Royal Enfield bobber with a bespoke frame and a dazzling livery. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 [known as the INT650 in the USA] is a cracking donor bike for a custom build. It’s not crazy expensive, its parallel twin engine is easy to get along with, and it looks great out of the box with lots of room for tweaking. But for Marcelo and Germán, this particular project called for something more… “A client came to us asking to make a bobber out of his Interceptor 650, but it had to be different,” Marcelo tells us.…",

    "description": "Pune-based Vayve Mobility will present its Eva electric vehicle, which charges via solar power, in production spec at the 2025 Bharat Mobility Global Expo being held from 17th to 22nd of January in Delhi. Vayve debuted the Eva concept featuring a roof-mounted solar panel at the Auto Expo in 2023.  Eva’s solar panel doubles up as a panoramic sunroof It supports charging via both the Sun and standard electrical outlets It’s designed for an average daily commute below 35km Vayve Eva EV: design, colours Sitting on a 2,200mm wheelbase, the Eva is 3,060mm long, 1,150mm wide and 1,590mm high. For reference, the wheelbase and length are slightly more than the MG Comet EV, which has a height of 1,505mm and a width of 1,640mm. The tyre size is 13 inches (12 inches in the Comet). The quadricycle-like design is aimed at aerodynamic efficiency, as with any other electric vehicle.  A total of six colours will be on offer: Moonstone White, Light Platinum, Rose Coral, Sky Blue, Champagne Gold and Cherry Red. Vayve Eva EV: interior, seating capacity  Besides focusing on driver visibility, Vayve has also equipped Eva’s cabin with features such as touchscreen and digital information displays, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, panoramic sunroof, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, climate control, remote monitoring and vehicle diagnostics and over-the-air updates. Seating capacity is limited to three – one for the driver and a bench seat at the back suitable for a child and an adult. Vayve Eva EV: battery specs, range The green vehicle promises a 250km range on a single charge, while the OEM claims an annual 3,000km mileage on solar energy. Additionally, a range of 50 kilometres can be achieved in five minutes by fast charging, while it takes 45 minutes to reach an 80 percent charge with a DC charger. With a standard charger, the time goes up to 4 hours. Eva’s liquid-cooled battery has a 14kWh capacity, as seen in the concept about two years ago. Powered by a 40Nm RWD motor, the Eva EV sprints from 0-40kph in 5 seconds, maxing out at a top speed of 70kph. The battery unit, placed under the floor, has a waterproof rating of IP68; other safety bits include a driver airbag and seatbelts for all three passengers. Vayve Eva EV: running costs Vayve claims that in comparison to regular petrol cars with an average running cost of Rs 5 per kilometre, Eva costs Rs 0.5 for every kilometre (90 percent less) it runs. This is made possible owing to the usage of lightweight materials in its construction, it says.

    "description": "The new year will kick off with the 47th edition of the Dakar Rally, scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia from January 3-17, 2025. It is a 7,700km route that features a mix of dunes, rocky valleys and mountains. The Dakar Rally is one of the most gruelling tests of man and machine in motorsport. And the latest edition is set to up the ante further, with the opening week featuring both the 48-Hour Chrono and Marathon stages. First introduced this year, the 48-Hour Chrono stage requires competitors to stop at the closest rest area at sunset and survive on their own in secluded areas in the middle of the desert. Those who make it through this will then have to take on the Marathon stages, with no help from support vehicles or mechanics. The Indian contingent is showing up in full force at Dakar 2025, with participation from four racers. Hero MotoSports also returns as the only Indian team at the event, on the back of a historic second-place finish at the 2024 Dakar Rally. Hero MotoSports   2024 was a milestone year for Hero MotoSports. It became the first Indian team to score a podium finish at Dakar, thanks to Ross Branch’s second place finish. Moreover, Branch went on to clinch the 2024 World Rally Raid Championship. The Indian team will be looking to continue this upward trajectory at Dakar 2025 and will have three riders competing in the premier Rally GP class. Branch returns for his third Dakar Rally outing with Hero, and he’ll be joined by Sebastian Buhler and Jose ‘Nacho’ Cornejo. “Looking ahead to Dakar 2025, the challenge is bigger and the expectations are higher, but we come well prepared. The team is looking in peak shape and we are ready to face any challenge that comes on,” said Hero MotoSports team manager Wolfgang Fischer. “We are entering the 2025 season with a stronger than ever three-rider squad, and our Hero 450 Rally bikes are fine-tuned to conquer even the most gruelling conditions.” Harith Noah TVS-backed racer Harith Noah also scripted history at the Dakar Rally earlier this year, with his Rally 2 class victory. “What I took away from it is that a lot of things are possible in life. You just have to be determined. Consistency is really important,” he said. 2025 is set to be his sixth Dakar Rally outing. The Indian will continue racing for the Sherco factory team in the Rally 2 class and his goal remains the same – “I just want ride every day as fast as I can and try to stay on two wheels.” Ashish Raorane   Ashish Raorane’s journey to Dakar has been very different compared to his compatriots. A Marine Engineer by profession, he started his racing career at the age of 35. Just six years later, he became the first Indian privateer in the Malle Moto (now called ‘Original by Motul’) category, competing without any assistance. That outing ended when he crashed on Day 5. But he returned in 2024, racing for team Xraids Experience. Unfortunately, he crashed out of the 2024 Dakar Rally on Stage 1 itself with a broken collarbone. But he returns to Dakar for unfinished business, and he’ll once again be riding a KTM 450 Rally Replica for Xraids in the Rally 2 class. “I’m looking forward to Dakar 2025. The recovery was super tough after my crash on Stage 1 of the 2024 Dakar. I think that more than the recovery of the body, the mental side took a little bit longer. You prepare for so long for the Dakar, and it’s all over after a few hours. That’s a hard pill to swallow,” he said. “I’ve been preparing hard. I did the Baja Aragon and then the Rallye du Maroc. That was really good for my 2025 preparation. I was really happy to get a finish at the end of a very difficult race in Morocco. It makes me a bit more confident.” Jatin Jain   2025 will be Jatin Jain’s debut outing in the Dakar Rally. He started racing on home soil over 20 years ago, and he’s gone on to take victories in the Indian National Rally Championship and Raid De Himalaya. After gaining experience in international cross-country rallies like the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, Mexico’s Sonora Rally and Argentina’s Desafio Ruta 40, he’s now set to take on the challenge of the Dakar Rally. Jain will also be competing in the Rally 2 class, racing a Kove 450 Rally bike. “I was really inspired by CS Santosh, who pushed me to try out cross-country rallying. I was also lucky enough to have raced many times with Aravind KP and Harith Noah (former and current Dakar competitors). So, I keep in touch with them if I have any questions concerning the Dakar,” said the 46-year-old. “I wanted to take it easy before doing the Dakar and that’s why I gained experience on many other rallies around the world. I’ll be riding a Kove bike that I was able to race with these last few months, and I feel good with it.” Sanjay Takale In a racing career spanning over three decades, Sanjay Takale has collected more than 75 wins on home soil and overseas, including winning the Asia Pacific Rally Championship’s Production Cup in 2013. He’s now set to become the first Indian to compete in a Dakar four-wheeler category. The 56-year-old will be racing a Toyota Land Cruiser HZJ78 in the Dakar Classic class, with support from French team Compagnie Saharienne. The Dakar Classic class features vehicles manufactured before 2005, and competitors run on a separate route, better suited to the vehicles. And unlike the other classes, where the goal is to complete each stage with the fastest time, Dakar Classic follows a regularity rally (more commonly known as Time-Speed-Distance or TSD) format, where the goal is to complete each stage in a specified time and at a specified average speed. “Dakar is more than a race – it’s a dream that pushes the limits of human and machine capabilities. Representing India on this unparalleled platform is both a privilege and a responsibility,” said Takale. Also see: Hero MotoSports’ Ross Branch wins World Rally Raid Championship",
