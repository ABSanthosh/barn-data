    "description": "This 1969 Ford Mustang is one of a claimed 17 produced as an officially licensed Boss 429 continuation by Classic Recreations. Each began with a 1969 Mustang body that was modified in the style of a Boss 429, while under the bodywork of this example a Jon Kaase Racing Engines 572ci “Boss Nine” V8 was installed and mated to a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. A four-link rear suspension, tubular upper and lower front control arms, adjustable coilovers, and chassis reinforcements highlight the suspension modifications, and forged 18″ American Racing wheels were also installed along with Wilwood brakes, custom gauges, TMI high-back bucket seats, an aluminum steering wheel, air conditioning, a modern sound system, and a center console. This car is believed to be the only example delivered in this configuration with Laser Red paintwork, a custom interior, and an automatic transmission. This continuation Boss 429 was previously listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered again with a clean Oklahoma title in the seller’s name.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/inside-cosworth-how-brit-firm-keeping-screaming-v12-alive",
    "description": "Commerical director Chris Willoughby shows us around the Cosworth factory... The company faded from popular view for a while but is now back at the forefront, designing soul-stirring engines Features such as this so often open with a somewhat clichéd remark about the incongruousness of the drab surroundings from which the renowned company under the spotlight operates. True to form, we find the headquarters of one of Britain’s best-known and most influential automotive engineering outfits nestled between the garages and warehouses of Northampton’s sprawling St James Industrial Estate. Head to the right of Jewsons and around the Royal Mail sorting office to find the main office entrance, and then up and under the West Coast mainline and past the MOT centre for the factory itself. This small and unassuming complex of buildings forms what could undramatically be described as the epicentre of Britain’s motorsport and performance car engineering heritage. The history of Cosworth Engineering is so intrinsically connected with that of British sports cars that you have to wonder what today’s car world would look like had founders Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth never formed a relationship while working at Colin Chapman’s fledgling Lotus Engineering outfit in the late 1950s. From humble beginnings in grassroots motorsport, the pair evolved their business into a leading engine supplier for top-flight motorsport series, famously creating the most successful engine in the history of Formula 1, the DFV V8. The business would go on to put its name to some of the most revered and influential performance cars of the late 20th century: Ford's Escort and Sierra, Mercedes-Benz 190E, Audi RS4, Subaru Impreza… The list goes on, and today the company counts in its portfolio some of the most powerful and expensive road cars currently in production: the likes of Bugatti, Aston Martin and Gordon Murray have all turned to the storied outfit for a new generation of mammoth-capacity motors. Commercial director Chris Willoughby has been at Cosworth for 34 years, first as an engineer in the F1 powertrain division – what he calls a “golden era”, during which he worked with legends including Senna and Schumacher. Now he oversees a team that builds some of today’s biggest and most beautiful road car engines.  While the remit has changed dramatically, the ethos has not, and Willoughby says the pit lane mentality remains absolutely central to Cosworth’s success. “I can see parallels between that really successful racing era and where we are now with the hypercars,” he says. Primarily this is reflected in how self-contained and agile the business still is – a characteristic fostered by its involvement in those halcyon days of F1, when engineering innovation and rapid reaction times were utterly crucial to supremacy. “All of our customers today want shorter and shorter programmes, so we’re very focused on that,” continues Willoughby. “But being vertically integrated is very much who we still are. \"An interesting parallel with the DFV is that we made getting on for 1000 of them, and if you look at some of the car programmes we’re working on now, we’re certainly going to be into the many hundreds of engines. Creating a clean-sheet design, developing and then manufacturing it in quantity – that was our business model back then, and that’s our business model now.” What’s different about Cosworth’s output now, though, is that the engines are so much more than mere tools used in the pursuit of racing success. Rather, they are upheld as mechanical marvels in themselves, ones that are central to the appeal – and ultra-exclusive billing – of the cars in which they are mounted. “There’s an appreciation of the engines and vehicles almost like they are pieces of art,” says Willoughby. “They’re appreciated in the same way – even the aesthetic of the engines and what they look like is very important. And I think there’s a growing interest in what the engines are technically beneath the skin. “People are blown away when they see a piston or a crankshaft, or the oil cooling squirt jets… All those things – there seems to be a real appetite for that now.” Willoughby echoes the sentiments of Bugatti-Rimac CEO Mate Rimac, who said recently that demand for the ludicrously quick Nevera hypercar was flagging as the world’s highest-net-worth individuals were being drawn by the heightened analogue appeal of its combustion-engined contemporaries. That his new Cosworth V16-powered Bugatti hypercar is named Tourbillon – after a tiny and highly intricate mechanism that’s usually on display in expensive watches – is no coincidence. It is largely because of the enduring allure of a mechanical combustion engine – with all of its pulleys, belts, plugs and bangs – that Cosworth is still designing and producing enormous 12- and 16-cylinder engines, and all of this while the more mainstream sectors of the automotive industry scrabble to downsize and decarbonise. But there are also more rational technical considerations to bear in mind. Today, the viability of using batteries in such high-performance cars as the Valkyrie and T50 is limited, because the energy density “is not there”, says Willoughby. “They will progress and get better, but doing 10 laps of the Nürburgring seems like a long way off. “If you want to do 10 laps in a car that weighs 1000kg and has desirable dynamic qualities to it, then an engine is still very much the tool to use.” Hence Cosworth’s exploration of alternative means of fuelling the internal combustion process. The study has yielded promising results, lending further weight to the growing argument that banning engines themselves – rather than the highly polluting substances that currently make them spin – is a misguided enterprise. Willoughby adds: “We’ve been running synthetic fuels for four or five years, and the chemists say it’s exactly the same as gasoline. Sure enough, when we put it in an engine, we can’t tell the difference.” He acknowledges that production of synthetic fuels is currently highly limited, and thus it is prohibitively expensive for use in a mainstream context. “But for our type of applications,” he says – referring to the £3.2 million Tourbillon and £2.8 million T50, for example – “the price is less likely to be a limiting factor.” The fact that racing at the Goodwood Revival is now powered by e-fuels, and that F1 is on track to follow suit in 2026, is representative of the opportunity at hand to decarbonise those enthusiast-facing sectors of the automotive world that simply can’t – at least yet – feasibly switch to battery power. In one of Cosworth’s 10 top-secret dyno suites, one engine has been rigged up to burn hydrogen. Willoughby says it has also shown promise as an alternative fuel because of its propensity to burn over a wide air-fuel ratio range and produce comparable power outputs to petrol.  Dampening its appeal over purpose-designed synthetic fuels, though, is that it requires around 10 times more storage space in the car and produces water, which “all ends up somewhere”, necessitating extensive moisture-capture modifications – as demonstrated by the labyrinthine pipework twisting its way up from the manifold of this block into the vents on the ceiling. The primary inhibitors to adopting hydrogen for use in combustion engines are not so much the technical limitations but rather the crucial developments that can’t be achieved within the confines of a Northampton workshop. “The adoption of hydrogen depends on lots of things outside of our control,” says Willoughby, “like the development of infrastructure and supply.” Even if this is not a technology that has a place in today’s world, it may well be needed in the future – and Cosworth will be ready to take to the front of the grid, in figurative terms, when it is. Cosworth’s efforts at combustion-engine preservation are far from a wilful nosethumbing of the rules and regulations that will bring about the eventual demise of fossil-fuelled powerplants; instead, they come in recognition of the fact that even the very highest echelons of the automotive market will be forced to adapt to new technologies as part of a clean-up act that will safeguard their future. It’s just not entirely clear when that will be, at least for now. The fact that we’re looking at an engine that burns hydrogen does not mean Cosworth has any immediate plans to commercialise this technology, but rather it serves as testament to the company’s ruthless commitment to being prepared for any eventuality. “We need to know how to react to changes in the market,” explains Willoughby. “We have to be a bit diversified and understand how our skillset maps into the market, and where it has value.” As he speaks, Willoughby is forced to raise his voice over the deafening growl of a Gordon Murray V12 that’s running in the adjacent test bay – a neat metaphor for Cosworth’s eggs-in-many-baskets approach. Small wonder that the people responsible for these screaming mechanical marvels should be exploring ways of keeping their crankshafts spinning into the future. From the dark and deafening confines of the test benches that are little changed since the company’s early days, we are ushered down a hallway to the final assembly suite, which is comparatively blinding in its surgical spotlessness and lays bare the scale, significance and splendour of Cosworth’s latest generation of combustion engines. Perhaps it’s the relative mundanity of its surroundings that so emphasises the ludicrous proportions of Bugatti’s new V16, but you get the sense that this is a powerplant conceived to draw the eye organically even when removed from the multimillion-pound missile in which it will be mounted. Even if you have only the vaguest inkling of which bit does what in an engine, there is pleasure to be drawn from the granite-hewn quality of the components used here, the attention to detail in linking them all together and the sheer size of what they constitute when they are united. This 8.3-litre lump is so colossal that you don’t so much casually glance around it as embark upon a lap of it: comparisons with the likes of the Rolls-Royce Merlin and the Beast of Turin’s flame-spitting 28-litre motor feel more than appropriate. Our request to fire the engine up in situ is wrongly assumed to be a joke and laughed off, but videos from testing confirm that it sounds about as biblically cataclysmic as you would expect: guttural and booming, with a baritone bark that spirals upwards in pitch as it approaches its 9000rpm redline. As it accelerates away from the camera, it sounds almost like two Mercedes-Benz SLR McLarens having a drag race. “Hopefully we can keep it so limiter-free,” said Mate Rimac recently. Quite. Willoughby says this aural drama was a prerequisite of Bugatti’s V16 programme, which was good news for a company whose co-founder Duckworth is quoted as saying: “Turbos are for people who can’t build engines.” Here at Cosworth, they like their engine aspiration natural, their revs high and their exhaust notes shrieking. Willoughby, surprisingly perhaps, drives an electric car himself, and says they are “absolutely the right answer” in mainstream applications. But in the sort of rarified air that Tourbillon, Valkyrie and T50 owners breathe, there is still a huge demand for analogue viscerality and evocative authenticity that can only be provided by a free-breathing, huge-capacity petrol engine. And while very, very few of us will ever have the opportunity to take one of these automotive artworks up through the rev range ourselves, the resulting soundtracks can at least be enjoyed by anyone within earshot. “The thing that’s surprised me is how well received the sound of a naturally aspirated engine is,” admits Willoughby. “I think that’s deep-rooted in the human psyche in some way. I’m not a psychologist, but I think it’s hard-coded from when tigers used to jump out on us from behind bushes – we’re coded to have a response to noise.” There’s rather less poetic licence in that analogy than you might think. When the probing jaw of the Aston Martin Valkyrie emerged from behind the hay bales at the Goodwood hillclimb’s first corner last year and its deafening exhaust note – more than reminiscent of a 1990s F1 car – began to reverberate ominously around West Sussex, the stunned, respectful silence that fell on the Festival of Speed grandstands was testament to the emotional power still wielded by a properly fettled combustion engine. This roar, though, unlike a tiger’s, attracts a crowd rather than dispels it – but it is also similarly endangered and risks being silenced without the efforts of dedicated preservationists. Happily, there’s a group of highly skilled and ruthlessly committed engineers in the East Midlands, working hard to ensure it remains unstifled for many years to come.",

    "description": "New model will arrive here by end of 2026 priced from below £30,000 Chinese upcoming brand Omoda has revealed a radical new compact crossover aimed at the MG4 and Kia EV3.  The Omoda 3 will be officially launched in October ahead of a global rollout including the UK starting late next year and will be offered with an electric drivetrain as well as plug-in hybrid and straight internal combustion. The angular styling and sharply defined sharknose grille recalls much more expensive SUVs including the Lotus Eletre and Lamborghini Urus, however the price is expected to start below £30,000. The car measures 4420mm long, making it just almost 50mm longer than the Omoda 5 SUV already sold in the UK in both UK and combustion engine form. However the 5 will stretched for its next generation version, a product manager for Omoda and Jaecoo told Autocar at the unveil event held at parent company Chery’s home city of Wuhu, China, on Saturday. The car sits on the same T1X platform as the 5, new Omoda 7 midsize and new Omoda 9 large SUV. Also sharing the platform are the Jaecoo SUVs including the 7 compact and new smaller Jaecoo 5.  Chery is steering its Omoda brand to appeal more to a youthful customer and the presentation highlighted elements of the 3 such as the sci-fi inspired dashboard digital graphics, a ‘starship’ noise option and the ability to sync your Nintendo Switch with the large, portrait central touchscreen.  Omoda also promised a modification option dubbed ‘the official racing pack’ as well as official body wraps. Omoda sold 3194 cars in the first three months, with Jaecoo notching up 3235 units according to data from automotive lobby group the SMMT. Put together the twin Chery brands outsold Fiat, Citroen, Jeep and Lexus from just two models in the quarter. The combined brands have just under 80 dealers in the UK and are targeting 120 by the end of the year. More brands are coming from the Chinese company – the country’s largest vehicle exporter – with Chery’s own brand arriving in October with the Tiggo 7 compact plug-in hybrid and a new brand, Lepas, scheduled to hit early 2026.",

    "description": "Royal Enfield’s most accessible roadster, the Hunter 350, has been updated for 2025, marking the first major update this motorcycle has received since its inception. For this year, RE has made a few crucial changes to make the Hunter 350 more appealing. Here’s everything you need to know about the updated model.  Available in three variants Gets a new rear suspension Royal Enfield Hunter 350: What’s New? The Hunter 350 remains largely mechanically unchanged The biggest change has been made to the rear suspension, which moves from a linear spring to a progressive one. This, along with a new routing for the exhaust, has resulted in an overall increase of ground clearance by 10mm. The bike now also comes equipped with a redesigned seat that has the same profile as before but now features a higher foam density to aid comfort. The brand has also thrown in a slip-assist clutch across all Hunter 350 variants. Additionally, this model now gets more features and tech.  RE has now equipped the Hunter 350 with an LED headlamp and a digi-analogue instrument cluster with a tripper pod, and higher variants get a Type-C charger as standard. The Hunter 350 is available in six colours spread across three variants. Apart from these updates, the motorcycle remains largely mechanically unchanged.   The Hunter continues with the 349cc air-cooled J-series motor that delivers a relaxed 20.2hp and 27Nm. It's mated to the same slick-shifting 5-speed gearbox that is now paired with a slip-assist clutch. Currently, the Hunter 350 rivals the likes of the Honda CB350 RS and the Jawa 42. Prices for the Hunter 350 start at Rs 1.50 lakh for the base variant, Rs 1.77 lakh for the mid-spec variant and Rs 1.82 lakh for the top variant. While prices for the base variant remain the same as before, the top variant now sees a Rs 5,000 increase in price over the model it replaces.

    "description": "The MG Windsor will soon be updated with a larger battery pack option, say our sources. Besides this crucial addition, the Windsor is expected to receive more features, and the launch is expected as soon as next month. A new 50.6kWh battery pack is expected on the Windsor New feature additions will likely include an ADAS suite Updated Windsor launch expected next month Updated MG Windsor: what to expect? The Windsor is currently sold in India with a 38kWh battery pack, but it gets a larger 50.6kWh battery in Indonesia where it is sold as the Wuling Cloud EV. This same battery will make it to the India-spec model; it has a claimed range of 460km on the CLTC cycle. For reference, the existing 38kWh battery on the Windsor returns a range of 332km (ARAI-rated). However, the power and torque figures of 136hp and 200Nm are expected to remain unchanged with the larger battery, as will the front-wheel-drive configuration. Our sources have also hinted at an updated features list, the highlight of which will be the inclusion of an ADAS suite.   New battery could bring a notable update to real-world range In our real-world efficiency tests, the Windsor fared really well, returning an efficiency of 8.1km/kWh and a range of 308km – just 24km off the claimed figure. For reference, The Nexon EV with a larger 45kWh battery returned a real-world range of 350km but with a lower efficiency of 7.79km/kWh. The larger battery could take the Windsor’s range closer to 400km, probably making it viable even for trips outside the city. MG Windsor sales in India It is currently outselling the Nexon EV  Since its launch in September 2024, the Windsor alone has given significant boost to MG’s sales in India. In the seven months between September 2024 and March 2025, the Windsor sold 19,394 units, averaging more than 2,700 units a month. More importantly, it has consistently been outselling its chief rival, the Tata Nexon EV, which had long been the undisputed bestseller in the EV segment. The addition of the larger battery surely will give a further impetus to its sales. But expect a reasonable bump in its ex-showroom price, which currently ranges between Rs 14 lakh and Rs 16 lakh.  Also See: Renault Duster, Bigster hybrid under evaluation for India Tata Nexon EV 5-star BNCAP safety rating extended to 45kWh variants",

    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "The Vellfire is Toyota’s big global MPV. It’s the current craze among India’s rich and famous, and has even gone on to become an unlikely red carpet regular. Mind you, this new-gen model was launched in India way back in 2023, but such has been the demand (nearly 1,200 were delivered last year), even the team at Toyota – that wouldn’t cut a queue – seemingly got their hands on their own media car only now. 2025 Toyota Vellfire exterior design and engineering: 7/10 5 metres long and 2 metres tall Vellfire has big presence You wouldn’t buy a Vellfire – or any MPV for that matter – primarily for the way it looks, but this latest-gen model does look more luxury product and less upscale airport pickup than the last one did. Of course, it’s the 5-metre length, 2-metre height and massive body that make the hulking Toyota unmissable even amidst luxury sedans and SUVs. Chrome treatment extends to 19-inch rims. Chrome details add bling to large MPV There’s more bling too. The huge 6-slat grille that almost extends to the floor is slathered in dark chrome, there’s more of the shiny stuff lining the bumper and even the headlamps sport a jewelled effect. You get the full effect of the Vellfire’s towering size at the side. Even the 19-inch rims look small amidst the vast body. A stylistic fold at the window line does give the slab-sided Vellfire some distinction in the world of MPVs. At the back, a roof spoiler and protruding bumper add some sportiness, if you will. Upward sweep of window line limits visibility for middle row passengers. The Vellfire uses a monocoque construction and is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform meant for large models. Toyota claims the new Vellfire is significantly stiffer in its construction yet engineered to be comfier and quieter than the last-gen model. 2025 Toyota Vellfire interior space and comfort: 9.5/10 Middle row comfort is exceptional Make what you want of the way the Vellfire looks, because the real story starts when you get inside. The first and perhaps only place of interest for the Vellfire’s chauffeur-driven clientele will be the middle row seats, access to which is via powered sliding doors. It is a bit of a step up into the living room-sized cabin. However, the short trek is worth it, ending in a pair of individual chairs that are no less than thrones. Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar. Vellfire's middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar.  Physical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests. There’s a wide range of motion, and, at full extension, you can really stretch out business-class style to catch a power nap on the go. Heating, ventilation and massage functions only up the comfort levels. However, the upswept rear windows don’t give the panoramic view out you’d expect in an MPV. Detachable screens mounted on armrests control seat adjustment, heating, ventilation and massage.   Third row offers enough room for three adults to sit in comfort Middle-row space and comfort is just brilliant, but it isn’t too bad for your entourage at the very back either. In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage. Access to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.   Access to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that's large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’. There's loads of flexibility built in: push the third row seats far forward or manually swivel them up and to the sides to free up courier van-levels of room. For all its space though, the Vellfire doesn't offer enough room for a spare tyre. Vellfire's boot offers courier van-levels of space, but there’s no provision for a spare tyre.   Cabin quality sees a huge jump over last-gen Vellfire We don’t foresee too many Vellfire owners getting into the intricacies of the front section of the cabin, but even so, the news is good. The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality. There’s more generous use of leather and padded surfaces, and even the wood-like detailing is convincing. Front seat comfort is also really good. Wraparound look to dash and high quality materials make cabin look rich and inviting.  The Vellfire gets abundant storage spaces across all three rows (including roof-mounted boxes), although the glovebox is unusually small. 2025 Toyota Vellfire features and safety: 8/10 14-inch touchscreen and digital dials are part of long equipment list The Vellfire comes loaded with goodies, so let’s break down the features set row-wise. Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either. 14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn't cutting edge.    Middle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos The multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system. Also, there won't be any quarreling with your co-passenger over sunroof opening thanks to the presence of individual glass panels with powered sunshades atop both seats. Middle row passengers get dedicated sunroofs. Adjustable seats, AC vents and powered sunshades for the quarter glass are features of note for third-row passengers. ADAS is part of Vellfire’s safety suite Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are also included. Lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control worked well on the smooth and well-marked Coastal Road in Mumbai, though it was the Blind Spot Warning function that came in most handy when piloting the oversized Vellfire. 14-inch rear entertainment screen folds out of the roof.    2025 Toyota Vellfire performance and refinement: 7/10 Vellfire offered in India only in front-wheel drive form Before we get moving, you should know that the Vellfire is sold in India only in front-wheel-drive format. Versions on sale overseas can be had with a rear electric motor that powers the rear wheels, effectively enabling all-wheel drive when driving conditions require. As things stand, the Vellfire is the most expensive front-wheel-drive vehicle on sale in India. Strong hybrid powertrain delivers a max of 250hp Driving the front wheels via an eCVT is a strong-hybrid arrangement. The powertrain comprises a 192hp, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine and a 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp. Vellfire doesn’t like to be rushed and feels its best in city confines.  It goes without saying that this is not a vehicle you buy for performance. If you’re in a hurry, the Vellfire is probably not the right vehicle to pick from your garage. This one’s job is to transport seven passengers in comfort. Vellfire can run in electric-only mode when battery has enough charge The Vellfire loves easy-going driving and gentle cruises, but ask anything more of it by pressing down harder on the accelerator pedal and that CVT-ness of the drivetrain comes right through. The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point. When there is enough charge in the battery, the Vellfire will slip into all-electric EV mode, which brings the decibel levels right back down. This is when you see the Vellfire in its best light. The Vellfire is ideal for easy-going driving and gentle cruises.  The Vellfire actually feels its best in stop-start urban confines, where the hybrid setup keeps the big Toyota in its comfort zone. It works as a long-distance vehicle too, but the powertrain simply doesn't feel as effortless as a strong diesel or even a strong turbo-petrol engine would. 2025 Toyota Vellfire ride comfort and handling: 7/10 Suspension doesn’t iron out all bumps and road noise creeps in to the cabin On the go, the VIP sat at the back will have reason to nitpick. Ride comfort is good but not good enough for a vehicle that sets you back by Rs 1.5 crore. The bumps and potholes do get filtered to quite an extent (it’s far nicer than the last Vellfire on this front), but the experience is not as pliant as it should have been. There’s also a fair bit of road noise that makes its way into the cabin, and at high speeds, you’ll hear air slamming against the A-pillar. Drivers will take some time getting used to the Vellfire’s size.    Drivers will need some time to get comfortable with the Vellfire’s size Also, the Vellfire isn’t the kind of vehicle that you just get into and get comfortable behind the wheel of. Sure, the high-set seat and large glasshouse give a commanding view of the world, but the windscreen that extends far forward makes it tricky to judge the Vellfire’s frontal extremities, at least initially. The size takes some getting used to and U-turns will need a bit of planning. There’s more ground clearance than the low floor would suggest. Ground clearance might appear inadequate but the Vellfire clears big speedbreakers without scraping its belly. No height adjustable air suspension here; the Vellfire rides on steel springs. 2025 Toyota Vellfire price and verdict: 8.5/10 Toyota Vellfire prices start at Rs 1.22 crore (ex-showroom) The Vellfire starts at Rs 1.22 crore for the Hi trim, while this VIP Executive Lounge spec is yours for Rs 1.32 crore (ex-showroom). Fun fact? That’s a crazy Rs 40 lakh-plus jump over the last-gen model’s launch price in 2020! The Vellfire is clearly not your average level-headed Toyota, nor is it your typical practicality-above-all-else MPV. It’s a luxury good and Toyota would like you to think it’s priced as such too. The Vellfire is for the chauffeur-driven who want to lounge on their way to work or home. A like-priced luxury sedan or SUV will get you more power and deliver a quieter experience, and of course, there’s the lure of a more prestigious badge too. But nothing, and I mean nothing, at this price can match the Vellfire’s rear seats for comfort. For the chauffeur-driven who merely want to lounge on their way to work or home, the Vellfire will be money well-spent. Toyota’s peace of mind ownership and a claimed 19.28kpl fuel economy figure would perhaps help strengthen the case for the Vellfire with the company CA too. But you know what? There’s an even more exclusive, more refined and comfier option from the house of Toyota – the Vellfire’s cousin. It’s called the Lexus LM, and it goes up to Rs 2.6 crore. Van damn!
