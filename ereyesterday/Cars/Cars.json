    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/lancia-brand-refused-die",
    "description": "Ypsilon is reigniting the old marque – a hot HF-badged electric version will soon follow Lancia has at last launched a new car. We drive it to find out whether that odds-defying revival is a success Until recently, Lancia was withering away on death row, reduced since 2017 to a single model in a single market. One could almost sense hard-headed FCA chief Sergio Marchionne’s irritation as the Fiat 500-based Ypsilon continued to sell in droves. It’s thanks only to Italian drivers’ patriotism and indifference to needless expense and the latest tech that Lancia survived for long enough to be saved by Stellantis. Credit must go to founding Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares for appreciating Lancia’s value enough to hand the brand sufficient funding for a 10-year revival of its core model lines. Precisely what is that inherent value, though? That’s what I’m hoping to discover, driving the new Ypsilon in Turin – home to the first factory that employed Vincenzo Lancia way back in 1898, the first site he opened under his own name and the famous Mirafiori plant, now also host to the Fiat and Lancia historic car collection. The Ypsilon comes in Ibrida and Elettrica forms, and I’ve chosen the Elettrica, it being Lancia’s electric car. The former uses a 99bhp mild-hybrid 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol triple, the latter a 154bhp motor and a 51kWh battery. Those specs feel very familiar because they are, from the many small cars based on Stellantis’s e-CMP platform. The Ypsilon Elettrica drives virtually indistinguishably from a Peugeot 208 or Vauxhall Corsa EV, then. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Those cars have sold extremely well and the finer points of ride and handling aren’t priorities for many buyers in this market. The Ypsilon is smooth, comfortable and refined on the autostrada, and in town it has a healthy reserve of power and it will round corners sharply. And if that really isn’t enough for you, exciting news: there’s a rally-inspired HF version coming. What really sets everyday cars apart, prices aside, is design. The reason one person falls in love with the Jeep Avenger may well be why another orders an Alfa Romeo Junior instead, despite their identical specs. Lancia has always been a design brand and, in this coming era of increasing mechanical and technical similarity, going all in on that appears to be an ideal strategy. “Many people came expressly to ask me to work for Lancia. There was passion in their eyes, and when I told them about the possible plans for the rebirth of this glorious brand, they lit up,” creative chief Jean-Pierre Ploué (designer of such favourites as the Mk1 Renault Twingo, Citroën C6 and DS 3) recently told Italian publication Auto \u0026 Design. Of the four design pillars his Turin studio team defined, ‘meaningful’ perhaps isn’t the easiest to identify in the Ypsilon, but ‘iconic’ I can see in the Stratos-inspired tail-lights and, while ‘consistent’ and ‘eclectic’ might seem to clash, the exterior sparks interest in its many details – most unusually the, erm, Y-front – without becoming a hotchpotch. Same inside, where unusual details abound: knurled gold air-vent adjusters, slices of wood, an art deco dashboard pattern and a table atop the centre console – whose round shape is replicated in the doors and ‘Sala Hub’ behind the touchscreen (short for Sound Air Light Augmentation and meant to simplify the digital experience, apparently). And then there are the rust-coloured, boiserie-patterned velvet seats – simply fabulous. The Ypsilon’s official range is 250 miles, so I expect to finish the 160-mile drive to my hotel in Turin with plenty in reserve, but the number on the display plunges alarmingly as I cruise at 80mph, such that I have to rise early the next morning to get a big charge. Thankfully, Zap-Map reveals that there are many chargers in this industrial city, and the Plentitude network (run by Italian oil giant Eni) offers both an easy app sign-up process and a slick-looking ‘CCS Hypercharger’. The rate races to 89kW (the Ypsilon’s limit is 100kW) and all is well – until suddenly it isn’t. The charging process terminates halfway for no obvious reason and fails to restart. Then the car bongs loudly and says: “Electric traction system failure: stop the vehicle, see user manual.” Ah. There’s work to be done then, and the technicians tell me later they could find no fault with the car. When I visit the FCA Heritage Hub, the guide suggests some Italians aren’t too hot on the Ypsilon either, unconvinced by the design and annoyed that it’s built in Spain. It’s evident that rebuilding Lancia is going to be difficult in many ways – but when you see the history the brand has and the passion it still evokes, you realise why it’s an effort worth making.",

    "title": "Super-budget superminis of the Eastern Bloc face off",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/super-budget-superminis-eastern-bloc-face",
    "description": "We tested three 'cheaps from the old Bloc' in November 1990… We go back to the 1990s and re-discover which budget Soviet brand was the best Europe was changing. We'd experienced the revolutionary Autumn of Nations in 1989, which began in Poland and soon spread like wildfire behind the Iron Curtain. By the end of that year, democracy had returned to Czechoslovakia. Just a year later, the very linchpin of communism, the Soviet Union, fell apart. And Yugoslavia was soon to follow, violently disintegrating into several Balkan states from 1992.  And so, unbeknownst to Autocar's testers, our November 1990 test of the three superminis representing these countries (or 'cheaps from the old Bloc', as we put it) was, in a way, the last hurrah for commie cars — loved and maligned as they had been by the British public for the previous decades. Those three cars were the Skoda Favorit 136LX (£5446), the Lada Samara 1300SL (£5549) and the Yugo Sana 1.4 (£5495). Each was front-engined and front-wheel drive and the result of their overseers' swallowing of national pride. Italians and Germans had helped Skoda; Brits had done work for Lada; and Italians had assisted Yugo. Which was the best bet? \"None of these cars will be bought for its performance,\" we said, \"but all will provide adequate mobility for the family and none can be considered underpowered. \"As expected, the Yugo, with a Fiat Tipo 70bhp 1.4-litre engine, has the legs on the others. It will buzz and thrash its way to 97mph, passing 60mph in 13.2sec and managing 30-70mph in 14.1sec. Quite why the engine feels and sounds so gruff in this installation is a mystery. \"The Lada isn't far behind. The Soviet's 65bhp 1.3-litre iron/alloy engine, with siamesed valves in a non-crossflow cylinder head, doesn't savour revving. Only the cloth-eared will extract all of the available performance. It runs out of puff at 93mph, reaches 60mph in 13.4sec and records a 30-70mph time of 15.6sec. \"The Skoda, with the least powerful, 62bhp all-alloy engine, will hit 92mph, pulls lustily past 60mph in 14.3sec and keeps the driver waiting for 15.7sec during the 30-70mph increment. It makes up for its less spritely performance by having by far the most responsive, eager engine. \"The Lada is a stable and unfussed motorway cruiser — probably this car's best feature — while the Yugo trundles along at a respectable pace, but with more engine noise intrusion than can reasonably be expected and an accompanying chatter of creaks and rattles from poorly fitted interior trim items. \"The Lada's brakes are, by far, the least effective of the bunch. Travel is long and a continuous push would have the pedal go all the way down to the carpet. Stopping power was weak and, if stamped on hard, there was evidence of premature rear wheel lock-up.\" The Skoda also came to the fore in terms ride and handling: \"By any standards of the popular hatch market,\" we continued, \"it's well suspended, reasonably composed and able to soak up most that's thrown at it. But it does suffer from slightly insipid damping which can sometimes be felt at the most unexpected times: for instance, during motorway cruising. The Lada lacks composure, as does the Yugo. \"The Lada jolts in and out of ruts and ridges, sometimes sending quite severe shocks through the bodyshell. It likes things to be smooth, and provided nothing upsets the suspension mid-corner, it shows a safe, progressive, understeering stance. \"The Yugo takes unresponsive steering to a new low in this company. On home-produced tyres, its steering is unacceptably heavy at parking speeds, and though less effort is required as speed increases, it remains decidedly dead and stodgy. The ride is lively and uncoordinated, larger shocks being heard (and felt) as they are fed through the bodyshell. The Yugo is a dogged and determined understeerer. Its dynamic responses are a throwback to the dark, early days of front-wheel-drive chassis behaviour.  \"Driven in convoy over a variety of tight and twisty Cornish roads, it was the Favorit that won the testers over. The Skoda felt good to drive, with prompt turn-in and a sure-footed stance through corners, whereas the others were harder work on the arms and less precise in road positioning.\" Much is made of interior material quality these days, with the words 'squidgy', 'soft-touch' and 'plush' appearing all too often. These three cars would positively horrify today's testers. We wrote: \"Only the Yugo is provided with a soft-touch wheel of pleasing proportions and thick enough rim. The Skoda's semi-soft wheel is thin and insubstantial, while the Lada's larger-diameter wheel is spindly and poorly finished. The Sana comes closest to an optimum seat-wheel-pedals relationship. \"The Yugo's facia is also, at first sight, the most appealing, with a reasonable standard of finish, a plethora of ventilation nozzles and a comprehensively packed instrument binnacle. In practice, it works less effectively. The gearchange is mounted too far forward and suffers from an ill-defined gate and over-long throw. \"In terms of ambience, the Skoda comes next. Its facia looks integrated; again, there are sufficient ventilation outlets (though output is poor) and an acceptably designed instrument binnacle. A large analogue clock dominates the display where a rev counter would be better employed. Insubstantial stalks control the usual functions. The gearchange deserves praise (in this company), though, for its fast and smooth operation. \"The Lada is the least appealing. The front seats are set too low and the seat-wheel relationship is poor. The driver's environment is dominated by the wheel and a tacky-looking instrument pod with voltmeter and economy vacuum gauges included. Flimsy stalks correspond to the European norm. Other switchgear appears on a centre console that has the appearance of an afterthought. The gearchange is a stretch too far away, and the long throws require some delicacy.\"  Okay, prospective buyers would say, I expected that. But how about practical applications? After all, these cars would mostly serve as family transport, be that primary or secondary.  Well, we continued: \"The Yugo provides the most comfort and space. The car's size means that it can be considered genuine five-seater. The front seats are well bolstered and sufficiently supportive, but the rear bench, complete with centre armrest, is less generously padded and set too low for full squab support. It also features static rear seatbelts — an unwelcome throwback. Rear head and leg room is plentiful. Lifting the rear hatch reveals a usefully low sill and a deep load area, compromised in width by suspension turret intrusion. \"The Skoda's front seats score barely average marks for comfort and are lacking in lumbar support. Although a few inches more compact than the Yugo, the Favorit's rear bench seat, with integral head restraints, is surprisingly comfortable and offers plenty of knee room, although three adults abreast is a squeeze. The rear hatch opens usefully low, but the load area is again compromised by rear suspension intrusion, and the door aperture by the rear lamp clusters. \"The Lada is the longest of the three cars by three inches, but it doesn't make best use of the available space. The front seats are extremely poor. They are too low, meanly padded and bereft of lateral location. Headrests are intrusive and the seat covering material was already looking grubby, despite our test car's low mileage. Rear seating is spartan but acceptably comfortable. Opening the rear hatch reveals a high sill, which partly negates the very purpose of a hatchback. The load area is usefully large, but again with some turret intrusion.\" Overall build quality was as shoddy as parts of the cars' designs. The article went on: \"The Yugo has distortions and rippling of its main panels. Inside, it suffers from poor assembly. The facia is prone to scuttle-shake tremors, giving rise to many creaks and rattles. A one-piece headlining panel wobbles disconcertingly. The overall impression is that it was lashed together against the clock. \"Fair to middling would summarise the Skoda's exterior, while inside scrappy, sharp-edged door bins do little to enhance quality and the facia of the test car vibrated in sympathy with an out-of-balance wheel. Money has been spent in curious ways. The glovebox, for no logical reason, is 'assisted' by a miniature gas strut. \"'Must try harder' is the only message for the Lada's finish. The paintwork of the test car appeared to vary substantially in thickness of application and the orange peel effect was, in places, of mountainous proportions. An impression of having been chucked out of the factory without any quality control inspection was exacerbated by side decals that were a peeling mass of air-bubbles.\"  The big redeemer, however, was the standard equipment, which was much better than that of any base-line Western European economy car. The Skoda came with alloy wheels, a radio/cassette player, a top-class toolkit and a \"beautifully made\" removable torch. The Lada had a heated rear window and rear wash/wipe, plus a less impressive toolkit and a tyre pump. The Yugo also boasted most of these convenience items, but a stereo was extra, as it was on the Lada.  There was a clear winner in the test, and perhaps unsurprisingly it was the brand that nowadays makes some brilliant cars and as a result is hugely successful. Despite Skoda being the butt of many jokes back then, we believed the Favorit did not deserve any such reputation. It was well above its two rivals and could be compared with any opposition, irrespective of nationality. We said: \"It rides and handles well, turns in to corners eagerly and functions as a complete package without quirks. It is comprehensively equipped and looks like it should stand the test of time. It is well developed and can even be fun to drive. It offers masses of features for the money, and underneath the obvious value-for-money image, it is a thoroughly engineered car with a pleasing, willing nature.\" Lada is now mostly restricted to Russia and surrounding countries. We could have predicted that, having tested the Samara. \"Tough and durable for a trip over the Urals it may be,\" we said, \"but the fit and finish for the UK market can only be described as dismal. If that isn't bad enough, the operation of the brakes leaves much to be desired.\" As for the Yugo, we commented: \"It feels flimsy and is shoddily put together in the most obvious areas. It could also benefit from a comprehensive ride and handling development programme. It might be streets ahead in the showroom stakes, but not on the road.\" Its maker, Zastava, never really rose above such cars and went bankrupt 10 years ago.",

    "description": "Ever since it came out back in 2011, the erstwhile Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX has been one of the most well-rounded sport touring packages. Fast forward to 2025, and while this breed is sadly all but extinct, Kawasaki has determinedly stuck to its guns and brought out the new Ninja 1100SX. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX changes for 2025 Most of the changes have happened under the largely familiar skin Kawasaki has chosen to focus only on updating the internals, and the main change comes in the form of this new 1,099cc four-cylinder motor, which was birthed by stroking out the erstwhile 1,043cc powerplant by an additional 3mm. However, since this engine complies with Euro 5+ norms, peak output figures are slightly different. Save for the new paint and graphics, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the older 1000. With 136 ponies on tap, the 1100 is down 6hp compared to the 1000, although with 113Nm of torque available, it does have 2Nm more. And since this is a sensible sport tourer and not a headbanging supersport, Kawasaki has wisely given this mill taller 5th and 6th gear ratios. However, to ensure acceleration is not humdrum, the final drive gearing is slightly shorter, courtesy of the one-tooth-larger rear sprocket.  The TFT display is crisp and the UI is uncomplicated. Other changes include an improved, butter-smooth bidirectional quickshifter (which works literally from just above idle!), a 10mm-larger rear disc brake (which should come in handy because this bike will likely be ridden with luggage and/or a pillion), and a USB-C charger near the left-hand switch cube.  Charging port's housing could have been executed in a neater, sleeker manner. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX performance, ride comfort It is both supremely comfortable and blazingly fast As evident from these pictures, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the 1000, save for the stealthy black paint job and green graphics. This is the only colour you can buy it in, as the green paint is currently exclusive to the higher SE variant, which is not sold here. Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. All of the above-mentioned changes aren’t very drastic, and the impact they’ve had on the riding experience isn’t landmark either. But who’s complaining about that? The Ninja 1000SX was a smooth, comfortable, and polished sport tourer to begin with, and this 1100 carries forward all its strong points (save for one, which we’ll address later). It can be both blazingly quick and amazingly mellow when needed. Over the 750-odd kilometres I clocked on the Ninja, never once did I miss the six ponies it has relinquished to Euro5+ (unlike those pesky spec-sheet warriors). There’s no other way to say this – 136hp is a LOT of power. And since the midrange has been bolstered, in the 3,000-7,000rpm zone, you could argue that this is a more effortlessly quick bike than before. On that topic, you’d better have your wits about you before whacking the throttle open because the Ninja will catapult you toward the horizon with surprisingly calm yet undeniable ferocity. All the while, the motor was belting out a smooth inline-four scream, but what I enjoyed more was the intake howl every time I twisted the accelerator. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX handling Given the right inputs, this 238kg bike can handle very well And even in the city, the Ninja 1100 is perfectly composed, and you can just as easily commute as you can travel from Mumbai to Manali on it. The only trouble within city limits is that the mirrors stick out a little too much, and even for 5’11 me, reaching them in my natural riding position isn’t possible. The 135mm of ground clearance available is on the lower side, but you can make do if you exercise a little caution. Wide-set mirrors demand caution when filtering. But can this Ninja slice through a corner properly? 238kg is a lot, let’s make no bones about it, but once you adapt your riding style to the Ninja’s heft, you’ll be able to go just as fast as your friend who’s on the ZX-10R (on the road, at least) without any of the agony of having to sit like a gargoyle. So, is this the perfect road-going superbike for India? In a word, yes. It’s tantalisingly fast, fabulously comfortable, and superbly capable. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX price and verdict Its an accomplished machine but its no longer the VFM big-bike it once was The only caveat is that, at Rs 13.49 lakh, the big Ninja is no longer the VFM big-bike proposition it once was. Not long ago, the BS4 ZX6R and the 1000SX were priced almost on par. Today, the price difference between the BS6 ZX6R and the 1100SX is nearly Rs 2 lakh! Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. The fact remains that this is still a wonderfully sweet and capable machine (and the only one of its kind in this class), so if your pocket permits, I’d recommend you make a trip to your nearest Kawasaki showroom. I know I would if I could. Also See: Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX video review",

    "description": "You are probably already familiar with the Suzuki Access 125 because it is a common sight on our roads. Ever since its launch in India in 2007, the Access has been an extremely popular choice in the 125cc scooter category because it offers a practical, efficient and ultra-reliable scooter experience combined with zippy performance for a decent price. In nearly two decades, this is only the second major update the Access has received. So, what has Suzuki changed? Catering to this end of the Indian scooter market is tricky because traditional consumers identify with the established body style that is prevalent, but, at the same time, the company needs to keep its product fresh against its rivals. Which is why Suzuki has not strayed very far from the previous Access’ design ethos. The underseat storage space has grown by 2.6 litres to 24.4 litres. Park the old and new scooters side by side, and the 2025 model looks just new enough to differentiate itself but not so much that the average consumer will mistake it for anything else. We think the Access manages to cut a pleasing figure with its neo-retro aesthetic, and this shade of sea green only helps things further. It has two front cubbies now, but their opening is rather narrow. While not much is new in terms of features and technology, the 2025 Access has improved upon its predecessor in the storage capacity. The boot measures 24.4 litres (up from 21.8), and this scooter now has two slim cubbies on the front apron. Do bear in mind that these cubbies have a rather slender opening, and you cannot fit a 1-litre water bottle like you could in the previous scooter’s single cubby.   The Suzuki Access is very much a family scooter, but unlike most of its rivals, it never feels dull to ride. And its fun character doesn’t come at the expense of any sacrifice in practicality or handling. True to its family-scooter roots, the Access has a plush suspension setup, which never feels out of sorts unless you turn up the wick to the point where seldom any staid rider will venture. Neutral ergos, a spacious seat and balanced suspension keep you comfy. For 2025, Suzuki has given the Access a new frame and heavily reworked the engine – we will address the chassis first and the motor a little later. To be perfectly frank, ride this 2025 model and a previous-gen scooter back to back, and you will be hard-pressed to tell the difference – we actually did just that, so you can take our word for it. That’s really no bad thing because the 106kg Access feels light in traffic (despite its weight having gone up by 2 kilos) and is manageable for riders of all sizes, both attributes expected of a family scooter. Seat has grown slightly longer, and cushioning is on the firmer side. However, for all that has changed, we would have liked to see a 12-inch rear wheel on the Access with this update. Because it still rides on an archaic 10-inch unit (just like it did way back in 2007), at higher speeds and while going through turns, the Access doesn’t feel as stable as its Indian rivals that use 12-inch wheels at both ends (think TVS Jupiter 125 and Hero Destini 125).   That small gripe aside, we are happy to report that the Access retains its zippy, playful demeanour. And a big part of that is down to the tried and tested 124cc engine. This mill is energetic right from the get-go. Even if you’re holding a steady 70kph on the highway, if you open the throttle, there’s still enough left in reserve to manage a reasonably quick and effortless overtaking. Heavily revised engine retains its pep and turbine-smooth character. By and large, Japanese engines are known to have two major USPs: refinement and reliability. As for the former, the most vibration is actually felt only when you are at a standstill, as is typical for scooters. It disappears as soon as you get moving. In fact, it is so smooth that even at an indicated 90kph, there is absolutely no buzz either in the floorboard or the handlebar. Disc brake is reserved for the top two variants and has sufficient bite. In our tests, the new Access was quicker than the BS6 version in roll-on acceleration as well as the sprint to 80kph, which is impressive considering it is a little heavier now and has to comply with stricter emissions norms. Moreover, along with its energetic performance, the Access continues to have great fuel efficiency. In fact, these numbers could have been even better if the Access had start/stop tech like the Burgman, but you can’t opt for that feature here.   The 2025 Access has stuck to the same formula as its predecessor but with minor refinements all across. While it doesn’t have any one standout feature, it blends frugality, practicality and comfort with a dash of zippiness wonderfully. Another important factor to consider is that Suzukis are generally light on the pocket to purchase as well as run, which now brings us to the price. Round chrome mirrors look nice, but the field of view isn’t the best. With prices ranging from Rs 81,700 to Rs 93,300, the new Access is Rs 1,000-1,500 more expensive than the outgoing model. It is also nearly on par with competitors in pricing. The aforementioned factors are why the Access has achieved such widespread success. Even today, if you’re in the market for a new 125cc scooter, the Access remains a really compelling option. Also See: 2025 Suzuki Access video review",

Most bikes ship from the factory with unsightly lights and turn signals, and swapping those out is a quick way to tighten up your bike’s overall look. My 2012-model Triumph Bonneville SE is by no means a full-blown custom build. Instead, I’ve modified it bit by bit whenever the opportunity arises. The latest round of tweaks involved installing a new LED headlight and teeny tiny turn signals, supplied by Australia’s Purpose Built Moto.

So they know the Triumph Bonneville inside out—and they know how to transform it into just about anything. Tamarit Motorcycles has used this experience to build a stacked catalog of bolt-on Triumph parts and a handful of made-to-order customs. But what they relish most are the opportunities to build one-off specials, like this vivid Triumph Bonneville scrambler. Numbered 142 and nicknamed ‘Bull Ring,’ the 2006-model carbureted Triumph Bonneville was commissioned by a returning client.

    "description": "We’ve had the Skoda Kodiaq in India before, but never the sporty RS version. That, however, is set to change with the arrival of the second-generation model. The regular Kodiaq will launch here in the April quarter, and the RS version will likely arrive by October, but unlike the regular Kodiaq, the RS will come in as a CBU import, meaning it will be pricey. Skoda Kodiaq RS exterior design and engineering (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq is less SUV-like than before, but you won’t mistake it for an estate. Segmented grille DRL is exclusive to the RS version. The Skoda Kodiaq – named after the Kodiak bear – was first unveiled in 2016, with the second generation coming in late 2023. It’s built on the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform, a derivative of the previous car’s MQB platform. The new car has grown 60mm longer but is about 10mm lower, giving it a more elongated stance. But while it is less SUV-like than before, you won’t mistake it for an estate. The RS version stands out with a blacked-out grille, lower bumper air intakes and a cool-looking segmented DRL that runs between the grille’s slats and extends into the headlight daytime running lamps (DRLs). Like the standard car, the headlamps are split LED Matrix units. Kodiaq RS comes with exclusive 20-inch alloy wheels Alloys are designed with aero efficiency in mind. Exclusive to the RS are two 20-inch alloy wheel designs with red brake calipers, black cladding around the wheels, and black accents on the lower sill, wing mirrors and the B, C and D pillars. At the rear, the tail-lights have a cool split and mirrored look, the lower half extending into a reflector bar across the boot lid, with Skoda’s lettermark replacing the logo. The rear windshield is topped by a deep spoiler and flanked by fins that are finished in black. Skoda says these aid airflow around the car, helping reduce the drag coefficient of the new-gen Kodiaq from 0.31 to 0.28. Skoda Kodiaq RS interior space and comfort (rating 8.5/10) Interior space is plenty and its comfortable too inside the Skoda Kodiaq RS There’s loads of space all around; the rear legroom and headroom are impressive. The inside is an all-black affair, from the headliner to the carpets. You can choose between suede or leather trim on the sports seats, dashboard, door pads and centre armrest, but only in one colour – black. And what really sets it off is the lively contrast from the red stitching all around the cabin. The 3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in perforated leather looks neat, with RS badging at the bottom. It’s nice to hold and has the familiar and easy-to-use scroll wheels. Skoda has put the extra length to good use. There’s ample headroom at the front and rear, and even with the front seats set rearward for taller passengers, second-row occupants will have plenty of legroom. This can be adjusted further, given that the second row slides and reclines. Like the previous car, the new Kodiaq can also be had as a 7-seater, with the third row stowing away neatly in the boot floor. Our car was the 5-seat variant, so we’ll reserve judgement on the third row, but the boot space is enormous. Without the third row, boot space is a massive 910 litres, and even with it in place, there’s 340 litres. There’s also a spare tyre and a space for the cargo cover beneath the floor. Most of my time was spent driving, but having inspected the second row, it seemed comfy enough despite the 40:20:40 split, which sometimes tends to make the individual seats too small. The front sports seats on the RS are really nice, and the bolstering held me nicely in place during some spirited driving in the hills. Skoda Kodiaq RS performance and refinement (rating 7.5/10) The Kodiaq RS is not firecracker quick but it’s just enough to justify an RS badge 2.0 TSI is a happy cruiser and can deliver strong acceleration, but you can feel it working hard. The Kodiaq RS packs the VW Group’s familiar 2.0-litre TSI engine. This unit also powers the regular Kodiaq, but under the hood of the RS, the output is bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm. Incidentally, the power is identical to the Octavia RS, which has the same engine, but the torque is 30Nm more here. The output is enough to propel the Kodiaq RS’ 1.8-tonne mass from 0-100kph in 6.3 seconds, which is plenty quick for what is also a genuine family SUV. Drive it sedately, and the Kodiaq RS is happy to cruise steadily all day with the engine nicely relaxed. And, should you need a quick overtake, mashing the throttle will drop a few gears, giving you momentum quickly enough. The 7-speed DSG gearbox did trip up occasionally while trundling through some low-speed traffic. In Sport mode, the shifts are quick, and the engine is kept nicely on the boil, so overtaking at any point is very quick and easy. Engine is aurally enhanced with artificial soundtrack The engine note does sound nice, but it’s enhanced with what Skoda calls Dynamic Sound Boost, which augments the car’s real exhaust note with an artificial soundtrack. Skoda Kodiaq RS mileage (rating 6/10) The Skoda Kodiaq RS fuel efficiency will not be very high, expect a single digit range only. We didn’t get to test the mileage of the Kodiaq RS in Croatia but given the engine’s output, the car's 1.8-tonne weight, and the fact that you can feel and even hear the engine working hard, don’t expect fuel efficiency to be impressive at all. Skoda Kodiaq RS ride comfort and handling (rating 7.5/10) In comfort mode, there is some float, but in all other areas ride and handling is good in the Kodiaq RS The body does roll in corners, but Sport mode tidies that up nicely. Putting down the RS’ power is an 4x4 driveline with impressive grip. We had some snowy weather, and driving to a mountain ski resort over wet roads, I always felt confident and was able to maintain a good pace. The RS has adaptive dampers, and in Sport mode, they do a good job of keeping body roll in check. What’s nice is that the ride does not get lumpy. In fact, I found myself using the firmer damper setting even on highway stretches, as in Comfort mode, there’s some body float over undulating surfaces and lean in corners. There’s a variable-rack steering, which adjusts the ratio for less steering input around bends. These systems often corrupt the feel, but that’s not the case here, with Kodiaq RS’ steering providing enough weight and precision. Skoda Kodiaq RS features and safety (rating 8.5/10) You can expect the Kodiaq RS to be well-equipped The all-black interior looks sporty, and vibrant red stitching is plenty but not overdone. The touchscreen is a new 13-inch unit that’s slick to use. Equipment-wise, there are all the expected bits, including 3-zone climate control, a 10-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel and a free-standing 10-inch infotainment screen or an optional 13-inch unit like we had on our test car. India-spec model should come with sunroof What was not on our test car was a sunroof, but given the popularity here, expect the India model to get one. Being a Skoda, the Kodiaq packs in a lot of ‘Simply Clever’ bits, like specific storage spots for the key fob and phones and even a handy little duster to wipe the touchscreen clean. You can expect the India-spec car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. Skoda Kodiaq RS price and verdict (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq RS isn’t a wild child, it’s a family SUV with a nice sporty side to it. If everything goes according to plan, Skoda says we can expect the Kodiaq RS in India by October, and, importantly, local manufacturing is a possibility later on. So, while its everyday sibling could be competitively priced, the RS will most definitely not be, as it will come in as a CBU for now. Expect an asking price of around Rs 60 lakh, which is wading into traditional luxury-brand territory, and for some, that would seem like a lot of money for a Skoda. But the Kodiaq RS does a lot to entice you to look past all that. There’s a massive amount of space all around and the option of three rows of seats. It’s comfortable and rides well, and you can expect the India car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. So, it’s got ‘family SUV’ off pat. But what about the sporty side that the RS badge promises? It’s not light and nimble for sure, but it’s plenty quick in a straight line, and the 4x4 drivetrain gives you ample grip in corners. Plus, the engine sounds fun. So, for that money, then, there really is nothing quite like it.

    "description": "If there’s a model that symbolises ‘age is just a number’, it’s the Volvo XC90. Now in its tenth year, the broad-shouldered Swede has managed to disguise its vintage rather well. Subtle tweaks over the years have helped, but this 2025 update is a clear ‘facelift’ in the truer sense. 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift exterior design and engineering   Revised grille and headlights help refresh styling Most of the design updates can be seen on the leading end of the XC90 facelift. Styling sees a refresh with most of the changes concentrated up front. The focal point is the flatter and wider grille with Volvo’s iron mark logo now flanked by slanted streaks. Slim new headlights (still home to the Thor’s hammer LED light signature) flow out of the grille, and there’s a tidied-up bumper section with fewer but more pronounced lines. In profile, though, the new look 20-inch wheels are your only giveaway of this being the 2025 model. Tail-end styling, too, has just been breathed upon with redone tail-lights. Still, you’ll like what you see. The XC90 is clean-cut and traditionally upright in its stance, and many will like it for just that. 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift interior space and comfort Cabin is plush and feels airy. Third row useable too but access is poor Middle seat set a touch low. Space is great. Middle-seat passengers will like the space on offer but could find the seat slightly low-set. The XC90 retains a third row of seats as a USP. Unfortunately, access to them remains awkward via a small passage between the door aperture and the middle-row seat. What’s nice is that there’s usable space aft of the third row for soft bags, and should you need more room, rows two and three can be folded flat to form a huge load bed. 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift features and safety   Larger 11.2-inch touchscreen is big feature update The 11.2-inch touchscreen takes centre stage on redone dash. More has changed on the inside. The dashboard has been redone with more horizontal surfaces and larger AC vents, but it’s the larger 11.2-inch touchscreen that your eyes will lock on to. The new screen is vertically oriented like the older 9-inch unit was, but its larger size makes it almost look like an iPad tacked on to the dash. Infotainment system powered by brand-new software The unit runs a new-gen Android system and features large tiles to give quick access to oft-used functions. It does require a shorter learning curve than say, a BMW system, but more physical shortcuts for the climate control system would be welcome. Also, the need to plug in a phone to use Apple CarPlay is not very 2025. XC90 facelift comes with loaded feature list The XC90 does pack in much else too. There’s generous use of Nappa leather, digital dials (it’s limited to just two layouts), heads-up display, four-zone climate control, an onboard air purifier, a crisp 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, and a sensational 19-speaker Bowers and Wilkins audio system. The shapely front seats offer great support and the experience is upped with ventilation and massage functions that are standard for India. The safety suite includes a laundry list of features, including radar and camera-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift performance and refinement 2-litre turbo-petrol engine delivers 250hp and 360Nm It’s brisk, but you can tell the 2.0-litre engine is working hard. As before, India gets the XC90 with the ‘B5’ powertrain. That’s Volvo-speak for a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, turbocharged petrol unit with support from a 48V mild-hybrid system. Peak power is 250hp and max torque is 360Nm. The engine delivers sufficient go for average city driving and highway duties, and the 7.94 second 0-100kph time isn’t shabby either. Thing is, the Volvo simply doesn’t offer the reserve of power that rivals’ (think BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE, and Audi Q7) 3.0-litre six-cylinder petrol units do. You can sense the Volvo’s engine working harder, and you hear more of it as well. The eight-speed auto gearbox is also not the smoothest around. 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift ride comfort and handling Suspension feels firm for our roads. There’s more road noise than warranted too.  The Volvo also trails rivals in how effectively it cocoons you from the outside world. There’s more road noise, and there’s a firmness to the air suspension that comes through on anything less than perfectly paved surfaces. Suspension and steering modes help fine-tune the experience but don’t manage to transform the XC90 into the sportiest or comfiest of the large SUVs. 2025 Volvo XC90 facelift price and verdict Pricing at par with larger-hearted rivals hurts XC90’s case The XC90 facelift carries a Rs 1.03 crore asking price. Priced at Rs 1.03 crore (ex-showroom), the XC90 is pricier than some rivals. Buyers who associate a big SUV with big power will not find the right match in the XC90, whose engine remains a chink in its armour. However, buyers not hung up on power might see the Volvo in a different light. After all, the XC90’s strong design, inviting interior and long list of features, do tick many of the other boxes of interest.

    "description": "While Tesla is still strategizing its India entry and looking for tariff reliefs, the Model Y facelift which was unveiled in January this year has recently been spotted testing on our roads. The company has already initiated homologation for the Model Y in India, along with the Model 3, which means these are likely be the first models to go on sale here. The sighting of the facelifted car suggests that the Model Y will indeed be offered in its latest iteration. Tesla Model Y gets up to 719km of range (CLTC cycle) Is available in two variants: RWD and Long Range AWD Tesla India first showroom location finalised in Mumbai Tesla Model Y facelift spotted testing Facelifted model improves aero-efficiency and range Although the test mule is well covered in camouflage, a look at the car’s front and rear lighting signatures is enough to suggest that this is facelifted model. The January 2025 update brought a new split headlamp arrangement with new full-width LED light signatures at the front and rear, and it was made more aero-efficient, too. On the inside, the Model Y’s rather minimalistic interior is dominated by a central 15.4-inch touchscreen, and the rear passengers also get an 8.0-inch touchscreen. The Tesla Model Y is available in two variants: RWD and Long-Range AWD. The former has a claimed range of 719km, while the latter returns 662km on a single charge, both as per the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC). Tesla claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.3 seconds for the AWD car, while the single-motor RWD model does it in 5.9 seconds. Tesla’s India entry: what’s the progress? Looking for local partner for manufacturing The company has already secured a Mumbai showroom on a 5-year lease, and is scouting for a location is Delhi as well. Tesla India Motor \u0026 Energy, Tesla's Indian subsidiary, has also begun hiring across customer support, sales and product development roles. While Tesla plans to bring its first models as CBUs (completely built units), the company is exploring contract manufacturing instead of setting up a greenfield plant immediately. When it comes to retail, the company’s approach would remain direct-to-consumer, with fully owned retail operations and a Supercharger network, too. Tesla’s ongoing challenges Entry into India is very crucial for Tesla because the company is struggling in its existing key markets. Demand has stagnated in Europe and interest in the US is lukewarm, too, thanks to Musk’s right-wing politics. Plus, there’s severe competition in China from carmakers like BYD and Xiaomi. It is, therefore, imperative for Tesla to get its India strategy right, and the key to cracking this market will, of course, be the pricing.

    "description": "F1’s new cooling vest made a rather inconspicuous race debut at last weekend’s Bahrain GP, with Mercedes’ George Russell having used it during the race. However, Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton has expressed scepticism about the device, stating that he would “avoid it”. Cooling vest not mandatory for 2025 season System introduced to avoid repeat of 2023 Qatar GP F1 cooling vest: How does it work? The cooling vest incorporates 50 metres of tubes through which cooled fluid is circulated. The FIA had originally planned to make its use mandatory when ambient temperatures cross 30.5C, in a bid to avoid a repeat of the 2023 Qatar GP where several drivers were affected by the extreme heat. Logan Sargeant had to withdraw from the race after suffering a heatstroke, while Lance Stroll even briefly passed out. However, the vest is still optional in 2025, with several drivers expressing concerns about the device being uncomfortable in the tight confines of the cockpit. Given the added weight that comes with wearing the vest, any drivers who opt to not use it need to carry an extra 5kg of ballast to avoid gaining any advantage. Russell used the cooling vest during Bahrain GP qualifying and race Hamilton appeared to be surprised when told that Russell used the vest during the Bahrain GP enroute to a second-place finish. “Oh really? I’d be surprised if he did, because you have to add five kilos to the car for it and no one else would,” Hamilton responded while speaking to media, including Autocar India, at the Saudi Arabian GP. It is understood that Mercedes was able to compensate for the added weight by adjusting the ballast that it normally uses. However, Hamilton has maintained that he’d much rather focus on preparing better before the race. “I’ve only had maybe two races in my career where it’s been like Malaysia. Our first year at Malaysia, the drinks machine didn’t work. So, I was just dehydrated at the end of the race. And Singapore last year was pretty brutal. But I love that,” the seven-time world champion said. “We’re supposed to be the highest of the highest in terms of athletes and it needs to be tough. If anything, the cars today are easier to drive than when I started in Formula 1 and they’re a lot heavier. I don’t want to use it if I can avoid it. For me, I want to look at how I can prepare better, how I can use the cooling vest before, how I can pre-cool my body, how to make sure I’m hydrated. That’s a part of the whole process.” Hamilton added, “I do understand that it’s tough and we don’t want drivers passing out when we go to Qatar, where I think [we had] one race that was extremely hot for the drivers, which I actually crashed out [of], so I didn’t get to do it. I think that it’s good that they’ve got the technology in there, but for me, it’s not what I want to see in my car.” Also see: F1 2025: Piastri takes commanding Bahrain GP win to join title fight",
