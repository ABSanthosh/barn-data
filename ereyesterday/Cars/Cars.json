    "description": "It’s hard not to get carried away when riding on mountain roads in Southern California. Maybe it's the crisp, cool high-altitude air that tricks you into feeling relaxed, even when the speeds are anything but. We certainly got carried away in the twisties during our first ride aboard the new Royal Enfield Bear 650, and it wasn’t entirely to do with that cool mountain air. Confused? Understandable. After all, why should a scrambler-ised version of the already hefty and not very sharp Interceptor be egging us on in the corners? Well, as it turns out, the Bear is much more than just a scrambler-ised Interceptor. Royal Enfield Bear 650: design, features Sure, many of the changes have been made with the intent of making the Bear better suited to off-roading. You’ve now got an upside-down fork (in place of the Interceptor’s conventional unit) offering more travel – up from 110mm to 130mm. It’s a similar story at the rear, too; the Bear sticks with a twin shock setup, but travel has grown from 88mm to 115mm. As a result, seat height and ground clearance have also increased, and now stand at 830mm and 184mm, respectively. But to accommodate the new suspension components and adapt the bike to its more off-road-focused role, Royal Enfield has had to strengthen the frame in multiple areas. It’s the same basic frame as the Interceptor, but it has now been braced in various areas to add strength and stiffness, and the sub-frame has been revised as well. The end result is a chassis that feels noticeably stiffer than the Interceptor’s. Attacking corners hard, the Bear does feels hinged in the middle, and the sort of mid-corner bumps that would have the Interceptor wobbling and wallowing all over the place are simply shrugged off. There’s great feedback and you really have the confidence to keep carrying more speed into a corner, and leaning further and further, despite the more off-road centric 19in/17in wheel on offer. This is also, in no small part, down to the excellent new tyres wrapped around those wheels – you’re unlikely to have heard of the MRF Nylorex tyres before and that’s because they’re a new dual-purpose model that have been developed specifically for this motorcycle. Despite the blocky pattern, the grip, profile and predictably on the road were superb, and there were no complaints when on tarmac. Part of the Bear’s playfulness in the twisties can also be attributed to the suspension setup. The front fork strikes a nice balance between comfort and performance, but the shocks feel rather firm and unforgiving. This was the case across riders of different weights, even at the minimum preload setting. On the largely excellent Californian tarmac, it wasn’t a deal-breaker, but the firm edge could be felt, and rough patches translated to my backside without sufficient mitigation. How this setup fares on the less than perfect roads back home is something we’ll have to find out in due course. Royal Enfield Bear 650: performance, ergonomics Many of the numbers are bigger with the new Bear, and while most of that is good, one big number that’s got some people a little apprehensive is the seat height. Yes, 830mm is definitely on the taller side – I’m not very tall, only 5’8”, which means I can’t flat-foot both feet. That said, it isn’t unmanageable either, and with a little bit of forward planning, you can comfortably pick either one side to flat-foot. It also helps that the footpegs are now a little further forward, so they don’t foul your shins as much. The other change to the riding position is the handlebar, which is wider and a little further away from you. The wider part is nice, it gives you more leverage over the bike, which I like. The further away part, I’m not such a fan of – it’s a bit more of a forward reach than I’d like, and if you’re short like me, then this could become a point of fatigue over long rides. On the upside, this is now a lighter motorcycle than the model it’s based on. Moving to this new 2-into-1 exhaust setup has helped shed a bunch of weight, though some of that has been added back through the suspension and the frame strengthening. Nevertheless, it is still 2kg lighter than the Interceptor. However, at 216kg, still a fairly hefty motorcycle. You only really feel this at low speeds and when paddling about, and once you’re on the move, the Bear masks its weight rather well. The new exhaust has done more than just trimming the weight – it’s also allowed RE to squeeze out some more torque from the motor; it now produces 56.5Nm vs the 52Nm we’ve seen from it so far. So the engine feels a little more punchy now, while still remaining the pleasant, fairly refined, characterful motor that we’ve fallen in love with over the last 6 years. The new exhaust has slightly changed the sound, though. It exits a little closer to you and doesn’t run quite as far back as the twin-pipe designs, which is one of the factors at play. Overall, it’s a little more braap-y and raspy, as opposed to the more sweet-sounding twin pipe 650s. I think this suits the character of the Bear rather well. Royal Enfield Bear 650: off-road performance Now, we come to the big question of off-road performance. We didn’t have a great deal of opportunity to ride the Bear off-road – we only got a short spin up and down a fairly simple gravel track. But the feeling is that this is definitely more of a soft-roader than a hardcore off-roader. The suspension can absorb some hits, up to a point, and these new tyres seem to work well off-road. The rear ABS can also be turned off. So yes, you can have some fun off-road. But the weight makes its presence felt, and the ergos are halfway between on-road and off-road, so this is not a bike you’d want to push very hard when the tarmac runs out. But you won’t have to turn around either. Turning off that rear ABS is done through a fully-digital TFT display –  this is the first Royal Enfield 650 to get one, and it’s the same unit you’ll find on the Himalayan. Which means, you also get features like Bluetooth connectivity and Google Maps integration. It’s also the first RE 650 to get full-LED lighting. The only other noteworthy feature is a USB charging port, but as is the case with all REs now, there is a comprehensive list of accessories that covers the usual suspects, like touring mirrors and a touring seat, as well as more scrambler-specific items like a sump guard and a headlight grille. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The final piece of the puzzle is the price – and starting at Rs 3.39 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and going up to Rs 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), the Bear sits between the Interceptor and GT on one end and the Shotgun and Super Meteor on the other. Having ridden it around California, it feels like the most versatile and competent RE 650 today. It can cruise, it can tour, it can commute, you can corner pretty hard – it’s a great road bike – and it’s got some off-road ability as well. But how much of a pain the firm suspension setup will be back home in India is something we’ll only be able to tell you a little further down the road. Test rides and deliveries begin on November 10, so it shouldn’t be too long before we find out. Also See: Royal Enfield Bear 650 video review",

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  Everest iconography shifted here from the spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular). But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-long-termer/mercedes-eqe-suv-long-term-review-11000km-report-433398#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "It was one of those perfect drives, a rare window of relative emptiness on India’s busiest highway. A mid-morning dash to the BU Bhandari showroom for the launch of the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 was the easiest Mumbai-Pune trip I’ve done in a long time. Making the drive particularly relaxing was the new addition to Autocar India’s fleet, the all-electric Mercedes EQE SUV, which got its first highway outing. It took just two hours and six minutes in the ultra-smooth (and quick) EQE SUV to go from the Autocar HQ to the BU Bhandari Showroom on the Pune bypass. That’s less than what many office folks take to get home on a typical working day in Mumbai. It does help that the AtalSetu has brought our office closer to the edge of Mumbai, and a 10:15am departure was a sweet spot (or time). The early-morning highway rush was over, the toll plazas had no long queues, and even the Lonavala Ghat, which is choked most of the day (and night) on Google Maps, was surprisingly ‘blue’. Traffic flowed without holdups, even on the steepest sections where trucks otherwise block all lanes while trying to ‘overtake’ at a crawl. Strong and smooth powertrain effortlessly gobbles miles. The Atal Setu is always a great place to try out the ADAS system on any car. The wide and perfectly marked lanes and the gentle curves on this 21km sea bridge were perfect for checking out the EQE SUV’s ‘Level 2’ ADAS capability. That meant letting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which I have set at 99kph (just below the 100kph speed limit), and the Lane Keep Assist do the work while I sat back and relaxed with just a light hand on the wheel, enjoying the harbour’s breathtaking views. The Lane Keep Assist worked brilliantly, keeping the big Merc centred nicely in the fast lane. When changing lanes, I was impressed with how the ACC reacted smoothly. When you signal and shift into the overtaking lane, the ACC provides strong and linear acceleration without abrupt power surges to match the new lane’s speed. Active Brake Assist activates at the slightest hint of an obstacle. While the ADAS in the Mercedes EQE SUV is highly advanced, it has some limitations, especially when dealing with erratic drivers who slice across lanes like it’s a normal thing to do. If some idiot abruptly cuts into your lane from a sharp angle, the ADAS can struggle to react promptly. This is not the case with just the EQE SUV – no ADAS is fully capable of handling such unpredictable events, which is a reminder of why the tech can only assist and not replace the driver. Mercedes’ Active Brake Assist, while a great safety feature on paper, can become a nuisance – and even a potential hazard – in Mumbai’s chaotic traffic. Designed for controlled environments, it doesn’t quite account for the unpredictability of pedestrians darting across roads or scooters weaving through tight gaps. The system often triggers unnecessarily, slamming on the brakes at the slightest hint of an obstacle. In such congested conditions, this overly sensitive response can be more dangerous than helpful. These fierce and abrupt stops are hugely unnerving for the passengers and could catch a driver behind you off guard, increasing the risk of rear-end collisions. It’s best to switch the Brake Assist off, which you have to do every time you start the car. The monsoons have made mincemeat of the Nhava Sheva road, which connects the Atal Setu to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and on such surfaces, the EQE SUV is out of its comfort zone. To be honest, it doesn’t quite live up to its SUV credentials and isn’t comfortable dropping in and out of potholes like its IC engine brethren. That’s because the softly sprung EQE SUV uses up its suspension travel quite easily, and deep ruts and craters crash through. In fact, it’s best to use ‘Sport’ drive mode as the default setting. The suspension feels overtly soft in Comfort and Normal modes, which is fine when you are crawling in rush hour, but up the pace a bit on even a slightly smooth road, and you’ll find the EQE SUV tends to wallow and feel floaty. In Sport mode, the suspension tightens nicely to give a more settled ride, which is what you want on the highway. Wallows at speed because of soft suspension. Two areas where the EQE SUV stands out are performance and range, and both are interlinked because, with great range, you can enjoy the performance without keeping an eye on the SOC meter. Plant your foot down, and this big and heavy SUV lunges forward with an intensity that can take you aback but in a very pleasing way. The EQE SUV gathers with velvet smoothness, and before you know it, you’ve sailed past the speed limit. On the Mumbai-Pune expressway, which is now infested with speed cameras, it is hard not to get a speeding ticket. To stay out of trouble, I limit my indulgence to short jabs of the accelerator pedal just to enjoy all the 408hp and 858Nm of torque that puts most IC engine SUVs to shame. I averaged 66kph on the 140km drive to BU Bhandari, which is pretty good if you consider that this included slow, non-expressway sections. Not that the expressway raises your average speed dramatically because with so many cameras staring at you, I’m forced to show a lot of restraint! With 332km range left, I didn’t need to use the Pune Mercedes dealers’ on-site 180kW fast charger, but it’s good to know that it’s there and that the dealership is happy to let non-Merc owners plug in as well. Located just off the Pune bypass, it’s an incredibly convenient place for EVs on a long-distance trip to Mahabaleshwar or beyond to quickly top up their batteries. Phenomenal range eliminates range anxiety. The return journey was equally uneventful. Using the regen down the Lonavala Ghat, I could extend the range even further, which, on this round trip, I calculated to be 504km. That is a truly impressive figure, considering how hard I was driving the EQE SUV. In fact, there was enough charge left in the battery (36 percent) for me to make another trip to Pune! The other area where the EQE SUV shines is refinement. The EQE SUV is not just quiet; it’s like being inside a luxury vault on wheels. The adaptive air suspension noiselessly glides over any surface, and then there’s the acoustic insulation, which Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Road, tyre and wind noises, even the electric motor’s faint whir, are gone. The cabin is like a calm oasis, and that’s what makes the EQE SUV special. It is luxury in its most serene form.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/business/its-pivotal-time-future-looking-ford-says-europe-boss-lisa-brankin",
    "description": "It has been a turbulent few years for the Blue Oval, but the brand is finally profitable in the UK Lisa Brankin took the top job at Ford of Britain in late 2020 just as the brand was about to execute plans to willingly give up a market-leading volume position for its car business in pursuit of the profitability that had always eluded it. While Brankin’s observation that “timing is everything, and I think probably my timing isn't as good as it could have been…” was said largely in relation to the industry-wide challenges faced at that time (Covid, the chips shortage), it’s just as apt for how difficult a job she was handed compared to her predecessors for Ford no longer being “obsessed over market leadership”. That road to “managing a profitable business overall” has led to a series of outwardly quite unpopular decisions, not just for Brankin being the bearer of bad news with the demise of the likes of the Fiesta, but in reducing the dealer network from above 300 to under 170 as a result of this shift away from such mass volume, a process that’s still ongoing.  She doesn’t “feel like I’ve been apologising so much” in her stint in the top job, but even so is determined to shift the narrative and says “things have changed” already in dealers and in the brand’s line-up. “You've heard a little bit of bad news from Ford: no more Fiesta, no more Mondeo, no more S-Max etc. But we're at a pivotal point now where we're turning a corner. We've got the newest passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle line-up that we've ever had. We're thinking about the future and not so much about the past.” While two new electric crossovers, the Explorer and Capri, are getting the headlines, the transformation is already well underway at Ford with the success of the Puma and Kuga crossovers. While Ford sales are down overall, the Puma is now Britain's best selling car, and the brand is finally profitable in the UK. Perhaps volume and profitability can mix. Brankin has not gone electric yet herself, her previous Mustang company car is followed by a run-out edition of the Focus ST. Her ultimate boss, Ford CEO Jim Farley, would love to hear that as an enthusiast himself. As for the level of Brankin’s interactions with Farley and Ford’s Dearbon HQ, she says with a smile that it “all depends how well we’re doing”. Much of the discussion at the moment will be on Brankin’s immediate priority of complying with the government’s ZEV mandate and its compulsion of a car maker having to have 22% of its new car registrations this year as EVs, immaterial of demand.",

    "title": "Official: Rotary Mazda sports car is planned for production",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-rotary-mazda-sports-car-planned-production",
    "description": "Rotary-electric powertrain is said to enable a classic sports coupé shape Mazda plans to build 370bhp, rotary-electric MX-5 successor \"in the not so distant future\" Mazda has confirmed plans to put its striking Iconic SP rotary-powered sports car concept into production in the near future. Revealed at last year’s Tokyo motor show, the Iconic SP is a tightly packaged, 370bhp vision of a future sports car in the vein of the MX-5, equipped with an innovative hybrid powertrain that uses a rotary engine to generate power for the EV motors that drive the wheels. At the car’s unveiling, bosses were tight-lipped on whether the concept would evolve directly into a production car, but now the firm’s design boss Masahi Nakayama has confirmed that the firm’s intention is to put the Iconic SP on the road. “This concept is not just one of those empty show cars. It’s been designed with real intent to turn it into a production model in the not-so-distant future,” he said, stopping short of giving a projected timeframe.  Naohito Saga from Mazda’s planning division added that the concept was designed with a keen eye on eventual homologation: ““In the development process, everything from position of the doors and tyres, to the length of the vehicle, the seating position of the occupants and visibility was meticulously researched before reaching the final specifications. “It really shows how much we wanted to make it a car that manifests Mazda’s commitment for the future, especially in terms of sustainability and the future role of our rotary engine technology.”   There is a strong indication, too, that the production version will use the same hybrid powertrain, with the firm hailing the scalability, compact size and synthetic fuel compatibility of its new rotary petrol engine.  Notably, the firm does already sell a rotary-electric car in the form of the MX-30 R-EV, which similarly drives on EV power but uses a petrol motor to charge its traction battery and extend range.  Mazda has long touted the potential benefits of synthetic fuels as a means of decarbonising combustion cars, holding back on transitioning its product line-up to pure-electric power. Saga said the ability to run the Iconic SP on sustainable fuels, including hydrogen, “could give us an edge in the race to find a feasible solution for the future of mobility”, with Mazda estimating that the concept’s powertrain has the potential to cut emissions by 90% compared to current petrol equivalents. The firm is also working on a system for capturing CO2 from exhaust emissions, which it says could “take Mazda one step further and see it evolve into a carbon-negative manufacturer”.   Mazda says a rotary range-extender powertrain makes sense for an electric sports car because it can be configured in a variety of layouts for optimum weight distribution and packaging. Here, for example, the tightly packaged petrol engine is housed in the middle of the car, which promotes a low centre of gravity while allowing for a long, probing front bonnet and cab-rear silhouette. The two-seater concept measures 4180mm long, 1850mm wide and 1150mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2590mm, which makes it closer in size to the Alpine A110 than the MX-5.  Tipping the scales at 1450kg – roughly on a par with the four-cylinder Lotus Emira, which produces 360bhp – the concept should be, theoretically, significantly faster than any road-going Mazda so far. The combination of the proportions, size, powertrain and packaging is what makes this “concept a demonstration to ourselves that what technologies we can put in a compact sports car” in the future, Mazda’s chief financial officer, Jeff Guyton, told Autocar. “We have packaging feasibility for things we’re talking about. Guyton added: “By itself, the concept is not intended to be the next MX-5 or something else, although if the responses are great, that’s a nice indication that there could be some market for this.” Mazda has given no indication of when an electrified MX-5 would make production, but now that the current car has been safeguarded against impending safety legislation, it can be expected to remain on sale until at least 2026. The Iconic SP makes it clear that Mazda intends the MX-5 to live on in its future electrified line-up and the aim of this concept is as inspiration for a future MX-5, not a reborn RX, even though, like past RX sports cars, it uses a rotary engine. Guyton said that while “there are technical solutions we have to make, especially with the emissions for the rotary, and with challenges left, including the battery packaging, some of the fundamentals are there.” He added: “This was a demonstration of ‘we want to put these pieces together, can we do it, make it compact and make it a sports car?’ We can.” The packaging of the rotary “unlocks the concept’s unique proportions”, said Guyton, pointing out that it is based on a “unique” architecture for Mazda. While the concept is a hard-top coupé, it can be made into a convertible and that has been factored into its creation, said Guyton. Guyton said that as a car maker selling in more than 130 countries, Mazda not only has a duty to produce decarbonised models but also to do so in a way that suited a majority of its markets – ie far from all markets are ready to go battery-electric – and it believes the Iconic SP’s powertrain solution delivers on that. The cockpit give clues as to just how important handling is for this electric reimagining of the MX-5. The digital driver display hosts a g-meter and, intriguingly, a map of the Monaco Grand Prix circuit – hinting that the Vision SP has been conceived with rapid lap times and driver engagement as a prevailing focus. There are shift paddles behind the steering wheel too for adjusting the brake regeneration and a touchscreen that looks to host controls for the active aerodynamic elements, suspension settings and launch control. Other visible features include a 360deg camera and an ultrasound sensor in the front grille, presumably for adaptive cruise control. The cabin is trimmed in a blend of microsuede and Mazda's plant-based bio-fabric material in a nod to the firm's ambitious pledge to be completely carbon neutral by 2050. Recently appointed Mazda CEO Masahiro Moro, revealing the concept in Tokyo last year, said: \"We love the MX-5, and the world loves the MX-5. We are determined in the age of electrification to keep the joy of driving which the MX-5 represents alive and the Mazda Iconic SP, with its dual rotary power generator-EV powertrain is our dream solution – a dream we will work hard to launch. “Mazda will always deliver vehicles that remind people that cars are pure joy and an indispensable part of their lives.” He was named as Mazda's new CEO in March last year, at the same time as the company announced a massive £8.7 billion electrification initiative, under which it will introduce new hybrid and pure-electric models by 2027, before working to electrify all of its cars from 2028.",

    "description": "With the festive season out of the way, new car dealers are gearing up to clear their unsold MY2024 inventories before the year ends. Maruti’s Arena line-up, comprising a range of body styles from budget hatchbacks like Alto and Celerio to SUVs like Brezza, is being offered at attractive discounts on most variants. Here’s what you need to know. Maruti Wagon R discounts in November 2024 The Wagon R is available with a discount of around Rs 45,000 for the 1.0 petrol version and Rs 49,700 for the more potent 1.2-litre version. The discount on the Wagon R CNG, which is the most popular of the lot, is around Rs 40,000. Maruti Swift discounts in November 2024 The current-gen Swift gets discounts of around 50,000, depending on the variant. It comes with the new Z-Series 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine, which will also power the soon-to-be-launched next-gen Dzire. The discount on the Swift CNG is around Rs 25,000 at most locations. Maruti Dzire discounts in November 2024 Almost all dealers have some unsold stock of the outgoing third-gen Dzire. The compact sedan still offers a competitive proposition and comes with a decent features list. The discount is around Rs 35,000 on the automatic variants and slightly less on Dzires with a manual gearbox. There are, however, no offers on the third-gen Dzire CNG. Maruti Brezza discounts in November 2024 Discounts on the Brezza have gone up from Rs 15,000 to Rs 22,000 at all locations. In some cities, benefits are even higher. The Nexon-rivalling compact SUV comes with a tried and tested 1.5-litre petrol engine or a 1.5-litre petrol-CNG powertrain. The CNG-powered Brezza doesn’t have discounts at all locations. Maruti Alto K10 discounts in November 2024 The discounts on the Alto K10 have increased marginally by around Rs 1,000 on the petrol variants, and is now up to a total of Rs 51,000 on most variants. The benefits offered with the Alto K10 CNG are around Rs 40,000-45,000, depending on the location.  Maruti S-Presso discounts in November 2024 Just like the Alto K10, the S-Presso has also seen a marginal hike in benefits. The petrol range gets benefits of around 55,000 now; the CNG-powered line-up has slightly lesser benefits of around 45,000. The S-Presso comes with the same 1.0-litre petrol engine as the Alto K10, paired with a 5-speed MT or a 5-speed AMT gearbox. Maruti Suzuki Celerio discounts in November 2024 The Celerio sits on the same platform as the Alto and S-Presso but is a larger hatchback overall. It has the same 1.0-litre petrol as many other Maruti models. The discounts and benefits on the Celerio range from Rs 40,000 to Rs 54,000, depending on the variant and the location.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki is all set to launch the fourth-gen Dzire on November 11. The popular compact sedan will be available with petrol and petrol-CNG powertrains, and the Dzire CNG delivers 33.73km/kg, according to the company. New Dzire CNG delivers 33.73km/kg Ranks fourth in fuel efficiency among Maruti’s CNG cars May cost Rs 50,000-85,000 more than the petrol versions Maruti Dzire CNG more efficient than Swift CNG At 33.73km/kg, the fourth-gen Dzire is more fuel-efficient than the third-gen Dzire CNG (31.12km/kg). It comes with the Z-Series 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine that also powers the Swift CNG. Notably, the compact sedan’s fuel efficiency is better than even the Swift CNG, which delivers 32.85kg/km. The new Dzire is Maruti's fourth most fuel-efficient CNG car, with hatchbacks like the Celerio CNG (34.43km/kg), Wagon R (34.05km/kg) and Alto K10 (33.85km/kg) giving more bang for the buck. Also See: New Maruti Dzire fuel efficiency figures revealed Maruti Dzire CNG to come in two trims  Like most other Maruti models, the Dzire CNG will be sold in mid-spec VXi and ZXi trims. Both will be equipped with a five-speed manual gearbox only; there's no Dzire CNG automatic on the cards.   But this time, Maruti is breaking the trend by offering the CNG version right from launch of the new Dzire. The CNG-powered Dzire will take on the likes of the Tigor CNG and Aura CNG in our market. Expect the Dzire CNG to be priced around Rs 50,000 to Rs 85,000 higher than the equivalent petrol variants.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.
