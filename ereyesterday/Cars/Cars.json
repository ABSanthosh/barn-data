    "description": "This 1987 Porsche 911 Carrera Targa was the subject of a multi-year backdate build by Patrick Motorsports of Phoenix, Arizona, that was completed in 2022. Work included the installation of steel backdated bodywork, a 3.8L flat-six equipped with Bosch Motronic engine management, a custom exhaust system, and a replacement limited-slip differential. The G50 five-speed manual transaxle was also rebuilt, and the car was repainted Dolphin Grey and fitted with a KW G-body suspension kit, Boxster S-sourced disc brakes, 17\" Fuchs-style wheels, nickel-plated brightwork, LED headlights, bodyside stripe decals, and a green removable roof panel. Inside, the cabin houses green leather sport seats, a Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM) head unit, electric air conditioning, and keyless entry. A custom decklid with an integrated ducktail spoiler and front and rear green leather seats with Pepita cloth inserts were constructed during the build and are also included in the sale. This backdated Carrera Targa was acquired by the current owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Blaine, Washington, with build photos, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-peugeot-e-208-gti-green-lit-new-ceo",
    "description": "Autocar render shows what a new e-208 GTI might look like Brand's new management revives performance line in effort to \"nurture driving sensations\" in its cars Peugeot will launch a GTi variant of the e-208, new boss Alain Favey has confirmed, with the hot hatch set to spearhead an effort to “nurture the reputation of the brand for driving sensations”. It will be the first GTi model since the previous-generation Peugeot 308 went off sale in 2021 and Peugeot's first sporty electric car. Speaking to media today, Favey said: “I’m in a position to confirm that we will reintroduce the GTi on the e-208 as soon as possible. We’ve made the decision that Peugeot GTi will be reintroduced.” He added that it is a “signal” about “what it means to reconnect to our past, our history” and that it would link the French brand’s road cars to its involvement in motorsport (in the World Endurance Championship). “We want to continue to nurture the reputation of the brand for driving sensations and the fact that our cars produce particular driving sensations, either as a driver or as someone that is being driven in the car,” Favey said. As for a broader GTi line-up or a sporting model with a combustion engine, Favey suggested it will depend on customer feedback. He said: “We will start with the 208 and [are] definitely listening to your inputs, or what our customers will say as well. \"We don't exclude that there might be other executions of the 208 GTi under the GTi badge, but for today there's absolutely nothing planned in that sense. Confirmation of the GTi badge’s return comes after Favey last month said that he would consider it as one of his first jobs since taking over as Peugeot CEO. The new e-208 GTi is most likely to use the same powertrain as the new Abarth 600e, which is based on the same e-CMP platform as the e-208. The Italian hot crossover gets a 237bhp motor mounted up front with a Torsen limited-slip differential. It weighs 1625kg and delivers a 0-62mph sprint time of 6.2sec. It’s possible that a lighter and lower-set e-208 equipped with the same powertrain could cut that to below 6.0sec. The Abarth is also offered with a punchier 278bhp motor in limited-run Scorpionissima form, leaving room for a special edition in the vein of the previous 208 GTi by Peugeot Sport. Green-lighting the e-208 GTi for production is also likely to result in a hot version of the Vauxhall Corsa Electric, given that the two models are twinned.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-vanquish-volante-revealed-214mph-v12-roadster",
    "description": "Roof folds out of sight in 14sec and can be shut in 16sec while on the move New drop-top version of thunderous GT brings similar performance; 95kg heavier than coupé Aston Martin has revealed the drop-top version of its 824bhp V12-powered Vanquish flagship. Taking the Volante name, it is technically identical to its coupé sibling, which arrived in September 2024 to revive the Vanquish nameplate as one of the few V12 cars on the market. In drop-top form, this is one of only two new GTs – alongside the Ferrari 12Cilindri Spider – to offer open-top driving with a 12-cylinder soundtrack. The fabric roof is operated by a K-fold mechanism, similar to the arrangement in the new Vantage Roadster. The roof can be opened in 14 seconds and closed in 16 seconds. Underbody bracing is fitted to recover some of the rigidity lost during the transition from coupé to roadster and, as a result, the Vanquish Volante is 75% stiffer laterally than the previous DBS Volante. However, it is also 95kg heavier than the Vanquish coupé, at 1930kg, which is due mainly to that extra bracing and the roof mechanism. With the same outputs of 824bhp and 738lb ft from its twin-turbocharged 5.2-litre V12, this extra heft means the Volante is 0.1sec slower than the coupé in the 0-62mph sprint, at 3.4sec. Its claimed top speed is the same 214mph as the coupé. The Volante otherwise shares its hardware with the coupé, including Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers, a ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic gearbox and an electronic limited-slip differential. Inside, it gets a 10.25in digital instrument panel and an infotainment screen of the same size running Aston Martin’s own operating software. A 15-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system is fitted as standard and extensive interior customisation will be offered through the company’s Q by Aston Martin division. Prices have yet to be confirmed, but the Vanquish Volante is expected to carry a relatively small premium over the £334,000 coupé. For reference, the DB12 Volante costs £13,500 (7%) more than the DB12 coupé, at £204,500. Production of both variants of the Vanquish will be capped at fewer than 1000 cars per year. Deliveries will start between July and September. The arrival of the Vanquish Volante completes Aston Martin’s core line-up, which also consists of the Vantage, DBX 707, DB12 and mid-engined Valhalla.",

    "description": "For buyers who crave the thrill of a sports car without giving up the space and practicality of a sedan, the BMW M340i has always been an enticing option. While its blistering performance and attractive pricing made it a standout, its stiff suspension often compromised everyday comfort. With the 2025 update, BMW has addressed that concern in a big way. 2025 BMW M340i performance, ride and handling Now gets Adaptive M Suspension Adjustable damper settings transform the way this M340i behaves. The headline change? The addition of Adaptive M Suspension, previously exclusive to the now-discontinued X3 M40i in India. This system allows drivers to toggle between firmer or softer shock absorber settings at the push of a button, transforming the car’s ride quality. Yes, the 19-inch wheels and run-flat tyres still make it firmer than the standard long-wheelbase 3 Series, but in Comfort mode, the ride is significantly more forgiving than the outgoing model. Switch to Sport mode, and the M340i tightens up dramatically, delivering the razor-sharp agility and direct steering feel you would expect from a performance sedan. The new flat-bottomed steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock marker enhances the sporty vibe further. The ride quality is softer and far more forgiving than before.   Retains 374hp, 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The M340i retains its B58 3-litre 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, which makes 374hp and 500Nm. Those who have experienced the earlier iterations of the M340i will quickly point out that this unit is much quieter, especially in Eco and Normal drive modes. The engine sound, though, is prominently amplified by the cabin speakers in Sport and Sport Plus, and with BMW’s ‘iconic sounds’ turned on, you will also hear occasional crackles from the M exhaust. Yes, the sound is synthesised, but this 6-cylinder mill sounds sweet when revved hard. The 3-litre, 6-cyl unit is quieter than before; performance remains explosive.   0-100kph comes up in 4.39 seconds 2025 BMW M340i performance as testedAcceleration Time0-20kph0.70s0-40kph1.31s0-60kph2.14s0-80kph3.16s0-100kph4.39s0-120kph5.96s0-140kph7.75s20-80kph (kickdown)3.00s40-100kph (kickdown)3.39s The best bit is that performance remains explosive. In our performance tests, it sprints from 0 to 100kph in merely 4.39 seconds, and it hits 200kph rather effortlessly. Also, it retains the 48-Volt mild hybrid system, which facilitates a rather seamless automatic engine stop-start function to reduce fuel consumption while idling.  Complementing this engine is a fantastic 8-speed torque converter automatic, which transmits power to all four wheels. Besides being smooth and quick, it is a rather clever transmission, and you’ll seldom find this powertrain caught off guard when you put your foot down. For manual control, though, it gets paddle shifters, which certainly elevate driver engagement. 2025 BMW M340i exterior and interior New colour option and alloy wheels New blacked-out 19-inch alloys and red brake calipers look sporty. With this update, the M340i gets two new paint options, one of them being Arctic Race Blue, as seen on the test car. It also gets new blacked-out alloys as well as red brake calipers. Changes to the interior are minimal, with the most prominent ones being the new flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker and redesigned central air vents – though the latter feels flimsy to operate. The curved touchscreen now features an updated software interface, but it still feels cluttered with too many apps, making it unintuitive. Redesigned air vents feel flimsy in operation; flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker looks racy.   2025 BMW M340i price and verdict Rs 6 lakh more expensive than the 2023 model At Rs 74.90 lakh, this iteration is nearly Rs 6 lakh pricier than the 2023 version. However, the newly added Adaptive M suspension justifies this price premium. It has transformed this car’s character, making it more comfortable than before without hampering driver engagement. With stonking performance, adequate cabin room, a 480-litre boot and a decent standard kit, the M340i exerts serious appeal. If you love to drive and are in the market for a daily driver within Rs 1 crore, your search should end here.

    "description": "It’s an SUV that doesn’t just drive brilliantly ‘for an SUV’, but one that, in true Porsche fashion, drives brilliantly, period. It’s a defining moment for Porsche and a risky one, too. The legendary German sports car maker has taken a proven and successful formula, torn it up and rewritten it – with lithium. Porsche has electrified its bestselling Macan, which, since its debut in 2014, has been the compact performance SUV benchmark. But, with a pair of motors replacing engines, including the much-loved V6, and a heavy battery pack slung underneath the floor, the question is, does the Macan Electric still feel like a proper Porsche? The litmus, er, lithium test is a quick dash to Mahabaleshwar. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric platform and exterior Built on the PPE base It’s important to note that the Macan Electric has nothing in common with its combustion-powered predecessors. Porsche has ditched the ICE platform and moved to the all-new Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which has been co-developed with Audi. Without the constraints of an engine up front, designers had a freer hand in the styling, but yet, from the outside, the Macan Electric is unmistakably a Macan. Signature four-point DRLs look great. The signature four-point LED daytime running lamps remain, but the full-width rear light bar is now slimmer and more pronounced. A key differentiator is the Macan EV’s proportions. The lowered nose, short overhangs, longer wheelbase (up by 86mm), and slightly wider track help improve aerodynamics (down to a slippery 0.25Cd) while giving it a more hunkered-down look. The Taycan-inspired front end and the subtly integrated active aerodynamics (including adaptive air curtains and a deployable rear spoiler) mark it out as a performance SUV even before you step inside. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric interior features Three screen-layout shared with Panamera The interior remains reassuringly familiar and is unmistakably Porsche – superbly built and driver-focused. Material quality is top-notch, with leather, brushed aluminium and soft-touch plastics that deliver a premium ambience. However, the gloss-black surfaces are prone to fingerprints. Infotainment is intuitive, logical and easy to navigate. The driving position remains spot on, thanks to 18-way adjustable front seats, which offer fantastic support and even a massage function – a first for the Macan. Dominating the dashboard is a trio of screens similar to the Panamera: a 12.6-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the centre, and an optional passenger display of the same size – a Rs 1 lakh upgrade. It’s a crisp, clean and well-integrated layout, maintaining the minimalist elegance Porsche is known for. The infotainment system is superb – logically laid out, sharp in resolution and not overrun with an excess of apps. Apple CarPlay is not wireless Porsche has also struck a happy balance between digital screens and physical controls. Unlike many rivals that have gone fully touchscreen, the Macan retains some key physical buttons – most notably for climate control. This ensures that adjusting basic settings remains easy and intuitive. However, there are some surprising omissions. Wireless Apple CarPlay, a feature expected at this price point, is absent and requires a wired connection. This wouldn’t be a major issue if not for the awkwardly placed USB-C ports on the left side of the centre console, which are hidden from view and difficult to access in the right-hand-drive versions. The rear seat isn’t particularly generous despite a longer wheelbase. Also, the rear seats, while benefiting from the Macan Electric’s 86mm longer wheelbase, aren’t particularly generous. The legroom is decent, but the high window line, coupled with the sloping roof, gives the back a slightly claustrophobic feel. Taller passengers will find headroom just adequate, and the knee-up seating position – common in EVs due to battery packaging – is noticeable but not objectionable. The panoramic sunroof helps brighten things up, but the Macan remains more of a driver’s car than a rear-seat-friendly SUV. The small 84-litre frunk is useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. With no engine up front, the Macan Electric offers a small 84-litre frunk – useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. The rear boot is well-shaped and reasonably spacious at 480 litres in the Turbo variant, though lower-spec models offer a more generous 540 litres. Folding the rear seats expands cargo capacity. Overall, the Macan Electric’s cabin stays true to Porsche’s ethos – driver-focused, high-quality and functional – without succumbing entirely to the touch-only trend that plagues many modern EVs. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric performance and ride 0-100kph takes 3.3 seconds Four drive modes on offer. The Macan Electric has debuted in India with the top-of-the-line Turbo, which has a dual-motor, all- wheel-drive setup. Lower variants like the Macan 4 and Macan 4S with rear-wheel drive are yet to be available. Straight-line performance is where the Macan Turbo Electric feels utterly ballistic. With up to 639hp and 1,130Nm of torque, it delivers the kind of acceleration – the claimed 0 to 100kph time is 3.3 seconds – that can humble supercars. Engage Sport+ mode, activate launch control, and the Macan Electric catapults forward as if fired out of a cannon. 260kph top speed While some EVs struggle to sustain their initial surge, the Macan Electric maintains its ferocity well beyond the first few seconds, and given the space, the Turbo can crack 250kph. Porsche’s sophisticated thermal management ensures that performance remains consistent, even after repeated hard acceleration runs. As a result, the performance is always effortless, relentless and completely addictive. Macan EV perfectly balances performance and practicality, making for a great daily driver. And it’s not just heart-stopping acceleration that is the Macan Electric’s forte. Like most high-powered EVs, it blends performance with daily usability. Unlike high-strung ICE-powered performance SUVs that tend to feel jerky and restless in traffic, the Macan Electric is buttery smooth. Thanks to the absence of a traditional gearbox and the instant torque delivery of its electric motors, crawling through traffic is smooth and seamless. Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable However, despite this city-friendly character, the ride remains firmly on the stiffer side. It isn’t uncomfortable, but there’s no escaping the underlying firmness, particularly at low speeds. Comfort- seekers may find this a little intrusive, but Porsche enthusiasts will appreciate the taut setup. Road noise also creeps into the cabin, especially at speed over coarse tarmac, which slightly dampens the otherwise refined experience. On the patchy NH66, which has bumpy concrete surfacing for most parts, it’s deafeningly obvious that Porsche hasn’t been generous with sound insulation, but that’s more to do with saving weight than saving money. The sound I do like is the synthesised ‘engine’ growl that’s electronically induced. It’s neither obtrusive nor over the top – just enough to add a layer of aural engagement without feeling forced. In contrast to some artificial, gimmicky EV soundtracks, Porsche has taken a more subtle approach. 591km claimed range Battery-cooling fan kicks up a dust storm. Range anxiety is often a concern with EVs, but the Macan Turbo Electric has addressed this with a large 100kWh battery, of which 95kWh is useable. After a full day of spirited driving, including high-speed runs and a 4,500-foot elevation climb, it still had 31% charge remaining. Given its claimed 591km range, the battery’s real-world performance is reassuring. Charging speed is where the Macan Electric truly shines. Thanks to its 800-volt system, it can charge at up to 270kW, but the challenge is finding such high-speed chargers in India, where the fast-charging network mainly consists of 30kW to 60kW units. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric handling Sharp and precise steering The steering is sharp and precise, with a level of feedback that most EVs lack. One of the biggest challenges in transitioning to an electric platform is weight, and at nearly 400kg heavier than the Macan GTS, the Macan Electric isn’t exactly light. Yet, you’d never guess it from the way it handles. On the twisty Ambenali Ghat, the Macan Electric is an absolute delight to thread through corners. It’s quick to change direction and delivers an uncanny sense of precision despite its mass. Performance is effortless and completely addictive.  Its near-perfect 48:52 front-to-rear weight distribution and strong rear motor create a rear-engine-like balance, allowing it to rotate beautifully into corners, and with the traction control off, it’s easy to get the tail out for some sideways action. The rear-axle steering (a costly but worthwhile option at Rs 2.70 lakh) further enhances its dynamic prowess, making it feel far smaller and nimbler than its size suggests. Grip levels and the overall body control are outstanding, thanks to a low centre of gravity courtesy of the floor-mounted battery. The all-wheel-drive system ensures unwavering stability, even when pushing hard. The Macan Electric is quick to change direction despite its mass. The steering is one of the best in any EV – sharp, precise and with a level of feedback most electric cars lack. It’s on the heavier side at parking speeds, but that’s a small price to pay for its dynamic edge. Regen braking does not feel aggressive Porsche has also nailed the braking feel. Unlike many EVs with an artificial, grabby ‘regenerative’ braking sensation, the Macan Electric’s brakes feel natural and progressive. There are no paddles to manually adjust regen on the fly – just two settings, ‘on’ and ‘off’, which can be accessed via the touchscreen or assigned to a shortcut key on the steering wheel. When engaged, the regen remains mild and unobtrusive, ensuring smooth and predictable deceleration rather than aggressive one-pedal driving. True to Porsche’s philosophy, the Macan Electric is tuned to feel like a proper driver’s car, recovering energy efficiently without compromising its dynamic character. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric price and verdict Macan Electric isn’t just an electrified version of a traditional SUV but more of a sports car engineered into an SUV body. The Macan Turbo Electric isn’t just another fast electric SUV; it’s a true Porsche. It feels natural, intuitive and engaging in a way that many EVs don’t. It doesn’t come across as an electrified version of a traditional SUV but rather a sports car engineered into an SUV body. Sure, it lacks the mechanical soul of an ICE – the visceral sound of an engine, the ebb and flow of power, and the rhythm of shifting gears – but it makes up for it with instant torque, razor-sharp responses and a level of precision that set it apart. Yes, the rear seats could be more spacious, but none of that matters when you’re behind the wheel. What matters is that this EV delivers the same thrilling experience as its petrol-powered predecessor, and in some ways, even better. Like most Porsches, the Macan Turbo Electric, too, is pricey, at Rs 1.68 crore. But that won’t stop many Porsche aficionados from queuing up for one.

Working as NamiXII Design from Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan, he creates everything from furniture and sculptures to trophies. More importantly, he also builds radical 70s-style choppers. The last time we checked in with Fo, he wowed us with a wildly chopped Yamaha SR400. This time he’s back with an equally bodacious chopper on a very different foundation—a 2022-model Harley-Davidson Low Rider S. Dyna cultists must have felt cheated when The Motor Co. re-released the Low Rider S on their newer Softail platform. But the truth is, the contemporary Low Rider S is a total hoot to ride. Its 117 ci Milwaukee-Eight engine is a peach, and its chassis is vastly better than that of its predecessor.…",

Bright blocks of colored paint made up the bodywork while it was adorned with intricate details of gold. It was bold, brash, and sexy.

The German carmaker plans to use the flexible retail concept to reach customers in more nascent markets (such as Tier 2 cities) without having to invest in full-scale showrooms. Audi India opens a pop-up store in Kanpur to expand footprint in Uttar Pradesh The pop-up store will focus on personalised consultations and feature various amenities The carmaker plans to use pop-up stores to reach prospective customers in “key cities” Audi pop-up store Kanpur location and details Operated in partnership with Audi Lucknow, the brand’s inaugural pop-up store is located near Cawnpore Club and looks to attract luxury car buyers in Kanpur. Unlike traditional showrooms, the pop-up store is portable. Visitors are treated to an indoor vehicle display showcasing select Audi models, like the S5 Sportback, as well as a collection of branded merchandise and genuine accessories. Several amenities and points of interest for visitors Customers can also explore an Audi Library with displays of accessories such as custom interiors and performance upgrades. There’s lounge seating, dedicated consultation areas and a refreshment counter. Digital engagement tools have also been peppered throughout the store, allowing visitors to compare Audi models, customise them and explore vehicle specifications. Audi looking to expand pop-up showroom format According to Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon, the demand for luxury cars is “growing substantially” in Uttar Pradesh, and the company is confident that the Kanpur pop-up store will resonate well with customers thanks to its emphasis on personalised consultations. Dhillon believes the pop-up showroom format will help Audi “reach aspirational customers in key cities”. Mercedes-Benz opened pop-up stores across India nine years ago Notably, Mercedes-Benz India introduced pop-up showrooms in 2016 across seven major locations: Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai and Goa. However, Audi seems to be reserving the pop-up store format for Tier 2 cities. Also see: Audi India addressing entry luxury segment with pre owned cars Audi Q9 7-seat SUV to debut in 2026",

    "description": "The BMW R 12 GS has been teased on the brand’s global website, and is set to be unveiled on March 27. It is an enduro bike that shares its engine and fundamentals with the R 12 nineT roadster. R 12 GS will be unveiled at 9:30pm IST on March 27 Will use a 21/17-inch (F/R) wheel setup with knobby tyres To feature longer suspension travel and higher ground clearance BMW R 12 GS unveil date It will sport minimal bodywork and a purposeful stance In the first quarter of 2024, BMW Motorrad’s chief, Markus Flasch confirmed that the brand is working on an off-road enduro motorcycle. It gets an air-oil cooled motor shared with the R 12 nineT roadster, borrowing its fundamentals while making it purposeful to suit its intent. The R 12 GS will be a raised R 12 nineT with 21/17-inch (F/R) wheels, wrapped in knobby off-road rubber. It could also get longer suspension travel and a purposeful stance. It will be more closely linked to the earlier HP2 Enduro than the GS 1300. In essence, it will be to the R 12 nineT what the Ducati Desert Sled is to the Scrambler Icon. According to earlier leaked images of the R 12 GS, it features a single-sided swingarm and a shaft final drive– just like its roadster sibling, although with a more upswept exhaust and higher ground clearance. It will be packaged as an enduro motorcycle with minimal bodywork and expected lighter kerb weight. At its heart will be a 110hp, 115Nm, 1,170cc, air/oil-cooled, boxer twin mated to a 6-speed gearbox. However, it could come in a different state of tune. Also see: BMW CE 02 road test, review",
