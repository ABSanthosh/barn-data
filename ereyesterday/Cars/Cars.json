    "description": "This 1968 Ford Mustang coupe was initially delivered to Beattie Motors in Monterey, California, and is one of 4,118 examples ordered with the California Special equipment package. It was purchased by the seller's parents-in-law in December 1989, and subsequent modifications have included overboring the 302ci V8 and installing TRW pistons, a revised camshaft, and Tri-Y headers. A Doug Nash five-speed manual transmission was also installed along with a McLeod clutch and flywheel and a Ford 9\" rear end with a limited-slip differential and 31-spline axles. Finished in Lime Gold, the car rides on 15\" Cobra-style wheels and is equipped with Koni shocks, revised anti-sway bars, disc brakes, fog lights, and exposed hood locks. The refreshed interior features black vinyl upholstery, a Nardi steering wheel, a Hurst shifter, a push-button radio, and an 8-track cassette player. This California Special coupe is now offered by the seller with a Deluxe Marti Report and a clean California title in the name of the owners.",

Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 by OrMotors The new Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 doesn’t just offer better looks than the previous generation, it also performs better in every way. Sure, Enfield’s new liquid-cooled Sherpa 450 single-cylinder is only a 40-horse stable, but it’s a huge update over the previous 411 cc air-cooled engine.

The event is dripping with nostalgia and adrenaline, as contenders go head-to-head across the sands of Wildwood’s sprawling beach. This beguiling Harley-Davidson beach racer looks exactly like the type of motorcycle you’ll find at T.R.O.G. until you spot the beefy powerplant sitting at its center. It’s actually a modern Harley-Davidson Milwaukee-Eight Softail—masterfully redesigned by Gasoline Motor Co. to resemble a vintage machine and nicknamed the ‘Wildwood Beach Racer,’ as a nod to the iconic beach race. The Milwaukee-Eight Softail cuts a lovely silhouette in stock form, but the Australian custom shop’s vision for the bike called for more than just a light makeover.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/you-can-sleep-xpengs-new-ev-%E2%80%93-should-you",
    "description": "In-car sleeping is an advertised feature of Xpeng's G6, not just a theoretical possibility Have you ever noticed that there are regional market trends for seat adjustment mechanisms? I never had, until a wise colleague some years ago pointed one out. “Japanese and Korean cars very often have lever-style adjusters for seat recline,” he said, “whereas European and American cars [those without motorised seats, at least] tend to have those wheel-style adjusters that you have to wind all the way up and down.” This, he assured me, is because it’s much more common in Asian countries – Japan especially – than it is elsewhere for people to sleep in their cars, and a simpler recline mechanism (literally just lift, plonk, snore) makes this a lot easier. Makes sense: I can imagine Tokyo business types, after a ridiculously long day of work and socialising, preferring to grab some shut-eye in the front seat, rather than schlepping an hour home just to get up and turn around all the earlier to come back the following morning. And in-car sleeping, funnily enough, might be becoming a global trend. A couple of test cars I’ve driven recently have been especially suited to it. The first was the Hyundai Inster, a pint-sized electric hatchback in which all four seats can be folded flat to make a decent-sized sleeping area. Which is especially funny, because the car itself can’t be much bigger than a king-sized bed. The second, about which you will be reading in an upcoming road test, is the Xpeng G6. This is quite a derivative mid-sized electric crossover that’s plainly out to steal the lunch of the Tesla Model Y. The fact that it offers no fewer than three ‘sleep space’ cabin layouts might be the most interesting thing about it. Because the front seats are motorised, the car at least partially converts itself. You just whip out the front headrests, then select which ‘mode’ you want from the touchscreen. You can have one front seat flattened or both of them, or you can have the front chairs motored forwards and convert the back-seat area and boot for sleeping (the back-seat folding is done manually). An inflatable mattress can be supplied with the car as an accessory, to be pumped up from the 12V socket. And then, and rather importantly, once your sleeping area is set up, the climate control will stay active for as long as you like, maintaining a comfortable slumbering temperature, whereas in other cars it would automatically shut down after a while. Presumably because it’s electric, the G6 can shuffle power between its high- and low-voltage power circuits to enable this. And you might well have it plugged in and on charge at the same time, of course. The infotainment system can play a range of lullaby-like audio tracks while you drop off, too. The crackling of a bonfire was my favourite. Car-sleeping is the kind of thing that gets romanticised in car brochures, but I doubt if it would really catch on as a selling point in the UK. Our laws are quite particular about where and how it’s legal to do it. Make a habit of it and you’re likely to be woken by a police officerbefore too long, because sleeping in a car while inebriated remains a specific criminal offence. But, frankly, who would want to do it sober? It’s often prohibited in private car parks. You need to seek permission if you’re on privately owned land. And even in the places where it is safe and legal, we still live in Britain, of course, so you’re likely to attract attention from locals who assume you’re homeless, dispossessed or simply odd and would rather report you to the police and have you moved on than let you represent any kind of risk to their golden retriever. In any case, the G6 that I tested didn’t have the mattress accessory included, so sadly I couldn’t properly test its effectiveness as a mobile sleeping pod. I would have been willing, reader, in the interests of journalistic thoroughness. I’m just not quite sure where I would have parked to do it, or what people would have thought of me.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lexus/rx/long-term-reviews/what-we-learned-after-3000-miles-%C2%A370000-lexus-rx-phev",
    "description": "How will PHEV tech affect this brew of comfort, luxury and practicality? This car has a bit of an identity crisis. Ever since Toyota's luxury brand launched its Radiant Crossover (yes, really) in 1998, the Lexus RX range has stood for one thing above all else: luxury. Yes, they went uncommonly well, and yes, they could probably get you home if the Glyndebourne car park got particularly muddy, but the main draw of these limousines on stilts was always comfort and opulence, rather than driver appeal or off-road ability. That was only enhanced from 2005, when the RX became the first hybrid large SUV, offering the silence of electric motivation running hand in hand with its free-spinning petrol V6. When specified, as here, with the new F Sport Design trim, however, this new fifth-generation RX has real attitude, its aggressive addenda and 21in rims suggesting something a bit racier than the Lexus norm. Drive it only a little way, though, and it's reassuring to learn that the key strengths of the old RX are alive and well. Unlike the 500h version that we put through the road test treatment in 2023, which features a six-speed automatic gearbox and torque-vectoring gubbins to try to give the RX a sportier drive, this 450h+ sticks with the e-CVT of old. Now, I'm no fan of VTs in general, but here it works very well, largely thanks to the large battery pack and powerful electric motor, which masks any torque gaps. But this car does stray from the old RX in two very important ways. First, the long-serving (and thirsty) 3.5-litre V6 has at last been ditched in favour of a more frugal 2.5-litre four; and second, unlike the conventional 350h hybrid (which is now the entry point to a three-model range), this new 450h+ is the first plug-in hybrid RX, with an 18.1kWh lithium ion battery offering a claimed 42 miles of electric-only range. It also results in a serious slug of performance, with a large front and smaller rear electric motor boosting the 182bhp available from the petrol engine alone to a 304bhp total. That means 0-62mph in 6.5sec (compared with 7.9sec for the regular hybrid) and a 124mph maximum. Not bad for a car weighing a little over 2.1 tonnes. The PHEV is certainly having an effect: in 2023, the RX had its biggest-ever sales performance in Europe, a market traditionally more resistant to the charms of this unashamedly US-focused SUV, with a large part of that success thanks to sales of this particular model. Lexus likes to claim that the RX was the world's first luxury SUV. I suspect a couple of rather large names from the UK (Range Rover) and the US (Jeep Wagoneer) might have something to say about that, but it was certainly the first to use monocoque construction to give truly car-like refinement and road manners - and those qualities remain. The 21in wheels of my test car's F-Sport Design trim introduce a certain amount of bump-thump into the cabin, but overall refinement is excellent, the cocoon-like feel aided by door seals so thick that you have to really slam them shut and windows programmed to slow their climb as they near the top of the doorframe to avoid an aggressive change of air pressure as they close. Only the slightly raucous nature of the four-cylinder engine spoils that impression, lacking the muscle and outright smoothness of the six-pot units of rivals such as BMW's X5 Drive50e, which I greatly enjoyed running last year. It's also outgunned on boot capacity by the X5 Drive50e and Volvo XC90 T8, both of which additionally offer a seven-seater option, but at 461 litres (or 612 litres if filled to the roof), it's still pretty large, and usefully the PHEV RX gets the same amount of space as its hybrid siblings. Instead, the battery pack eats slightly into the fuel tank provision, which is 55 litres to the 65 litres offered by the 350h and 500h. Lexus presumably figured that the additional battery range would more than make up for that. This car scores well as far as passengers are concerned. The 2850mm wheelbase is 60mm longer than the old RX's, meaning that rear occupants enjoy palatial comfort, regardless of how tall the driver is. It's similarly roomy up front, with a pleasingly driver-focused dashboard layout and beautiful interior quality augmented by soft-touch materials throughout. And the generous specification leaves you wanting for very little: the only option that we chose was premium paint, in a particularly lustrous silver that sets off Lexus's 'Spindle' grille design. Rather bluff nose aside, this is a good-looking car to my eyes, with the neatly resolved rear in particular a big step forward over the slightly ungainly old RX. And it's made all the more handsome by the sharp F-Sport Design addenda, which brings us full circle, back to the subject of driver appeal. This is a very large car, at nearly five metres long and a shade less than two metres wide, and on country lanes in particular it feels it, causing the odd sharp intake of breath as I dive into hedges to avoid getting intimate with oncoming traffic. Sport it ain't. Realistically, though, most of my time is spent either stuck in traffic or eating up motorway miles, and in both of these sets of circumstances, it offers a very different type of driver appeal, soothing and cosseting in a way few others can. So while 10% of the time I might pine for a touch of agility, for the remainder I'm very happy indeed. Update 2 I'm not generally a great believer in automotive smartphone apps, as they tend to be overcomplicated and not hugely useful, but the recent cold snap tempted me to download Lexus Link+ to try out its climate settings. Pleasingly, it’s logical and simple to use, offering general data such as fuel and battery levels, range, any warnings from the car and the status of the doors, windows and boot, plus a neat Hybrid Coaching section to help you get the best from the hybrid drivetrain. Apparently, I have ‘room for improvement’ – no surprise there. But the main event is the remote control for the climate. You can set any temperature from 18-29deg C and ask it to start on demand, and it will give you a countdown to when it’s expected to reach your chosen level. Alternatively, you can tell it to start automatically at a set time, either as a one-off use or on repeat. You can even programme it to follow different schedules on weekdays and at the weekend. My wife wasn’t best pleased when I enjoyed a morning cuppa while she went out to chip the ice from her frozen Mini and saw that the RX’s windows were all clear, and inside it looked cosy and inviting. In truth, the heating system as a whole is worthy of mention, too. Since setting it to my comfy level (21deg C) shortly after collecting the car, I’ve hardly had to touch the controls. Despite it being very large inside, the RX heats up remarkably quickly, and the heated/ventilated seats and heated steering wheel are both set to ‘auto’, which means that they turn themselves on and off with a near-telepathic intuition. I also love that the only two settings I do vary regularly – turning on the heated rear screen/heated mirrors and windscreen demist – are both available via buttons, so I don’t have to wade through touchscreen menus. This always feels like a car that has been designed with the driver’s comfort and convenience in mind. And you can’t talk about comfort without mentioning the phenomenal seats, which are supportive and cosseting in equal measure. There has been some complaint from my (clearly very spoiled) daughter that the seats in the rear aren’t heated as well, and I was surprised to discover that to get them, you have to upgrade to the £6000-pricier Takumi trim level. You do have to search quite hard to find a gap in the spec sheet of this F Sport Design car, though. The dipped-beam headlights could be a bit better, but other than that it’s the consummate winter car: grippy, safe and secure-feeling, even if you do sense its considerable weight when hitting an icy patch. The outside world is near-silenced, but the doors do require a good slam to shut properly, and even after a few months my wife continues to complain about the needless complexity of the electric door buttons, bemoaning: “What’s wrong with a proper door handle?” I’m used to them now, but for some reason, I keep forgetting to lock the car when I’ve been out for a short trip. Fortunately, that’s another useful element of the Lexus Link+ app: it sends me a notification to let me know if there’s a window or door open or a door unlocked, and I can then lock it from my phone. A comforting safety net for if I ever have to rush for a plane or train. Update 3 Our expectations of what a luxury car should offer have evolved since Toyota’s upmarket Lexus brand was launched in 1989. The original LS 400 was exceptionally comfortable and refined, but it was resolutely an executive express: all work and no play. It was brilliant at it, though, and Lexus soon became a fixture of the motoring landscape. These days we demand that our luxury cars are a little less one-dimensional. They must be as adept at family life – the school run, muddy weekend dog walk, tip run or holiday road trip – as they are at the commute or a motorway blast to a meeting. All of which explains the rise and rise of the luxury SUV. The RX has delivered even better than expected in this respect: this is a seriously practical car, not least because it’s so big. Accommodation for my dog is palatial (even if he has to mind his head on the supports for the luggage cover), and with the seats lowered I managed to squeeze in an entire double mattress (unfolded) for its send-off at the tip. Dropping the rear bench is easy thanks to a couple of electric releases beside the tailgate (also electric, opening via a ‘virtual pedal’), but you do have to put them back manually. The boot is nice and square and feels larger than its claimed 461-litre capacity. It proved ideal when a colleague begged a borrow for a house move, shuttling several loads swiftly and securely on icy roads during a cold snap. I do have the odd complaint: unless the rear seats are fully reclined (something my youngest daughter appreciates), there is a gap between the seatback and the loadbay cover that leaves your shopping exposed; and for a reason I have yet to fathom, sometimes the one-touch boot-close-and-lock button refuses to obey, emitting an angry beeping in response. Admittedly, that is a rather first-world problem… I’m struggling to think of a better companion for the now regular motorway schlep, fully laden, to take my daughter to and from university: she has to empty her room at the end of each term, so it’s always a large load.   The RX swallows the lot without even dropping the rear seats, so the whole family can come along to wave her off. Once packed, the rest of the car’s impressive armoury comes to the fore: the seats are fantastically comfortable, and the drivetrain is refined (unless you’re really thrashing the four-pot turbo engine) and surprisingly frugal for such a large car, its hybrid system working well even when your pre trip charge has been exhausted. Add in effortless power and pace and it makes for a remarkably relaxed way to cover large distances with four people and lots of kit. It’s probably the complete modern luxury car – just a shame its driver isn’t quite so on the ball. I didn’t realise Oxford’s low-emission zone was actually a zero-emission zone, and the £2 it would have cost me to enter the city centre in the Lexus was multiplied many times over when a fine landed on my doormat. Lesson learned, I guess. Final update A little over 20 years ago, I was sent to cover the launch of the second-generation Lexus RX for Autocar. At the time it was not much more than a quirky niche player over here yet, thanks to the US market’s voracious appetite for it, the world’s best-selling SUV. While it has since gained traction in the UK, it has lost that title to its little brother, the Toyota RAV4 – a car that donated much of its drivetrain to this, the fifth-generation RX, in a search for greater efficiency (presumably in terms of parts commonality as well as fuel consumption). That means the sweet 3.5-litre V6 of old has been replaced by a 2.5-litre four-banger, but to (more than) make up for it, the RX 450h+ is a plug-in hybrid that offers more power and torque from its electric motors than from its petrol engine, in total mustering a useful 305bhp. In daily use, particularly around town, that results in a car that feels effortlessly potent, with the muscular torque of the motors meaning you avoid the wearing droning so common among CVT-equipped cars. On a longer journey, however, when the battery’s charge has been exhausted, you can feel the lack of torque – on petrol alone, there’s a fairly lightweight 167lb – and it’s vocal (albeit not unpleasant) when called upon. Still, Toyota’s vast experience in self-charging hybrids means that it’s quick to generate enough power for the next overtake. Once charged of a morning, it defaults to EV mode, and for such a big car with a relatively small motor, it is reasonably efficient. In warmer weather, it averaged 2.5mpkWh, dropping to 2.3mpkWh when really chilly, so even in winter it’s possible to get close to the official claim of 42 miles. It’s enough for my commute, and having a charger at home makes it ideal, but most of the time I’ve tended to switch to hybrid mode in order to prolong battery life. With a pretty meagre 55-litre fuel tank, the range on petrol alone isn’t huge; it still prioritises electric power at low speeds, but moves over to the engine more readily at the kind of pace that is going to sap battery life. Although rapid, the RX is definitely more comfortable cruising than really pressing on. Sport mode makes it livelier, but this isn’t a sporty machine. The steering is fluid and well weighted and it covers ground at a deceptive rate with decent body control, but the poor lock and the sense of well over two tonnes changing direction mean it isn’t something you could call agile. Yet there are few better cars for a long journey, especially if you have dogs or lots of bags. Not only is the RX exquisitely comfortable, with fantastic seats, superb refinement, intuitive controls and efficient heating, but it’s also practical, with a large boot and thoughtful detailing such as a bin for the charging leads beneath the boot floor. There’s also the subconscious pleasure of its build quality, which feels superb and comparable to premium rivals in areas such as the lovely so -touch headliner. Initially, I found myself irritated by the seemingly incessant beeping from the speed warnings and the driver attention monitor, but bearing in mind that I got caught speeding a er turning off the former and am no longer hearing the latter (so must be paying more attention), I can’t complain. Other minor debits include headlights that aren’t as bright as I would have liked on dipped beam and further beeping when I tried to lock the car before the boot had fully latched, while my family – even after three months with the car – continued to complain about the doors. As the seals are thick (part of the reason for that refinement), they don’t always shut on first close, but the real source of irritation was the electronic door releases in place of a traditional handle. At least we haven’t had the problem suffered by reader Bob Toon, who got locked in his RX for over an hour and had to smash the window to get out. Ken Richards has had a much more positive experience with a near-twin for my car, averaging 73mpg over his first 7000 miles, doing most of his driving in EV mode. “The car is immensely comfortable, faultless and simply wafts along,” he says, “and the customer care offered by the dealer [Lexus Edinburgh] is outstanding.” I’m pretty much on the same page. Back in 2003, I concluded that it was difficult to see past the contemporary BMW X5 if you were after a luxury SUV. Fast forward 22 years and I’ve been fortunate enough to run an X5 xDrive50e and this RX in quick succession, so does that still ring true? Yes and no: the BMW remains the benchmark if you want your SUV to be fun to drive, but the Lexus feels better built, is more efficient, and is better value, spec for spec. I think the (slightly more mature) me of 2025 would find it a much more difficult decision.

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",

    "description": "Lando Norris won the 2025 F1 season-opening Australian GP after acing tricky wet-dry conditions and several Safety Car restarts. Reigning world champion Max Verstappen put pressure on the McLaren driver in the closing laps, but had to settle for second place, ending his record 1,029-day streak of leading the drivers’ championship (since Spain 2022). Mercedes’ George Russell completed the podium. His rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli was promoted to P4 after his five-second time penalty (for an unsafe release) was overturned. Norris wins Australian GP, 0.895 sec ahead of Verstappen Russell completes podium Ferrari’s Leclerc P8, Hamilton P10 Norris wins Australian GP; Piastri spins off track Norris and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri held on to the top two positions in the early stages of the race. After switching to slick tyres, the pair had pulled over 15 secs clear of Verstappen. However, shortly after, both McLaren drivers were caught out by another spell of rain. Norris immediately recovered and pitted for intermediate tyres. But Piastri spun and ended up stuck in the grass. While he was able to re-join the track, the incident dropped him to the back of the field. Out at front, Verstappen briefly held the lead, but eventually had to stop for inters as the rain intensified. After the final Safety Car period (caused by crashes for Gabriel Bortoleto and Liam Lawson), Verstappen was on a charge and started hunting down Norris. The Red Bull driver even managed to get within DRS range, but Norris held on to win the opening race of the season by a margin of just 0.895 sec. “[It was] a tough race, especially with Max behind me. I was pushing, the last two laps were a little bit stressful, but an amazing way to start the year,” said Norris. “It’s a tough one because we went off, made some big mistakes and went through the gravel and did a lot of damage. It was just tricky conditions, but these are the ones that are enjoyable, fun and unpredictable, but this time we got it right and we ended up on top. I’m very happy.” Amidst all the drama on track, Russell pulled off a clean drive to secure the final spot on the podium. Antonelli P4 on F1 debut Mercedes rookie Antonelli impressed on his F1 debut, going from P16 to P4. In fact, he and Oliver Bearman (who makes his full-time F1 debut this year) were the only rookies to reach the chequered flag. Antonelli was initially dropped to P5 after being handed a five-second time penalty for what stewards at the time deemed was an unsafe release into the path of Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg. However, after Mercedes petitioned for a Right to Review, further footage was examined and stewards decided to overturn Antonelli’s penalty, promoting him to P4. Alex Albon finished fifth for Williams, scoring his best result since losing his Red Bull seat in 2020. He was followed by Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, Sauber’s Hulkenberg and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. Piastri recovered from his earlier spin to finish P9. Hamilton: Australian GP “not the start we wanted” Lewis Hamilton rounded out the top 10 on his Ferrari debut. The seven-time world champion briefly led the race after running longer on slicks during the last spell of rain. However, Ferrari failed to capitalise on the chaos of the race and walk away from the Australian GP with fewer points scored than Sauber (6 points for Sauber versus 5 for Ferrari). “Not the start we wanted, but there’s lots to take away and work on from this one,” said Hamilton. “The rain always mixes things up, and strategy comes down to timing and a bit of luck. We took a gamble and made up places, but then boxing too late for Inters cost us, dropping us to the back of the top 10 with too much ground to recover. I struggled with the balance, but it was an important race for learning more about the car in different weather conditions, as well as gaining more experience working with a new team. McLaren and Red Bull had serious pace, so there’s work to do, but we’ll dig deep.” Next up on the F1 calendar is the Chinese GP on March 21-23. 2025 Australian GP results 2025 Australian GP resultsPosDriverTeam1Lando NorrisMcLaren2Max VerstappenRed Bull Racing3George RussellMercedes4Andrea Kimi AntonelliMercedes5Alex AlbonWilliams6Lance StrollAston Martin7Nico HulkenbergSauber8Charles LeclercFerrari9Oscar PiastriMcLaren10Lewis HamiltonFerrari11Pierre GaslyAlpine12Yuki TsunodaRacing Bulls13Esteban OconHaas14Oliver BearmanHaasNCLiam LawsonRed Bull RacingNCGabriel BortoletoSauberNCFernando AlonsoAston MartinNCCarlos SainzWilliamsNCJack DoohanAlpineNCIsack HadjarRacing Bulls Also see: F1 2025 car liveries revealed Cadillac, General Motors to join F1 in 2026",

    "description": "First previewed by a concept in September 2023, the Mercedes-Benz CLA has now been officially revealed as the brand’s new entry-level sedan with both EV and hybrid powertrains. In a first for Mercedes, the CLA EV and the CLA hybrid will share a common model name. This marks an end to Mercedes’ strategy of entirely bespoke EVs being developed to sit alongside their combustion-engined equivalents. CLA has been developed as an EV first, and then a hybrid Both EV and hybrid models look similar inside and outside India launch expected by end of 2025 Mercedes Benz CLA EV battery, range and powertrain CLA EV has more range than flagship EQS sedan The CLA EV line-up starts with the entry-level 250+ with EQ Technology that is claimed to deliver a range of 792km. Meanwhile, the all-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology is claimed to deliver 770km. What’s notable here is the smaller range disparity compared to the rear-driven version than is typical of most other EVs. Do note that these figures are still pending homologation under the WLTP cycle. However, what’s really interesting is that the rear-wheel-drive CLA leapfrogs Mercedes’ own flagship EQS 580, which manages 770km WLTP range from a 118kWh battery. That remarkable range figure is thanks to Mercedes’ efforts to minimise the CLA EV’s energy consumption: it just has an 85kWh nickel-managanese-cobalt (NMC) battery. This means the CLA EV's efficiency is north of 9.0km/kWh. Comes in both RWD and AWD configurations The CLA EV’s new rear-mounted permanent magnet motor is also significant to its efficiency. It produces more output in a smaller package, is lighter and has greater torque density, too. The motor also gets a Porsche Taycan-style two-speed gearbox, rather than the usual single-speed reduction gearing. The powertrain puts out 272hp, which allows the CLA 250+ to complete the 0-100kph dash in 6.7 seconds. The four-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology gets an additional 108hp motor with a single-speed gearbox on its front axle, giving a combined output of 354hp. This cuts its 0-100kph sprint time to 4.9 seconds. This additional motor is decoupled from the front axle when it isn’t needed, reducing energy losses to friction by 90 percent. Braking primarily relies on the motors’ regenerative effect (which can provide up to 200kW of stopping power), helping to keep the battery topped up. Can charge at up to 320kW, thanks to 800V architecture The CLA EV can be fast-charged at rates of up to 320kW, thanks to its 800V electrical architecture that allows for a 300km top-up in just 10 minutes. In addition to the 85kWh battery, a 58kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) pack will also be offered at a later stage. Mercedes Benz CLA hybrid powertrain Mercedes says it has diesel levels of efficiency The new CLA will also be offered in hybrid form. Specifically designed to fit in the same space as the EV’s front motor, its powertrain pairs a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a small, 1.3kWh battery and a 27hp electric motor. These combine to send either 136hp or 163hp through the front wheels or, in the range-topping 4Matic model, 191hp to all four wheels. Mercedes claims the new hybrid powertrain gives the CLA “diesel levels of fuel efficiency”. Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius also announced that the hybrid will be priced at par with the EV in a push for greater parity between EVs and combustion models. Mercedes Benz CLA exterior design and aerodynamics CLA has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21 The CLA EV’s impressive range figure is in no small part thanks to its aerodynamic design. Although the car is larger than its predecessor (25mm wider, 25mm taller and 30mm longer), much work went into minimising its frontal area, and smoothing the air flow around it. For example, the wheels are set further in-board of the arches than its predecessor. Small inlets on the front bumper (and corresponding outlets at the rear) guide the flow of air around each corner relatively undisturbed by the alloy wheels’ flush-faced designs. The efforts net a slippery drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21, just behind that of the EQS (0.20). CLA EV and CLA hybrid share the same design Also, in a first for Mercedes, the CLA hybrid and CLA EV will look almost identical inside and out. The new CLA emphasises on the brand’s three-pointed star logo with its lighting elements. The motif features in the CLA’s headlights and brake lights, and the EV also gets a flush front grille with no fewer than 142 backlit stars. They surround the main front badge, which is also backlit. The CLA hybrid is differentiated by a traditional open grille, needed to provide cooling to the engine. Mercedes Benz CLA interior and features Superscreen setup continues in CLA Inside, the new CLA takes on a sportier character than its more luxurious stablemates. The front seats have chunky side bolsters, for example, and there are more exuberant material choices, such as a combination of black and white Alcantara and faux leather with red stitching. The dashboard is designed around the latest iteration of Mercedes’ Superscreen, whose three digital displays (a 10.25-inch one for the instruments in front of the driver; a 14.6-inch infotainment; and, optionally, a 14-inch one for the front passenger) span its entire width. New MB.OS operating system brings AI functions Thanks to Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system, the screens can be used to play video games or stream shows and films via Netflix and other such services. The system also features the latest iteration of Mercedes’ virtual assistant, which blends various artificial intelligence functions (ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Bing) to provide more accurate answers to questions. In cars without the Superscreen, the passenger screen will be replaced with a glass panel with LED-backlit star logos, which match the interior’s ambient lighting. Boot space is rated at 405 litres. In a first for a modern Mercedes, the EV gets a frunk that adds another 101 litres of storage space. Mercedes Benz CLA launch details India launch expected by end of 2025 The CLA will first go on sale in its EV guise around October in Europe, with the hybrid following a few months later. Joining the sedan will be a new CLA estate with both powertrain options, and it is expected to be showcased around September at the Munich Motor Show. The CLA sedan is expected to arrive here in India by the end of 2025 as well. Also See: 2025 Defender Octa price announcement on March 26 New BMW iX3 design previewed by Neue Klasse X prototype",

    "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-turbo-s-facelift-review-turbo-charged-434832#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Then Porsche first introduced the Taycan, the enthusiasts said it was sacrilege. How could Porsche, renowned for some of the best ICE sports cars in history, slap its crest on a four-door, two-tonne electric sedan? But as usual, Porsche has proven naysayers wrong, as the Taycan is now known as the enthusiasts’ EV of choice. We can attest to that after setting the fastest lap time by an EV at the Buddh International Circuit in it, racing it against a sailing boat, and even drag-racing it against its petrol-powered stablemates. But Porsche is not one to rest on its laurels. There’s an updated version with even more performance now, and we sampled its Turbo and Turbo S variants in and around Dubai to see what to expect. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift exterior design The rear bumper and light signature have been mildly altered. You’ll have to be a real Porsche nerd to spot the design differences on this facelift; they are so subtle. It has more aero-efficient bumpers on the front and back, tweaked headlamps that now get LED Matrix tech as standard, a revised rear light bar and new colour and wheel options. Porsche lettering on tailgate lights up There’s even an option to illuminate the Porsche lettering at the back, which looks quite cool, and the Turbo and Turbo S also get the new ‘Turbonite’ satin-matte accents, which feature on the logo, too. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift interior and features Active air suspension aids cabin entry There’s good room behind, but you’re seated in a low and knees-up position. Before I even got inside, the Taycan showed off one of its party tricks. Air suspension is standard fit, but Taycans can now be equipped with the optional Porsche Active Ride system, which instantly lifts it off the ground by 55mm to ease entry into the cabin. While 55mm may not sound much, it makes a big difference, given how low-slung the Taycan is. The updated UI is more user-friendly; there are ‘Turbonite’ Porsche badges inside and on the exterior. The interior is more or less the same, but there are changes to the interface for the infotainment screens to make it more user-friendly. The Turbo and Turbo S also get the Porsche emblem finished in ‘Turbonite’, much like on the exterior, and buyers can opt for a fully leather interior or one with sustainable materials, in line with the EV’s green cred. The car retains its four-screen layout, including one for the passenger, which gets a special coating so that it can’t distract the driver. The rear seat has good room, but the seating position is low and knees-up. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift ride and handling 'Leans' while cornering to minimise body movement The Taycan's handling belies its near-2.3-ton kerb weight. Circling back to the new Porsche Active Ride, this system is a technological marvel. Sure, Dubai’s pristine roads aren’t the best place to judge a car’s ride, but the Taycan walks the tightrope between handling and comfort with precision like few others. Around bends, it ‘leans’ like a motorcycle to maximise corner speed, and it also compensates for body movements like squatting and diving while accelerating or braking. The entire system is so clever that it does without anti-roll bars. And despite sitting on huge 21-inch wheels (Turbo S), the ride feels quite supple. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard fitments Handling is typical Porsche, which means the Taycan corners flat, and there’s tremendous grip, too. With the way it changes direction, you won’t be able to tell it weighs nearly 2.3 tonnes. That, coupled with the sharp and responsive steering, makes it the best-handling four-door EV on the market. The brakes are immense as well, and you get a good feel from the pedal. It’s worth noting that the Turbo S gets carbon ceramic brakes as standard. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift performance 0-100kph takes 2.7 seconds Immediate power delivery helps the Taycan Turbo S match the 911 Turbo's performance. On the move, the Taycan Turbo feels absolutely manic. With a max output of 884hp and 890Nm from its dual-motor setup, there’s always so much power in reserve that you can barely floor the throttle for a couple of seconds before doing illegal speeds. Mind you, the limit is 120kph in certain parts of the UAE. From a standstill, 100kph is dismissed in just 2.7 seconds – that’s as quick as the 992-gen 911 Turbo! And as it’s an EV, there’s no delay or lag in performance. Moreover, the clever Porsche Torque Vectoring system keeps all wheels in check without losing traction. That makes acceleration almost a non-event, aside from the ferocity with which it launches forward – that simply scrambles your brain. But there’s no getting away from the distinctive lack of sound, which, in a Porsche of all the cars, is essential to the driving experience. Taycan Turbo S develops 952hp and up to 1,110Nm Next up is the Turbo S, which dials things up even further. Power is now up to an eye-watering 952hp (from 761hp) while torque is up to 1,110Nm (from 1,050Nm) with the ‘Overboost’ or push-to-pass function, which gives you full power for up to 10 seconds. The difference in performance between the Turbo and Turbo S is like splitting hairs. Porsche will tell you that the S does 0-100kph in just 2.4 seconds, 0.3 seconds quicker than the Turbo, but the truth is that both feel equally relentless. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift battery, range, and charging It now gets a larger yet lighter battery, more efficient regen braking and can accept charge up to 320kW. Besides the added performance, Taycans now get a larger 105kWh ‘performance’ battery that weighs less than the older 93kWh unit, revised electronics and more efficient regenerative braking. The results are more range and quicker charging times. Charging speeds bumped up by 50kW Both the Turbo and Turbo S have a combined claimed range of up to 630km (WLTP), but in urban conditions, the former is claimed to give up to 683km and the latter up to 691km. Both can accept charge at speeds of up to 320kW, up 50kW from before, and the max regen capacity is also said to have improved by 30 percent. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift price and verdict Taycan Turbo S not coming to India While the Taycan Turbo S isn't on the cards for India, the base 2WD, 4S, and Turbo are on sale here. In India, Porsche sells the Taycan 4S for Rs 1.89 crore and the Taycan Turbo for Rs 2.52 crore; the base two-wheel-drive variant is due for a launch soon. However, Porsche won’t offer the Turbo S or the Nürburgring record-holding Taycan Turbo GT here. Nevertheless, the performance from the more ‘regular’ Turbo is mind-numbingly fast, and the Taycan remains the most electrifying EV out there. The updates have only made it more compelling. Not only is it quicker, but it also has more range, can charge faster and has more tech. It remains the enthusiasts’ EV of choice – for a price, of course.
