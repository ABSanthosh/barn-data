    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/morgan-plus-six-bows-out-%C2%A397k-special-edition",
    "description": "Signature styling started with the 4/4 in 1936 Flagship roadster will be replaced with an all-new sports car late next year Morgan will end production of its Plus Six, the higher-powered, six-cylinder version of its two-tier ‘Plus’ range, early next year and replace it with a new flagship that ushers in a fresh design language for the British brand. The Plus Six’s departure will be marked by the Plus Six Pinnacle, which will be limited to just 30 examples and adopts design cues from the striking Pininfarina-styled Midsummer that was unveiled earlier this year. Morgan will also use the £96,995, 3.0-litre straight-six-powered Pinnacle to demonstrate its expanding bespoke programme, which will offer what Morgan calls “almost limitless” options. The replacement for the Plus Six, insiders have revealed to Autocar, will arrive late next year as a two-seat sports car that will not use the traditional ‘wing silhouette’ of today’s four-wheeled Morgans. The best-selling four-cylinder Plus Four – which has recently been outselling the Plus Six by roughly two to one – will be left to continue the brand’s traditional vintage styling, which started with the 4/4 back in 1936. The company has previously signalled its interest in producing a model that advances its vintage look into what design chief Jonathan Wells calls “the jet age”. For the new flagship, it seems more likely that Morgan will use lessons from the limited-edition Midsummer to produce a considerably more exclusive and upmarket model, clearly differentiated from the Plus Four, that will justify higher prices and more interest in the firm’s bespoke programme. Some people inside Morgan have been calling for this move for some time as rivals take similar approaches, Autocar understands. The new model is expected to continue to use the Plus models’ CX extruded-aluminium chassis, plus a version of the outgoing Six’s 3.0-litre BMW-derived turbocharged inline six, which currently makes 335bhp but is thought to be reliably capable of considerably higher outputs. Even at its current power rating, a Plus Six can hit 60mph from rest in 4.2sec and exceed 160mph. Extra power, perhaps as much as 380bhp, could easily lift performance further towards supercar levels. Q\u0026A: Matthew Hole, Morgan's new managing director How would you describe Morgan’s priorities? “We need to continue broadly in the direction we’re travelling. But we have recently seen the success of Midsummer, our limited-edition project with Pininfarina, and I’d say we definitely need more of that. I have also had three years working with Jon Wells and his amazing design team, and I reckon they need to be unleashed a bit more on things you might not have expected.” Does that mean different-looking Morgans in future? “There’s definitely space out there for new models that don’t look the same as the Morgans of old – as long as we also meet the expectations of our traditional customers: that’s one reason we’re keen to maintain and expand our coachbuilding skills. Our cars’ underpinnings have come a long way, but there’s catching up to do with some of the exterior. Coachbuilding allows you a lot of flexibility. Do we need more high-tech Morgans?  “We’re in no hurry to dump a lot of forward-facing technology into the cars, especially if it doesn’t add to the analogue driving experience. We’ve been doing mostly subtle mechanical stuff, like enhanced ride and handling. We’ll probably continue on that line.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/volvo-considering-ex30-sales-ramp-outside-eu-tariffs-hit",
    "description": "Firm will look to avoid inflated import costs before it shifts production to Belgium early next year Incoming European Union import tariff rises mean Volvo is considering shifting supply of its Chinese-built EX30 to non-EU markets, such as the UK, while it readies its Belgium factory to take over local market production early next year. The crossover is currently the third best-selling electric car in Europe behind the Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y but is currently manufactured in a plant run by parent firm Geely in Zhangjiakou, China. That means it is set to be hit by EU tariffs on EVs imported from China from 31 October onwards. To avoid the tariffs, Volvo has already confirmed that it will start production of the EX30 at its factory in Ghent, Belgium, where the EX40 is currently made. Work is ongoing to prepare the facility and supply chain, with EX30 manufacturing slated to begin there in the first half of 2025. Volvo CEO Jim Rowan said the tariffs present a “short-term problem” for Volvo with EX30 models sold in Europe and require the firm to either cut profits on the car or increase pricing. He hinted that could lead to a focus on markets outside the EU. “We'll start [EX30] production at our Ghent facility in Belgium in the first half of next year and then ramp up through the gears,” said Rowan. “In the meantime, we can supply that car to many other regions which are not yet affected [by tariffs]: a lot of countries in South-East Asia, and the UK is an example of that.” Volvo will launch the EX30 in the US after 2025, although cars will be supplied from Ghent due to the US’s stiff tariffs on Chinese-built EVs. Despite the challenges of tariffs, a sales slowdown and higher interest rates, Volvo slightly increased its sales in the third quarter of 2024, with sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars having doubled year on year, driven substantially by the success of the EX30. Volvo’s high proportion of electrified sales means it is ahead of its fleet emissions targets in the EU and other markets, and the firm has acknowledged it could look to sell some of those spare credits to other car makers. Volvo financial chief Johan Ekdahl said: “We are one of the reasonably few in a good spot when it comes to our EV penetration in terms of potential credits. That is a potential significant upside. We don't guide on specific amounts because it requires negotiations with other parties, and it's not something we'll rely upon for our financial ambitions – but there is a potential reasonably substantial upside.”",

    "description": "The Pulsar 125, in its Classic guise, continues to be a massive seller for Bajaj, but the company needed something fresh and youthful to address the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R. After all, those two have carved out a new segment of about 50,000-60,000 sales per month. The N125 is Bajaj’s answer, and the interesting thing is that it has nothing to do with any other Pulsar before it. Bajaj Pulsar N125 design, colours, quality  Bajaj wanted to make a 125 that weighed 125 kilos (which is nearly 20kg less than the existing 125cc Pulsar models), and that necessitated an entirely new platform. The N125 also carries a new design language, and it’s great to see that this isn’t just another Pulsar wearing a familiar set of clothes. Plenty of floating panels all over and a rather un-Pulsar-like headlamp bring freshness to the design philosophy. But there’s also familiarity in elements like the shape of the tank extensions as well as the new take on the twin-slash brake lamps.  While so much aero-inspired bodywork on a tiny 125 is almost purely for aesthetics, the vents on the front mudguard shroud are actually functional. The story goes that the initial design did not have any vents, but the engine development team complained to the design department that their air-cooled engine wasn’t getting enough flow, which is why the vents were incorporated.  There are some unusual touches, like the body panel along the side of the subframe. We’re used to seeing this kind of bodywork at the tail section on most motorcycles, but it finds itself positioned between the rider and pillion seat on the N125. This has the effect of adding mass to the design but also keeps the tail quite slim. The fat fork shrouds do a good job of masking the skinny 30mm telescopic fork, but while they certainly give the bike more presence, some may find them to be excessively wide. Quality levels are decent, but some visible panel gaps on our bike do leave room for improvement. In all, the N125 has a striking design that will be a little polarising yet also easily identifiable, especially in the funky colour schemes Bajaj has gone with. It doesn’t have the same ‘big-bike’ look as the Hero Xtreme 125R, but it certainly stands out, and that’s a good thing. Bajaj Pulsar N125 ride and handling The seating position is more or less what you’d expect from a bike like this. At 795mm, the seat height isn’t the lowest in the class, but it’s still very manageable, and the seats are spacious and comfortable. The footpeg placement is a little sporty, which goes well with a bike like this. However, the narrow handlebar felt a bit too ‘commutery’, which slightly dilutes the special feeling a bike like this should have.  Happily, the new chassis makes up for this in its sheer lightness and behaviour. 125kg is nearly on par with the TVS Raider, and just like that bike, the N125 has a delightfully nimble, easy-going character without any nervousness. Bajaj let us experience this on a go-kart track, and the N125 was genuinely good fun, displaying an eagerness to change direction and lean over. The footpeg placement enabled plenty of cornering clearance without any scraping, and the bike never displayed any fidgety moments you might expect with a very light machine. The MRF tyres were nice and grippy in this situation as well, and the only thing I’d have liked was a bit more initial sharpness in the front brake. Bajaj Pulsar N125 engine refinement, mileage Nevertheless, the N125’s dynamics will translate into an enjoyable experience on densely packed city roads. Going nicely with this is a very light clutch effort, which they say is 50 percent less than the competition. With 12hp, the new engine is the most powerful in the segment alongside the NS125, but this bike has a much better power-to-weight ratio of nearly 100hp/tonne. More importantly, the engine is smooth and tractable, and it makes a nice sound as well. While the strong acceleration only arrives at quite high revs, the engine can also pull you along in third gear (out of 5) as low as 20kph, which is crucial in a city bike like this.  Refinement is excellent, but I noticed that the motor would stall if the revs got too low without any of the typical warning signs (like a juddering sound or feel) that come when an engine’s revs get too low. This isn’t really an issue on its own, but the problem arises in that the N125 doesn’t have a gear position indicator or even a rev counter. With its tractable nature, you will often find yourself riding around at rather low revs in heavy traffic, and that’s when these stalls can catch you out, so it’s something you’ll need to learn to work around. Bajaj claims a 0-60kph time of 6 seconds and a top speed of 97kph, although you’ll see over 110kph on the display. The bike hits about 80kph quickly, and overall performance feels up to the mark of the best in the segment. The company also claims an overall fuel efficiency of about 60kpl. Bajaj Pulsar N125 price, features and verdict One of the big success factors with bikes like the Raider and Xtreme 125R is that they offer the looks and feature set of bigger 150-200cc machines. When it comes to the latter, the Pulsar N125 isn’t quite up there with its rivals. On the one hand, it has a front disc brake and LED head/tail lamps as standard, while the top model gets Bluetooth connectivity and a silent start/start-stop system. But then it misses important things like a rev counter, gear position indicator or single-channel ABS – although Bajaj says it will introduce the latter if there’s demand. While the Pulsar N125 probably won’t sway buyers with segment-leading features, it has most of the essential fundamentals in place, the key among them being the price. At Rs 95,000 for the base model and 98,000 for the top model, it is more affordable than a similarly specced Raider and on par with the Hero Xtreme 125R. As of now, we can’t confirm whether it’s the best in its segment, but the new Pulsar N125 definitely has a fighting chance.  Also See: Bajaj Pulsar N125 video review",

    "description": "To say the Kia Carnival was a high-risk, high-reward product would be an understatement as big as the MPV itself. At the time of its launch in February 2020, the brand had only been in India for six months, and though its first product, the Seltos, was a runaway success, Kia was yet to become a household name.  To then launch a premium diesel MPV positioned above the near-untouchable Toyota Innova Crysta, and that too with an investment in local assembly? It sounded crazy. Sure, it sold nowhere near as many units as the rest of Kia’s products (or the Innova), averaging about 3,600 units a year, but it carved a niche for itself deep enough to warrant a sequel. Perhaps not many knew that the 2020 Carnival for India was really a 2014 model globally (Gen 3: YP) that was at the end of its life; in fact, the next model (Gen 4: KA4) was simultaneously going on sale in other markets. But, the YP lived on in India until April 2023, when it succumbed to the BS6 Phase II emissions norms.  New Carnival is a generation-and-a-half leap over its predecessor. However, rather than just launching the KA4 (it was shown at the 2023 Auto Expo) immediately, Kia opted to wait until it got a facelift so India would get the latest model possible and not lag the rest of the world like last time, and that’s the car you see here. 2024 Kia Carnival colours, dimensions, exterior design History lesson over, let’s talk about the new Carnival, whose basic premise hasn’t changed much. It’s still a massive vehicle, at 5,155mm long, 1,995mm wide and 1,775mm tall, with an E-class-like 3,090mm wheelbase, which are gains of just 40mm, 10mm, 20mm and 30mm, respectively, over the previous car.  It carves a silhouette similar to the previous car, even using the exact size of wheels - 18 inches, with a set of chunky tyres. Look closely, and you’ll notice the bonnet is longer, taller and more horizontal, while the front overhang is 20mm shorter and the rear overhang 30mm longer, all of which give it slightly more SUV-like proportions.  Wheel size at 18 inches is exactly the same as the previous Carnival.  Since this design is a facelift of a generation jump, the details are far removed from the previous car and in line with the newest Kias. The ‘Tiger Nose’ grille is wide, and hovering above it are LED strips that join the tall, slim headlamps pushed out to the very sides of the nose. Lighting is via prominent ‘ice cube’ LED projector elements stacked vertically, and even the fog lamps at the base of the bumper look similar. Spot the radar element in the centre of the air dam. To break the monotony of the slabby sides is a vertical dappled brushed silver trim piece, as well as a black element between the doors. Sadly, the exposed rail over the rear wheel arch for the sliding rear door returns and is an eyesore, as is the huge gap under the floor (for the same purpose), which you’ll see when you open the door.  Horizontal strip connecting the tail lamps help accentuate the width of the MPV.  The rear, similar to the front, adopts slim vertical LEDs joined by a thin horizontal strip, highlighting the added width, while a brushed metal trim element in the bumper adds some character. The rear wiper, meanwhile, is hidden under the spoiler when not in use.  Incidentally, the powered tailgate opening is wider than before, giving even better access to the mammoth 627-litre boot – that’s with all the seats in place, by the way, thanks to a deep underfloor storage as before, and Kia says it will hold four large suitcases. Fold everything down, and you’re looking at 2,900 litres of space.  Deep underfloor helps free up some additional storage in the boot.  The 2024 Kia Carnival is available in just two colours - Fusion Black and Glacier White Pearl - as that, the brand says, made up the bulk of the previous car’s sales. A small hint at the target demographic, if you will. 2024 Kia Carnival interior space and comfort Where the previous model offered 7-, 8-, or 9-seat configurations, the new Kia Carnival only comes in top-spec Limousine+ spec, with seven seats in a 2-2-3 layout. This was by far the most popular layout in the previous model, owing to buyers primarily purchasing it for second-row use.  The pair of vast captain’s chairs slide back and forth manually, requiring some muscle to move their bulk; that’s easier done once seated. They also slide left to right, but this is actually a functional requirement rather than a cool gimmick, as it might seem. With seats in their outermost position, you have ‘access mode’, placing them closer to the doors but also creating a gap between them to access the third row – the only access available. However, in this mode, their fore-and-aft movement is limited, so to access their full potential, they have to be pushed inward to the centre. Middle row captain chairs slide back and forth as well as left to right.  With this done, you can slide it a few inches further back and a few more still if you fold the third row away. And having them in the centre means they don’t foul with the third-row armrests, so you can fully recline the backrest and extend the ottoman with sufficient space to stretch out. For still more space, there’s a ‘boss mode’ to move the front passenger seat forward.  There’s even some height adjustment on the second row, and you can vary the seat base angle to an almost comical level. These functions, along with the recline and ottoman, are now powered, but the controls are oddly located on the inner side of the squabs, making them difficult to reach when the seats are pushed together. There's lots of adjustability for the second-row, including a powered ottoman. In terms of creature comforts, the second row once again gets its own separate sunroof; the seats are heated and ventilated; there are manual window shades; and there’s a pair of USB-C chargers, unusually located in the seat backs of the first row. The cup holders, too, are between the front seats, so if you have the second row slid back, you won’t be able to reach them.  There is a third climate zone for the second and third rows, but the AC controls are once again oddly located on the right side of the roof, above the driver’s seat, and you only get four small roof-mounted AC vents. That said, cooling didn’t seem to be a problem during our drive. The third row is a three-seat bench, which feels tight for three adults but just right for two, though the placement of the seat belts might restrict you. The headroom is decent; you can recline the backrest, and with the sheer range of fore and aft sliding for the second row, legroom can be either too little or a whole lot. So, as long as the middle seats are kept upright, there can be sufficient space for all. Third-row is a three-seat bench, but best only for two adults The front seats are big and comfortable, though a little firm in the upper back area. They’re ventilated and heated, with 12-way power adjustment and memory function for the driver. 2024 Kia Carnival features and safety Much like with the exterior, the cabin design and layout feel like the biggest leap forward for the Carnival. While the previous one was well-built, decently kitted out and practical, its look was decidedly last-generation. This one elevates things in every area, with the same futuristic design as all modern Kias. Dashboard is in line with latest Kias and material quality is really good. There’s a clean and horizontal layout to the dash, accentuated by the strip of ambient lighting on the passenger side and the slim AC vents in the centre. Below these, you’ll find a context-sensitive touch panel that switches between HVAC and audio controls, which looks cool but is frustrating to use in a hurry.  Further down is a wide central console that really highlights the space between driver and passenger, and it’s put to good use with a big storage bin, wireless charging tray, USB-C ports and large cup holders. The gear lever has made way for a crystalline rotary selector that looks and feels upmarket. Switchable HVAC and audio controls are frustrating to use in a hurry. In fact, that sensation is only enhanced by excellent material quality all around and generous use of soft-touch materials, typical of a modern Kia. A particularly high-quality touch is the row of metallic toggle switches for seat heating and ventilation and a few other functions. The twin 12.3-inch curved screen array feels bang up to date with its free-standing and hood-free design, and the graphics especially make it look techy and state-of-the-art. Touch sensitivity and smoothness aren’t up there with the best in the industry and are about the same as you’ll find in a Seltos; some might expect more at this price.  12.3-inch touchscreen looks slick and techy, and packs in a lot of functionality. The 12-speaker Bose audio system fills up the large cabin nicely, while other feature highlights include ADAS with Level 2 autonomous capability, eight airbags, a heads-up display, and powered, sliding rear doors that can be operated from the handle, the driver’s seat or even the key fob. 2024 Kia Carnival mileage, ride comfort and driving impressions The changes to the mechanical makeup might seem nonexistent at first glance, but there are a few important ones. For instance, the engine might still be a 2.2-litre diesel, but it’s an all-new unit that, crucially, moves from a cast-iron block to an aluminium one. The steering, meanwhile, uses electronic power assistance rather than hydraulic, which is another big difference. 2.2-litre diesel engine now uses an aluminium block instead of a cast-iron block. Power and torque are actually lower, at 193hp and 441Nm, and while Kia didn’t quote a figure, the kerb weight will no doubt have gone up. It doesn’t appear to have affected the driving character too much, though, and the Carnival’s powertrain remains unhurried but ample; Kia quotes a 0-100kph time of 10.7 seconds.  The 8-speed torque-converter automatic, too, isn’t the most eager, and that’s just as well in a big MPV, but its reluctance to kick down a gear quickly for an overtake can be annoying when you need it in a hurry. There’s a sport mode and paddle shifters, too, but you’ll seldom find yourself using them. While the obvious benefit of the aluminium diesel engine is weight reduction, the unfortunate side effect is greater engine noise. And though not loud and clattery like that of an Innova Crysta, it is something a premium vehicle at this price point should do without. New Carnival's performance is unhurried but ample. Kia has admirably stuck to its big diesel powerplant at a time when many are switching to petrol or hybrid, and apart from strong pulling power on the highway, its other advantage in a big car is fuel economy. The Kia Carnival’s fuel economy is rated at 14.85kpl by ARAI, but even in our day of hectic driving and shooting, we managed a respectable 10.9kpl. Ride comfort is also important in a chauffeur-driven car like this, and the new Carnival largely delivers. It was a wise choice to stick to the same size of wheels and their chunky 235/60 R18 tyres, as they do provide a degree of cushioning to the ride. Overall, though, it offers a solid and stable ride at high speed, with some harshness over larger bumps. Ride quality is solid and stable, with some harshness over larger bumps. The new electric power steering (EPS) makes this big MPV very easy to manoeuvre at low speeds, and even when making lane changes on the highway, it gives a degree of confidence to the driver. That said, the previous hydraulic unit wasn’t noticeably heavy or cumbersome, particularly compared to that of an Innova Crysta. 2024 Kia Carnival price and verdict With the generation-and-a-half leap that the Kia Carnival has taken, the advances over its predecessor are clear to see. It’s most evident in the features and tech, which now feel contemporary and right up there with the best. The updated look, which is modern and even a bit rugged, also adds to the appeal.  For all the updates, however, the basic proposition remains the same: that of a luxurious MPV that pampers the chauffeur-driven owner in the middle row with vast space and the ability to stretch out while also providing space for three more in the back and lots of luggage. As such, then, its price of Rs 63.9 lakh (ex-showroom), a jump of Rs 20 lakh (it is locally assembled as before), feels excessive. The fact is that MPVs are gaining better acceptance as desirable luxury transport; Kia, as a brand, has grown in stature, and buyers are willing to spend more. And Kia has chosen to make the most of it. There’s a gap between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1 crore (bookended by two very capable hybrid Toyotas), and while the old Carnival was positioned at the lower end of this space, it’s now moved up to the middle.   Carnival delivers in spades as a chauffeur-driven vehicle, but the price hike feels excessive. On paper, the updates might not seem to justify it, but the truth is people are willing to spend for the premium chauffeur-driven experience, as evidenced by the 3,000-plus bookings the new Carnival has received since launch, despite its price. And when it comes to delivering that experience, there’s no doubt the new Carnival has got the goods. Also See: New Kia Carnival video review",

In that time, the South African designer became infamous for designing bikes that were polarizing at first but went on to become successful. The Ducati 999’s boxy bodywork and stacked headlights upset Ducati purists, but it was wildly successful on the race track. The Ducati Hypermotard was a massive departure from the Italian marque’s usual fare, but it was immensely popular among riders. And the Ducati Multistrada 1000 DS, although goofy as heck, went on to spawn one of Ducati’s most successful model ranges.

Many find it charming in stock form too, thanks to its quirky early-2000s adventure bike aesthetic. But not Žiga Petek. The man behind Slovenia’s Gas\u0026Retro workshop ranks metal fabrication as his favorite aspect of custom bike building. So the amount of plastic on the iconic Honda thumper grinds his gears. With a 2002-model Honda NX650 Dominator on his bench, he set out to rid it of its stock body panels and dress it in as much metal as possible. Much to Žiga’s chagrin, the bike still wears a pair of plastic Acerbis fork protectors. A set of handmade guards would have been preferable, but the project’s scant 49-day timeline didn’t leave much wiggle room.…",

    "description": "BMW has said it will build the Skytop roadster in limited numbers, and the concept was shown at the recent Villa d’Este Concorso d’Elegance. The limited-production model appears to draw inspiration from the BMW Z8, resulting in a luxurious two-seat GT equipped with a V8 engine. BMW Skytop is based on 8 Series Gets unique styling, bespoke materials Will be limited to 50 units only BMW Skytop roadster: only 50 units to be made According to the brand, only 50 units of the Skytop roadster will be made now and all of them have been already called for. While the prices have not been disclosed, we can expect them to be sold at nearly $1 million each. While there are no pictures of the production model yet, the car will stick to the concept’s design and powertrain. The stylish Skytop roadster is based on the existing 8 Series and retains BMW’s iconic kidney grille, with two separate illuminated elements and horizontal slats. It gets ultra-thin LED headlights and huge vents on the bonnet. The boot features a distinctive central divider that mirrors the one on the bonnet and curves up into a small ducktail spoiler. On the inside, the cabin is wrapped in brown leather. It gets the latest generation of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system, a fully digital driver’s display, a familiar shifter for the automatic gearbox, and a conventional multifunction steering wheel.   BMW Concept Skytop: powertrain details Just like the concept, the production model will come with with BMW’s most powerful V8 engine, i.e., the 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged unit that powers the top-end M cars and produces up to 643hp in its highest state of tune.

    "description": "Mahindra Racing has revealed its 2025 Formula E challenger – the M11Electro, which will be driven by Nyck de Vries and Edoardo Mortara. The upcoming season will feature the new Gen3 Evo cars, which will introduce all-wheel drive for the very first time, along with new tyres and revised bodywork. And after a couple of difficult seasons, Mahindra is pinning its hopes on the M11Electro to revitalise its form in the championship. New Gen3 Evo cars have a 0-100kph time of 1.86 seconds Get all-wheel drive for the first time Mahindra targeting better efficiency this year Mahindra M11Electro – What’s new? The M11Electro sports a new metallic red, satin silver and carbon black livery. But the changes go beyond just a fresh look. At the centre of the project is a new powertrain developed by Mahindra Racing, along with revised aerodynamic, suspension and rear-end packages. The headlining figure for the new Gen3 Evo cars is a 0-100kph time of 1.86 seconds, which is claimed to be 30 percent quicker than current F1 cars. All-wheel drive will also be available for the first time in Formula E, but this can only be unlocked during qualifying duels, race starts and Attack Mode. In the last two seasons, drivers have struggled to convert their Attack Mode boosts into overtaking moves. But de Vries believes the introduction of all-wheel drive will change this. “The race strategy will likely change a little bit,” he said. “The impact of having four-wheel drive in Attack Mode is going to be greater, so we expect to gain more lap time and performance when we’re activating it. It will be a tool that can be used to make up positions, whereas I feel in the last two seasons, with the style of racing, it was more something you wanted to get rid of.” The Gen3 Evo car also gets a new front wing, rear winglets, and a narrower nose. The all-weather Hankook tyres have been revised to provide more grip as well. Mahindra chasing gains in Formula E Season 11 Some sweeping changes have been made at Mahindra Racing since ex-FIA senior Frederic Bertrand joined the team as CEO in late 2022. He’s always maintained that Mahindra’s Formula E resurgence will be a long-term project, and despite facing a challenging start to the 2024 season, the team did become regular points scorers towards the end. Bertrand is hoping to continue this upward trajectory in 2025. “It’s definitely been a busy time for the whole team because we know that with every regulation change in Formula E comes an opportunity to move up the field,” he said. “Last season was all about putting a framework for success in place, not just hiring two world-class drivers but optimising our engineering and performance departments so that they are able to extract the maximum possible. We started to see the benefits of that towards the end of last season, and I’m hoping Season 11 will be a continual improvement from that.” He further added that the team is targeting a P5-P6 spot in the championship next season. One key area where Mahindra is chasing gains is efficiency. Bertrand admits that this is something that held the team back last season, limiting how much drivers could attack and defend since they were losing too much energy. “One of the expectations is additional efficiency so that we can start the race with more ambition because we’re not limited by the idea that we will be too short on energy. That was definitely one of the things that was driving a lot of our strategy last season,” he explained. “Last season we knew that we would struggle, and we did. We hope that this car [the M11Electro] is able to bring us into the midfield. If we can end the season around P5-P6 in the championship as a manufacturer and as a team, I think it would be a good step for us. If we can do more and go for the podium, we will push for it.” Mahindra says testing with the M11Electro has been “very positive” to date and the team is now gearing up for the official pre-season test in Valencia from November 4-7.
