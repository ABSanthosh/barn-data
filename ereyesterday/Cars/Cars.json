    "description": "The GP Tech V4 suit serves as a replacement for my Missile Ignition suit, which has served me very well for the past five years. The GP Tech V4 costs about half of what you’d pay for the top Racing Absolute suit used by the top racers, but it incorporates many of the learnings and top-tier materials that you will find there. The biggest improvement for me is the overall fit and comfort. The first time I wore this suit, I was in it from 8am to 4pm, with much of that time being spent hanging around the pit area. Normally, that would have been a rather uncomfortable experience, but the GP Tech was surprisingly pleasant. Much of this goes to all the work Alpinestars has put into incorporating stretch panels in strategic spots, but it’s also down to the materials. This suit uses kangaroo leather in certain panels on the chest, arms and legs, and this material has the benefit of being lighter than the usual bovine leather. I was surprised to see that the armour used is CE Level 1, but the reasoning is that it resides behind tough, hard shell protectors on the shoulders, elbows and knees, which amps up the safety but keeps weight and bulk down. The GP Tech V4 uses kangaroo leather in select areas. From a fit standpoint, the GP Tech V4 is superb once you squeeze into it, and the only thing that caught my attention was that it felt a bit tight behind the knees. However, this was only a problem when standing and not on the bike. My sole gripe is that the leather around the chest area bunches up slightly at the seams, which causes no functional issues, but it doesn’t look great. There are some innovative materials in use here, including Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. This helps reduce the heat buildup when leather drags on the tarmac at high speed, which can burn the skin. Then, there’s the MATRYX® material, which uses a combination of Kevlar and polyamide yarn and promises high levels of abrasion resistance as well as excellent breathability. The suit uses Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. Breathability is excellent, and there are even little intake ducts built into the hard armour on the shoulder and knees. One thing worth noting is that this suit is airbag-compatible but only with the newer systems. Older Astars airbag vests that need to be zipped into the suit don’t seem to be compatible with this one. Vents are built into the hard armour for better airflow. At around 2,000 dollars, the price for the GP Tech V4 hasn’t changed compared to its predecessor. You can get much more affordable suits for sure, even from Alpinestars, but if you’re a racetrack regular looking for the next step in comfort and protection, you’ll love the GP Tech V4.

    "description": "The Land Rover Defender, five years into its second-generation run, remains a tour de force in the world of SUVs. Defying the norms of typical automotive life cycles, the Defender’s appeal continues to grow rather than fade. Global sales are closing in on the 4,00,000 mark, a testament to its enduring charm and versatility. But rather than rest on its laurels, Land Rover has taken its most daring step yet with the introduction of the Defender Octa – a luxury off-roader conceived to play at the pointy end of the high-performance SUV market along with the mighty Mercedes-AMG G 63, Porsche Cayenne and Lamborghini Urus. The brief was very simple – make the Octa the fastest off-roader in the world. But what does that exactly mean? Is it about Nürburgring lap times? Racing up sand dunes? Rock-crawling prowess? Or the ability to bomb down a gravel road sideways with a family and a boot full of their luggage? Land Rover’s answer: all of the above. Plus, it will make its Dakar Rally debut in 2026. Yes, the Octa is out to make a statement – a big, bold, go-anywhere, do-anything statement – and live up to its name. And in case you were wondering, the name ‘Octa’ takes inspiration from the octahedral shape of a diamond, a nod to both the beauty and unparalleled toughness of this precious stone. Defender Octa engine and mechanical upgrades BMW-sourced twin-turbo V8 makes 635hp and 750Nm The twin-turbo V8 produces 635hp and 750Nm. To acquire such a repertoire of talents, the Defender Octa had to be much more than just a beefed-up version of the standard Defender 110. It represents a wholesale reengineering effort aimed at elevating performance both on and off the road. At its heart lies a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine sourced from BMW, tuned to deliver a staggering 635hp and 750Nm of torque, which jumps to 800Nm when using Dynamic Launch Mode. This V8 is a ‘hot-vee’ with twin turbochargers within the two-cylinder banks, which improves driveability. This engine also has a mild hybrid system that gives an extra 27hp and 175Nm of torque.  This immense power enables the Octa, a 2.5-tonne SUV, to sprint from 0 to 100kph in just 4.0 seconds – performance on par with some sports cars. New 6D suspension includes hydraulically interlinked, triple-valve dampers controlling pitch and roll On rocky trails, the Octa has an astonishing ability to clamber over boulders with calculated precision. However, the Octa’s true innovation lies in its all-new 6D suspension system. While the standard Defender employs air suspension with adaptive damping and mechanical anti-roll bars, the Octa ditches traditional anti-roll bars in favour of hydraulically interlinked, triple-valve dampers that control pitch and roll in real-time. This semi-active suspension setup provides unprecedented body control, enhancing both on-road agility and off-road capability. The front and rear axles have been moved forward (by 4mm and 3mm, respectively) to accommodate the larger tyres and extra ride height to give a lofty ground clearance of 323mm. Wheel articulation? Up by 100mm to a massive 500mm. Approach, departure, and breakover angles? All improved (40.2, 42.8, and 29 degrees, respectively). There’s a larger intake at the front to keep the engine cool, a powder-coated metal undershield for added protection, and an extended bar at the rear shielding a pair of auxiliary radiators. Octa is the fastest and toughest ever Defender With this trick suspension, the Octa achieves a level of wheel articulation and off-road capability that sets new benchmarks in the SUV segment. This isn’t just the fastest Defender ever – it’s the toughest, too. Standing 28mm taller and 68mm wider than the standard Defender, the Octa’s pumped-up wheel arches add some serious presence, but it still looks like a Defender – just one that’s spent a lot of time in the gym. The optional matte protective film adds a military-spec ruggedness, though the carbon fibre accents on the bonnet and interior might be a bit much for some tastes. 20- and 22-inch tyres options on offer The Defender Octa can be specced with three tyre options tailored for different terrains. The 22-inch road-focused tyres are perfect for urban and highway use, while the 20-inch all-terrain tyres strike a balance between on-road comfort and off-road prowess. For the ultimate off-road experience, the Goodyear DuraTrac RT Advanced All-Terrain tyres provide durability and unparalleled grip on loose surfaces. Defender Octa off-road and on-road performance Not a match for the Urus or Cayenne on road In off-road mode, ground clearance is 323mm. Leaving Cape Town, the first thing I notice is the steering response, which is nippier than a standard Defender’s – the result of borrowing the quicker steering rack from the Range Rover Sport. The Octa turns in keenly, feeling surprisingly agile for such a large machine. It won’t match a Lamborghini Urus or Porsche Cayenne for outright handling precision, but it’s not far off. And let’s be real – nobody would dare take those road-oriented SUVs deep into the wilderness. The optional 275/60 R20 Goodyear DuraTractyres (fitted to our test car) do impact on-road grip, but they were necessary for tackling the extreme terrain of our South African test route. Driving on empty and smooth South African roads, the handling felt a bit ‘woolly’, and I had to make constant steering corrections. The chunky tread pattern drummed up some road noise, too. Most Octa buyers will likely opt for the Michelin all-season tyres on 22-inch alloys, which should transform on-road performance and offer a more direct or connected feel. We’ll need to revisit the car on those to get the full picture. New 4.4-litre V8 misses the drama of the old 5.0-litre supercharged V8 With the right tyres, the Octa can munch tarmac at a blistering pace. Tarmac roads also gave the opportunity to prod the performance of the Octa, which is simply staggering. The BMW-sourced 4.4-litre V8 is a different kind of beast compared to the old-school supercharged 5.0-litre V8. It’s more refined, less unruly, but no less potent. Flat out, the Octa pulls hard all the way to 7,000rpm, with a relentless surge of power. The twin-turbo V8 is smooth, muscular, and effortlessly quick. But compared to the old supercharged unit, it’s missing that raw edge – the deep-chested growl, the theatrical pops and crackles. That said, in any gear, at any speed, just floor it, and this thing absolutely flies. A proper V8 is always something to celebrate, and this one is no exception. Lofty driving position gives you a commanding view. The ZF 8-speed torque converter auto is the best in the business, seamlessly and swiftly managing the grunt with smooth shifts. The drivetrain has been seriously reinforced with stronger propshafts, beefier driveshafts, high-tensile steel joints, and a toughened rear diff – all built to handle the extra torque. The bespoke quad-pipe exhaust is tuned to balance performance with the Defender’s class-leading wading ability. Octa is far more capable off-road than the already formidable standard Defender Defender Octa off-road specsWater wading1,000mmGround clearance323mm (max)Approach angle40.2degDeparture angle42.8degRamp angle29deg The Defender Octa takes the already formidable off-road capabilities of the standard Defender and dials them up to an entirely new level. On rocky trails, it exhibits an almost supernatural ability to clamber over boulders and steep inclines with calculated precision. The Octa’s added ground clearance and increased wheel articulation make it feel unstoppable. The terrain response system does most of the work, letting the electronic differentials and suspension handle the trickiest sections with minimal driver input. Even when faced with a near-impassable climb, the Octa methodically claws its way up, throttle response so precise that you feel like you’re advancing one tread block at a time. Engage the off-road cameras, and you’ll watch in disbelief as obstacles that appear insurmountable disappear under the wheels with barely a scrape. In the sand, the Defender Octa is equally impressive. Drop the tyre pressures to 20psi, engage the Octa mode, and it transforms into a desert-storming beast. The V8’s abundant torque ensures that maintaining momentum – critical for dune driving – is effortless, while the advanced software monitors suspension movements to optimise damping in real time. Engage Octa mode and it transforms into a desert-storming beast. It’s on fast dirt tracks where the Octa truly sets itself apart. Engage Octa mode, and the Defender transforms from a rugged off-roader into something that feels more at home in the Dakar Rally. With roll control dialled back and the damping force cranked up, it stays composed while hammering over rough terrain at high speeds. The faster steering rack keeps you locked into the front axle, making corrections easy and intuitive. You can initiate a slide and let the Octa dance through corners with surprising agility for something this big and heavy. The recalibrated ABS and powerful Brembo brakes ensure you can scrub off speed effectively, whether you’re blasting down a dirt road or picking your way down a near-vertical descent. So, whether creeping over boulders, gliding over dunes, or charging through rally-style dirt tracks, the Defender Octa is an absolute weapon. Defender Octa exterior design Octa looks even more muscular than regular Defender 110 After an intense day of driving, we arrive at BushmansKloof, a fabulous resort in the middle of nowhere surrounded by scrubby desert. Taking a break at this luxurious oasis, I get a chance to have a proper look at the Octa to see what’s new. The real standout features are the bulging wheel arches and the massive tyres that fill them. That alone gives the Octa street cred like no other SUV. For the first year of production, the Octa will be available in this Edition One variant, which gets some exclusive colours and bits of carbon fibre. On the C-pillar, there’s an Octa badge, but it isn’t eight-sided or octahedral; it does look like a diamond. The other distinguishing factor is the quad exhausts neatly tucked away under the rear bumpers. So, all in all, the Octa Defender still looks like a Defender, but with a bit of muscle. Defender Octa interior features and comfort Octa looks even more muscular than regular Defender 110 Functional and quality interiors similar to the standard Defender. The interiors are pretty much Defender, but there are some specific Octa touches. The Performance front seats are new; they get integrated headrests, 14-way adjustment, and can be heated and cooled. There are specific colour themes for the Octa, and you tell the steering wheel apart from the standard Defender just by the Octa button. The minute you activate Octa mode, the paddle shifters glow, which is pretty cool. Selecting Octa mode illuminates the paddles. What is not cool is the aircon system, which struggled in what was peak summer in South Africa, with ambient temperatures hitting 42 degrees Celsius. With the temperature dialled down to the lowest cooling setting and the blower speed cranked up to seven, the cabin was just about cool but far from cold. Aircon struggled to cool cabin in 42 deg C. The Defender’s AC uses a variable-geometry piston compressor, which is simpler and easier to maintain than the more effective scroll-type compressor. However, the real issue seems to be the mild-hybrid battery system, which needs cooling when the Octa is driven hard. In such situations, the air-conditioning system’s power is split between cooling the battery and cooling the cabin via the air vents. Defender Octa price and verdict Expected to cost Rs 1.35 crore more than the standard Defender 110 V8 The touchscreen works well and is easy to use. The Octa will officially be launched soon at an indicative price of around Rs 2.85 crore. That’s Rs 1.35 crore more than the standard Defender 110 with the 5.0 supercharged V8, but even at this price, customers will be lining up for it. It’s cheaper than the G 63 and has wider breadth of capabilities. The Octa pushes the boundaries of what an off-road SUV can do and offers an unparalleled driving experience for those willing to explore its full potential. Whether tackling the toughest trails or cruising on the highway, the Defender Octa proves there’s truly no limit to where this legendary SUV can go.

The shop sells brand new electric motorcycles alongside pre-owned gas guzzlers, and offers services on everything from vintage Harleys to modern sportbikes. Somehow, they still find time to build charming custom bikes—like this 1979 BMW R65 bobber. Fittingly, finding time was the most challenging aspect of this particular project. That’s because it was the pet project of Zen co-founder Bruce Crerar, and often had to sit on the back burner while client projects took precedence. “I’ve always been a fan of the boxer engine and some of the amazing builds people create all around the world and was inspired to try and create one for myself,” says Bruce.…",

    "description": "Range of \"at least\" 155 miles could mean the ID 1 can't go as far as the previous e-Up Volkswagen's affordable electric car is finally on the way – but with a range of only around 155 miles There’s a lot to like about the Volkswagen ID 1. In an age when cars are forever growing bigger, here’s a proper city car that's right-sized and looks great. A mainstream car brand committing to the A-segment is something to celebrate. But there’s one big concern: with a promised range of “at least” 155 miles, it’s possible the ID 1 will go on sale in 2027 with basically the same range as offered by later versions of its spiritual predecessor, the e-Up. That doesn’t feel like progress. To be fair, the ID 1 promises to be larger, more practical, more powerful and around £3000 cheaper than a new e-Up would have set you back in 2023 (and the e-Up benefitted from a government grant). Those are hard-won gains, and they haven’t been easy. Still, it’s a stark illustration of how making affordable electric cars is a huge challenge. EV batteries are slowly – glacially – getting cheaper, but they remain by far the most expensive part of a new EV. Volkswagen was determined to hit its €20,000 (£17,000) target for the ID 1, and the best way to do that is to right-size the battery for its intended urban use case. Trouble is, that requires buyers to accept a potentially unpalatable compromise. A range of 155 miles might be fine for the everyday, but what about those occasional weekend trips away? History suggests buyers are unlikely to compromise with their main or only car.  It’s concerning that, like the Renault Zoe, Nissan Leaf and e-Up in the early days of mass-market EVs a decade or so back, the likes of the ID 1 and Dacia Spring could find most success as budget second cars – a daily runaround that allows you to keep your bigger, posher car for the weekend. Which is great, but that means instead of widening access to electric mobility, the new wave of cheap EV is really providing further benefit to more affluent buyers who can afford two cars. Single-car owners on a budget who don’t want to compromise will stick with petrol. None of that is Volkswagen’s fault: it can produce cheaper EVs, but it can’t control who buys them. And in an age when so many rivals have given up on smaller, more affordable cars, credit to it for persisting in a category that is no longer a huge profit driver. It's absolutely doing the right thing. But this is a reminder that there’s a long way to go to making truly usable everyday EVs that are genuinely affordable – and that, at present, even the drive towards affordable EVs risks benefitting those who are better off.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-every1-previews-%C2%A317k-city-car-2027",
    "description": "ID Every1 uses new 94bhp motor, giving a claimed top speed of 81mph Spiritual successor to the Up is described as the 'last piece in the puzzle' in VW's line-up Volkswagen has vowed to realise its long-held goal of an ‘affordable’ £17,000 electric car in 2027 with the arrival of the production version of the new ID Every1 concept car. Described by Volkswagen as a model “from Europe for Europe”, the new car will serve as the spiritual successor to the Up as an A-segment city car and become the entry point to the German firm’s range of bespoke electric ID models. Volkswagen boss Thomas Schäfer has described the model, which will be part of the firm’s new Electric Urban Car Family, as “the last piece of the puzzle” in its mass market line-up, adding: \"this is the car the world has been waiting for.\" The production version of the ID Every1 will sit on a modified version of the new front-wheel-drive MEB Entry platform, which has been developed for the forthcoming ID 2, ID 2X, Cupra Raval and Skoda Epiq. Those models will all be built at the Seat factory in Martorell, Spain, with prices for the ID 2 starting from around £21,000 (€25,000). Volkswagen development chief Kai Grünitz said the front end of the machine from the front wheel to the A-pillar is largely the sam as the ID 2all concept, but it then uses a different, smaller battery and has a shorter wheelbase. It also features a new rear axle, which is based on that used in the current Polo.  The ID Every1 features what is described as a newly developed electric motor that produces 94bhp and gives the car a claimed top speed of 81mph. Volkswagen has provided no details of the battery capacity or what chemistry it will use but claims the model will offer a range of “at least” 155 miles.  It will also be the first Volkswagen Group model to benefit from a new software architecture that has been developed through a new joint venture with American EV start-up Rivian. For comparison with the cheapest EVs currently on sale in the UK, the Dacia Spring is priced from £14,995 and offers 44bhp and a range of 140 miles, while the £15,940 Leapmotor T03 produces 94bhp and offers 165 miles. Meanwhile, Volkswagen has previously said the ID 2 will offer 223bhp and around 280 miles. Design and styling The ID Every1 concept is likely to serve as a close preview of how the production car will look. It has chunky, upright proportions that evoke the Up. Volkswagen design chief Andreas Mindt said the goal was to create a car that offered “character and an identity that people can relate to”.  There are large LED headlights and a rounded front end that, Mindt said, is intended to make the car friendly and likeable through “a slightly cheeky smile”. The front and rear badges are illuminated. The concept features sculpted wheel arches and 19in wheels while, as is typical for an EV, the axles have been pushed to the vehicle's extremities to maximise interior space. The relatively simple silhouette and side bodywork is intended to give the car a “timeless” and “classless” design, according to Mindt. As with the ID 2all, the ID Every1’s design features a number of nods to VW’s heritage. In particular, the rear C-pillar has been designed to evoke that of the first-generation Golf. Mindt has spoken of wanting every Volkswagen model he designs to offer a “secret sauce” that helps imbue the vehicle with character. In the case of the ID Every1, Mindt cites the lowered middle section of the roof, a design concept he claimed is borrowed from sports cars. Other ‘secret sauce’ elements include the integrated third brake light in the roof recess and the new designs for the 19in alloy wheels. The ID Every1 is 3880mm long, which places it between the Up (3600mm) and Polo (4074mm). The ID2all concept that will sit above it in VW’s future electric line-up measures 4050mm. Volkswagen describes the ID Every1 as a four-seater and says it also offers a 305-litre boot – a substantial increase on the 251 litres offered by the Up.  The interior of the ID Every1 features a simple design with a prominent-looking dashboard. While the dash is dominated by a centrally mounted touchscreen, it is notable that there are physical buttons for the temperature, heating and volume controls below it. The steering wheel is a squared-off two-spoke affair. Meanwhile, the front passenger has access to a variable multi-purpose panel to which different items, such as a tablet or shelf, can be attached. A removable Bluetooth speaker is located between the driver and passenger. The centre console is similar to that offered in the ID Buzz and is mounted on a rail so that it can be slid from the front to the rear compartment. It also features pull-out shelving. ID 1’s software focus Volkswagen development chief Grünitz said the production version of the ID Every1 will be a “customer-defined vehicle” – a phrase evoking the ‘software-defined vehicle’ term that reflects the car industry’s increasing push towards vehicles designed around their computing architecture. The ID 1 will be the first model in the Volkswagen Group to use a “fundamentally new” zonal software architecture from the firm's new joint venture with American EV start-up Rivian. That new system is based on the existing software used in the Rivian R1T pick-up and R1S SUV, and is intended to be highly flexible, so it can be stripped back for the ID 1 with extra zones added for more premium models to make the software run faster and add extra features. \"The main benefit is that it's highly flexible and updatable,\" said Grünitz. \"We see that with Rivian models on the road today, which can be updated with new functions for customers on a regular basis without the need to touch them. It's really the next step.\" Grünitz did not rule out offering functions as paid-for extras that can be downloaded using software, but said that \"we don't need that\" to hit the ID 1's planned £17,000 target price, adding: \"we are not shooting in that direction today.\" While it is unusual to debut an advanced new software architecture on an entry level vehicle, VW said that showcased how important the entry level ID 1 market was to the firm. It also allows VW to learn about the software platform before it is used on the next-generation ID Golf due in the coming years. Production and future plans Volkswagen has said that the production version of the ID Every1 will be built in Europe, but has yet to commit to a specific plant. The model could initially be produced alongside the ID 2 and its siblings in Spain, although given the group has already committed to producing four models from that location, it is most likely to be built elsewhere. The ID Every1 is the first concept to be launched since the firm agreed a new ‘Future Volkswagen’ plan with unions at the end of last year. That strategy includes binding targets for future projects, including a commitment to strengthening its competitiveness by expanding its existing model range, and becoming the “technologically leading high-volume manufacturer”. Volkswagen will launch nine new models by 2027, including the production versions of both the ID 2all and ID Every1. The firm will reveal the next member of its Electric Urban Car Family, the ID 2 X crossover, in autumn this year, most likely at the Munich motor show.",

    "description": "The Hyundai Santa Fe has been adjudged the World’s Best Car for 2025 by the 82-strong, all-women panel of journalists who announced the Women's Worldwide Car of the Year (WWCOTY) awards. The panel of judges decided to make the announcement so that it coincides with the week in which International Women’s Day is celebrated.

In the subsequent round, the finalists vied for the Best Car title, and the voting is said to have been very close. “Choosing the world’s best car is a task of great responsibility. It must take into account the particularities of each market, the type of driving done, purchasing power, orography, consumer preferences... The winning car has to meet all these needs, satisfying drivers around the world,” said Marta Garcia, executive president of WWCOTY. The Hyundai Santa Fe bagged the Best Car award and also won in the Large SUV category for its innovative design and hybrid engines, among other reasons.

With AWD and hybrid variants, the Santa Fe is quite versatile.” Hyundai Santa Fe India details While there is no word on the new Santa Fe coming to India, the Korean brand is looking at bringing the Ioniq 5 facelift to our market this year, the next-gen Venue by early next year, and the third-gen Creta by 2027.

    "description": "The Tata Curvv is set to follow the Nexon, Harrier and Safari in getting a blacked-out, Dark Edition model, a leaked dealer document shows. The Curvv Dark Edition is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks, before making its debut at the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL), set to begin on March 22. Tata Curvv Dark Edition to get 125hp petrol and 118hp diesel options To be based on top-spec Accomplished trim Tata Curvv Dark Edition engine options Curvv Dark Editions to get petrol-MT, petrol-DCT, diesel-MT and diesel-DCT options Tata will offer the Curvv Dark Edition with two out of three engine options available with the mid-size coupe-SUV – the 125hp, 225Nm, 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo-petrol and the 118hp, 260Nm, 1.5-litre diesel. Both come with 6-speed manual and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox options. Tata Curvv Dark Edition price, features and variants Curvv Dark Edition prices expected to be Rs 16.5 lakh-19.6 lakh Nexon Dark Edition interior used for representation only. As the leaked image shows, the Curvv Dark Edition will be based on the top-spec Accomplished trim, and will share the same features list and safety features. Highlights include 6 airbags, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, a 9-speaker audio system, gesture-controlled tailgate, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, reclining rear seats and an ADAS suite. Considering Nexon Dark Edition prices are about Rs 40,000 higher than the trims they are based on, expect a similar hike for the all-black versions of the Curvv. This means that Curvv Dark Edition prices are expected in the Rs 16.5 lakh-19.5 lakh region for the petrol model, while the diesel is expected in the Rs 16.8 lakh-19.6 lakh bracket.

    "description": "Photos: Rosario Liberti Tuberculosis is a heck of a way to start an article about some ice racing history, and an even wilder way for a town to find its purpose, but here we are. Back in 1866, an Englishman named Arthur Edward Vansittart Strettell, while coughing his bloody lungs out, decided St. Moritz might just save his life. The pure alpine air (or luck) worked its magic, and he stuck around long enough for people to notice. Soon, more of Europe’s well-heeled started showing up,not just to breathe better, but to winter in style.   That might have been part of the beginning, but Johannes Badrutt, a Swiss hotelier, turned it into a destination. In 1864, he made a bold wager with his English summer guests: return in winter, and if you don’t love it, I’ll pay for your entire trip. They took the bet, expecting bitter cold and suffering. Instead, they found sunshine bouncing off snow-capped peaks, a winter unlike anything they had known. St. Moritz was no longer just a retreat, it is possibly the birthplace of luxury winter tourism. By the time it hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, St. Moritz was more than just ski chalets and cocktails. It was home to the Cresta Run, a skeleton track where men in tweed willingly hurled themselves face-first down a mile of ice. Horse racing? On ice. Polo? On ice. It was only a matter of time before we ended up with cars, on ice. If it could be done with risk and elegance, it happened at St. Moritz.  Fast forward to 2019, and The ICE St. Moritz started carrying that same spirit forward. But this time, instead of jockeys or sledders, it’s Ferrari 250 SWBs, Bugatti Type 35s, and Maserati 450Ss sliding across the frozen lake, their reflections blurry and fractal on the ice.  Part concours, part fever dream, spiked tires chew through ice while vintage race cars dance across a surface that was never meant for them. And then there’s the light, snow refracting golden-hour sunlight, exhaust vapor swirling in the cold. It’s a photographer’s paradise, a filmmaker’s storyboard, a dreamscape of speed and style. With a little history behind us, and that light in mind, we’re sharing a gallery of the finest photos from St. Moritz 2025. Enjoy the view.  Continue...",

    "title": "The Perfect Elixir: Lab Eleven",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ \"If a car sits too long, it starts to die.\" That is the ethos at Lab Eleven. No over-polished baubles. No overbuilt tech experiments masquerading as classics. Just 911s built to be used, built to last, and built to keep showing up for its only job, to be driven. The restomod world has a habit of missing the point. Somewhere between the bespoke interiors and the carbon fiber everything, a lot of builders lost track of why people love these cars in the first place. The formula has gotten predictable. Strip a 911 down to its studs, load it up with more power than anyone will ever use, tweak the suspension until it stops feeling a bit bitey, and then call it an improvement. It isn’t. It is just progress for the sake of it, and progress does not always move things forward. Lab Eleven is not interested in better for the sake of automotive performance theater. They are interested in better for the sake of driving. Pino La Rosa and his daughter Milena run their shop in Milan the way you would expect from people who actually care about these cars. Every Lab Eleven build starts with an accident free 993 and gets stripped down. What happens next depends on the car and the owner, but the process is always the same. Make it sharper, stronger, and more usable without killing what makes it a 911. \"We are not here to make a completely different car, we are here to make the best possible version of the car that already exists.\" That means no unnecessary gimmicks. No touchscreens, no pointless tech, no desperate attempts to make an air cooled car feel like something that rolled off a production line yesterday.  \"You should still feel the road, still hear the engine, still know what the car is doing beneath you.\"  The engines are rebuilt in three stages. A 3.6, a 3.8, or a 4.0 liter pushing anywhere from 300 to 400 horsepower. It is more than stock but not excessive, just enough to make the car feel alive. This may turn things into a bit of a handful for the rear engined uninitiated, but never more than one. Some panels are swapped for aluminum or carbon fiber, but only when it improves balance and durability. There are no qualifying laps that reward weight savings, and Colin Chapman is not breathing down your neck as you roll out of your garage. The goal is not to shave grams off a control arm or hub. It is about balance. Inside, they stick to materials that belong, wool fabrics, houndstooth, and leather that looks and feels right. Somewhere along the way, the restomod scene evolved into a competition to build the most expensive cars and coffee accessory. Machines that flick their blinkers a few times before arriving at an asphalt prison, only to be tucked back into a temperature controlled garage, polished with an overpriced orbital, and plugged into a twelve volt battery tender, the automotive equivalent of life support. Lab Eleven builds cars that need to be driven. Lab Eleven cars belong on alpine passes, winding back roads, and long stretches of open road where dirt and rock chips are part of the experience. A Porsche was never meant to be perfect. It was meant to be driven, to wear in, to collect the marks of use that prove it is alive, and when the time comes, you pass it on, imperfections and all.
