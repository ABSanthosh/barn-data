    "description": "The Crossfire 500 X is a retro-style motorcycle that embodies a mix of vintage aesthetics and modern engineering. It’s positioned as a middleweight bike, aimed at riders who want a stylish, versatile, and performance-oriented machine. Does this Austrian motorcycle have the credentials to carve its niche in the sub 500cc segment? Unfortunately, we were only allowed a glimpse at its performance inside the confines of a private property. Here’s what we discovered.  Brixton Crossfire 500 X design and features Its bold “X” tank design, which has become a signature of the Brixton line-up, tends to stand out. The minimalistic approach to bodywork, paired with LED lighting, gives it a contemporary touch while retaining the retro vibe. The Crossfire 500 X gets a long single-piece seat that felt adequately comfortable during my short stint. Its scrambler styled riding seat has a relatively accessible seat height of 795mm.  A rather budget-looking speedo The bike uses a monotone LCD speedo, which was dim and showed limited information in small fonts, making it hard to read under direct sunlight. Switchgear quality felt budget and should have been better for its asking price. While the overall design is quite eye-catching, fit and finish levels could have been better. Brixton Crossfire 500 X performance and handling The Crossfire 500 X is powered by a 486cc parallel-twin engine that is paired with a 6-speed gearbox and produces 47hp at 8,500rpm and 43Nm at 6,750rpm. Its motor feels torquey and strikes a balance between approachable performance and power delivery. The engine is smooth, with a linear torque curve that makes it easy to handle around tight corners.  It features J.Juan brakes, paired with dual-channel ABS for strong stopping power. However, the brakes lacked feedback and felt rather wooden. This motorcycle is equipped with an adjustable KYB USD fork and monoshock, which are on the softer side. The Crossfire 500 X wafts over uneven surfaces at slow speeds, but wallows over them at higher speeds. Despite that, it felt surprisingly engaging and fun around the tight bends of the premises. Unfortunately, we didn’t get a chance to test this motorcycle on public roads and it remains to be seen how the Crossfire 500 X does in the real world.  While we primarily rode the road-oriented model, Brixton also sells the Crossfire 500 XC, which is a scrambler-styled motorcycle. It is mechanically quite similar but gets larger wheels and a different design. It also costs Rs 45,000 more, and will be sold alongside the Crossfire 500 X through Motohaus’ limited dealership network.  Brixton Crossfire 500 X verdict The 500 X may lack some high-tech features, but its charm lies in its simplicity and seemingly rugged appearance. While it is priced respectably for a CKD, the Crossfire 500 X is significantly more expensive than the 650s from RE, which will be a big challenge for Brixton. LED headlamp design is eye-catching Given that Brixton is a very young brand in India and globally, Its long-term reliability and after-sales service also remain to be seen given the small footprint the brand currently holds.

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

    "description": "Beating a Porsche on the legendary Nürburgring is no mean feat, especially when the Porsche in question is the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupé. But the 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance did just that. A full-size SUV with 640hp and enough tech for an Engineering Explained video, the RS Q8 Performance might look like a standard Q8 with some blacked-out bits, but that’s the kind of thought that will have you gasping at its performance. We had it for a whole day on a race track and in the Spanish countryside to see what all is new and how much of a difference it has made. 2024 Audi RS Q8 exterior design  On the face of it, the RS Q8 Performance continues with stern expressions and almost no emotion. There is no smiling grille or angry air vents; it’s sleek, sharp and means business. What’s new over the older version are the LED Matrix headlamps with multiple daytime running lights (DRLs) options and a re-profiled grille finished in gloss black with a 3D honeycomb pattern. Wrapped around the grille is a massive carbon-fibre frame, and there’s more carbon fibre on the front lip and air vents. LED Matrix headlamps are standard. The bumpers are sportier and more aggressive than before, and what’s really nice to see is that there isn’t an ounce of chrome to be seen anywhere on the car. Over to the side, the optional 23-inch wheels look stunning (22-inch come as standard), and these help shave 20kg off the total SUV’s weight. Hidden behind these large rims are massive 420mm carbon-ceramic brake discs (standard on the Performance version) with red brake calipers. Carbon fibre on the outside rearview mirrors finishes off the changes at the side. OLED tail-lamps get customisable DRL designs. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance gets OLED tail-lamps conjoined by an LED light bar, some more honeycomb pattern on the bumper, and a gloss-black diffuser with carbon-fibre surrounds for the oval exhaust tips. Dramatic is not something you’d call the RS Q8 Performance, despite its many oversized bits and plenty of carbon-fibre trimmings (courtesy of the optional Carbon Pack). It’s the perfect look for the introverted car guy, especially in the subtle Satellite Silver paint shade. 2024 Audi RS Q8 interior and features  On the inside, the introversion is even more pronounced as there is little that will ‘wow’ you. As standard, the Performance version gets the Sport Seats Plus; these seats offer lots of bolstering and are also very comfy for long drives. And there is the same honeycomb pattern with Race-Tex and all-black upholstery. But barring all that, it’s all very simple – very high-quality, but nothing that will make it look fast while stationary. Even the steering, which was a chunky flat-bottom one on the previous car, is now a simple round unit. The racy one has been tucked away in the options list. However, you can choose between red, blue or grey for the upholstery contrast stitching. For anything more, like maybe a panoramic sunroof, you’d have to start ticking the options list. Its interior oozes quality but lacks the drama you’d expect from a 640hp super SUV. The centre console features the all-too-familiar dual-screen layout, and apart from the RS modes and drive settings, it’s all very simple and straightforward. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance has enough space for three adults, and there’s four-zone climate control with electric sun blinds for added comfort. But would you want to be chauffeured in a 640hp super SUV? I think not. 2024 Audi RS Q8 performance  Performance is literally this RS Q8’s name, and it is truly mind-boggling. Sure, it has beaten the Cayenne around the Nürburgring, but what does that mean? Is it fun? Or is it a weapon to be wielded only in the hands of a professional test driver? To find out, we did a few laps around the Parcmotor Castelloli in Spain, and a few laps is all it took to showcase why and how this is the fastest SUV around the Nürburgring. Powering the RS Q8 Performance is a 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, as before, but it now makes 40hp more, bringing it to 640, while max torque is 850Nm. The 0-100kph sprint takes an astounding 3.6 seconds, and the SUV can haul all the way to the good side of 305kph. The increase in power is the result of the catalytic converter’s repositioning, which, in turn, has reduced exhaust back pressure. The turbo boost pressures are also higher now, and the end result is an engine with virtually no lag. To add to this instant boost is a 48V mild-hybrid system that lends a hand during acceleration, which means no matter how tight the corner, you can exit it with all the brute force available. The real star is the nimble chassis. The 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox is rapid, too, but select Dynamic Plus or any of the RS modes, and it shifts with lightning-fast speeds. The paddle shifters are also quite responsive, and in manual mode, you can have total control of the shifts. On straightways, the acceleration is a blur, and given the SUV’s driving position, it’s hard to believe that you can be seated this high up and travel this fast. The sense of speed is immense, and the engine sounds terrific at full pitch. Audi has a reputation for making silent cars, but in this, it actually removed some of the sound insulation so you can hear even more of the engine noise on the inside! After all those e-trons, this sure comes as a welcome change. Out on the public roads, however, the engine changes character in a flash. Swap from the Dynamic or RS mode to Comfort mode, and it puts the leash and muzzle on the engine instantly. You can amble through town without being noticed and in comfort. The engine has a soft burble, which only amplifies post 4,000rpm and, of course, through tunnels. The ease of driving it as a daily driver takes you by surprise, especially if you’ve been hooning it around a racetrack an hour ago. 2024 Audi RS Q8 ride and handling  Speaking of hooning around a racetrack, pin-point handling is not something you expect from an SUV the size of the RS Q8 Performance. Yet, thanks to all the wizardry under the skin, it corners like it has an identity crisis. It refuses to acknowledge it is an SUV; instead, it identifies as a hot hatch. Many things are at play here – active roll stabilisation, all-wheel steering, Adaptive Air Suspension Sport and the new Quattro Sport differential – words you’d find in engineering textbooks but with the effect you’d find in comic books. The RS Q8 Performance holds the lap record on the Nürburgring for the fastest production SUV. The RS Q8 Performance corners with absolutely no body roll or understeer, and despite the power and torque available on tap, it always has the grip to save you. A lap record definitely needs precision, which the RS Q8 has, but even for mortals with not even a fraction of the pro talent, it is very hard to look bad on the track. The power split is 40-60 as standard, but in case of slippage, it can send up to 70 percent power up ahead and 85 percent to the rear wheels. Then, there is the electromechanical active stabilisation, which is basically a motor between two halves of the anti-roll bar. On long, straight highways, the two halves are disconnected, which reduces pitching and vertical movements, but as soon as you get to the corners, they link up and twist the bar in the opposite direction to the turn, thereby reducing roll and keeping the car as level as possible. It sounds complicated, but when you notice the steering is on full lock and you haven’t keeled over in your seat, it makes sense. Ride comfort with large 23-inch wheels is surprisingly good. Ride comfort is also surprisingly good, given the weight and, more importantly, the large 23-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The adaptive air suspension is compliant in Comfort mode and tries its best on broken patches, but for Indian conditions, the 22-inch ones will undoubtedly be more comfortable. 2024 Audi RS Q8 verdict and India launch details  Audi has not confirmed the RS Q8 Performance for India as of now, but given the strong response to the older version, it is likely to make it back to home soil in 2025. Prices would be slightly higher than the outgoing version, but you can expect it to be extremely competitive against its arch-rivals, the Lamborghini Urus S and Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. As a performance SUV, the RS Q8 ticks all the boxes. It is large, mighty fast and loud enough to shake up the mountains, and best of all, incredible to handle, too. It does not have the flash of a supercar or super SUV, but not everyone wants that kind of attention all the time. For those who love the concept of a ‘sleeper’ or discreet performance, this is what you should get your hands on – enough space and comfort to drop the kids off to school or do an airport run and enough power to never be late.

    "description": "Hyundai India has started accepting bookings for the upcoming Creta Electric with a token amount of Rs 25,000. However, registrations for the base Executive trim haven't commenced yet. This comes ahead of its launch on January 17 at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Long Range Creta EV promises 473km range Rivals include Tata Curvv, Maruti e Vitara, Mahindra BE 6 Hyundai Creta Electric: how's it different from regular Creta? Since the Creta EV is based on its ICE sibling, the overall compact SUV silhouette looks identical. Save for bits like a shut-off bumper grille, active air flaps and a new skid plate, not much differs. Others include an aerodynamic design for the alloy wheels and a refreshed bumper. Pixel-theme-based inserts make the e-SUV look in line with premium Hyundai EVs like the Ioniq 5. For a detailed report on the exterior differences, click here. About the interior, this new Creta borrows the steering wheel from the Kona EV (sold abroad) and the Ioniq 5’s drive mode selector (Eco, Normal and Sport). Features carried over from the Creta ICE include two 10.25-inch screens for instrumentation and infotainment, a panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera setup and ADAS.  Hyundai will sell the EV in five variants: Executive, Smart, Smart (O), Premium and Excellence. For now, the larger battery pack can only be booked on the Smart (O) and Excellence trims. As for colours, there will be 10 shades to choose from, including dual-tone and matte options. Hyundai Creta Electric: battery packs, range Two battery packs of 51.3kWh (473km range) and 42kWh (390km range) will be offered with the Creta Electric, both ARAI mileages. The Creta Long Range (51.3kWh) charges from 10 to 80 percent in 58 minutes with a 60kW DC fast charger, while 10 to 100 percent takes 4 hours with an AC wall box unit. The EV goes from 0 to 100kph in 7.9 seconds, which is even faster than the Creta N Line DCT (8.9 seconds). Single-pedal driving will also be offered in the compact electric SUV. Rivals to include the Tata Curvv EV, MG ZS EV, Maruti e Vitara and Mahindra BE 6 (earlier BE 6e).

    "description": "The year is off to a good start, with several bike and scooter launches planned for this month. We've got a list of 11 models lined up from several manufacturers for January 2025. Ather 450X, 450S Ather has updated the 450X and 450S for 2025 and will be launching these on January 4. Both are expected to feature new software updatse, traction control, Magic Twist and a new set of colours as part of the update. While other aspects such as the battery, motor and chassis will likely remain unchanged. We can expect prices to go up by Rs 3,000 - Rs 6,000 for the 450s upon launch. Also see: Updated Ather 450X, 450S to be launched on January 4 Bajaj Pulsar RS200 Bajaj recently teased the return of the Pulsar RS200 on its social media. The Pulsar RS200 will likely receive minor updates to its styling, feature new colours and perhaps get a minor bump in features. It is also likely to receive an updated speedo like the one seen on the Pulsar N150, N160 and NS200. Bajaj could launch this update sometime this month, though It remains to be seen if Bajaj will make any mechanical changes to the Pulsar RS200. Also see: Bajaj Pulsar RS200 update teased ahead of launch Royal Enfield Scram 440 Last year at Motoverse, Royal Enfield unveiled the updated Scram 440 which is scheduled to launch sometime this month. The engine has now been upgraded from 411cc to 443cc which has been achieved by a bore increase of 3mm. The Scram 440 produces 25.4hp at 6,250rpm and 34Nm at 4,000rpm which is an increase of 1hp and 2Nm. Additionally it now gets a 6-speed gearbox and remains mechanically unchanged otherwise. Also see: Royal Enfield Scram 440 revealed, launch in January 2025 Royal Enfield Classic 650 Royal Enfield has already showcased the Classic 650 and we even rode it towards the end of last year in the UK. The Classic 650 shares its underpinnings with the Shotgun 650, with the only key difference being in styling, wheels and front suspension. The Classic 650 will be available in four colours - Vallam Red, Bruntingthorpe Blue, Teal and Black Chrome. We have been led to believe that the starting price for the big Classic will be in the Shotgun’s ballpark (Rs 3.59 lakh - Rs 3.73 lakh) and the top variant could cost around the same as the flagship Royal Enfield - the Super Meteor 650, which is priced between Rs 3.64 lakh and Rs 3.94 lakh. Also see: Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin review: All-Time Classic? Hero Xtreme 250R, Karizma XMR 250 and Xpulse 210   Hero revealed all three models at EICMA 2024 and has now sent us an invite for January 19, with the words “Thrill awaits”. This leads us to believe it is likely going to be either of the 250s or could even be the all new Xpulse 210. Both the Karizma and Xtreme will be powered by a 250cc motor that produces 30hp and 25Nm. The Xpulse 210 on the other hand uses the Karizma XMR 210’s engine that produces 24.6hp at 9,250rpm and 20.7Nm at 7,250rpm in the Xpulse 210. The upcoming Xpulse 210 also weighs 11 kilos more than the outgoing Xpulse 200 4V. We can expect all three motorcycles to cost around the Rs 2 lakh - Rs 2.3 lakh mark upon launch.

Honda has since revealed both models in India and bookings for both of them have already begun. The Activa e: is powered by a pair of 1.5kWh removable battery packs with a claimed IDC range of 102km. The QC1, on the other hand, is powered by a 1.5kWh battery pack and has a claimed IDC range of 80km. It is worth noting that customers will be able to swap batteries for the Activa e at Honda dealerships across the country.

While only the 390 Adventure S and 390 Enduro R were on display, KTM says it will be bringing the base 390 Adventure X alongside these models to India. While official specifications haven’t been released, we know it will be powered by the same motor that’s currently found in the outgoing 390 Duke. The 390 Adventure S will also get a 21-inch wheel at the front and a 19-inch wheel at the rear. The 390 Enduro R will get a 21-inch wheel at the front and an 18-inch wheel at the rear. The 390 Adventure S will also be the first motorcycle in its segment to feature cruise control. Also see: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R unofficial bookings open in India",

    "title": "Private buyers bought fewer new cars last year than Covid-hit 2020",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/private-buyers-bought-fewer-new-cars-last-year-covid-hit-2020",
    "description": "Overall car sales did rise last year but were heavily propped up by fleets – sparking industry worry The number of new cars bought by UK private buyers last year was fewer than in 2020, when the country was in the midst of the Covid pandemic. Around 746,000 cars were sold to private buyers in 2024, some 1000 fewer than five years ago, when car buying was temporarily halted by lockdowns. It was also down 8.7% on 2023. Despite this, car sales still rose 2.6% on 2023 to 1.95 million. However, 1.16m of these were fleet sales (up 11.8% year on year), accounting for six in 10 new cars sold.  This is a worrying position to be in, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) boss Mike Hawes said, as the split between private and fleet sales used to be closer to even. Hawes blamed the drop in private sales on “the confusion for buyers of which vehicle to buy”, a comment aimed at mixed messaging from the government over the past few years. This was a key reason for many car makers not hitting the government’s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate target of 22%, the SMMT claimed, with just one in 10 new cars sold to private buyers being battery-powered. A market share of 19.6% was, although under the target, a record for EVs – one of the few positives to come from the year. During 2024, 381,959 EVs were sold, up 21.4% on 2023 – the year’s biggest riser. This total made EVs the second most popular car type behind petrol (1.02 million sales) and 'self-charging' hybrids (261,396). In a sign of the times, petrol car sales were down some 40,000 on 2023 and fewer than 125,000 diesel cars were sold. “This should be a success story, with a record share of EV sales and [overall] numbers up,” Hawes told journalists at a year-end briefing. ”But instead the cost of delivering that, and that [EV sales] are still shy of the government’s ZEV targets, cast a shadow.” He added: “If we did not have the [ZEV] mandate, we would say that this was a good year.” Hawes used the 2024 results to again call on the government to bring back buying incentives for EV buyers, which were pulled in 2022. This would be in the form of lowered VAT on car purchases and VAT parity between public and home charging. “Incentives make a big difference, as they help people into these vehicles while also sending the right messages,” said Hawes.  He added that fleet incentives – delivered via benefit-in-kind tax breaks – should be transferred to private buyers. Similarly, Kia UK boss Paul Philpott told Autocar: \"There aren't enough carrots for the consumers, other than in fleet market, and the fleet user-chooser is proving that where they have relatively sensible incentives behind electric vehicles, buyers want to try them; where there aren't, they're more reticent to move in numbers.\"  Hawes claimed that car manufacturers are already shelling out billions of pounds in lowered car prices to incentives buyers in an attempt to hit the ZEV mandate’s target, but “manufacturer incentives shows an unhealthy market”. Although there seems to be appetite for change from the new Labour government which has already launched a consultation on potentially amending the ZEV mandate, Hawes warned that any changes – expected at the back end of 2025 at the earliest – might be too late, given that “a number of car makers have warned me they won’t hit mandate targets this year”. For 2025, car makers must, in real terms, increase EV sales by 46% in order to hit the mandate’s new 28% sales target – goals that increase each year. This, the SMMT claims, won’t be hit: of the 1.97 million new cars that it predicts will be sold this year, just 23.3% are expected to be EVs. Elsewhere, the SMMT’s figures revealed that, with 48,340 sales, the Ford Puma was the UK’s best selling car, narrowly pipping the Kia Sportage (47,163) to top spot. The Nissan Qashqai (42,418) and Nissan Juke (34,454), both UK-made, placed third and fourth. In fifth was the Tesla Model Y, with 32,862 sales, which also made the SUV the country’s best-selling EV, a year on from being crowned the world’s most bought car.  The Model Y was the only EV to place in the overall top 10. That might not be the case in 2025, though, with an influx of more affordable EVs – such as the Renault 4, Renault 5 and Citroën ë-C3 – joining the market.",

They’re usually existing models, upgraded with fancy liveries and, in some cases, numbered plaques. But the fact that they come out twice a decade (and in strong numbers) sort of diminishes their allure. It’s little wonder, then, that the owner of this 100th Anniversary Harley Springer Softail had no qualms about handing it over to our man in Taiwan, Winston Yeh, for a Rough Crafts makeover. As implied, the 2003-model Harley-Davidson Springer Softail followed The Motor Co.’s typical Softail formula, with a vintage-style springer front end added to the mix. This particular example had already been dressed in a handful of aftermarket parts, so Winston’s client had no illusions about keeping it stock.…",

    "description": "It’s not often that you get the opportunity to turn a passion project into a full-time business but should that chance arise, grab it by the horns and don’t let go. Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying.
