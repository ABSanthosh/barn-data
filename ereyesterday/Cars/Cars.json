Rather than quietly retreat to Renault’s heritage collection, the concept was developed into a production car that looks just as spectacular. And it’s not a mere small-series vanity project. The new 5 is here to be Renault’s mainstream hatchback, an entry point into its EV line-up. With a headline price of £22,995, it’s no more expensive than a mid-spec hybrid Renault Clio.The 5 has already won a number of awards – not least Car of the Year. Can it add five stars from Autocar to its achievements? We’ve driven both a high-spec Comfort Range model and a base-spec Urban Range model to find out.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/vw-concept-trio-previews-30-model-assault-chinese-market",
    "description": "Left to right: ID Era was developed with SAIC; ID Aura with FAW; ID Evo at VW's Anhui base Two new SUVs and compact saloon are aimed at new breed of Chinese buyers, majoring on autonomous capabilities Volkswagen has unveiled a trio of concept cars ahead of the Shanghai motor show, previewing a dramatic expansion of its offerings in the crucial Chinese market. Developed in collaboration with the firm's joint-venture partners SAIC and FAW, plus its sub-division headquartered in Anhui, the new cars form the backbone of a 30-model line-up that's due in China over the next two years. The headliner is the ID Era, developed with SAIC, previewing Volkswagen's first car with a range-extender powertrain. It's a three-row seven-seat SUV similar to the existing Tayron that pairs a petrol-burning generator with a battery-electric powertrain for a combined range of more than 621 miles (1000km) with the fuel tank and battery brimmed.  The other SUV in the trio is the ID Evo, developed by Volkswagen Anhui. It has been conceived as a sibling to the ID Unyx – the Chinese-market version of the Cupra Tavascan – but swaps that car’s rakish styling for a more conventional hatchback silhouette. It packs an 800V electrical architecture, rather than the 400V system used by the ID Unyx, and a new zonal computer set-up that's said to enable a wide range of new digital services and rapid over-the-air software updates. The final model is FAW-Volkswagen’s ID Aura, a small notchback saloon in the vein of the old Bora. It's aimed at buyers who would typically tend toward affordable A-segment city cars and will manifest the first car based on the new Compact Main Platform (CMP), which is aimed at the Chinese market. Volkswagen has yet to publish specifics on each model’s powertrain but has confirmed that all are new-energy vehicles (NEVs), a Chinese term encompassing plug-in hybrids, range-extender EVs and battery EVs. It added that each car is fitted with an AI-based autonomous driving system that will be capable of driving in so-called level-two-plus-plus mode next year, in which the car takes most of the controls but the driver retains much of the liability for keeping out of harm’s way.  “In certain situations, cars will be able to drive fully autonomously, including overtaking and turning manoeuvres and independently merging into traffic, with the driver’s supervision,” Volkswagen said in a statement.",

    "description": "The Himalayan has now completed a year with us, and it’s time for the bike to be returned to Royal Enfield. Over the past year, the bike has gone on a couple of long rides out of the city, but most of the 6,648km on the Odo have been clocked within the metropolis. During this time, the bike has made my 70km round-trip commute far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. I’ve spoken about this before, but the Himalayan’s size, seating comfort, and superb suspension have won me over. With the engine, it’s not quite so straightforward, and I find myself wishing for more character after a few days of continuous commuting. However, the moment I take a break from the bike (which happens far more often than I’d like with the travel schedule), I get back on it and find myself enjoying the mid-range punch. That being said, RE still has work to do when it comes to damping out the handlebar vibrations at highway cruising speeds. Seating and suspension comfort are both outstanding. That I have enjoyed riding the Himalayan 450 is without doubt, but the experience has not been free of flaws. First, there was the issue of the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released. This took ages and multiple visits to the showroom to be sorted, and I was given to understand that it came down to correctly torquing some of the bolts that connect the engine to the frame. 17-litre tank is top-heavy, but it also makes the bike feel big. We also had the toggle switch on the left-hand switchgear fail, and it was replaced under warranty. But even when it works, I find the switch fiddly enough that I avoid using it altogether. This means that even though there is quite a bit of tech within all the menus on that pretty circular TFT display, I never bother with it. Thankfully, this has had no negative effect on the riding experience. The joystick switch is fiddly to use and needs redesigning. Finally, there’s the infamous cone-set issue. It first started to get loose at about 5,000km, which I reported on in the previous report. I was told by the folks at the service centre that it was tightened, as the bearing didn’t need to be replaced. However, less than 1,000km later, it has gotten loose again and is now considerably worse than it was the first time. For something that was such a well-known issue with the old Himalayan 411, it’s surprising to see it continue in the all-new model. It’s also been disappointing that the service centre has not reset the service warning after two separate services, and it shows up every time I start the bike. The steering cone set bearing keeps getting loose. But as I write this, I’m reminded that while there have been niggles, there have never been any serious breakdowns (or letdowns). The bike has always started when I’ve asked, and every ride has been enjoyable. Whenever I conclude a long-term review of a motorcycle, I always ask myself if I’d buy one. Usually, the answer is no, but here, I could see it being a yes because this bike fits my particular needs for a large, quick and super comfy bike that can steamroll through the mess of our local road system. The Himalayan has truly excelled at that role.

    "description": "Sometimes, timing is everything. Just when I need a compact but quick-ish car to get from one end of the city to the other, in walks the Toyota Urban Cruiser Taisor Neo-drive – Toyota’s version of the Maruti Fronx but with a name that does its best to confuse the hell out of you. Still, semantics and onomastics apart, what makes my eyes light up is that the Taisor Turbo is a relatively light car with a nice 1.0 turbo engine and a sufficient amount of boost. So, while the crossover-like profile may help it look bulky, the Taisor with a Boosterjet engine and a 5-speed manual weighs in at just over one tonne: 1,030kg, to be precise. And it isn’t just the 100hp; it also has 147.6Nm of torque that the engine puts out between 2,000rpm and 4,500rpm. The presence of a turbo, along with extra power and torque, makes this a fun crossover. This is primarily why it’s a happy camper in the city. Driving across town in start-stop traffic, what impresses is the relative lack of turbo lag. Sure, there is a zone where engine responses are relatively slow – around 1,200rpm – but responses are better by 1,500rpm, and power keeps getting stronger. This is primarily because this is a direct-injection engine (the only one in the Maruti range) that makes peak torque relatively early. The small turbo can be spooled up quickly due to the lower resistance it offers, and the engine even gets a small amount of e-boost from the mild-hybrid system. Light, easy and precise, the manual gearbox is good to use. Needs a sixth gear, though. This is why the 1.0 turbo is quite friendly to drive even in start-stop traffic, and unlike most turbos, I don’t mind letting it off the boil. In addition, the relatively responsive bottom end is also a reason why this engine delivers some good economy numbers, especially if you can resist squeezing down on the throttle. The dead pedal sometimes comes in the way when I press the clutch. Not nice. However, the latter is something I find difficult to resist, and that’s because, after 2,000rpm, the Taisor ramps up its power delivery in a linear push that gets stronger and stronger as you wind up the powerband. Sure, Suzuki’s Boosterjet could have had 10-15hp more, and power delivery doesn’t have that spike of boost that makes turbocharged cars so much fun. Still, the additional performance and light weight make this one of the most fun compact cars around, the ramp up in performance carrying on till around 6,000rpm. And that means my early morning drives from one end of Mumbai’s new inner-city highway – the Coastal Road – to the other en route for our Modern Classic Rally in Kalina are especially fun. The sweeping elevated sections and light traffic allow me to wind through the gears, and what’s nicer is that there is a real tachometer, a real dial and a real needle to follow. It helps that you can see all around, but the resolution needs to be better to see obstacles. While the 5-speed gearbox is slick enough, and you can heel and toe easily, the clutch is placed too close to the dead pedal and often comes in the way when I am trying to depress the clutch fully. Also, don’t much care for the plastic quality on the dash or quality levels in general. The seats are a bit too soft, and the cabin lacks a secure place to put my phone. The Toyota-Maruti screen, however, is much improved and has been relatively glitch-free, as is the voice quality on the carphone. What also makes this car quite practical is that it has a decent-sized boot, good ground clearance, and it’s easy to park with its 360-degree camera. The resolution, though, could have been better. And though it isn’t uncomfortable per se, the ride could have been more comfortable. Still, the Taisor is one of the most characterful, practical and enjoyable cars to drive in its class. The cherry on the top – the Taisor looks more balanced and interesting, especially with those headlights and the two-tone bodywork.

    "description": "Rounds 1 and 2 of the FMSCI Indian National Drag Racing Championship 2025 saw records tumble. The three-day event was held at Taneja Aerospace in Hosur, near Bengaluru, from April 18 to 20. Sean Rogers Pachigalla’s twin-turbo Audi R8 improved upon his previous quarter-mile record of 9.215 seconds, which was set at the Valley Run in 2024. Audi R8 V10 is the fastest car with a quarter mile time of 8.849 seconds Sean Rogers Pachigalla broke the record he set last year FMSCI Indian National Drag Racing Championship 2025 Twin-Turbo Audi R8 is the fastest car in India Pachigalla, competing in the premier unrestricted class, clocked a time of 9.635 seconds for the 402-metre dash in Round 1 on Friday. He improved to 8.948 seconds in Round 2 on Sunday, setting a new national record in the process. He also clinched victory in the Indian Open M3 (Unlimited) class on Sunday, setting a time of 8.955 seconds.   However, his fastest run came during the Vroom Drag Meet – a support event – where he set a staggering time of 8.849 seconds, surpassing his own national record. Pachigalla’s Audi R8 V10+, tuned by Venom Performance and equipped with a Sheepey Race twin-turbo setup producing over 1600hp, is now officially the fastest car in India over the quarter-mile – and the first to dip under the 9-second mark.   Among the other highlights, 80-year-old Vidyaprakash Damondaran, the event's oldest participant, remained unbeaten in the Pro-Stock 3061cc-4002cc class across both rounds, driving his Audi TT. Meanwhile, Bengaluru’s Shreyas Mahendra claimed victories in three categories – Pro-Stock 2051-2550cc, Indian Open M1, and M2 – in Round 1.   FMSCI Indian National Drag Racing Championship 2025 results (winners only) FMSCI INDRC 2025 ROUND 1CategoryCompetitorTime (secs)Unrestricted (N1)Sean Rogers Pachigalla9.635Pro-Stock K2 (1151cc – 1450cc)Narayan Swamy15.483PS K3 (1451cc – 1650cc)Shaik Hussain Pasha17.241PS K4 (1651cc – 2050cc)Thrishal M.S15.545PS K5 (2051cc – 2550cc)Shreyas Mahendra13.618PS K7 (3061cc – 4002cc)Vidyaprakash Damodaran13.351PS K8 (4003cc – 5100cc)Karthik KV10.315PS L4 (1651cc-2050cc)Naveen Reddy Kesara13.749PS L6 (2551cc-3060cc)Aakash Durai12.571Indian Open M1 (Upto 2750cc)Shreyas Mahendra12.963Indian Open M2 (Upto 4002cc)Shreyas Mahendra13.259Indian Open M3 (Unlimited)Yajur Miglani10.656 FMSCI INDRC 2025 ROUND 2CategoryCompetitorTime (secs)Unrestricted (N1)Sean Rogers Pachigalla8.948PS K2 (1151cc – 1450cc)Narayan Swamy14.88PS K3 (1451cc – 1650cc)Vinay SM15.036PS K4 (1651cc – 2050cc)Thrishal M.S15.79PS K5 (2051cc – 2550cc)Vijay Raju13.846PS K7 (3061cc – 4002cc)Vidyaprakash Damodaran13.83PS K8 (4003cc – 5100cc)Karthik KV10.23PS L4 (1651cc-2050cc)Naveen Reddy Kesara13.624PS L6 (2551cc-3060cc)Aakash Durai12.415Indian Open M1 (Upto 2750cc)Vijay Raju14.195Indian Open M2 (Upto 4002cc)Vidyaprakash Damodaran13.236Indian Open M3 (Unlimited)Sean Rogers Pachigalla8.955",

    "description": "Royal Enfield will soon be updating the Hunter 350, and the refreshed model will debut on April 26 at its HunterHood festival. The Hunter 350 is the entry point to the RE family and is also the lightest model the company sells today.  RE Hunter 350 likely to get updated shocks, LED headlight New colours are also likely to be introduced Currently priced between Rs 1.50 lakh and Rs 1.75 lakh Royal Enfield Hunter 350 update details  RE’s most affordable bike will soon be updated The Hunter 350 marked Royal Enfield’s entry into uncharted territory, with its lightweight, nimble demeanour aiming to target people who weren’t Royal Enfield traditionalists. Since its introduction in 2022, more than 5 lakh units of the Hunter 350 have been sold worldwide. What has partly helped cement its incredible popularity is that Royal Enfield hasn’t hiked the Hunter’s prices, which range between Rs 1.50 lakh and Rs 1.75 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), since its launch. With this updated model, set to be showcased at the HunterHood festival, we believe Royal Enfield will address one of the bike’s primary shortcomings - its stiff suspension setup. The twin rear shocks of the Hunter are something a lot of people have complained about, and this is likely to be addressed with this update. In fact, last year, we even spotted a Hunter 350 test mule with new rear suspension units and an LED headlight.  This could give us some clues to what RE will change with this update on one of its bestselling models – both in India as well as globally. The company could also introduce new colours with this update, and it remains to be seen if Royal Enfield will raise the prices of the Hunter in the process.  Also See: Triumph Speed 400 vs RE Hunter 350 vs Classic 350 comparison: Retro rivalry",
