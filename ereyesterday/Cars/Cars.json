    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At an expected price ranging between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 23 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/will-fake-gearshifts-hybrids-and-evs-win-over-enthusiasts",
    "description": "The inbound Honda Prelude will have a 'fake' gearbox much like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N News that the upcoming Honda Prelude will have fake gearshifts has caused some consternation among enthusiasts in the various bits of the internet where we’re currently scattered. Quite a lot of sceptics, not much wild enthusiasm. In their earlier incarnations, Preludes were among the best affordable driver’s coupés on the market, with high-revving VTEC engines mated to good manual gearboxes. There are plenty of people – and I will admit that I’m one of them – who mourn the demise of cars like that. Some say, then, that Honda should just fit the new Prelude with a proper manual ’box, like you can still get in an Integra in some markets, and to heck with the inefficiency, because the Prelude is a sports coupé. Others say Honda should do away with even the idea of a gearshift, because it’s obviously not real and we should just grow up and get over ourselves, because this transmission is trying to dupe us. As Cypher said in the 1999 film The Matrix (nothing but the latest cultural references for you here, reader): “I know this steak doesn’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, The Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.” Disliking fake technology is, I can see, an argument with merit too. And it is, ultimately, fake tech. What this Prelude’s new S+ Shift system will do is take hybrid technology but make it less efficient while still not being real. As referenced on page 11, it has a clever way of working, developed as it is from the transmission of the latest Civic. This is sometimes referred to erroneously as a CVT (continuously variable transmission), when it’s nothing of the sort. Rather unhelpfully, e-CVT is even how Honda initially referred to it. It’s kind of the opposite, in that it’s not a variable transmission at all. A petrol engine acts the vast majority of the time solely as a generator, making electricity for an electric traction motor that does all of the driving. In the Civic, the engine does very occasionally drive the wheels itself too, but only through one, single fixed ratio at motorway-type speeds. Most of the time it’s just coupled to a system that makes electricity, with the motor doing the driving. There is a speed at which an engine is running at peak efficiency for power generation, but there is a problem with that: an engine running at a steady RPM sounds boring. One can live with that noise, or make it inaudible if possible, or do as Honda has done with the Civic and try to zhuzh it up a bit. The Civic’s engine revs through pretend ratios to sound like an engine that’s driving things. Yet if you pull a flappy paddle on the steering wheel, you change the regeneration from the motor but have no effect on the ‘gears’. The Prelude will change that part, with the paddles changing those fake gear ratios instead. I don’t know what it will do in terms of lift-off regeneration, but it’s not difficult technically to basically mimic engine braking. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N can do the same with no engine at all. So at high revs, you would get a lot of regen; at low revs, less. The difference between the Ioniq 5 N and the Prelude is that while the gears are still fake, the engine is real. That’s less thermally efficient than an EV and less efficient than an engine spinning at fixed-rev maximum efficiency. But it’s more efficient than driving the wheels through an actual transmission with all the heat and noise losses that entails, which is why the Prelude is a hybrid in the first place, plus it’s lighter than an EV and comes with other ICE-car advantages, like quick refuelling. And finally it creates, hopes Honda, some old-fashioned driver engagement. If this all sounds like a bit of a fudge, I suppose that’s because ultimately it is. But while the purist in me is sceptical, if it works well I can see myself coming around to Cypher’s views on the steak and wine that his brain tells him are real: “You know what I realise? Ignorance is bliss.”",

    "title": "79 years of innovation: Highlights from the Honda heritage hall",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/79-years-innovation-highlights-honda-heritage-hall",
    "description": "You can't miss the Honda Jet... Honda has a history of pursuing dreams until they come true – as the prize exhibits in its Heritage Hall show. Walk in to the large, light-filled lobby of the Honda Heritage Hall and the six exhibits set out in front of you outline what makes the Japanese firm different from so many of its rivals. There’s a 1958 Super Cub bike, an immaculate S600 sports car, Honda’s first Formula 1 racer, its first motorbike grand prix race winner and, not to be overlooked, a portable generator. Oh, and a jet, of course. You can’t really miss the jet. Few car firms have wider operations that encompass such a diverse spread of machinery. Especially when you consider the location of the hall in Mobility Resort Motegi, an automotive theme park of sorts built on the grounds of one of two Japanese race circuits that Honda owns. The Heritage Hall was opened 25 years ago and, to mark the anniversary, was given a major refresh this year, to ensure it will stay relevant for whichever innovations Honda develops in the future. To mark the occasion, Autocar had a poke around to pick out some highlights. Bike Engine Essentially, this is the very first Honda. In 1946, two years before founding his eponymous company, Soichiro Honda made an air-cooled 50cc engine based on an old military generator and used it to help power a bike so his wife could tackle steep hills more easily. NSX and NSX-R It’s a mark of the NSX’s significance that the hall features two examples of the transformative sports car. The red one is a first-gen example of the 397bhp car; the white one is a 1992 NSX-R, which is 120kg lighter than the regular car and weighed just 1230kg as a result. Asimo and friends Whatever Elon Musk says, car firms working on humanoid robots is not new: Honda produced its first in the 1980s. Those efforts on various E- and P-series robots culminated in Asimo, a 4ft 3in, 54kg robot that can recognise gestures and engage in conversation in English and Japanese. Z and Vamos The first-generation Z proved popular among young buyers, and also forwent Honda’s long-running air-cooled engine for a water-cooled version. With the transmission also relocated to beside the crankcase, it was more powerful and less prone to vibration. Meanwhile, the 1970 Vamos truck featured an open body and became popular as a utility vehicle – a sort of forerunner of modern compact crossovers, perhaps. Civic Mk1 The original Civic was developed at a time when a struggling Honda’s future as a car firm was in doubt after a number of technically innovative vehicles failed to win over buyers. As a result, the firm focused on developing a ‘basic car’.  The wheels were pushed to the corners to boost comfort and a 1.1-litre engine made it affordable. The result: Honda sold a million examples in just five years. RC142 The Heritage Hall contains an amazing assortment of motorbikes but none was more key to Honda’s history than the RC142 from 1959, built to enter the world’s most important road race, the Isle of Man TT. Becoming the first Japanese firm to enter the race was an audacious move from a company in financial trouble, but Honda said that “dreams are seeded more in hard times”. Honda won the makes’ title in its first season; three years later, Mike Hailwood led a sweep of the top five places. S600 and T360 Honda was founded as a motorbike firm in 1946 but expanded into four-wheeled vehicles with the T360 pick-up in 1963. It was rushed into development in the face of Japanese government plans to effectively shut out new manufacturers from the car industry but proved a big hit. It was followed a year later by something totally different: the S600 sports car. It used techniques from the bike world, such as rear-wheel chain drive, and its 43bhp four-cylinder engine and light weight gave it plenty of performance. Lotus 99T, McLaren MP4/4 and McLaren MP4/6 Formula 1 cars on display range from John Surtees’ 1966 Italian Grand Prix-winning Honda RA300 to Max Verstappen’s championship-winning 2023 Red Bull, but the most memorable ones date from Honda’s F1 peak in the 1980s and early 1990s. The 1987 Lotus 99T claimed two wins in Ayrton Senna’s hands, although this particular car was driven by team-mate Satoru Nakajima, the first full-time Japanese racer in F1. Behind it sit two of Senna’s title-winning cars: 1988’s dominant McLaren MP4/4 and 1990’s MP4/6.",

That trend was at the forefront of Rick Hannah’s mind when he set out to build his third Kawasaki W650 desert sled. A South African ex-pat currently living in the UK, Rick works in the tech industry—but he’s a petrolhead at heart. Working under the cheeky nickname of Dirty Dick’s Motos, he burst onto our pages a few years ago with a picture-perfect Kawasaki W650 scrambler in the style of vintage British desert sleds. He followed it up with a similarly styled W650 a year later, leaving him with more than enough data to build a third. Rick’s biggest challenge was figuring out how to repeat his success, without getting carried away.…",

    "description": "The uncomfortable truth about custom motorcycles is that for every good one built, there are dozens of bad ones. All too often you’ll come across custom bikes that have been crudely cobbled together with no regard for good taste—or safety, even. This 1999 Moto Guzzi California was one such bike, until Massimo Rinchiuso rescued it. “The California was previously customized using poorly matched parts, with many malfunctioning parts and poorly made modifications,” says Massimo, who runs Fuchs Workshop as a one-man band in the vibrant city of Ravenna, in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region. “The bike was not only really ugly but also potentially dangerous.” Massimo’s client is a long-walks-on-the-beach guy, so the Moto Guzzi’s torque twin-cylinder motor suits him well. He handed the bike over to Massimo to make it not only beautiful to look at, but usable and safe, too.…",

The slim, two-door, quadricycle-like design is specifically designed to navigate the tight confines of our urban spaces, and it rides on small 12-inch wheels. It is a three-seater vehicle with a centrally positioned driver’s seat at the front and a bench seat for two passengers at the rear. Vayve has also equipped Eva’s cabin with a dual-screen setup, comprising a touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster, along with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, a six-way adjustable driver’s seat, climate control, a reverse parking camera, hill-hold assist, vehicle diagnostics, and over-the-air updates. A total of six exterior colours are on offer: Moonstone White, Light Platinum, Rose Coral, Sky Blue, Champagne Gold and Cherry Red. Vavye Eva range and specifications The Eva promises a 250km range on a single charge from the 18kWh battery. Meanwhile, the 9kWh and 12kWh batteries return 125km and 175km, respectively. If opted with the optional solar roof panel, it can add up to 10km to the driving range. Vayve claims that an annual mileage of 3,000km can be achieved using solar energy from the panel. Also, its running cost is just Rs 0.5 per kilometre, which Vavye says is one-tenth of the cost of a normal petrol hatchback. Powered by a 40Nm RWD motor, the Eva EV sprints from 0-40kph in 5 seconds, with a top speed of 70kph. The battery unit, placed under the floor, has a waterproof rating of IP67; other safety bits include a driver airbag and seatbelts for all passengers. Vavye says the battery can be topped up from 10 to 70 percent in 15 minutes using a DC charger and can take up to 5 hours using a normal 15A household socket.  Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV showcased at Auto Expo 2025 BYD Sealion 7 bookings open: Auto Expo 2025",

    "description": "Korean car manufacturer Hyundai has roped in TVS Motor to develop electric three-wheelers and micro four-wheelers in India. While Hyundai plans to offer design, engineering and technology, TVS will focus on manufacturing and marketing these EVs in India.  Two concepts showcased today feature screens at the front to display text Wheelchair access is also provided Two Micro Mobility concepts, called E3W and E4W, that could culminate from this partnership, were also showcased at the ongoing Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 on Saturday. This comes after our exclusive report on the two firms coming together. E4W (left) and E3W (right) concepts at Auto Expo 2025. The three-wheeled concept is the duo’s take on electrifying the motor rickshaw while also serving multiple purposes, such as logistics, emergency response, or passenger transport. The other four-wheeler concept looks similar to the e-rickshaw but gets a wider-angled windshield.  These green vehicles are built with enhanced collision protection and have a flat floor placed right above a long wheelbase. The Korean manufacturer is also reviewing the use of heat-resistant gloss black paint on the roof to reduce interior heat conductivity and exploring water-resistant materials for the cabin. Apart from that, wheelchair access is provided. Interestingly, they are also equipped with a screen at the front that can display text, something we have seen on public buses in Delhi. “Hyundai is a customer-centric brand, and our mission is to care for people in India by designing micro-mobility solutions tailored to its unique environment,” said SangYup Lee, executive vice president and head of Hyundai and Genesis Global Design.  “Collaborating with TVS Motor, we aim to locally produce the three-wheeler while exploring global opportunities for the four-wheeler, blending intuitive functionality with India’s spirit of innovation,” Lee added. Hyundai and TVS are reviewing the feasibility of scaling these vehicles for global markets, with the electric four-wheeler micro concept under evaluation for a broader application.
