    "description": "With the BYD Sealion 7, the Chinese brand has truly cemented its position as a high-end EV maker in the Indian marketplace.  Its first two offerings, the e6 (now evolved into the eMax 7) and the Atto 3, took a while to gain traction for various reasons, while the Seal sedan was the first sign that this was a brand intent on upsetting the established order. The Sealion 7 is the Seal’s crossover counterpart, and though the two share some similarities, there are tangible improvements in key areas that give the newer model a much broader appeal. BYD Sealion 7 exterior design 170mm ground clearance For one, it’s an SUV, and that fact in and of itself will endear it to many more buyers, but the more practical consideration is ground clearance, which is now up to 170mm from the Seal’s 145mm.  That aside, though, it’s not a traditional SUV in its proportions, which lean heavily towards the coupe SUV or crossover end of the spectrum.  2.9-metre wheelbase At 4.8 metres long with a 2.9-metre wheelbase, it’s not a small car, but its sloping roof and tightly skinned curves make it appear a lot more compact than it actually is. To these eyes, though it uses an evolved version of the Seal’s design language, dubbed ‘Ocean X’, the proportions aren’t quite as appealing as the sedan’s, particularly its taller nose, which carries a lot of visual bulk. 19- and 20-inch wheels This is offset somewhat by the generous use of contrast black trim, particularly around the large wheel arches that house 19-inch wheels (20-inchers on the AWD version) and a huge diffuser that’s cut into the rear bumper. BYD Sealion 7 interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior design is not as characterful as the Seal’s, with a conventional-looking rectangular central console and a horizontal and flat dashboard, which does at least integrate some interesting ambient lighting elements. 15.6-inch rotating touchscreen The digital driver’s display is incorporated into that flat panel, and making a return is the signature rotating touchscreen, which stretches the tape at 15.6 inches across.  What impresses the most, once again, is the cabin quality and fit and finish, which are truly on par with the best luxury brands and, in certain areas, surpass them. Quality as good as luxury cars There’s soft-touch material on even the lower half of the dashboard, and you have to scratch around the footwell to find a rough plastic bit. Panel fit is tight across the board, save for a few ill-fitting panels on the door, and though pretty straightforward in its design, the cabin is not without a few quirks, like the door ‘handles’, which are more like lift-up flaps.  Comfortable seats with generous cushioning The front seats are supremely comfortable (and ventilated), with a nice mix of firm and soft cushioning in just the right places. The rear seats feature similar cushioning and can be reclined quite significantly, but more significant is the amount of space on offer, particularly legroom, thanks to the long wheelbase. Big glass area gives a spacious feeling You’re seated quite low relative to the window line, but there’s a large glass area that gives a good sense of airiness; window blinds would have helped, though. BYD Sealion 7 features and safety Large fixed glass roof with sunshade Speaking of glass, a huge fixed glass panel stretches the length and width of the roof, but unlike in the Seal, you get a powered roller blind to block out the sun on really hot days. Another small but helpful change is that the AC vents are regular, manually controlled in the Sealion, and not electronically adjusted like in the Seal.   Driver's display is cluttered The screens, as before, are extremely slick with high-resolution graphics; however, the driver’s display features an extremely cluttered layout with far too much information thrown at you, which is distracting. There is a heads-up display, too, and while it’s high in resolution, it, too, places far too much data in your field of view. The touchscreen, thankfully, has an improved UI, but we wish BYD hadn’t stuffed so many basic functions into it. BYD Sealion 7 feature highlights  The Sealion 7 is very well-equipped, with the likes of wireless smartphone integration, a punchy 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered and ventilated front seats, automatic headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, dual-zone climate control, a ventilated wireless phone charger, and more. 11 airbags, Level 2 ADAS On the safety front, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters as well.  There’s also ADAS with Level 2 autonomous driving, one of the clearest 360-degree cameras around, and a driver attention monitor that’s way too sensitive, given the sheer number of distractions in the touchscreen alone. BYD Sealion 7 battery, range and charging Unlike the Seal, the Sealion 7 just gets a single battery option – the larger 82.56kWh pack that uses BYD’s standard-setting Blade Cell LFP technology. Up to 567km range  However, with two powertrain options, there are two sets of range figures as well – 567km (NEDC) for the single-motor version and 542km for the more powerful (and 100kg heavier) dual-motor variant. BYD cars, in our experience, come close to their claimed range figures, and though we weren’t able to do a full range test on this short drive, our mixed driving conditions still yielded an equivalent range of close to 500km on the single-motor version.   7kW wallbox charger provided On a DC fast charger, the battery can be charged at speeds up to an impressive 150kW, while on an AC fast charger, it can do 11kW. But disappointingly, the home wallbox charger BYD supplies maxes out at just 7kW, which is slow for such a large battery. The Sealion 7, like other BYD models, features a vehicle-to-load (VTL) function that lets you charge other devices, such as speakers, electric stoves, lamps and camping gear, off the car’s battery. BYD Sealion 7 driving impressions We were able to spend some time with both versions of the Sealion 7, and there are some clear distinctions in the driving experience.  Dual-motor version makes 530hp The AWD dual-motor version packs a substantial 530hp and 690Nm, allowing for a 0-100kph sprint in just 4.5 seconds, a figure we were able to achieve and verify on our VBOX testing gear. You can feel that performance advantage instantly and in any drive mode, but as you drive it longer, what you appreciate more is how tidily the AWD version puts down its power.  The RWD has ‘only’ 310hp and 380Nm, but in everyday driving, these outputs feel more than ample for a luxury car of this size. Smooth, progressive power delivery At low and medium speeds, both versions serve up a smooth and progressive power delivery, much unlike the flat or spiky shot of acceleration we are used to from most electric cars, which is welcome. However, once you get into triple-digit speeds, while the powertrain itself is silent (no artificially generated sound here), you start to hear more of the outside world, particularly at the rear, as while the front windows are double-glazed for better insulation, the rear ones are not. BYD Sealion 7: Acceleration from restSpeed (kph)Time (seconds)200.81401.60602.38803.291004.50 Not as sporty as the Seal sedan The Sealion 7 makes no pretence of being a sporty handler. Where the low-slung Seal sedan feels sharp and agile going around a corner at speed, the SUV rolls quite a bit, and you instantly feel the weight and higher centre of gravity. This is not a bad thing, of course, as it only serves to elucidate the Sealion’s positioning as a comfortable luxury car and not a sports model, although its ultra-responsive and quick steering is somewhat at odds with this philosophy.   Composed and comfortable ride The ride has a slight firmness to it, something we usually expect from a European car, but on balance, this is better suited to managing the 2.3-tonne mass than an outright soft suspension setup. A slight spoilsport is the wheels, which tend to register a ‘thump’ as they go over bumps – something that’s more pronounced with the 20-inch set that comes on the dual-motor version. 2025 BYD Sealion 7 price and verdict The BYD Sealion 7 is the perfect answer for those buyers who were intrigued by the prospect of the Seal but stayed away because of the ground clearance or sedan form factor.    Reasons to buy a BYD Sealion 7 It brings back what we loved – most notably the plush, well-put-together cabin, which genuinely feels right on par with a European luxury car. BYD’s powertrain expertise shows in the smoothness and sophistication of the power delivery and how keenly the Blade Cell LFP battery clings on to every electron, maximising the range. There’s a lot of tech in the Sealion 7, be it for infotainment, safety or everyday comfort and convenience, and while all of it is useful, we wish some of it was presented in a more user-friendly manner. BYD Sealion 7 price and rivals At a price of Rs 48.90 lakh to Rs 54.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the BYD Sealion 7 confidently wades into the crowded space of electric cars in India, armed with the latest tech and know-how.  Similarly priced crossovers include the BMW iX1 LWB, Kia EV6, Volvo C40 Recharge and Mercedes-Benz EQA, of which the Kia comes closest in size and specs.  BYD’s sales and service network is small compared to these established brands, but it is growing, as is the ready availability of cars. As for the product itself, on first impressions at least, it’s one of the best of its kind at the price, and a premium electric car buyer should definitely have it on their shortlist.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/bmw-ce-02-road-test-review-434534#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The BMW CE 02 represents an innovative leap, targeting younger, eco-conscious riders who might overlook traditional BMW motorcycles. In India, it appeals to a niche audience with higher disposable incomes, valuing style and badge value over practicality. While its price may seem steep, the CE 02 offers a compelling case, particularly when compared to its more expensive sibling. Love it or hate it, the CE 02’s design is undeniably catchy. Neither a bike nor a scooter, BMW dubs it an “e-parkourer” meant for fun, short-distance commuting. Practicality, however, takes a backseat with no storage or additional seating space, making its heavy charger or a pillion inconvenient to carry. Upon first glance, the rider footpegs seem like an afterthought and feel out of place in the otherwise cohesive design. The rider footpegs look like a bit of an afterthought on the CE 02. With minimal bodywork, a low stance and a futuristic aesthetic, the CE 02 captures attention from a diverse range of onlookers. During my time with it, teenagers, adults, and even senior citizens frequently enquired about it.  A stylish single-piece seat that looks and feels like an ironing board. The bike’s low 745mm seat height and light 142kg weight make it approachable for beginners, but the bench-like seat limits comfort as it is best suited for solo riders. Additionally, the low-mounted tail-light is poorly positioned, making it less visible to tailgaters. A rather cute face and an LED headlamp with good illumination. On the features front, the CE 02 comes equipped with LED lighting, a 3.5-inch TFT display, keyless start, two riding modes, a reverse feature, adjustable levers, a Type-C charging socket and Bluetooth connectivity.  Extremely crisp micro TFT that is both easy to read and use. Our test unit included the Highline package, an optional upgrade costing Rs 50,000. This adds features like a fast charger, additional switchgear, a smartphone holder, an extra riding mode called “Flash”, a tri-coloured seat, heated grips, a gold-finished fork and some graphics.  The charger cover is rather simple-looking and feels basic to use. The Highline package is worth considering for a more enriched experience overall. Additionally, the accessory comfort seat, priced at Rs 12,000, is also recommended due to the limited cushioning of the standard seat. Besides this, if you buy the standard version and wish to add the fast charger, it will cost you Rs 70,000, which makes the Highline package a no-brainer.   The CE 02 offers three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. Flow combines high regenerative braking with a linear throttle response, Surf disables regen for a freer ride, and Flash delivers maximum regen with a sharp throttle response. There’s an additional Battery Saver mode that requires manual activation via the menu, while a Low Power mode automatically engages at alow charge. Surf mode proved ideal for my highway commutes to work, offering effortless coasting. Riding the CE 02 in Mumbai was a joy, thanks to its ample torque and quick acceleration. In our tests, the CE 02 accelerates quicker to 80kph than most 160cc motorcycles, aligning closer to a fast sub-160cc or a slower 200cc bike. Its lightweight build enhances its agility and pace, especially in city conditions, and the traction control ensures confidence on loose surfaces. The claimed 108km range holds up well for regular commutes, and the fast charger tops up the battery in about three and a half hours.   While the brakes offer excellent feedback, the lack of dual-channel ABS is a drawback since the rear wheel is prone to locking under aggressive braking. This is especially so when paired with the CE 02’s strong regenerative braking, which reduced how much I found myself using the brakes. The single-sided swingarm looks quite cool and gets a lot of attention. It is lightweight and has a low centre of gravity, which makes it highly manoeuvrable and enjoyable for city commutes. The suspension provides decent comfort at moderate speeds but struggles over potholes or bumps, often unsettling the rider. Ground clearance seems decent, but BMW would not share the exact figure with us. The fork is non-adjustable, and the rear shock is preload adjustable.  The low-mounted tail-light is hidden from tailgaters or tall SUVs. The Michelin City Grip 2 tyres deliver reliable traction overall despite varying riding styles. The CE 02 is an otherwise comfortable little commuter, but its thin and minimally padded seat becomes a pain after about an hour. The riding posture is upright, with wide bars allowing for better control.   This is by no means a practical purchase. Despite being made at TVS’ plant in Hosur, at Rs 4.99 lakh for the Highline package-equipped CE 02, it is an expensive proposition. Then again, it is the most affordable BMW EV and offers a blend of bold design, high-quality construction and engaging performance.  A rather charming little machine that tugs on your heartstrings and yanks on your wallet. Its quirky styling may not appeal to everyone, but it undeniably turns heads. For those well-heeled few who can afford this and are looking for an easy, stylish and completely left-field city-centric two-wheeler with superb badge value, the CE 02 promises a unique and fun experience.",

    "description": "In the build-up to the Rizta’s launch, Ather had released some very bold advertisements showcasing how big the scooter’s seat would be, featuring a prominent Indian professional wrestler. Naturally, I initially took all of that with a grain of salt, but now that I’ve actually used the Rizta extensively with a pillion aboard, I can confirm this is a really spacious and comfortable seat. Pillions of all shapes and sizes have sat behind me, and even the taller and heftier ones were comfortable. The backrest (standard on the Z variants) also goes some way in keeping the passenger comfortable. The well-padded seat is one of the most spacious units around, backrest keeps the pillion comfy. With just the rider aboard, the Rizta’s ride can feel a little stiff, although it’s never uncomfortable. However, when you’re carrying a passenger, this setup pays dividends and shields you from all but the worst bumps Mumbai has to offer. That said, the Rizta’s suspension is a bit of a double-edged sword, but we’ll come to the bad bits later on. As anyone who has ever ridden with a pillion will tell you, if your vehicle has a less-than-ideal throttle response, it’s going to be unpleasant, especially in stop-and-go traffic, where you need to give minute inputs almost constantly. What I absolutely love about the Rizta is its crisp and direct throttle response, which allows you to modulate the throttle very precisely in stop-and-go traffic without causing any unwanted herky-jerkiness. Accelerator response feels well-tuned in both modes, is precise and direct. What isn’t nice in our pothole-littered city, though, is the stiff front fork. It thuds over every single bump, and the big ones, especially, make their presence felt with a rather rude jolt to the rider’s hands. The 450X-derived front fork is too stiff, which hampers overall comfort over bumps. Another problem is that when you’re making a lock-to-lock U-turn, the Rizta’s handlebar fouls your knees. On a scooter with so much space in most other regards, the lack of it in this area stands out like a sore thumb. Ather has repurposed a lot of what was on the sporty 450 here, which is why these downsides have also transferred over to the Rizta. Lock-to-lock U-turns require taller riders to move their knees out of the way. But in the grand scheme of things, these are two issues I can look past, given how light the Rizta is on my pocket and, otherwise, how well it handles the daily grind in general. And since the Rizta and the 450 are quite closely related under their distinctly different skins, there are also some strong points – like the crisp handling – that I’m thoroughly enjoying.

    "description": "Motorcycling can be a selfish endeavor—and yet, motorcyclists can be some of the most charitable people around. If you’re one of those motorcyclists, CROIG and Yamaha have a treat for you. This wild Yamaha XSR900 is being given away to raise funds for Waves for Water, a nonprofit that provides clean water to communities that need it. This is the second time the two parties have teamed up for charity. The project, dubbed ‘Yard Built for Good,’ is the brainchild of David Chang—founder of the immensely popular CROIG (Café Racers of Instagram)—and is supported by Yamaha’s Yard Built custom initiative. The idea is simple; build a killer custom bike, and give it away to one lucky Waves for Water donor. For this round of Yard Built for Good, the crew took a 2022-model Yamaha XSR900 and turned it into a fully-faired racer.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mg-motor/mg-3/long-term-reviews/mg-3-hybrid-2025-long-term-test",
    "description": "Can this hybrid compete with the best superminis? Here’s our verdict What am I, Autocar's supermini correspondent? I'd be quite happy with that, actually, having previously run a generally fabulous Renault Clio E-Tech hybrid and then an endearingly honest petrol Dacia Sandero on our test fleet. Now I'm trying the new MG 3 - a car on which I delivered Autocar's first verdict back in May, and a very positive verdict at that. Well, MG did promise \"everything about it was designed to put a smile on your face\". The old 3 seemed a generation behind the competition even when I last drove it some six years ago, the justification being that it was one of the cheapest cars on sale. This new 3 is a wholly different proposition: MG says it effectively skipped a generation, which checks out, and it's now priced £4000 higher, putting it into Clio territory. And in terms of how it behaved on the road, my initial feeling was that it wasn't notably inferior to the class leader. Of course, though, living with a car every day can reveal hidden talents and flaws, which is why I will now be evaluating the 3 over an extended period. Like that initial test car, my 3 is in Trophy trim, which adds extra advanced driver assistance systems (as required by regulators, unfortunately), LED headlights, a combination of faux-leather and fabric upholstery, heated front seats (yes then!), a heated steering wheel (oh, get in!), a 360deg camera, keyless ignition and automatic windscreen wipers. That's all on top of SE trim's generous standard kit count, which includes a 10.3in touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and sat-nav, a 7.0in digital instrument display, a six-way adjustable driver's seat, rear parking sensors, electrically adjustable door mirrors and 16in alloy wheels. It's an almost identical spec to the entry-level Clio hybrid yet for £3500 less (although they are almost identical on a 48-month PCP finance deal at present, costing around £200 per month).   It really is amazing how much you get on affordable cars nowadays (and I would argue that an £18,495 starting price definitely still qualifies the 3 as such). The extra-cost item on our car is the rather smart metallic silver paint, because MG simply doesn’t do options: you just pick a powertrain, one of two trim levels and a colour. Actually, in the 3’s case, you don’t even pick a powertrain, because it only comes as a hybrid (for now, at least; a cheaper pure-petrol model is apparently on the way). This combines a naturally aspirated 1.5-litre four-pot petrol engine, a three-speed automatic gearbox, an electric motor and a small (0.92kWh usable capacity) battery. Combined outputs are put at 192bhp and 313lb ft, or in electric-only running there’s 134bhp and 184lb ft – significantly more than some perfectly usable EVs have. I’m still unconvinced about the accuracy of that combined torque claim, even though the 3 can kick me up the backside with what is for a supermini hilarious strength. It’s something I need to look into in greater detail. Certainly, the gearbox, while simpler than the mind-boggling multimodal unit in the Clio, isn’t what you would usually find, having so few speeds. It provides distinct waves of power delivery (one of them coming, confusingly and unhelpfully, at around 70mph), so perhaps the answer is somewhere therein. In these tough economic times, the outstanding efficiency of the Clio was one of my favourite things about it, as it averaged 53.5mpg during our time together, against an official 65.7mpg. Given that the 3’s WLTP figure is a similar 64.2mpg, I’m relishing the prospect of still having some extra money left at the end of each month. Everybody who has had a poke around this Trophy-spec interior has been impressed by the classy look and decent-quality feel – especially those with experience of the old 3. I particularly like that, unlike in most Chinese cars (and, to be fair, many of the latest from other parts of the world), the touchscreen hasn’t absorbed all of the physical controls. In fact, it’s much more understated than most, including the Clio’s. Beneath said screen is a row of buttons for air-con functions, the infotainment system’s home page and the audio volume. It’s just a shame that none of them is for adjusting the fan speed or internal heat, or indeed turning the heated surfaces on or off, and that you have to press the home button before the air-con button when Apple CarPlay is active (which itself irritates by requiring a wired connection), otherwise nothing happens. Oh well: you have to take what you can get these days. A bigger disappointment is that the passenger’s seat doesn’t adjust for base height, only for angle and leg room, because it means either a 5ft-nothing or a 6ft-something passenger will always be in a suboptimal position (which wasn’t a problem in my high-spec Clio). Similarly, it’s a shame that the 3’s rear bench doesn’t split in any way for folding – something I’ve always taken for granted – in order that I can take more than one person with me to Ikea. Nevertheless, I’m still finding more positives than negatives about this car at the moment. I’m just puzzled why I haven’t seen another one on the road yet, six months after launch, especially given that there’s a big MG dealership in town. Update 2 Oh no, oh no: I’ve only just got this car and already something has gone horribly wrong with it – and in rush hour on the M25, of all times and places. I’m cruising in the MG 3 when it emits a beeping noise so loud that I jolt with shock. There’s no way any ADAS bong could be so loud, I think in a fluster – this has to be something far more serious than straying too close to a line. It literally sounds like a fire alarm. Yet when checking the instrument display, I see no warning. BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Okay, I need to pull over. Stationary on the hard shoulder, I check the screens more closely for anything amiss, but still there’s nothing. Tentatively I dive back into the torrent of fellow commuters, but sure enough, shortly afterwards I’m subjected to that same noise. I pull over at Cobham services to check the manual, and even Google, but to no avail. Time to take drastic measures, I contemplate, and grab the noise-cancelling headphones from my work bag (vital equipment in a busy office). Here I must point out that I’m neither melodramatic nor unusually averse to loud noises. In fact, I’m more often blasting rock music than listening to Radio 4. No exaggeration, this alarm was uncomfortably, distractingly loud. Naturally, I email MG the next day. Imminent mechanical crisis? No, they say: it’s the speed camera warning. Seriously. Unbelievable. A week later, I again have trouble on this same stretch of motorway – ironically, due to a lack of an alarm noise. In lane four when the speed limit jumps from 40 to 70, I plant my right foot and nothing happens. ****! People are flashing, tailgating, undertaking... Miraculously I dodge and glide over to the hard shoulder, where I find I’ve run out of fuel. Yes, ultimately my own stupid fault – but my previous Dacia Sandero would bing when illuminating its low-fuel light, which was itself prominent within the dial cluster, and neither of those things was true of the 3. Once over the guard rail, I was dismayed to discover that the stairs up the embankment to a safer spot clearly hadn't been maintained in many years. I wouldn’t fancy climbing over and through big thorn bushes if I were disabled or elderly or had kids with me. Then, after a very embarrassing rescue by the AA (the patrolman sold me a couple of cans of petrol via a contactless card machine), rejoining the traffic was extremely fraught, as I had reached the hard shoulder just a few hundred yards before it vanished and the 3’s hybrid powertrain had hugely limited its performance (while warning me of an ‘engine emissions fault’). Probably the least auspicious start to something since Jaguar put in a bulk order for pink paint. Update 3  It seems that no two hybrid powertrains are the same anymore. There’s a real proliferation of ideas, and the Hybrid+ system that MG has introduced with its new 3 is one of the more interesting ones, having a gearbox of a kind unheard of since the 1990s and no fewer than four operating modes. One, it can run purely on its 192bhp electric motor, up to around 35mph – and it can do this for longer than many other ‘self-charging’ hybrids, because its battery is considerably larger than its rivals’, at 1.8kWh, hence why it’s located between the rear wheels rather than under the passenger seat. Two, it can run as a series hybrid, up to around 59mph – meaning the motor still does all of the driving but the 1.5-litre four-cylinder atmo petrol engine fires up to work as a generator for charging the battery. Three, under strong acceleration, it can run as a parallel hybrid – meaning the motor and engine are both working to rotate the wheels. And four, when you’re cruising at a steady speed, the engine can simultaneously do the driving and charge up the battery. I’ve previously cast doubt over MG’s claimed combined torque figure of 313lb ft, because while the 3 is surprisingly fast, it doesn’t feel as torquey as a Volkswagen Golf R. To my disappointment, MG hasn’t been able to provide a graph showing the car’s power and torque curves – although that’s perhaps understandable given how complex the powertrain’s operation is. The amazing thing is that you can’t really sense which mode the powertrain’s computer brain has chosen: it just does its thing while you do yours. Well, unless there’s no combustion noise, of course – and it isn’t a pleasant-sounding engine, especially when it’s firing up from cold. I wonder if it will sound better when not running on the hybrid-specialised Atkinson cycle in the promised pure-petrol manual 3. I’m not convinced by MG’s choice of gearbox, though. Whereby I rate Toyota Yaris’s CVT and the Renault Clio’s clutchless multimodal ’box deliver power in a smooth, linear way, the 3 meets it out in distinct waves. The third of these comes at around 70mph, which seems a bizarre point for MG to have chosen, as only Germans could ever (legally) benefit from that. More pressingly, and something my passengers have really noticed, is the braking. Usually with a new car, your braking is jerky only for that first little while as you retrain your right-leg muscle memory, but with the 3 I still really struggle to decelerate smoothly. I suppose this must be an effect of its blending of friction and regen braking. All this just adds credence to something a few colleagues have posited: MG’s ICE cars, while much better than they were a few years back, are a step behind its EVs in terms of operational sophistication. Final update  Rarely if ever have I been left with such mixed feelings about a long-term test car – and likewise, rarely have there been so many opinions expressed by colleagues and readers. I was mightily impressed on our first drive of the second generation MG 3 supermini in April last year, awarding the car four stars on the basis that it “offers comfort, practicality, lots of technology and hybrid propulsion for several grand less than rivals” – and I still stand by that. A couple of months later, though, our road testers knocked off half a star, declaring: “It still lacks the sophistication of some rivals and loses stars for its design compromises, poor tech and fuel economy that doesn’t quite live up to the promises” – and certainly some weaknesses in the car’s make-up became apparent to me during this extended time together. I don’t like unpleasant endings, so I will address the criticisms first. Most of them were made clearer by this MG replacing a class-leading Renault Clio E-Tech hybrid in my parking spot. That “lacking sophistication”, then. No, the 3 certainly isn’t as impressive to drive as the Clio. Its unorthodox Hybrid+ powertrain, with its three-speed automatic gearbox and four modes of operation, gave it an odd kind of performance, much more muscular at some speeds than others and with distinct waves of power, unlike the smooth and linear delivery that I had become used to (and that in my view is making purely combustion-engined models, even fancier ones, feel clunky to drive by comparison). And although the softer springing and squidgier tyres of the 3 gave it a comfier ride than the firm and taut (at least in Esprit Alpine trim) Clio, I would still place more value on the much more spirited dynamics of the French car were my money at stake. “Poor technology” seems a bit harsh, based on my experience. MG’s modestly sized touchscreen infotainment system and digital instrument cluster, while far from the most intuitive to operate, gave me everything I want from a car: Apple CarPlay (although only through a wire, annoyingly, and not perfectly integrated), DAB radio, sat-nav and a fuel economy readout. And while the (now mandatory) ADAS features caused me some consternation, I’ve yet to drive a car in which they haven’t. I also didn’t recognise colleagues’ criticisms of the interior looking dull and feeling overtly cheap. For the money, I think MG did a good job on both fronts, if more the former than the latter. What bothered me more was the evident cheapness of construction. I can’t recall testing a hatchback in which the rear seats didn’t split to fold down, and I was alarmed by how easy it was to detach the backrests out of their pivots when I automatically pushed them forward while holding only one of the two latches. And the phone shelf (note: not an enclosed cubby) and cup-rest divider came free of their mounts more than once, leading colleagues to nervously (but thankfully incorrectly) tell me they had broken my car. Fuel economy was disappointing, too. The WLTP lab boffins promised me 64.2mpg, but the 3 didn’t even manage 50mpg overall (aside from some shorter journeys). Admittedly my colleagues and I spent most of our time in the 3 haring up and down motorways, which is not what the average customer is going to be doing, but that was also true of the Clio, which managed 53.5mpg. But, but, but. At a time when cars are all becoming fatter, higher-riding, more expensive and increasingly electric, the 3 must be celebrated as a traditional hatchback that is at once compact yet practical, spiritedly quick yet fairly efficient, diminutive yet comfortable and cheap yet not nasty. I racked up long motorway journeys and never felt at the mercy of those outside-lane bullies, having all that petrol-electric power and torque under my right foot. I ran errands in town and was never made desperately uncomfortable over the endless deep potholes. Four adults were happy to accept a li from me, and they didn’t even have to leave their luggage at home. So I’m convinced that for someone who buys their cars privately for local journeys and can’t charge an EV at home, the 3 could prove ideal. Would I recommend the Clio instead? Absolutely. But would I talk you out of accepting a great deal offered by a local MG dealer? So long as you had your eyes wide open, I don’t think I would.

    "description": "The government will only allow new zero-emission cars to be sold from 2035 onwards Our response to the UK government consultation on plans to ban the sale of new non-zero emission cars and vans The chance to have your say on the future of motoring in the UK ends tomorrow (18 February), when the government closes responses for the consultation on the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate. Ever since 2020, when then prime minister Boris Johnson first outlined plans to ban the sale of new non-zero emission cars from 2030 onwards, there has been more confusion than clarity. Under various subsequent UK governments, the date has moved from 2030 to 2035 and back, and all the while there has been a plan to allow the sale of certain hybrids – although nobody has yet specified exactly which sort. For car firms used to planning years in advance, it has been hugely problematic. For car buyers, this huge dollop of uncertainty has left many unsure what they should buy, or when. But the current government has promised certainty, with a pledge to reinstate that 2030 date – and while some hybrids will be allowed on sale until 2035, there’s now finally a promise to specify details. At the same time, the government is looking at refining some aspects of the ZEV mandate, which requires firms to sell an increasing percentage of EVs to avoid punitive fines. With the targets running ahead of consumer demand, it warped the market in 2024. The first step to clarity is an ongoing government consultation, which seeks feedback on various aspects of the ICE phaseout and ZEV mandate. As we did with the original 2020 consultation (1 July 2020) Autocar feels it is vital to make our voice heard and we have submitted our own response. We only answered the questions that only related to vans and commercial vehicles, or on other areas where we have no direct expertise. But here is our full response to all the questions that we addressed.   We've outlined how you can have your day at the bottom of this piece. Part 1: 2030 phase out of new ICE cars, and CO2 requirements for vans Question 1: Do you agree with the Government’s view that full hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies only should be considered? Please explain your answer. Autocar supports the electrification of the UK car parc, both as a way of cutting emissions in our towns and cities and eliminating the CO2 output of cars and vans on UK roads. It is clear to us, and the wider car industry, that these are desirable outcomes. However, there are technologies other than HEV and PHEV that are also low or zero-emission capable at the tailpipe – such as hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen combustion and synthetic e-fuels. While there are questions about the viability of such technologies, we would support a solution that encourages innovation in different energy sources that might prove viable long-term. Question 2: Do you prefer a technological definition that permits both HEVs and PHEVs, or a technological definition that permits PHEVs only? Please explain your answer. We would prefer a definition that sets standards, rather than enforcing specific solutions. For example, as the legislation is written at the moment range-extender electric vehicle technology that is rapidly taking off in China, a kind of halfway house between plug-in hybrids and full electric vehicles, is effectively banned in the UK before it even has a chance to launch. It should not be down to legislators to prescribe the solution to the problem, as has happened with a legislative path now that only leads to battery electric vehicles. While the goal may ultimately be zero emissions, to facilitate that the focus should be on reducing CO2 emissions and the more technologies that can contribute to that the better. Question 3: Do you support no further CO2 requirements, a vehicle level CO2 cap, or a fleetwide CO2 requirement? Please explain your answer. We would favour a fleetwide CO2 scheme, because it allows some flexibility for firms to offer a more diverse line-up of vehicles to meet consumer demand. This must also include vans. The climate does not discriminate about emissions and where they have come from, so it is nonsensical to treat a manufacturer’s van emissions as a separate entity to its car ones.  Question 4: Should a minimum range be required for new PHEVs and, if so, at what level should it be set? Please explain your answer. We do not believe a minimum range should be set for PHEVs because we do not believe that figure is truly meaningful. While a PHEV vehicle might be capable of extending zero-emission running and manufacturers should be encouraged to increase this where possible, if it is not charged regularly and used correctly that figure is essentially meaningless.  Question 8: What are your views on current measures to support demand for zero emission vehicles? What additional measures could further support the transition? While the current tax benefits for fleet and business buyers of zero-emission vehicles have proven effective, at present, there is no support to drive demand for zero-emission vehicles for private buyers. That has created an unbalanced car market with business buyers accounting for the vast majority of EV sales. That needs to be addressed with increased support from private buyers, either through incentives or tax benefits - particularly for more affordable EVs that are now arriving on the market. Even a small incentive can serve as a strong push to consumers and help address the price gap that remains between ICE vehicles and EVs. This must too be joined up with the wider policy to road transport taxation. In the most recent budget, VED rates were raised on new internal combustion engined cars while fuel duty was frozen. Throw in the lack of incentives to buy electric cars, and together these three things simply encourage people to stay in their existing cars for longer and opportunities are missed to lower CO2 and increase the amount of zero emissions vehicles on the road. Question 9: What are your views on whether small volume manufacturers (between 1,000 and 2,499 registrations) should be subject to the 2030 requirements for cars and/or vans? Question 10: What are your views on whether micro-volume manufacturers (fewer than 1,000 annual registrations) should be subject to the 2030 requirements for cars and/or vans? Question 12: What is your opinion on exemptions for kit cars from the 2030 requirements for cars and vans? We have grouped these questions together because we have the same answer for each of them. Autocar strongly believes that small, micro-volume and kit car manufacturers should be exempt from the 2030 requirements. Such firms are a key part of the wider British manufacturing industry, helping to drive technical innovation and employee skills development that benefit the wider economy. Due to their low volume and the use case of most vehicles they produce, their overall impact on the UK’s CO2 emissions is negligible, while subjecting them to cost-prohibitive electrification requirements could prove insurmountable for many. Most of these vehicles will stay on the roads for decades and do minimal mileage each year. We do recognise that many of these firms are already looking at electrification solutions, so we would welcome incentives and support for them to pursue innovative and cost-effective emission-reduction technology that could ultimately benefit the wider industry. Question 11: What is your opinion on exemptions for Special Purpose Vehicles from the 2030 requirements for cars and vans?  Current electrification technology is both costly and has limitations in certain use cases. Therefore, we feel it is important that any requirements for Special Purpose Vehicles are carefully crafted to ensure that there is no impact on the effectiveness of such machines in their intended usage. It is worth noting that road transport of all kinds is on a trajectory of lowering emissions. Many of these vehicles will be sourced from or based on major OEM vehicles and technologies that have lower emissions regardless.  Part 2: Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes (VETS) Updates Question 14: What are your views on the proposal to implement a van-car transfer in VETS? Please explain your answer. Answer. We would welcome any flexibility here for reasons outlined in question three: the climate does not discriminate about emissions and where they have come from, so it is nonsensical to treat a manufacturer’s van emissions as a separate entity to its car ones.  Question 15: Are there other flexibilities that should be considered within VETS for cars and vans? Answer. We think it is unfair that CO2 trading is currently frozen at 2021 levels. This gives a car manufacturer no incentive to lower CO2 emissions across its whole fleet, only to sell a set number of EVs. The goal must be to reduce CO2 emissions on the way to zero emissions, and the way VETS is written at the moment doesn’t offer much encouragement for a car manufacturer to do so. Indeed, a legitimate way to comply is simply throttling back non-zero emissions vehicle sales to artificially boost your proportional sale of zero emissions vehicles. This is surely not the intention of the scheme, and again misses out the chance to lower CO2 emissions by someone switching to a new, surely lower-CO2 emissions vehicle than the one they’re coming out of.  Have your say The current consultation runs until Tuesday 18 February. The form can be found here and submissions must be emailed to zevmandate@dft.gov.uk or sent to ZEV regulations team, Department for Transport, 3rd Floor Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR. We would love to see your responses, so please email them to us at autocar@haymarket.com.",

    "title": "Evolution of an Icon: The MZR 240z",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ The Datsun 240Z was never the problem. It was the solution. The answer to a world where European sports cars carried steep price tags and Japanese cars were still thought of as nothing more than basic transportation. For years, Japanese cars in America were what students drove to class, what families bought when they were new, when money was tight, or what commuters relied on when fuel prices spiked. They were appliances, used for economy, and durability. It’s easy to look back on them now as more than products of their time. But they weren’t. They filled parking lots at office buildings and grocery stores, racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on city roads, and lived out their lives as forgettable hand-me-downs, passed from one generation to the next until they rusted into the ground. They were not the cars enthusiasts dreamed about, not the machines people pinned on their walls or took out on Sunday after church for a little exercise. Today we love the quirky, endearing nature of the classic Japanese econobox, but back then? It was a tool.  The Z was one of the cars that changed everything. It was Japan’s bold declaration, a machine shaped by the same relentless craftsmanship and discipline that defined the country’s post-war industrial rise. It embodied the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, continuous improvement.  The Z was beautiful, with the long nose of a Ferrari, and an inline-six that, despite its modest origins (and with some SU carburetors installed), could sing when you need it to. In 1970, it was fast enough, with a chassis that felt nimble, eager, and alive in a way most Americans had never experienced in something that did not wear a European badge. It was still affordable, but it was no longer just transportation. It was undeniably a sports car. But time does not stand still. Roads get wider. And for better or worse, cars get faster, stop better, turn sharper, and expectations shift. The Z’s magic is still there, but modern traffic, modern brakes, and modern speed put it in a different context. It still thrives on momentum and chassis respect. But, time marches on. The engineers at Nissan did not create the perfect Z, they created the best one they could for the money, theirs, and yours. So, as is often the case as we make engine noises in our garage over winter, pontificating on what we can modify, and how things could be better. The question is not whether the Z is still great as it was, it is how much better could it be? For Rahail Tariq, the Z had been lurking in his subconscious, a shape that had stuck with him from flipping through magazine pages. When he finally got his first 240Z, his first classic car, it was white, with black sills and a set of 260Z wheels that he did not even know were incorrect at the time. He bought it online in 2005, not as an expert but as someone drawn to its presence, and it’s silhouette. That car, with all its patina and imperfections, was the seed that eventually grew into MZR Roadsports.   Rahail’s connection to cars ran deeper than just his own discoveries. His father, a technician in the 1970s, was always bringing home interesting machinery, M5s, Mini Coopers, Daimlers, even an E-Type Jaguar. Growing up around those cars, seeing the way his father worked on them, improved them, and understood them, gave him an appreciation for cars as something alive, something that could always be made better. The Z was just the first car where Rahail realized that he was the one who would have to push it forward. In the UK, where classic Japanese sports cars did not have the same deep-rooted restoration culture as Porsches or E-Types, Rahail found himself frustrated. Nobody was building the Z the way he envisioned it. No one was taking it to its logical next step, not just restoring but refining, improving. That search led him to Martin Ryland, a Datsun expert who eventually became his collaborator and helped shape the vision of MZR. Restomods are sometimes frowned upon, seen as tampering with an icon, but consider this. Given the opportunity, is it possible Nissan would have never left the Z as it was? If the company had continued refining it with an unlimited budget, what would it have looked like? A lighter chassis, a more rigid structure, and an engine with sharper response and a little more urgency. That is exactly what MZR is doing, finishing what the original engineers, given enough time, could have done, maybe even would have done, but did not. Their Evolution models, built with bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork, are not just about chasing numbers. Yes, the RB 3.4L DOHC straight-six delivers over 300 horsepower, and yes, the six-speed manual brings precision to every shift, but the real magic is in how it all comes together. It is a 240Z honed and distilled, shaped by the same kaizen philosophy that defined its creation, an ongoing pursuit of refinement, balance, and purpose. The 240Z never needed saving, it was never the problem after all. But it deserved to be honored, not just looked at through the lens of nostalgia. It was built to be driven, and MZR has made sure that it still begs to be. Continue...",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "description": "A few months after it made its global debut at EICMA 2024, the Aprilia Tuono 457 has been launched in India at Rs 3.95 lakh (ex-showroom, Maharashtra). The sport-naked Tuono is largely mechanically identical to the fully-faired RS 457 but has noticeably distinct styling.  Aprilia Tuono 457 has the same power output as the RS 457 Its rider triangle is more upright thanks to the handlebar Bookings are open; deliveries will begin by March The Aprilia Tuono 457 is powered by the same 457cc parallel-twin engine that’s seen on the RS, producing 47.6hp and 43.5Nm and paired to a 6-speed gearbox along with a slip-and-assist clutch. A bi-directional quickshifter is available as an optional accessory. The Tuono 457’s frame, suspension, brakes and electronics suite are also shared with the RS in typical Aprilia fashion.    Where the Tuono differs from its sibling is the way it looks; in fact, it also differs greatly from the larger capacity Tuonos. A small new LED headlight flanked by two sharp daytime running lights replaces the signature Aprilia tri-bulb setup on the new Tuono 457. Another difference is the Tuono’s slightly reduced fuel tank capacity: 12.7 litres on the Tuono versus 13 litres on the RS 457. However, both motorcycles have the same 175kg kerb weight.   The Tuono 457 also has slightly shorter gearing, thanks to a rear sprocket that’s one tooth larger than the one on the RS 457. It can be had in one of two colourways: a striking red/black option and a more subtle white/grey scheme. Bookings open today, and deliveries are slated to begin by March.  At Rs 3.95 lakh, the Tuono 457 sits Rs 25,000 below the RS 457, and its main rival is the recently repriced Rs 3.50 lakh Yamaha MT-03. Another credible option in this displacement range is the Rs 2.95 lakh KTM 390 Duke, which also saw a price revision recently, although compared to the twin-cylinder Yamaha and Aprilia, the Bajaj-made KTM is powered by a single-cylinder engine.  Also See: Aprilia RS 457 vs Yamaha R3 comparison",

Our participation in this event will not only demonstrate the quality of our products but also inspire Indian motorsports enthusiasts and foster a sense of national pride.” “We are confident that our tyres will perform exceptionally well in the BRC 2025. Our engineers have been working closely with rally experts to develop the right products that can withstand the rigors of the sport and provide our drivers with the necessary grip and stability to compete at the highest level,” he added. Williams' Hyundai i20 N Rally2 car will also run MRF tyres   MRF British Rally Championship drivers In the headlining BRC1 category, MRF has recruited James Williams and Max McRae. Williams enters the season on a back of a strong 2024 that saw him win the Rally Isle of Man and the Goodwood Festival of Speed Forest Rally Stage. McRae, meanwhile, is set to compete in his first full BRC season. The 20-year-old tackled four rounds last year, but he’ll be competing in all six rounds this season. While he drove a Ford Fiesta Rally2 car last year, he’s switching to a Citroen C3 for 2025. “Yes, the car is new for me, but the team’s not. I drove with TRT (Tagai Racing Technology) in the Junior European Rally Championship last season. I know the team and they know me. I have full faith in them, they’re great guys!”  said McRae, who happens to be the nephew of late British rally legend Colin McRae. McRae tested his new car for the first time recently in Hungary, with the session also marking his first time running MRF tyres. “I was definitely impressed with the feel from the MRF Tyres – that said, the conditions were pretty tricky,” he said.
