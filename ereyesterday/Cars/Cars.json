    "description": "This Alpine A110 left the factory on January 7, 1975 as a 1600 VD example and was initially registered the following month in Germany. Chassis 20395 was purchased by the seller in 1990, who commissioned a refurbishment carried out in the mid-2010s that involved fitment of a Group 4–style body finished in blue with a tribute livery in the style of the car campaigned by Gérard Larrousse and Christian Delferrier at the 1974 iteration of the Tour de Corse. Overhauls were also carried out to the independent suspension, ventilated disc brakes, Type 365 five-speed manual transaxle, and replacement Gordini Type 807-20 inline-four, the latter of which was built to displace 2.0-liters with Arias pistons, CatCams camshafts, a Renault Clio Williams–specification crankshaft, and twin Weber 45 DCOE carburetors. The car rides on multi-piece 13\" Gotti wheels paired with KW adjustable coilovers at each corner and wears a front spoiler, flared fenders, and Cibié fog lamps with covers. Inside, OMP fixed-back bucket seats and six-point harnesses are joined by a MOMO steering wheel, a Heigo Motorsport roll cage, and an OMP fire-suppression system. This Group 4–style A110 is now offered in Losheim am See, Germany, with a Certificate of Authenticity issued by Renault, refurbishment photos, ownership notes, and German registration in the seller's name.",

    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "Audi is no stranger to odd naming decisions. It replaced its engine displacement badge with an arbitrary ‘performance’ number; ‘e-tron’ (aside from its meaning in French) was first a model, then a suffix, and now a sub-brand; and did you know its CNG cars are badged g-tron? Most recently, in 2023, the brand made the bold decision to assign odd numbers to all its ICE model names and even numbers to all EVs, turning decades of legacy on its head. It was so confusing to customers that the brand reneged in 2025 and is back to numbering cars based on their size. But even before this double U-turn, one model never quite sat right on the scale, and that’s the Q8. 8 is the largest number in the Audi model range, but the Q8 is not the largest SUV. It also implies a relation to the A8, but the Q8 offers nowhere near that kind of chauffeur-driven experience. Most confoundingly, it shares its name with the Q8 e-tron, an EV that’s noticeably smaller. Some argue that it earns its 8 because it’s a sporty, stylish coupé-SUV positioned above the Q7 – but then, its name would include ‘Sportback’, which it doesn’t. Looks menacing and sleek without going over the top. Having spent some time with our long-term Q8, I’ve realised it is best not to think about any of that too much because it detracts from the fact that this is an honest-to-goodness great luxury SUV. For one – and going back to that ‘Sportback’ point – though it looks a little sleeker than most big 5-seat SUVs, it sacrifices no space or practicality to the design. You’d have seen Santa Sergius load it up with Christmas gifts (Autocar India, January 2025), and I, too, managed a couple of airport runs in my time with the Q8. The boot can hold a lot more than its 605-litre rating or the dipping roofline would have you believe, and the rear seat is wide and spacious. I once carried a full complement of passengers, and they actually marvelled at how they weren’t making contact with one another. 605-litre boot is more spacious than it looks on the outside. The Q8 is part of the outgoing generation of big Audis, and with it will go a distinct interior layout that was started with the current Q7 a decade ago. It’s not without its flaws, like the dashboard and centre console made entirely of gloss-black plastic and screens, which attract a layer of dust every time I open the windows even for a short while. But back then, it successfully modernised the Audi interior while keeping it classy and expensive-looking, and that holds true even today, more so now that we’ve seen what’s coming next. It’s a similar story with the digital dials that, though simple, are incredibly clear and easy to read on the move. Among the last Audis to use this cabin layout. Not without flaws, but oh so classy. It’s a big car, for better or worse. I absolutely love lording over traffic on the way to work every day, but navigating the tiny streets in my neighbourhood and parking in my small driveway is tedious, to say the least. At my typical crawling speeds, it’s not surprising that a 2.1-tonne SUV with a turbo-petrol V6 isn’t going to be efficient, but 5.4kpl is low by any measure. And while Sergius enjoyed the ride quality on his highway drive to Goa, in town, the suspension feels firm (and the steering heavy); air suspension is a feature they should not have deleted. Struggled to reach even 6kpl on the daily commute. Then there’s Sakhir Gold: a colour that doesn’t even slightly resemble gold but is no less alluring for it (another confusing Audi naming choice, I suppose). I love the paint shade and am glad they offer it amidst the greys, blacks and silvers typical of German luxury cars. You can even get it on the Q7 now, and it never fails to rouse a remark from anyone who steps into the SUV. In fact, in my experience, whoever does experience the Q8 has only good things to say about it. It’s only those of us who’ve been trying to wrap our heads around its positioning who never quite got it. With the facelift and price revision, it’s now better placed against the likes of the BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE, and in my opinion, it looks better than either of them. By the time you read this, it will have left the fleet and been replaced by a Q7, and for many in the team, that will be an upgrade. For one, it’s got even more space and, crucially, smaller wheels and air suspension, which should allow it to ride better. But its colour? Samurai Grey. Boo!

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/chunky-new-jeep-compass-brings-hybrid-phev-and-404-mile-ev",
    "description": "Jeep's plusher, new-look mid-sized SUV points the way for its European reinvention Jeep has reinvented the Compass for its third generation with a bold new look, a more upmarket cabin and the option of having one as an electric car for the first time. With 2.5 million units sold worldwide since it was launched in 2006, the Compass is one of Jeep’s most important and popular models. The company’s Europe boss, Fabio Catone, said this latest generation will be “a key driver for Jeep growth” – building on the success of the smaller Avenger, which played a big role in the brand trebling its UK sales last year. Available to order now and with deliveries due to begin in the autumn, the new Compass will be crucial in helping Jeep to claim a share of Europe’s popular C-SUV segment, which now accounts for around a quarter of all car sales in the region and is expected to be 90% electrified by the end of 2026. The new Compass is based on the same STLA Medium architecture as the latest Vauxhall Grandland, Citroën C5 Aircross and Peugeot 3008. But it has been engineered to offer superior off-roading capability, claims Jeep, to position it as “the most capable” car in its class. To that end, it has gained a suspension lift over its Stellantis platform-mates to give it up to 200mm of ground clearance and a maximum wading depth of 470mm. It also has shortened overhangs at each end, giving an approach angle of 20deg, a breakover angle of 15deg and a departure angle of 26deg. All variants get a suite of drive modes for different types of terrain, controllable by a chunky red dial on the centre console. At 4548mm long, the Compass is among the shorter cars to use this platform, but it is 150mm longer than the old car. Its 2795mm wheelbase is a significant 159mm longer, which is said to result in an extra 55mm of leg room in each row. The third-generation Compass bears little resemblance to its forebear, instead taking influence from the smaller Avenger, with a few subtle nods to Jeep’s heritage. Its design was a collaborative effort across various global studios but was led by Jeep’s team in Turin. “Turin is one of those cities that exemplifies the European lifestyle, and European cities are almost like urban jungles – the way people park and run over stuff – so what works in the woods also works in the city,” Stellantis chief design officer Ralph Gilles told Autocar. “It’s not often we get to redo an icon like the Compass,” he added, emphasising the need to ensure Jeep’s mid-sized SUV stands out in a crowded segment. “When we came out years ago, we were the only game in town – there weren’t that many compact SUVs – and of course a lot of people have come into the scene and emulated us.” With that in mind, Gilles’s brief to Compass designer Daniele Calonaci was to “make it rugged, make it more bold but, at the same time, detoxify”. So the new Compass doesn’t feature any chrome – for ecological reasons and “to clean it up a little” – and it is overall a chunkier and more minimalistic proposition than before. The design also features a new face – “one of the most intimidating parts of doing a new Jeep”, said Gilles – with the seven slots reimagined as a wraparound panel. The exterior overhaul is matched by a dramatically different cabin with a 10.0in digital gauge cluster, a 16.0in touchscreen and an array of touch controls. The aim is for the Compass to serve as a more direct rival to the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson. “State-of-the-art technology will be standard on all models,” said Catone, “with features usually found in premium and upper segments.” The new Compass will be the first Jeep offered with the choice of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure-electric powertrains. Catone said this ensures it is “capable of meeting 90% of segment demand” in Europe. Both of the combustion-powered variants are front-driven. There’s a petrol mild-hybrid model with 143bhp and a 1.6-litre plugin hybrid with 192bhp and a 21kWh battery that will enable around 53 miles of engine-off running. The electric Compass is available with either a 211bhp or 229bhp motor on the front axle, giving 311 miles of range from a 73kWh battery or up to 404 miles with a 96kWh pack. At the top of the line-up is the all-electric 4xe, the only Compass with fourwheel drive from launch. It is equipped with a second, 177bhp electric motor on the rear axle that takes total power to 370bhp, making this Europe’s most powerful STLA-based car yet. More significantly, this new motor – bespoke to Jeep – puts out 170lb ft of torque and runs through a 14:1 reducer, which means up to 2380lb ft is available at the rear, enabling the Compass 4xe to pull itself up a 20% incline even if there’s no traction at the front wheels. In keeping with the 4xe’s more extreme billing, it has a 10mm suspension lift to boost ground clearance and give 31deg departure, 16deg breakover and 27deg approach angles. The Compass First Edition will be priced at £35,700 in mild-hybrid form and £39,200 as a EV. PHEV pricing will be revealed later. Q\u0026A: Ralph Gilles, chief design officer, Stellantis Is it a challenge to adapt modular, road-focused group architectures to Jeep’s needs? “The good news is that everybody realises how important Jeep is to Stellantis and [the architectures] give us quite a bit of leeway. We negotiated a lot of leeway ourselves – for the largest wheel possible, and there was some overhang to be reduced. So it was foreseen with that ability. We were able to really protect that platform for several future products.” Do you feel as though Jeep has lost a unique selling point as other brands start to trade on utilitarian ‘design for purpose’? “There’s only one at the end of the day. I know that’s our tagline, but we really do believe that. When you’re Jeep, you have that confi dence that people are going to get exactly what they want out of it. We found the sweet spot in giving the right image, the right robustness.” You have 80 years of heritage. As everyone is doing retro, why not lean on that in your designs more? “It’s been done. We don’t need to do that. I’m actually proud of the direction this has taken, which is much more futuristic and timeless. As modern as it’s gone with the design, it has a beautiful understatedness to it, which I think makes it last and broadens its appeal.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/touchscreens-cars-truth-we-need-them",
    "description": "Mini has got the right idea with its latest infotainment display, even if it's not exactly perfect A while back, someone made the case on this website for cars with no digital screens. We look at screens all day anyway, and they’re distracting and just plain lazy design, the author posited. The author in question was, er… me. So allow me to set the record straight by disagreeing with myself. Yes, car makers’ screen addictions have got out of hand and I enjoy the zen of simple cars, but for the vast majority of mainstream cars, touchscreens are essential to harnessing the inherent complexity and something that customers want. The Ineos Grenadier demonstrates as much: its interior looks like the flight deck of an airliner. You know, the things that require multiple years of study and training to learn how to operate. I firmly believe that certain essential, often-used functions should ideally be controlled by physical buttons, like the interior temperature, seats and useless mandatory driver assistance features. But the tyre pressure reset, the setting for deciding whether the speedo should be in miles or kilometres, the equaliser for the audio? It’s stuff you adjust once and then forget about, so a screen is perfect for them. Remember those separate single-DIN equaliser units with sliders in ’80s and ’90s cars? What a waste of space those were. When sensibly implemented, touchscreens can make a limited amount of dashboard space much more useful by giving the driver quick and easy access to a multitude of functions while keeping the peripheral stuff out of sight. The classic BMW iDrive rotary controller is brilliant for scrolling through menus or zooming in and out on the sat-nav map, so it makes an ideal partner to a well-laid-out screen, but trying to enter an address with it is excruciating.  A touchscreen does that much better. Unlike some, I don’t think touchscreens are inherently dangerous to use in a moving car. Some of them definitely are, and there should also be standards for the response time and reliability of these things, because there’s nothing more distracting than ineffectually prodding at a dead or – possibly worse – nearly dead touchscreen. But if the hardware can keep up and the menus are sensibly laid out, with big icons, simple graphics and a clear sense of prioritisation that puts important stuff permanently on screen, touchscreens can be great. Apple CarPlay has been a game-changer, because it lets you safely control music and podcasts. And the dinner-plate touchscreen in new Minis, for all its faults, is a great reinvention of an old styling cue and feels like an extension of the brand. Touchscreens are a sort of superpower for interior designers. But in the same way that Spider-Man falls off the odd roof in his early days and is occasionally tempted to use his powers for evil, car makers need to learn to find a balance.",

    "description": "The second-generation Jeep Compass has been leaked in full ahead of its scheduled official debut in Europe by mid-2025. Sharing underpinnings with the recently unveiled second-generation Citroen C5 Aircross, the new Compass has an evolutionary design, a new interior and is expected to use the same powertrain as its Citroen sibling, i.e., a mild-hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and an all-electric powertrain. This new Compass, however, will not be make it to India. New Compass is based on Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform Draws design cues from larger Grand Cherokee Expected to get mild-hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains Second-gen Jeep Compass exterior design Looks more butch and muscular than the first-gen Compass  The second-gen Jeep Compass looks very much like an evolution of the outgoing Compass’ design, and when viewed from the front, it looks like a scaled-down Grand Cherokee. The face is characterised by Jeep’s signature 7-slot grille that has been blanked-off and even gets some illuminated at the top. It is flanked by new simple, rectangular headlamps with the LED DRL signatures positioned at the edges. The bumper, meanwhile, gets a healthy dose of black plastic cladding and a large centrally-located air intake. Over to the side, the new Compass gets squared-out wheel arches, a very prominent shoulder line and some deep contouring for the doors near the sills. The window-line pinches slightly at the rear three quarters, and the blacked-out roof and pillars contrast well with the body. It also gets new dual-tone, five spoke alloy wheels. The new Compass, perhaps, looks the most attractive from the rear quarter where it gets a contrasting finish for the number plate housing that extends to enclose the tail lamps as well. The two-part tail lamps are connected with a light bar with an illuminated Jeep logo in between. Second-gen Jeep Compass interior and features Interior gets new twin, connected screen setup  A single leaked image of the interior gives us a side angle view which doesn’t reveal much about the overall design, but what can be discerned is a twin screen setup for the infotainment and digital instrument cluster. There are also aluminium and wooden inserts on the dashboard and a new centre console with a rotary dial and some physical switchgear. Some of the features visible are a panoramic sunroof, a wireless charger in between the front seats and head-up display. Second-gen Jeep Compass platform and powertrain Two hybrids and an all-electric version expected  The new Compass sits on parent brand Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform, and it is expected to carry over the same powertrain options from the new C5 Aircross, although this is yet to be officially confirmed. The range will comprise a 134hp, 1.2-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine that’s coupled with a 12hp electric motor and a small 0.9kWh battery. Then there’s the PHEV which uses a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine in tandem with a 125hp electric motor for a combined 195hp, and has a 21kWh battery. Meanwhile, the all-electric Compass is expected to come with two battery options – 73kWH and 97kWh – in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. Next-gen Jeep Compass India launch plans As we have reported previously, the next-gen Compass will not come to India. Sources tell us that the new STLA Medium platform failed to meet the commercial viability for the Indian market, forcing Stellantis to cancel it. Given that the existing Compass sells in just three digits on a monthly basis, the involved expense did not justify the expected volumes.  Also See: Jeep Wrangler Willys ’41 Edition launched at Rs 73.24 lakh Volkswagen Golf GTi bookings open on May 5",

    "description": "Retail sales figures from FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations) for April 2025 are in, and Mahindra has emerged as the undisputed number 2 on the sales chart, behind Maruti Suzuki. Mahindra overtook Tata Motors in the month, and extended its lead over Hyundai, which is now in fourth place. This marks the third consecutive month that the Korean brand has placed fourth on the sales charts. Maruti leads sales in April with 39.4 percent market share Mahindra now has 13.8 percent market share Tata, Hyundai have 12.6 percent, 12.5 percent market share, respectively April 2025 retail sales leaders in India Mahindra sold 48,405 SUVs in April, up 25 percent YoY Market leader Maruti Suzuki maintained its dominant position with a 39.44 percent market share. However, this represents a marginal decline from 40.39 percent in the previous year. Meanwhile, Mahindra, with 48,405 units sold in April (up 25.09 percent year-on-year) significantly strengthened its position, capturing 13.83 percent of the market, up from 11.23 percent a year earlier—a remarkable 2.6 percentage point improvement. Mahindra’s April retails sales are also an improvement over March’s 46,297 units (up 4.55 percent). Tata, Hyundai market share decline as sales decrease Hyundai sold 43,642 cars in April, down 11.37 percent YoY Both Tata and Hyundai sales in April 2025 reduced year on year, which means that both brands have lost market share. Tata Motors currently holds a 12.59 percent market share, down slightly from 13.61 percent in April 2024, while Hyundai’s 12.47 percent share today is significantly down on the 14.29 percent the Korean company had last year in April. In absolute numbers, Hyundai retailed 43,642 vehicles in April 2025, a significant 11.37 percent decline from the 49,243 units sold in April 2024. However, Hyundai posted a marginal month-on-month growth of 2.66 percent compared to the 42,511 units retailed in March 2025. Despite a decrease in month-on-month sales (March 2025: 48,462 units) Tata has managed to retain its third place position on the sales charts for last month.
