    "title": "DS should consider its past while shaping its future",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/ds-should-consider-its-past-while-shaping-its-future",
    "description": "The firm's design boss says it would be a \"dream\" to take on brands like Bentley and Rolls-Royce in the future If you thought that DS was optimistic in believing it was a rival to premium brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz, I wonder what you made of the news that it would in future like to become “the Louis Vuitton of the automotive industry”, rubbing shoulders with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Let’s take it seriously for a moment. DS design director Thierry Métroz acknowledges that this is a “dream”, that it could take the brand another 10 years to achieve (on top of the 10 for which it has existed in its present form) and that it ultimately might never get there. I’ll be amazed if it does – and it won’t do so by taking existing Stellantis platforms and tweaking them a bit, no matter how much the interiors, like that of the new N°8 crossover, are “more like Bentley than our German competitors” and regardless of how many key parts are changed. Pushing back windscreens and lowering rooflines won’t be particularly persuasive. True luxury is also territory never before occupied by a DS – not even one of the most striking cars in existence, the original Citroën DS19 of 1955. That’s pretty old history, it’s true, but if they thought it didn’t matter, they wouldn’t have reused the DS name in the first place. When new, the DS19 cost £150 more than other Citroën models, at over £1400. That turned out to be too expensive for many buyers in its home market, yet it wasn’t even near luxury pricing. The Bentley Continental of the day cost £3295 and the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud £3395, off the peg. By the time they had been to a coachbuilder, they could cost much more. The DS19 was never in that sphere. It was advertised as “one of the world’s most advanced cars” at the same time as a Rolls-Royce was being marketed as “the best car in the world”. Could a modern DS be one of the world’s most advanced cars? Perhaps, but even if DS were, say, the first brand within the Stellantis group to be given the newest battery or motor technology, it would have to offer a tremendous advantage, of the sort that’s harder to come by today, to cut through. Besides, would the average car buyer even know, remember or care that the original DS was about new technology? What they would do is remember the way it looked. It’s a unique, beautiful and in some ways still futuristic shape 70 years on. You don’t have to be a car nerd to know and appreciate the design. It strikes me as odd, then, for Métroz to bang on about interior materials or “an attractive design with a lot of character” as DS makes a car that, while making a couple of tiny nods to the original, doesn’t have overtly identifiable cues, stance or lines, nor its impossible elegance. The N°8 doesn’t look to me like a 21st-century DS19. You might disagree. But if I’d been shown it without badges and asked who it was made by, I’d have answered: “Haven’t a clue, mate.” To avoid retro cues is clearly deliberate. As Citroën design chief Pierre Leclercq said last week about the brand potentially reprising the 2CV: “The things you remember from Citroën is not especially that you want to redo the shape of the vehicles that have been good.” That’s laudable enough, because car designers like to design new things. But are new things what customers want to buy? Keeping shapes but changing philosophy seems a safer bet. Take the Land Rover Defender, Fiat 500 and Mini: models that spent time out of production and don’t do the same things they started out doing but are easily identifiable as modern iterations of decades-old designs. Entering this arena, too, is the Renault 5.  It won a couple of big awards recently, but what will please Renault most is that nearly 10,000 examples left French showrooms last month. Perhaps I’m exposing the reason why I don’t run a car company. But if I intended to restart the DS brand and wanted to push it as far upmarket as I could, I think the first thing I’d do is actually make a new DS.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/beginners-guide-driving-supercar-track",
    "description": "Scullion's training session took part on Bedford Autodrome's 1.87-mile West Circuit With a 621bhp Maserati and a greasy Bedford Autodrome, we find out how to become a track day champion Like most people attending their first session of track driving tuition, I have fallen at the first hurdle. Well, not so much the first hurdle. This is more like not doing up my laces properly. Driving position, vision, braking. These three fundamentals are at the forefront of what I learn at Bedford Autodrome on a slightly wet and greasy Tuesday. And it is the driving position where I let myself down. “Typically, most men tend to sit far too far back,” Christian Vann tells me. Vann is PalmerSport’s chief instructor, a former Le Mans racer and a very patient man. Being too far back leads to an outstretched leg position, which doesn’t provide optimal power from your quads and hamstrings when braking. Also, in the event of a crash, your leg will go through your pelvis if it’s outstretched. Which, I’m assured, is not ideal. This might all seem a bit dry considering the pictures in front of you are of a mid-engined Italian supercar. But the fundamentals, the boring stuff, are what make the biggest differences when piloting something like a Maserati MC20 at 200mph. Now that I can actually sit correctly, I should probably start driving. We’re here to find out how easy it is for a supercar newcomer to extract performance from one on a track, but I warm up in a BMW X3 PHEV on Bedford’s West Circuit. A few laps of the 1.8-mile 12-corner circuit fly by, and before I know it I’m out in the Maserati. I’m fortunate to have had the car for a couple of days prior to this track session, so I know my way around it. But I have driven on only a handful of tracks, and I have driven only a handful of supercars, and I have never, ever combined the two. My first few laps are taken fairly gingerly. But I eventually get into the swing of it. The night before, I casually looked up the track’s layout on my phone (I suspect Lewis Hamilton does the same thing before races), which revealed I’d be tackling the shortest of the four possible configurations. Despite this, I feel a bit lost at times. Corner 11, the penultimate one, is long, sweeping and so wide. Four laps sail by and it’s time for some feedback. “There are probably more good points than I was expecting,” says Vann. Damning with faint praise there, but I’ll let him continue. “Your steering technique was absolutely fine,” he says. “But you need to use a bit more of the width of the track, which will help smoothen out that throttle.” I couldn’t agree with him more. I did feel lost and I did feel unsmooth. On the drive to Bedford, the MC20 felt like it delivered its power pretty broadly. But on track, with the adrenaline racing through me and the gearchanges coming quickly, I’ve found it all becomes a bit peaky. Out for round two. Vann’s pep talk has given me a real spring in my step and, with a bit more confidence in me now, I feel much more at home using the track’s full width and I use the accelerator and brakes more gradually and less like an on/off switch. We come in for a bit of lunch. Vann notes that I have relatively good car control. I look up at social media executive Jonathan Bryce and snapper Jack Harrison, who are with me today. Both pretend they didn’t hear it, but they did. I finish up some couscous and discover that it is now raining heavily. Damn. We hang around for a while and it calms down. Then we head outside. Vann says a greasy track can be even trickier than a wet one. He explains the benefit of shifting up early to quell the 538lb ft of turbocharged torque and we take to the track. His words fail to make much of an impression on my prefrontal cortex as I nail it in second gear and ceremoniously feel the back end snap. I catch it, though having dialled the drive mode back to Sport means the DSC will have helped. Eventually, it’s time for the final debrief. “Where I thought that you had made the most improvement was in braking, in terms of your initial hit on the brakes – getting the car slowed down,” says Vann. “The main area for improvement, and I’m sort of getting into some more advanced levels now, is actually how you release the brake pedal. “It’s one thing going on the brakes and slowing the car down, and that’s kind of obvious, but actually, how you release the brakes plays a big part in the handling of the car.” Sitting here now at my desk, I can understand the merits of not simply braking as hard as possible. But on-track Murray did not see it like that. Tedious insurance reasons meant I couldn’t time myself. But Vann reckons I’m around 12 seconds per lap faster after the tuition. He says improvements can be even larger among people coming from a lower base level. His words, not mine. The secret to supercar driving? Supercars are just like regular cars. Sorting the basics – seating position, vision, looking through a corner, braking in a straight line, straightening the steering wheel before applying power – in any car will make a difference. It’s just that there’s more at stake and there are bigger gains to be made in a supercar.",

    "description": "Last year, Ultraviolette introduced the updated F77 Mach 2, bringing subtle design tweaks, new features, and drivetrain improvements. However, many riders wanted a more comfortable  setup, especially since most F77 owners primarily rode within city limits. Enter the F77 Super Street—a refined version of the Mach 2 with adjusted ergonomics and minor design changes. So, is the Super Street the better choice among the F77 models? Absolutely. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street design updates The Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2 has always been a striking machine, and the Super Street stays true to that design. Visually and feature-wise, it remains largely unchanged from the Mach 2, with no exclusive new additions. However, it does come in four new colors, though distinguishing between the two models requires a sharp eye. The most noticeable differences are the taller, wider handlebar and a redesigned headlight cowl. The rider footpegs remain the same as before and the company says this is done to maintain some sense of aggression with the ergonomics. Feature-wise, everything carries over, including 9 levels of regen, 3 levels of traction control, and dynamic stability control as standard on both variants. Ultraviolette also claims that the new headlight cowl improves aerodynamics by 15-20 percent compared to the Mach 2. It continues to get the same 5-inch TFT that is now slightly more inclined offering better legibility. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street ride and handling Despite weighing in at 207kg, the F77 Super Street’s ergonomic tweaks have made it a more manageable machine. Compared to the Mach 2, it feels noticeably easier to maneuver at low speeds, making urban riding less demanding. That said, its weight is still apparent when lifting it off the stand or pushing it around at parking speeds. While the more relaxed riding position offers some clear improvement in comfort, it doesn’t drastically alter the overall experience. The suspension setup remains unchanged and is carried over from the Mach 2. However, the new handlebar design reduces weight over the front fork, allowing for slightly more usable suspension travel.  Our test ride was limited to a go-kart track and well-paved backroads, but on the occasional rough patch, the Super Street felt a bit more forgiving. Although, this might just be because there’s less load on your wrists and back. Handling remains sharp, and through a series of corners, the bike is just as engaging as before. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street performance and braking Like the Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2, the new F77 Super Street is available in two variants. The base model features a 7.1kWh battery, delivering 36.2hp and 90Nm of torque, with an IDC range of 211km. The top-spec F77 Super Street Recon, which we rode, comes with a larger 10.3kWh battery, delivering 40hp and 100Nm of torque, while offering an impressive 323km IDC range. Riding the Super Street is a unique experience, with ample torque always available on demand. On a tight and technical track like the one we tested on, the throttle felt precise and easy to modulate. With the highest level of regenerative braking engaged, I found myself rarely using the brakes, allowing for a smooth and fast-paced flow through corners. Braking performance is commendable, though the only drawback I noticed was the bike’s weight under heavy braking. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street verdict The F77 Mach 2 is an exciting machine but demands more from the rider due to its aggressive ergonomics. In contrast, the F77 Super Street retains all the best aspects of the Mach 2 while offering a more accessible ride with its relaxed ergonomics.  A clear representation of the difference in ergonomics between the F77 Mach 2 and Super Street. Considering it comes at essentially the same price as its sibling, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to step up to an electric motorcycle that’s both fun and engaging but also reasonably comfy for city riding.

    "description": "In a move sure to bring cheer to vintage and classic car enthusiasts, the government of India has relaxed its import policy. Previously, only cars built before 1950 were eligible, but under the new norms, cars 50 years or older can be imported licence-free. So, this year, cars built up to 1975 are eligible, extending the import period from pre-1950 to 1975 and covering an additional 25 years of the automobile history. These vintage cars can be imported by their actual users Resale of these vehicles is strictly prohibited Furthermore, the 50-year limit is on a rolling basis, meaning that cars built up to 1976 would be eligible next year, and so forth. The exact date to determine the vehicle’s age will be from the date of its first registration after the initial sale. Iconic classics from brands like Mercedes, Jaguar, Porsche and American muscle cars are among the notable examples. Is the import of vintage and classic cars completely free? No, there are fees to be paid. The import is only licence-free, which implies the actual users don't need an import licence, and they can now bring in these cars after paying the stated duties and fees. Customs duty, GST and registration all together work out to about 250 percent of the car's invoice (traded) value. What are the restrictions on the usage of these cars?  The Directorate General of Foreign Trade has strictly prohibited the resale of imported vintage cars in the Indian domestic market, stating that these cars must be for personal use and cannot be traded in any form whatsoever. It further noted that if someone resells these vehicles, stricter conditions, such as a five-year no-sale rule, could be introduced in the future. Also, cars intended for use on public roads must comply with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The policy is a significant move for vintage car collectors in India and is also expected to create more employment opportunities for restorers.

    "description": "Honda has officially entered the Indian electric two-wheeler market with its maiden offerings, the QC1 and Activa e:, launched last month at the Auto Expo. Just a few days ago, we reported that the company is looking to set up a dedicated EV manufacturing plant in India, which will likely be operational by 2028 Now, our sister publication, Autocar Professional, has exclusively learned that these are just the initial steps, and Honda is working on bringing ten new electric vehicles to India over the next five years, of which four will come between 2025 and 2027. Four new Honda EVs coming by 2027 10 new EVs coming in the next five years India will serve as a manufacturing hub for global EV models First things first, why has Honda chosen India as one of its manufacturing hubs for producing its next-generation EVs? The company’s top brass believes that the Indian market will be the fastest-growing in the coming decade, with EV penetration set to rise. Today, the electric two-wheeler market is not the fledgling niche it once was, with models like the Bajaj Chetak and TVS iQube among the top 10 bestselling scooters in the country. Not much is yet known about the future Honda EVs coming to India, but what we do know is that the company has lined up a total of 10 electric two-wheelers over the next five years. People in the know tell us that Honda is targeting a cumulative 3 lakh units per annum with the four models, which will debut in the 2025-27 timeframe. While the Activa e: and QC1 have just been launched, these two are just the first step in the grand scheme of things. Sources tell us that the next wave of EV products from Honda will be better tailored to our needs, as the company will be looking at the limitations of these two models, as well as those of its rivals and noting down the specific requirements of Indian customers.  With inputs from KETAN THAKKAR Also See: Honda showcases electric scooter, e-bike concepts at EICMA 2024",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "title": "Is This The New Le Mans Golden Age We've Been Waiting For?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",
