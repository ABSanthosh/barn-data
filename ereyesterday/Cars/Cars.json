    "title": "Meeting the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club at 50",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/meeting-gay-bikers-motorcycle-club-50",
    "description": "We meet the club's members and find out why its support remains crucial It's about enjoying the hobby we love but in an environment where we're totally safe to be who we are,\" says Kevin Bazeley, chair of the Gay Bikers Motorcycle Club (GBMCC). The GBMCC was founded in 1977, just 10 years after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 began to legalise homosexual acts in England and Wales - albeit with a higher age of consent than heterosexual acts (the discrepancy wasn't fixed until 2001). Add to this the Aids crisis of the '80s and '90s - and the ruthless reporting of it by some of the British press - and you can see why so many gay people remained closeted and communities such as this club were so crucial. And still are. \"For many of our members, it's their only avenue to be out,\" says Bazeley. \"They are in the closet in their personal lives and coming away with the club is their only opportunity to be themselves. That applies more to our older members, but even our younger folk don't always have the most welcoming environment in their everyday lives.\" Joining the GBMCC opens up a wealth of group riding opportunities, from shorter local runs to weekends away across the UK - as well as a big summer camp on the continent, where the club links up with its European equivalents. Gay Bikers attends numerous Pride events too, placing prominently in the London parade each summer. The club's 500-plus members encompass all four UK nations (as well as a handful overseas) and cover the broad LGBTQ+ spectrum. An invitation to join is extended warmly to straight allies too. \"Our problem is finding younger members,\" admits Bazeley, 57, who rides a BMW K1600 GT Sport. \"Motorcycling is no longer the cheap hobby it used to be; insurance costs alone can be crippling. Even some of our more mature members have had to give up biking for that very reason. Society is also that much more accepting now, but the club intends to be around for many more years for the riders who need us. There are a lot of mental health benefits to a club such as this, and we are a group of friends who support each other.\" The focus, though, remains on biking. \"Romances have blossomed over the years, albeit not as often as you might think,\" reveals GBMCC treasurer Stephen Blurton, 60. He's another BMW man, now on his sixth GS. \"It's about making friends and having a common interest. I've travelled 277 miles to come here this weekend; the journey is all part of the fun. It's getting out and about instead of being sat at home watching Corrie. Social isolation is a problem we all have these days. We gained more members in Covid, even when we weren't doing any events. People always need community.\" Sean McAllister, 34, rides a Honda CB650R and joined the GBMCC just as Covid restrictions were beginning to ease. \"I'd just passed my test but had no one to go out riding with,\" he says. \"Joining a club like this meant one less barrier to entry, one less way to feel like an outsider as a new biker. I wasn't the most experienced rider, so my local rep encouraged me to follow him on my first event, to tuck in behind him and follow his bike positioning.\" McAllister has been on a host of events since and even led his own routes through the south of England, one of which centred on the Super Sausage Café, a bustling bikers' haven near Silverstone \"Motorbiking can be seen as quite a macho thing,\" he continues. \"Having to come out to a traditional group like that would have been nerve-racking. Joining an environment where you don't have to go through that process is quite appealing. There's a real breadth of characters in this club and I've made some great friends.\"  Ian St John, 44, sought similar kinship. \"I've been a member since 2017, he says. \"My dad passed away and left me his motorcycle. I'd never thought about biking before, but I got my licence, searched online for a club like this and here I am. This is a place where I feel like I fit in.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/papers-are-wrong-compare-pick-ups-tanks",
    "description": "Sending off 2024 with a bang, from Jaguar XJ220 racing to Sherman tanks Have you ever seen footage of a Jaguar XJ220 racing series? I recommend it if you haven’t. Called Fast Masters, it was run in 1993 in the US as a way of building the Jaguar brand there – and, helpfully, it occupied some of Jaguar’s supercars, which after the recession of the early 1990s weren’t exactly leaping out of showrooms. (Some people who ordered them, finding themselves suddenly cash-strapped, walked away from their deposits rather than buy the finished article.) Jaguar and broadcaster ESPN attracted mostly retired big-name drivers in the US and invited them to race in this one-make series. The XJ220 wasn’t designed as a race car and didn’t seem to become much less of a handful when race-prepped. The series was nicknamed Crash Masters and remains a great watch. It remained a single-line entry in my notes app throughout 2024, worthy of mention in a column but apparently not so worthy that I could big it up to 700 words of its own, so it sat there neglected. But, as ever, I’m keen to empty my notes for the new year, so here it is. See also a single-line entry: ‘Paula Radcliffe Way’, which is a bypass near Bedford named to celebrate the area’s famous world-champion runner. Amazing to have something named after you, I’d have thought, notably when you’re alive and can still enjoy it. Most things named after people only get so once they’ve died. But I wonder: how does any celebrity in question feel about it if it’s scruffy or neglected, as is likelier with a road than, say, a bridge or a race-track corner or a stadium? Would you feel hurt to see it strewn with fast-food packaging? Would you organise a litter pick? Do you hate being contacted by phone but feel okay about texting or meeting in person? I’m told this is a thing that affects young people more and is looked down on. But I wonder: is it actually reverting to humans’ natural type? Once we could signal from afar or send written messages or meet in person, but the idea of meeting sort-of in person while still miles away from each other was an impossibility. Maybe phone calls or online meetings are now being shunned because actually they feel unnatural? Anyway, I couldn’t find a fit with cars, so I didn’t manage to put this into a column. One notepad entry for which I did think of a car angle still needs more research. When Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe took a stake in Manchester United FC, it was reported that he called people back into the office because fewer emails were sent on Fridays, when people worked at home. That stat may be true, but it’s incredibly simplistic if it happened as reported. It’s possible that I write fewer emails when I’m not in the office, but it will be because I have several thousand words to write and people tapping me on the shoulder every 20 minutes isn’t conducive to productivity. But I’ve thought – and this is why I need to bury my head in some stats – about how it relates to smart motorways. Some proponents of them say they’re the safest stretches of road in the country, despite how badly the public feels about them. What they don’t say is how safe those stretches were beforehand and whether accident rates have gone up or down since. Smart motorways were designed to ease congestion, so it stands to reason that they were first introduced on the busiest (and therefore the slowest and probably safest per passenger mile) bits of road. I will revisit this one, so it will stay in my notes app. On stats: the Sherman tank. Some media outlets think it’s a winning argument to say pick-up trucks are a similar size to a Sherman. It’s not a winner. Truth is the Sherman was an incredibly compact tank, at just 5.8m long. The contemporary Churchill tank was 7.4m long and the modern Challenger tank is over 11m long. While the Sherman could and did carry quite a lot, you couldn’t put a pallet in the back of one. Cars are now too big, yes, but this is a silly stat. And with my notes largely clear, I feel better about stepping into 2025. Happy new year.",

Then, in Las Vegas, a rare and unusual motorcycle with a wheel-mounted radial engine is about to go on the auction block. Harley-Davidson Sportster 883 by Gasoline Motor Co. Made famous by Evel Knievel, and known for its domination in American flat track racing, the Harley-Davidson XR750 is arguably the most recognizable Harley in the world. It’s little wonder then that it’s regularly used as a style reference for custom-built Harleys—like this Sportster from Gasoline Motor Co. in Sydney, Australia. Gasoline Motor Co. has built a Harley XR750 replica before—so when a customer approached them to create another, they jumped at the chance.…",

They’re adored by chopper and bobber riders, fans of vintage café racers and scramblers, scooterists, and anyone who loves the feeling of the wind in their face (and bugs in their teeth). Sure, an open face helmet won’t protect your face in a crash—but a good one can still safeguard the soft grey stuff between your ears. So if you do insist on riding in one, at least pick a decent three-quarter lid and leave the novelty ‘piss pot’ at home. Here are three options that I’ve tested extensively. Biltwell Inc. Bonanza Biltwell has a handful of killer full face helmets in their arsenal, but the open-faced Bonanza remains a mainstay of the Californian parts and apparel brand.…",

Whether it’s because of a growing family or because of financial troubles, having to part with a car you’ve poured blood, sweat, and tears into is a heartbreaking moment. Daniel can relate to that feeling all too well. Back in the 1990s, when he was 13 years old, Daniel and his family would drive by a field in Reno every week where a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Sport Coupe wearing many coats of aging paint sat next to a shed surrounded by weeds.

    "description": "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUU5nb1jAw[/embed] The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel or the embedded video up top and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

    "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.

    "description": "The Tesla Model Y facelift has gone on sale in select Asian countries and special administrative regions, bringing updates to every aspect, especially the range: 719km (CLTC estimate). The Australia and New Zealand Tesla websites show the facelifted EV as well. Besides Korea, the delivery timeline in these lands ranges between March and June. Only the Long Range AWD and RWD variants have been refreshed The revised Model Y (code name: Project Juniper) is 47mm longer than the previous car Initial deliveries will begin in China, one of the world’s top EV markets Other markets including North and South America, Europe and the Middle East still offer the pre-facelift Model Y. In January 2024, the Tesla Model Y was crowned the world’s best-selling vehicle, with then estimated sales of 1.23 million units. Tesla Model Y facelift dimensions, exterior, colors Aerodynamic 19-inch alloy wheels enhance range; connected rear LED bar is new The 2025 Model Y runs 4,797mm in length, 47mm more than the pre-facelift car. However, the width is a scant 1mm narrower at 1,624mm. Its drag coefficient (Cd) has reduced from 0.23 to 0.22, which can contribute to boosting range and reducing wind noise. This year’s update makes the electric SUV adopt Tesla’s new design language with a connected light strip identical to the Cybercab robotaxi. Nearly the entire face is sealed save for the air dam. Door handles on the side are electrically operated and blend in well with the doors for aero. For maximum range, 19-inch alloy wheels will be ideal; 20-inch ones are optional but less efficient. The width-wide LED treatment is followed at the back too and the bumper looks chunkier than before.  Color availability differs on a region-to-region basis Tesla is offering up to six shades with the Model Y electric vehicle, namely Pure Black (in Taiwan only), Starry Grey, Pearl White, Glacier Blue, Flame Red and Quicksilver. The nomenclature and availability of these shades differ in the Asian countries where the Tesla best-seller is offered.  Tesla Model Y facelift interior, features Inside, subtle changes were made to the materials used and equipment. To keep the dashboard uncluttered, the central 15.5-inch touchscreen houses all key controls of the car and runs on an updated OS. The front seats now get the ventilation function with new fabric upholstery. Tesla has further added an 8-inch touchscreen for rear passengers to play games and control AC, mounted just behind the front centre armrest. The Model Y's official boot capacity is unclear, but with the back seats folded down in the five-seater EV, it is over 2,130 litre (2,041 litre previously). Tesla Model Y facelift safety Tesla Model Y automatic lane change feature The Model Y’s monocoque body frame has been engineered to better absorb impact during a crash. Autonomous driving is taken care of by advanced driver assistance systems with hardware like a front autopilot camera and blind spot monitoring lights in the ORVMs. The over-the-air (OTA) updates-enabled touchscreen inside also displays lane change animations when self-driving. While a Basic autopilot package is standard with the Model Y, Enhanced and Full-Self Driving bundles are optional upgrades. Tesla Model Y facelift range, charging speed As mentioned earlier, only the Long Range AWD and RWD Model Y variants are refreshed as of now. They have claimed ranges of up to 719km and 662km per charge, respectively, according to the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC). For reference, this is up 117km and 59km to the older Model Y SUV. Even the 0 to 100kmph sprint time has improved by 0.5 seconds at 4.3 seconds in the AWD car and the single motor takes 0.6 seconds less at 5.9 seconds to clock the 100kph mark. Peak charging speed remains at 250kW, with up to 266km added in 15 minutes.  Also, see: Tesla restarts scouting for showroom space in Delhi Tesla Cybertruck image gallery",

    "description": "Mahindra is usually known to keep away from public motor shows, but this time, the homegrown manufacturer will be looking to make a lasting impression with its new range of EVs at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025. The new BE 6 and XEV 9e will be headlining Mahindra pavilion at the Auto Expo, and the carmaker will also have a couple of concepts on display. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e The recently launched BE 6 and the XEV 9e will be of high interest. Both SUVs are based on Mahindra’s cutting-edge born-electric INGLO platform, but they take different approaches to design. The 4.3-metre BE 6 is sportier and more radical, while the larger 4.8-metre XEV 9e adopts a more practical style despite its coupé-SUV form factor. The duo share their powertrain and battery. The base model is offered with a 59kWh battery with a single rear motor setup producing 231hp and 380Nm. The BE 6 has a claimed range of 556km, while the XEV 9e returns 542km (MIDC range). Meanwhile, the top-spec Pack Three variant with the 79kWh battery produces 286hp and 380Nm of torque. Claimed range stands at 682km and 656km for the BE 6 and XEV 9e, respectively. Prices for BE 6 range between Rs 18.90 lakh and Rs 26.90 lakh, while the XEV 9e is priced between Rs 21.90 lakh and Rs 30.50 lakh (ex-showroom).     Mahindra Rall-E concept Also on display at Mahindra’s pavilion will be the Rall-E concept, which was first showcased in February 2023 at Mahindra’s EV Fashion Festival in Hyderabad. The rugged-looking Rall-E is essentially an off-road-focused iteration of the BE 6. It gets major design updates to suit its image as an off-road-ready alternative. The BE 6’s C-shaped daytime running lamps make way for just one sleek strip, and it gets round headlights that are nestled in the heavily cladded front bumper.  The cladding carriesover to the profile, with Mahindra giving it more rugged tyres. At the rear, the BE 6e’s C-shaped tail-lights make way for a single strip, and it gets a more aggressive-looking rear bumper. What completes its off-road look are a bunch of accessories like the roof-mounted carrier, a spare wheel on top of it and a couple of jerry cans. Mahindra XEV 7e Mahindra is also expected to showcase the conventional SUV body style version of the XEV 9e, which will likely be called the XEV 7e. It is essentially an EV equivalent of the ICE-powered XUV700, which means it ditches the raked roofline of the XEV 9e for a three-row seating layout on the inside. It’ll likely share all of the 9e’s features, safety kit, tech, battery and powertrain options. Mahindra is expected to launch the XEV 7e in the second half of this year.
