    "description": "Entry-level Sealion 7 gets 308bhp, enough for a 0-62mph time of 6.7sec Electric family SUV is one of six new models the Chinese giant will introduce in Europe by 2025 BYD has announced its new Sealion 7 SUV will start from £44,990, undercutting the rival Tesla Model Y by £2000. It's the brand’s first European model to use the new 'Evo' development of the architecture that underpins the existing Atto 3 crossover, Dolphin hatchback and Seal saloon, named e-Platform 3.0. It uses cell-to-body construction (in which battery cells are mounted directly to the chassis) with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery and can support a range of motor configurations. The entry-level Sealion 7 Comfort gets a single 308bhp, 280lb ft motor mounted on its rear axle, plus an 82.5kWh battery that gives a range of 300 miles between charges. The lightest variant weighs 2225kg and can dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in 6.7sec. The middle-rung Design costs £49,290 and adds a 215bhp motor to the front axle. This gives four-wheel drive and outputs of 523bhp and 509lb ft, cutting the car's 0-62mph time to 4.5sec. However, it also increases the car’s mass to 2340kg and reduces its range to 283 miles.  The range-topping Excellence is £57,290 and uses the same 523bhp powertrain, but it gets a larger, 91.3kWh battery, boosting its range to 312 miles. With this larger battery and extra interior kit (including nappa leather seats and a head-up display), the Sealion 7 weighs 2435kg. Nonetheless, it can hit 62mph in the same 4.5sec as the Design. Both the Comfort and Design cars can be charged at a rate of up to 150kW on a DC connection, taking 32 minutes to go from 10-80%. The Excellence is upgraded to a 230kW peak, cutting that time to 24 minutes. A heat pump (which more efficiently generates heat for the cabin than a conventional fan heater, boosting the car's range in cold conditions) is fitted to all versions as standard. Inside, the Sealion 7 gets a 15.6in infotainment touchscreen that is capable of rotating between portrait and landscape orientations and features a new voice control system. This is said to be capable of detecting which of the five occupants is speaking from four zones inside the car, allowing the system to make tweaks specific to where the person is sitting. Asking the car to reduce the temperature from the rear seats will tweak the rear climate zone, for instance. The Sealion 7 is also fitted with a 10.25in instrument display, four USB ports (two up front and two in the back) and a vehicle-to-load socket, allowing the car’s battery to power external devices up to 3.3kW. Boot space is claimed to measure 520 litres with the rear seats up and 1789 litres with them folded down. UK deliveries of the Sealion 7 are due to begin early next year. It is one of six new models (three battery-electric cars and three plug-in hybrids) that the Chinese brand will be launching in Europe over the next 14 months.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-amgs-new-super-suv-pack-more-1000bhp",
    "description": "New car is being developed with \"AMG first, EV second\" mantra Electric GT SUV will use advanced tech to take on Eletre and Cayenne EVs Mercedes-AMG’s answer to the Lotus Eletre and upcoming electric Porsche Cayenne will be launched in two years and be one of the most powerful cars the brand has ever produced. Currently known as the electric GT SUV – a name it is understood could be carried into production – the super-SUV has hit the road in prototype form for the first time and the production version is set to reach UK forecourts in 2027. It is the first SUV that AMG has developed independent of parent Mercedes-Benz. The EV will sit on the AMG.EA architecture, which will be used first for a four-door production version of the Vision AMG concept in 2026. AMG.EA will feature 800V and advanced axial-flux electric motors in both twin and tri set-ups, with outputs well over 1000bhp expected to be offered. Developed by Yasa, the Oxfordshire-based firm owned by Mercedes-Benz, these motors each develop up to 480bhp and 590lb ft and are seen by AMG as a key performance differentiator for its new SUV. Among the performance benchmarks for the new AMG model is the 906bhp Lotus Eletre R. AMG’s dedicated SUV will be heavily focused on road-going performance but insiders have told Autocar it will offer variable ride height control to improve ground clearance in off-road use. As for styling, prototypes reveal that its bold-looking design will incorporate elements that provide clear visual connections with its saloon sibling. The front end is also set to feature a new interpretation of AMG’s Panamericana grille, together with distinctive headlights that include the three-pointed star graphics. Flared wheel arches and wide rear haunches dominate the flanks, while retractable door handles – as seen on the EQE SUV and EQS SUV – increase aerodynamic efficiency. Although AMG’s existing combustion-engined GLE-based models come in both SUV and SUV-coupé bodystyles, its new electric model will be offered solely in SUV form, with a “relatively upright tailgate and angled rear window” providing “the best balance between form and load-carrying space”, insiders have told Autocar. Dimensionally, the new model sits between the 4863mm-long EQE SUV and 5125mm-long EQS SUV. Inside, it adopts a unique design for the dashboard and displays, together with new AMG.OS software. “SUVs have been among our most popular models for many years,” AMG CEO Michael Schiebe told Autocar. “We are responding to this by offering customers a high-performance off-roader based on the AMG.EA platform. Our new high-performance architecture follows a clear philosophy: AMG first, EV second.” AMG is remaining tight-lipped about the battery technology. However, Autocar has been told it will introduce a different chemistry combination to offer greater efficiency and a longer range than the existing lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt battery used by existing electric-powered AMG models. Extensive development is also being done on heat management, especially around liquid cooling, to support much faster charging rates. For reference, today’s Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4Matic+ uses a 90.6kWh (usable) pack that has a claimed maximum range of 321 miles and can support a charging speed of 170kW – good for a top up of 112 miles of range in just 15 minutes. Additional new software developments and inverter technology developed in partnership with Mercedes’ High Performance Powertrain division in Brixworth are also on the way, Autocar has been told. The new AMG SUV is underpinned by double-wishbone and multi-link suspension featuring the company’s newly introduced Active Ride Control system – a set-up also being readied for its new electric saloon. Already incorporated on the current SL, GT and the latest evolution of the 45-year-old G-Class, Active Ride Control features hydraulic pumps for each wheel to help reduce body roll while providing constant self-levelling properties. Without traditional roll bars connecting the two opposing wheels front and rear, it can also isolate the compression and rebound characteristics at each wheel in a bid to improve the ride over AMG’s earlier suspension developments. Additionally, this set-up will support an automatic reduction in ride height at higher speeds for added aerodynamic efficiency. Production of the new SUV will take place alongside the upcoming saloon at Mercedes’ Sindelfingen facility in Germany.",

The R80 and its successor the R100GS combined the best of BMW’s road-going features with increased suspension travel and the new ‘monolever’ swingarm in a form that excelled on any terrain, setting the stage for hundreds of thousands of dual-sport BMWs since. For all their timeless rugged charm, you wouldn’t call either bike stylish in a traditional sense, prompting a unique challenge for the craftsman at Stile Italiano.

    "description": "\"It’s fat, it’s slow, it’s a plug-in hybrid, it’s got an EV mode,\" they said. \"Is it even an M5,\" they asked? Yes, the new seventh-gen F90 M5 has attracted a lot of criticism, but naysayers also forget that this is the most powerful M5 ever built. And, unlike a few of its compatriots, going hybrid hasn’t sacrificed some of its cylinders. So, is this really an M5 then? We got to spend some time behind the wheel at the Buddh F1 circuit to try and figure out just that. BMW M5 engine and performance Let’s begin with the heart of the matter. The good news here is that while the new M5 is a hybrid, the engine is still the 4.4 litre V8. Let’s not forget the recently updated Mercedes AMG C 63 went hybrid, too, but it lost four of its eight cylinders. In the M5’s case, it’s added on a 197hp, 280Nm motor powered by an 18.6kW lithium-ion battery. Together with the 585hp, 750Nm V8, total system output stands at an impressive 727hp and 1,000Nm; hence, the most powerful M5 ever built. Acceleration is always instant thanks to the electric system. Sure, folks have called this M5 slow and that’s driven by the fact that at a claimed 0-100kph time of 3.5 seconds is a smidgen slower off the blocks than the previous car's 3.4-second claim. But you really can’t tell unless, perhaps, you drove them back-to-back. But leave the standing start aside and it's brilliant on the move – mash down on the throttle and off you go in an instant, with the electric system filling in nicely while the turbo spools up. Down the start-finish as well as the back straight, it was ridiculous seeing how quickly I was reeling in the XM, our lead car. I had to lift off each time. BMW M5 handling So it’s quick, now to figure out the issue of its weight. Coming in at just under 2.5 tonnes, the M5 is very heavy – remember, it’s got all-wheel-drive, has retained the V8 and added a motor and battery. But modern chassis systems do wonders at melting away fat. Sure, the M5 provides ample grip and good body control, but you do feel the weight. Especially out here on a race track where you’re coming in faster, braking later and going around a bend far quicker than you would on a public road. It’s not light on its feet, you feel the amount of mass you’re shifting, and the brakes feel like they are hard at work. But a point to note here, this press car had already done five sets of hard laps before this. Dynamically, on the whole, it will certainly feel better in the real world, so I can’t wait to drive it there. It does feel its weight in the corners. As with every modern car, there’s loads you can do with the electronics. Forget drive modes, you can adjust the suspension, the 8-speed gearbox’s shifts, the steering, brakes and the 4WD system, and it also has a 2WD mode. With just two laps, there was no time to work with the setup so I just left it in the sportiest settings. I tried rear-wheel-drive mode for a brief moment and the tail happily obliged with a little lean before ESP kicked in. BMW M5 interiors Besides the many controls for the chassis, there’s the M1 and M2 shortcut buttons on the steering that call up configurations of your choice. M cars can also be specified with the M Drive Professional option – which brings in a ‘Boost’ mode activated via a long pull on the left paddle – and ‘Track’ mode, which deactivates electronic nannies. You also get sport seats, which were quite wide for my narrow frame. Other M-specific bits include an Anthracite headliner and M-specific ambient lighting. Steering-mounted controls for chassis finished in red add to the sporty ambience. M5s also come with a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Diamond surround sound system with 18 speakers. Apart from the sound of the mighty V8, the music system also amplifies the sound by piping it in via the speakers. Other bits are familiar BMW, so you have the crystal dial for the central controller and the single-piece, curved glass panel, which houses a 12.3-inch instrument display and a 14.9-inch touchscreen. BMW M5 exterior Unlike the regular 5 Series that's available in India only in long wheelbase (3,105mm) format, the M version uses the regular 3,006mm wheelbase, so that's an obvious way to tell them apart. India-spec 5 Series' wheelbase is a noticeable 99mm longer than the M5. Furthermore, you get M-specific bits all around, like a massive bumper and air intakes lower down, an air splitter finished in carbon fibre if you opt for the carbon pack. The pack also adds carbon on the roof, rear view mirrors, rear spoiler and rear diffuser. Interestingly, the front grille, whose profile is illuminated, has a significant portion closed off, much like you’d see on an EV. At the rear, quad exhaust pipes and a massive two-section diffuser announce this car’s sporty side. BMW M5 price and verdict The M5 is priced at Rs 1.99 crore, ex-showroom, which is a significant mark up over the previous car’s Rs 1.62 crore. But it’s also just Rs 4 lakh over the sporty Mercedes-AMG C 63 (Rs 1.95 crore), which though a hybrid, uses a smaller 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. So is the new M5 worth the sticker price? We’ll know after a full review out on the road. But to answer the big question everyone’s been asking: is this an M5? The answer is yes. It’s not the greatest in its long line of ancestors, but an M5 it surely is.

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "The soon-to-be-launched TVS 300cc ADV has been spotted testing shortly after the brand announced an all-new 300cc engine. Here’s a breakdown of what we could see from the spy shots. Will likely feature the RT-XD4 300cc engine Appears to have a large tank Gets USD fork TVS 300cc ADV: what do the spy shots reveal? From what’s visible so far, it seems like the design will be more a crossover-style ADV rather than an out-and-out off-road bike. This is evident from its alloy wheels and what is likely to be a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear setup. Aesthetically, the bike stands tall and looks like an all-rounder Adventure bike for the streets, offering split seats, all-LED lighting and a beak at the front to complete the look. This test unit was also spotted with a few accessories like auxiliary lighting, a top box and crash protection suggesting a line of accessories will be available alongside the motorcycle when it goes on sale. The ADV features a USD fork as well as a mono-shock at the rear. TVS already offers preload adjustable suspension in some lower 200cc models, so it’s fair to expect at least that much adjustability in both the front and rear suspension units. The bike is expected to include ride-by-wire technology, riding modes and switchable traction control for enhanced versatility. The spied motorcycle looked production-ready and it is expected to launch in the first half of 2025. When on sale, this motorcycle will rival the likes of the KTM Duke 250 Adventure, Yezdi Adventure and the BMW G310 GS. TVS RT-XD4 engine details TVS recently unveiled its latest engine at MotoSoul, the RT-XD4. This engine displaces 299cc and is both liquid-cooled (for the head) and air/oil-cooled (for the crankcases). TVS also stated that this motor can produce a peak output of 35hp at 9,000rpm and 28.5Nm at 7,000 rpm.

    "description": "A year after Toyota revealed the Maruti eVX-based Urban SUV concept, the Japanese brand has taken the wraps off the final production version, the Urban Cruiser EV. While it carries over much from the concept, the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV is slightly smaller, and other than the design, it shares a lot with the recently revealed Suzuki e Vitara, which will come to India with a Maruti badge. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV is shorter in length than the concept version Like the e Vitara, it will have 49kWh and 61kWh battery options and optional AWD Features include ADAS suite, 10.25-inch digital instrumentation, 10.1-inch touchscreen Toyota Urban Cruiser EV design and dimensions Naturally, many details from the concept’s design have been toned down for the final production model. While the grille and headlights are still thin units, they are not as slim as those seen in the concept, and the front bumper also adopts a less angular radiator section. Along the sides, most details of the two-box e-SUV have been retained from the concept, with black plastic cladding giving it the requisite SUV cues. Toyota will offer the Urban Cruiser EV with 18-inch or 19-inch aero-optimised wheels. Like the e Vitara, the Urban Cruiser EV has rear door handles in the C-pillar. At the back, Toyota’s new ‘born-EV’ features a toned-down yet elongated version of the concept’s tail-lights and roof spoiler and a chunky rear bumper. In rear styling, the Urban Cruiser overlaps significantly with the e Vitara. Toyota says it will offer a wide variety of colour options, including dual-tone ones with a contrasting black roof. From concept to production, the born-electric SUV has lost about 15mm in overall length (4,285mm) and 20mm in width (1,800mm), but its height has increased by 20mm to 1,640mm. The wheelbase size is the same at 2,700mm. Interestingly, these dimensions also make the Urban Cruiser EV marginally larger than the Suzuki e Vitara. Toyota claims a 5.2 metres turning radius for the e-SUV. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV battery and motors We’ve reported that this Toyota e-SUV shares a lot with the e Vitara, from the skateboard platform to the battery pack options and motors. The Urban Cruiser EV has lithium-iron phosphate cells with 49kWh and 61kWh capacities. Urban Cruisers with the smaller battery will have a front axle-mounted 144hp, 189Nm motor, while those with the larger battery will pack a 174hp, 189Nm front motor. Like the e Vitara, an AWD version will also be on offer, which is powered by the 61kWh battery and comes with an addition 65hp rear axle-mounted motor. The Urban Cruiser in AWD form has a total output of 184hp and 300Nm of torque. These versions will also get hill-descent control and a ‘Trail Mode’, which assists during rough-roading. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV interior and features The Urban Cruiser EV’s cabin is nearly identical to the e Vitara, from the dashboard layout and two-spoke steering wheel to the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen. The images released by Toyota show an electronic parking brake with auto hold, drive modes, a single-zone auto climate control, wireless phone charger and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other confirmed features – at least on range-topping trims – include powered driver’s seat adjust, a JBL audio system and a sunroof. The Japanese brand has also confirmed that the EV’s rear seats will come with a sliding and reclining function, along with a 40:20:40 split-folding function.  The safety kit on the Urban Cruiser EV will come in the form of a 360-degree camera and an ADAS suite that includes a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure alert and lane-keep assist. Like the Maruti on which it is based, six airbags are expected to be standard. Toyota Urban Cruiser EV India launch While the Japanese brand has yet to confirm when its new EV will be introduced to the Indian market, we expect the Urban Cruiser to arrive later in 2025. As it is an international model (though it’ll be made in India at Suzuki’s Gujarat facility), the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV will make its public debut at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show, which will begin on January 10. The company has confirmed that prices for the UK-spec model will be announced during the third quarter of 2025.
