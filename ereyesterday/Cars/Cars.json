    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/bmw-ce-02-road-test-review-434534#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The BMW CE 02 represents an innovative leap, targeting younger, eco-conscious riders who might overlook traditional BMW motorcycles. In India, it appeals to a niche audience with higher disposable incomes, valuing style and badge value over practicality. While its price may seem steep, the CE 02 offers a compelling case, particularly when compared to its more expensive sibling. Love it or hate it, the CE 02’s design is undeniably catchy. Neither a bike nor a scooter, BMW dubs it an “e-parkourer” meant for fun, short-distance commuting. Practicality, however, takes a backseat with no storage or additional seating space, making its heavy charger or a pillion inconvenient to carry. Upon first glance, the rider footpegs seem like an afterthought and feel out of place in the otherwise cohesive design. The rider footpegs look like a bit of an afterthought on the CE 02. With minimal bodywork, a low stance and a futuristic aesthetic, the CE 02 captures attention from a diverse range of onlookers. During my time with it, teenagers, adults, and even senior citizens frequently enquired about it.  A stylish single-piece seat that looks and feels like an ironing board. The bike’s low 745mm seat height and light 142kg weight make it approachable for beginners, but the bench-like seat limits comfort as it is best suited for solo riders. Additionally, the low-mounted tail-light is poorly positioned, making it less visible to tailgaters. A rather cute face and an LED headlamp with good illumination. On the features front, the CE 02 comes equipped with LED lighting, a 3.5-inch TFT display, keyless start, two riding modes, a reverse feature, adjustable levers, a Type-C charging socket and Bluetooth connectivity.  Extremely crisp micro TFT that is both easy to read and use. Our test unit included the Highline package, an optional upgrade costing Rs 50,000. This adds features like a fast charger, additional switchgear, a smartphone holder, an extra riding mode called “Flash”, a tri-coloured seat, heated grips, a gold-finished fork and some graphics.  The charger cover is rather simple-looking and feels basic to use. The Highline package is worth considering for a more enriched experience overall. Additionally, the accessory comfort seat, priced at Rs 12,000, is also recommended due to the limited cushioning of the standard seat. Besides this, if you buy the standard version and wish to add the fast charger, it will cost you Rs 70,000, which makes the Highline package a no-brainer.   The CE 02 offers three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. Flow combines high regenerative braking with a linear throttle response, Surf disables regen for a freer ride, and Flash delivers maximum regen with a sharp throttle response. There’s an additional Battery Saver mode that requires manual activation via the menu, while a Low Power mode automatically engages at alow charge. Surf mode proved ideal for my highway commutes to work, offering effortless coasting. Riding the CE 02 in Mumbai was a joy, thanks to its ample torque and quick acceleration. In our tests, the CE 02 accelerates quicker to 80kph than most 160cc motorcycles, aligning closer to a fast sub-160cc or a slower 200cc bike. Its lightweight build enhances its agility and pace, especially in city conditions, and the traction control ensures confidence on loose surfaces. The claimed 108km range holds up well for regular commutes, and the fast charger tops up the battery in about three and a half hours.   While the brakes offer excellent feedback, the lack of dual-channel ABS is a drawback since the rear wheel is prone to locking under aggressive braking. This is especially so when paired with the CE 02’s strong regenerative braking, which reduced how much I found myself using the brakes. The single-sided swingarm looks quite cool and gets a lot of attention. It is lightweight and has a low centre of gravity, which makes it highly manoeuvrable and enjoyable for city commutes. The suspension provides decent comfort at moderate speeds but struggles over potholes or bumps, often unsettling the rider. Ground clearance seems decent, but BMW would not share the exact figure with us. The fork is non-adjustable, and the rear shock is preload adjustable.  The low-mounted tail-light is hidden from tailgaters or tall SUVs. The Michelin City Grip 2 tyres deliver reliable traction overall despite varying riding styles. The CE 02 is an otherwise comfortable little commuter, but its thin and minimally padded seat becomes a pain after about an hour. The riding posture is upright, with wide bars allowing for better control.   This is by no means a practical purchase. Despite being made at TVS’ plant in Hosur, at Rs 4.99 lakh for the Highline package-equipped CE 02, it is an expensive proposition. Then again, it is the most affordable BMW EV and offers a blend of bold design, high-quality construction and engaging performance.  A rather charming little machine that tugs on your heartstrings and yanks on your wallet. Its quirky styling may not appeal to everyone, but it undeniably turns heads. For those well-heeled few who can afford this and are looking for an easy, stylish and completely left-field city-centric two-wheeler with superb badge value, the CE 02 promises a unique and fun experience.",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-long-termer/ather-rizta-long-term-review-1200km-report-434554#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "In the build-up to the Rizta’s launch, Ather had released some very bold advertisements showcasing how big the scooter’s seat would be, featuring a prominent Indian professional wrestler. Naturally, I initially took all of that with a grain of salt, but now that I’ve actually used the Rizta extensively with a pillion aboard, I can confirm this is a really spacious and comfortable seat. Pillions of all shapes and sizes have sat behind me, and even the taller and heftier ones were comfortable. The backrest (standard on the Z variants) also goes some way in keeping the passenger comfortable. The well-padded seat is one of the most spacious units around, backrest keeps the pillion comfy. With just the rider aboard, the Rizta’s ride can feel a little stiff, although it’s never uncomfortable. However, when you’re carrying a passenger, this setup pays dividends and shields you from all but the worst bumps Mumbai has to offer. That said, the Rizta’s suspension is a bit of a double-edged sword, but we’ll come to the bad bits later on. As anyone who has ever ridden with a pillion will tell you, if your vehicle has a less-than-ideal throttle response, it’s going to be unpleasant, especially in stop-and-go traffic, where you need to give minute inputs almost constantly. What I absolutely love about the Rizta is its crisp and direct throttle response, which allows you to modulate the throttle very precisely in stop-and-go traffic without causing any unwanted herky-jerkiness. Accelerator response feels well-tuned in both modes, is precise and direct. What isn’t nice in our pothole-littered city, though, is the stiff front fork. It thuds over every single bump, and the big ones, especially, make their presence felt with a rather rude jolt to the rider’s hands. The 450X-derived front fork is too stiff, which hampers overall comfort over bumps. Another problem is that when you’re making a lock-to-lock U-turn, the Rizta’s handlebar fouls your knees. On a scooter with so much space in most other regards, the lack of it in this area stands out like a sore thumb. Ather has repurposed a lot of what was on the sporty 450 here, which is why these downsides have also transferred over to the Rizta. Lock-to-lock U-turns require taller riders to move their knees out of the way. But in the grand scheme of things, these are two issues I can look past, given how light the Rizta is on my pocket and, otherwise, how well it handles the daily grind in general. And since the Rizta and the 450 are quite closely related under their distinctly different skins, there are also some strong points – like the crisp handling – that I’m thoroughly enjoying.

    "description": "With the BYD Sealion 7, the Chinese brand has truly cemented its position as a high-end EV maker in the Indian marketplace.  Its first two offerings, the e6 (now evolved into the eMax 7) and the Atto 3, took a while to gain traction for various reasons, while the Seal sedan was the first sign that this was a brand intent on upsetting the established order. The Sealion 7 is the Seal’s crossover counterpart, and though the two share some similarities, there are tangible improvements in key areas that give the newer model a much broader appeal. BYD Sealion 7 exterior design 170mm ground clearance For one, it’s an SUV, and that fact in and of itself will endear it to many more buyers, but the more practical consideration is ground clearance, which is now up to 170mm from the Seal’s 145mm.  That aside, though, it’s not a traditional SUV in its proportions, which lean heavily towards the coupe SUV or crossover end of the spectrum.  2.9-metre wheelbase At 4.8 metres long with a 2.9-metre wheelbase, it’s not a small car, but its sloping roof and tightly skinned curves make it appear a lot more compact than it actually is. To these eyes, though it uses an evolved version of the Seal’s design language, dubbed ‘Ocean X’, the proportions aren’t quite as appealing as the sedan’s, particularly its taller nose, which carries a lot of visual bulk. 19- and 20-inch wheels This is offset somewhat by the generous use of contrast black trim, particularly around the large wheel arches that house 19-inch wheels (20-inchers on the AWD version) and a huge diffuser that’s cut into the rear bumper. BYD Sealion 7 interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior design is not as characterful as the Seal’s, with a conventional-looking rectangular central console and a horizontal and flat dashboard, which does at least integrate some interesting ambient lighting elements. 15.6-inch rotating touchscreen The digital driver’s display is incorporated into that flat panel, and making a return is the signature rotating touchscreen, which stretches the tape at 15.6 inches across.  What impresses the most, once again, is the cabin quality and fit and finish, which are truly on par with the best luxury brands and, in certain areas, surpass them. Quality as good as luxury cars There’s soft-touch material on even the lower half of the dashboard, and you have to scratch around the footwell to find a rough plastic bit. Panel fit is tight across the board, save for a few ill-fitting panels on the door, and though pretty straightforward in its design, the cabin is not without a few quirks, like the door ‘handles’, which are more like lift-up flaps.  Comfortable seats with generous cushioning The front seats are supremely comfortable (and ventilated), with a nice mix of firm and soft cushioning in just the right places. The rear seats feature similar cushioning and can be reclined quite significantly, but more significant is the amount of space on offer, particularly legroom, thanks to the long wheelbase. Big glass area gives a spacious feeling You’re seated quite low relative to the window line, but there’s a large glass area that gives a good sense of airiness; window blinds would have helped, though. BYD Sealion 7 features and safety Large fixed glass roof with sunshade Speaking of glass, a huge fixed glass panel stretches the length and width of the roof, but unlike in the Seal, you get a powered roller blind to block out the sun on really hot days. Another small but helpful change is that the AC vents are regular, manually controlled in the Sealion, and not electronically adjusted like in the Seal.   Driver's display is cluttered The screens, as before, are extremely slick with high-resolution graphics; however, the driver’s display features an extremely cluttered layout with far too much information thrown at you, which is distracting. There is a heads-up display, too, and while it’s high in resolution, it, too, places far too much data in your field of view. The touchscreen, thankfully, has an improved UI, but we wish BYD hadn’t stuffed so many basic functions into it. BYD Sealion 7 feature highlights  The Sealion 7 is very well-equipped, with the likes of wireless smartphone integration, a punchy 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered and ventilated front seats, automatic headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, dual-zone climate control, a ventilated wireless phone charger, and more. 11 airbags, Level 2 ADAS On the safety front, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters as well.  There’s also ADAS with Level 2 autonomous driving, one of the clearest 360-degree cameras around, and a driver attention monitor that’s way too sensitive, given the sheer number of distractions in the touchscreen alone. BYD Sealion 7 battery, range and charging Unlike the Seal, the Sealion 7 just gets a single battery option – the larger 82.56kWh pack that uses BYD’s standard-setting Blade Cell LFP technology. Up to 567km range  However, with two powertrain options, there are two sets of range figures as well – 567km (NEDC) for the single-motor version and 542km for the more powerful (and 100kg heavier) dual-motor variant. BYD cars, in our experience, come close to their claimed range figures, and though we weren’t able to do a full range test on this short drive, our mixed driving conditions still yielded an equivalent range of close to 500km on the single-motor version.   7kW wallbox charger provided On a DC fast charger, the battery can be charged at speeds up to an impressive 150kW, while on an AC fast charger, it can do 11kW. But disappointingly, the home wallbox charger BYD supplies maxes out at just 7kW, which is slow for such a large battery. The Sealion 7, like other BYD models, features a vehicle-to-load (VTL) function that lets you charge other devices, such as speakers, electric stoves, lamps and camping gear, off the car’s battery. BYD Sealion 7 driving impressions We were able to spend some time with both versions of the Sealion 7, and there are some clear distinctions in the driving experience.  Dual-motor version makes 530hp The AWD dual-motor version packs a substantial 530hp and 690Nm, allowing for a 0-100kph sprint in just 4.5 seconds, a figure we were able to achieve and verify on our VBOX testing gear. You can feel that performance advantage instantly and in any drive mode, but as you drive it longer, what you appreciate more is how tidily the AWD version puts down its power.  The RWD has ‘only’ 310hp and 380Nm, but in everyday driving, these outputs feel more than ample for a luxury car of this size. Smooth, progressive power delivery At low and medium speeds, both versions serve up a smooth and progressive power delivery, much unlike the flat or spiky shot of acceleration we are used to from most electric cars, which is welcome. However, once you get into triple-digit speeds, while the powertrain itself is silent (no artificially generated sound here), you start to hear more of the outside world, particularly at the rear, as while the front windows are double-glazed for better insulation, the rear ones are not. BYD Sealion 7: Acceleration from restSpeed (kph)Time (seconds)200.81401.60602.38803.291004.50 Not as sporty as the Seal sedan The Sealion 7 makes no pretence of being a sporty handler. Where the low-slung Seal sedan feels sharp and agile going around a corner at speed, the SUV rolls quite a bit, and you instantly feel the weight and higher centre of gravity. This is not a bad thing, of course, as it only serves to elucidate the Sealion’s positioning as a comfortable luxury car and not a sports model, although its ultra-responsive and quick steering is somewhat at odds with this philosophy.   Composed and comfortable ride The ride has a slight firmness to it, something we usually expect from a European car, but on balance, this is better suited to managing the 2.3-tonne mass than an outright soft suspension setup. A slight spoilsport is the wheels, which tend to register a ‘thump’ as they go over bumps – something that’s more pronounced with the 20-inch set that comes on the dual-motor version. 2025 BYD Sealion 7 price and verdict The BYD Sealion 7 is the perfect answer for those buyers who were intrigued by the prospect of the Seal but stayed away because of the ground clearance or sedan form factor.    Reasons to buy a BYD Sealion 7 It brings back what we loved – most notably the plush, well-put-together cabin, which genuinely feels right on par with a European luxury car. BYD’s powertrain expertise shows in the smoothness and sophistication of the power delivery and how keenly the Blade Cell LFP battery clings on to every electron, maximising the range. There’s a lot of tech in the Sealion 7, be it for infotainment, safety or everyday comfort and convenience, and while all of it is useful, we wish some of it was presented in a more user-friendly manner. BYD Sealion 7 price and rivals At a price of Rs 48.90 lakh to Rs 54.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the BYD Sealion 7 confidently wades into the crowded space of electric cars in India, armed with the latest tech and know-how.  Similarly priced crossovers include the BMW iX1 LWB, Kia EV6, Volvo C40 Recharge and Mercedes-Benz EQA, of which the Kia comes closest in size and specs.  BYD’s sales and service network is small compared to these established brands, but it is growing, as is the ready availability of cars. As for the product itself, on first impressions at least, it’s one of the best of its kind at the price, and a premium electric car buyer should definitely have it on their shortlist.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/bmw-says-it-eight-years-away-needing-solid-state-battery",
    "description": "The updated BMW iX in xDrive 60 guise offers the most range in the brand's stable with 426 miles Munich firm claims advances in current battery technology will yield more range benefits to customers in coming years BMW is not focussing on solid-state battery technology for the coming years, and instead insists there is “a long way to go” with today’s lithium iron (LI) and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) packs – which it will instead continue to develop. Solid-state batteries are widely said to be crucial to EV longevity because they offer greater capacity and more range than similar-sized LI/NMC packs in use today. That's because of their simplified make-up that is lighter, less susceptible to temperature variations and can be charged faster. But while firms such as rival Mercedes-Benz claim they are close to putting the technology into production, Martin Schuster, BMW’s vice president of next-generation battery tech Martin Schuster, estimates that the BMW Group is eight years away from needing a solid state battery option in its lineup. He said: “The most important thing is the lithium iron battery: it's not finished. You [still] see improvements. There is no one and only battery. It will not come. But the lithium ion at the moment [can] improve in a steady way, to reduce the cost, because that will be the main, most important goal.” He told Autocar: “We can do [solid state] now, but the cost in the packaging makes no sense to do. There is still a long way to go with lithium iron.” Purchasing and supply board member Joachim Post added that BMW Group’s new “Gen6” NMC batteries – that can add 186 miles in as little as 10 minutes – offer more than enough for what the market currently wants. “Would a customer be willing to pay a much higher price for solid-state for, maybe, a little bit faster charging?”, he asked. “Cost is one of the most important points [for EV buyers].” That cost comes from the production of the packs, especially the cells, said Post. “The problem [with solid-state] is to make millions of battery cells for a low price with a high efficiency, best quality, and easy to integrate in the package,” he said. “But what we so far see there is not a fast breakthrough coming, and that's why we are quite confident that our Gen6 [battery] is lasting for a long time.” Asked if this meant BMW would fall behind, given Mercedes-Benz has just announced it has begun testing of its own solid-state battery – which can offer a range of beyond 600 miles – Schuster said: “They are in a price range which is not competitive. That's fact today, and when we will see it in a competition against lithium iron, then [we will take note].\"",

    "description": "Switch to new BMW Group platform means future Mini models could be driven from the rear Next-generation electric Minis could switch from the firm's customary front-wheel-drove set-up to rear-drive, due to the adoption of a new BMW Group platform. The new “Gen6” 800-volt architecture developed by that Mini's parent firm is claimed to be a “huge leap forward” in terms of technology compared to what is offered in current generation EVs. This includes an increase in range and charging speeds, while the cost of making cars is reduced. Starting in September with the next-generation BMW iX3 – which morphs from the Vision Neue Klasse SUV concept – it will be rolled out across all BMW, Rolls-Royce and Mini EVs from their respective next generation models. But that adoption could mark a significant change for Mini, which in the spirit of the 1960s original has always focused on a front-wheel-drive set-up. The configurability of the new platform means single-motor cars can only be had with a powertrain on the rear axle. This is because the main Electric Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) is the only one offered by the Group with an integrated gearbox, and this exclusively sits between the rear wheels. BMW Group engineers told Autocar at the launch of the platform that there are currently no plans to develop an EESM to be used on the front axle, and only the new small asynchronous motor (ASM) – which doesn’t house a gearbox – will be fitted there. BMW models have long been developed with a rear-drive focus. One of the reasons for this decision is because a rear-wheel-drive setup is “better for dynamics”. As such, the platform can only support rear- or all-wheel-drive setups in either single-, dual-, tri-, or quad-motor configurations. When asked if this meant the end of front-wheel drive electric Minis in the future, purchasing and supply board member Joachim Post would not directly confirm. Instead, he said: “We will see what the future is.” Post added that the brand's future models will “always have Mininess” but questioned “what is the best, the optimum for the package?”, adding: “We want to make one thing feasible: sheer driving pleasure.” Any changes are still a long way from arriving given Mini’s entire lineup – which includes the new Cooper, Aceman and Countryman – was completely refreshed over the last 18 months.",

    "description": "The Kia PV5 has been unveiled ahead of its debut, which was scheduled for February 27 at the carmaker’s 2025 EV Day event. Not only is the PV5 Kia’s first van but also the introductory model for its Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), a modular skateboard designed to spawn all-electric multi-purpose utility vehicles targeted towards private and commercial sectors. Kia will offer the PV5 van in Passenger and Cargo body styles The Passenger version has rear seats, but the Cargo one doesn’t Separate screens for the instrument cluster and the infotainment system Kia PV5 exterior design The PV5 will come in two body styles: Passenger and Cargo. While both will have the same core design, the latter eschews rear seats in favour of luggage space. Being the more consumer-facing option, the PV5 Passenger sports a clean, futuristic styling. Up front, it gets high-mounted angular LED strips, which double up as indicators, and the main headlight units are situated lower. The PV5’s charging port is in the centre of the fascia, with a front-facing camera above it and a large radar sensor underneath. Both PV5 body styles have different tailgates Over to the side, plastic body cladding can be seen all around the PV5 Passenger’s lower half, and the upper half shows off chunky side mirrors and a large glass area. The pillars, bonnet and upper half of the fenders are blacked out. At the rear, the PV5 Passenger has a single lift-up boot lid; the Cargo body style gets dual, side-opening tailgate doors. Kia PV5 interior   PV5 dashboard to get two screens Kia has only revealed the PV5’s exterior, with full interior images likely reserved for the upcoming EV Day. However, the exterior images show glimpses of the cabin, most notably separate screens for the instrument cluster and the infotainment system and thick grab handles on the A-pillars. The Kia PV5 will primarily compete against the Volkswagen ID Buzz in international markets. Currently, it’s unclear whether Kia plans to bring the PV5 to India, but the company’s 2025 EV Day may shed more light on this.

He’s the lead mechanical engineer at the Vietnamese startup Nuen Moto, and has been instrumental in bringing their electric motorcycle concept to market. When he’s not doing that, he runs his own custom shop—building outrageous machines like this girder-forked Buell XB9S. Nicknamed ‘Lisa 22’ after Moc’s daughter, the Buell was built to explore various design and engineering principles. Moc kept the XB9S engine and fuel-bearing frame, but everything else was replaced, upgraded, or built from scratch. Most of the work was done by Moc and his two-man team, but specialist jobs like paint, wiring, and tuning were outsourced to local workshops—including Bike EXIF regulars MFix. One of Moc’s strongest skills is CNC machining, so it’s only natural that his custom Buell XB9S would showcase this.…",

    "title": "Ferrari at a Crossroads: Cavallino Classic '25",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Breakers really shouldn’t exist. Not in its current artful form anyway. Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.

    "description": "﻿ The Datsun 240Z was never the problem. It was the solution. The answer to a world where European sports cars carried steep price tags and Japanese cars were still thought of as nothing more than basic transportation. For years, Japanese cars in America were what students drove to class, what families bought when they were new, when money was tight, or what commuters relied on when fuel prices spiked. They were appliances, used for economy, and durability. It’s easy to look back on them now as more than products of their time. But they weren’t. They filled parking lots at office buildings and grocery stores, racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on city roads, and lived out their lives as forgettable hand-me-downs, passed from one generation to the next until they rusted into the ground. They were not the cars enthusiasts dreamed about, not the machines people pinned on their walls or took out on Sunday after church for a little exercise. Today we love the quirky, endearing nature of the classic Japanese econobox, but back then? It was a tool.  The Z was one of the cars that changed everything. It was Japan’s bold declaration, a machine shaped by the same relentless craftsmanship and discipline that defined the country’s post-war industrial rise. It embodied the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, continuous improvement.  The Z was beautiful, with the long nose of a Ferrari, and an inline-six that, despite its modest origins (and with some SU carburetors installed), could sing when you need it to. In 1970, it was fast enough, with a chassis that felt nimble, eager, and alive in a way most Americans had never experienced in something that did not wear a European badge. It was still affordable, but it was no longer just transportation. It was undeniably a sports car. But time does not stand still. Roads get wider. And for better or worse, cars get faster, stop better, turn sharper, and expectations shift. The Z’s magic is still there, but modern traffic, modern brakes, and modern speed put it in a different context. It still thrives on momentum and chassis respect. But, time marches on. The engineers at Nissan did not create the perfect Z, they created the best one they could for the money, theirs, and yours. So, as is often the case as we make engine noises in our garage over winter, pontificating on what we can modify, and how things could be better. The question is not whether the Z is still great as it was, it is how much better could it be? For Rahail Tariq, the Z had been lurking in his subconscious, a shape that had stuck with him from flipping through magazine pages. When he finally got his first 240Z, his first classic car, it was white, with black sills and a set of 260Z wheels that he did not even know were incorrect at the time. He bought it online in 2005, not as an expert but as someone drawn to its presence, and it’s silhouette. That car, with all its patina and imperfections, was the seed that eventually grew into MZR Roadsports.   Rahail’s connection to cars ran deeper than just his own discoveries. His father, a technician in the 1970s, was always bringing home interesting machinery, M5s, Mini Coopers, Daimlers, even an E-Type Jaguar. Growing up around those cars, seeing the way his father worked on them, improved them, and understood them, gave him an appreciation for cars as something alive, something that could always be made better. The Z was just the first car where Rahail realized that he was the one who would have to push it forward. In the UK, where classic Japanese sports cars did not have the same deep-rooted restoration culture as Porsches or E-Types, Rahail found himself frustrated. Nobody was building the Z the way he envisioned it. No one was taking it to its logical next step, not just restoring but refining, improving. That search led him to Martin Ryland, a Datsun expert who eventually became his collaborator and helped shape the vision of MZR. Restomods are sometimes frowned upon, seen as tampering with an icon, but consider this. Given the opportunity, is it possible Nissan would have never left the Z as it was? If the company had continued refining it with an unlimited budget, what would it have looked like? A lighter chassis, a more rigid structure, and an engine with sharper response and a little more urgency. That is exactly what MZR is doing, finishing what the original engineers, given enough time, could have done, maybe even would have done, but did not. Their Evolution models, built with bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork, are not just about chasing numbers. Yes, the RB 3.4L DOHC straight-six delivers over 300 horsepower, and yes, the six-speed manual brings precision to every shift, but the real magic is in how it all comes together. It is a 240Z honed and distilled, shaped by the same kaizen philosophy that defined its creation, an ongoing pursuit of refinement, balance, and purpose. The 240Z never needed saving, it was never the problem after all. But it deserved to be honored, not just looked at through the lens of nostalgia. It was built to be driven, and MZR has made sure that it still begs to be. Continue...",
