    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

You may know Mark Hawwa as the founder of the Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride (and Drive), the man behind the Throttle Roll custom bike show, or the owner of Sydney’s newest donut joint, Donut Garage. We know him as a total motorcycle nut with a penchant for café racers. But what we didn’t know, is that he’s always wanted to own a Harley V-Rod. Given the V-Rod’s inherent style, most custom examples are wide-tired, chrome-slathered brutes. That’s never appealed to Mark’s sensibilities, so he’s long imagined a V-Rod with a sportier bend.

It is an electric car, yet small dimensions don’t mean a small range, as it will go up to 229 miles between charges.An interesting and quite different proposition to the norm, then, in being a small car on the outside but does an impression of a larger one in its equipment levels and pricing. Few cars have a track record of success in being small yet with a premium price, the Honda E coming to recent memory to that end.

    "description": "Porsche Macan front action Can the highly popular SUV retain traditional Porsche qualities as it enters the age of EVs? The new Porsche Macan Electric has an umabiguous task ahead of it: to become a worth successor of the celebrated Porsche Macan, only powered by electricity.If only this was as simple as it sounds. For many, the existing, combustion version of Porsche's junior SUV represents a class-dominating spider chart of performance, space, long-distance road manners, and just enough fun to ensure you don't regret passing up that Cayman build slot.And excellent as many electric cars now are, there can still exist some compromises in terms of range or weight and, perhaps most conspicuously here, for dynamic handling appeal compared with their combustion-engined peers.Which means the electric Macan's biggest challenge may not be in defeating the imminent Polestar 4 or the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, but simply matching for broad appeal the combustion-powered Macan which, despite having been discontinued in mainland Europe already, will soldier on in UK showroom until a likely retirement in 2025.So how have they gone about evolving this model for the electric world? We've had a few occasions to find out so far, having now tested all four versions of the car (the base Macan, Macan 4, Macan 4S and Macan Turbo) briefly on European roads and a Macan 4 in more depth in the UK.

    "description": "As I drive home, I’m on the expressway, cruising at speed. My eye catches a single leaf that is attracted to my car like it’s stuck in a vacuum. Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu. The annual 28 Liberty Car Show Continue...",

On October 2nd, 1984, the Testarossa was unveiled at the Lido nightclub at the Champs Élysées in Paris. To celebrate 40 years of the next best 80s Ferrari icon - the Countach still has my heart. The first and third Testarossas ever produced were brought back to that same location for the first time in two decades. Both cars were reportedly in immaculate condition as they were raised on a pedestal in the middle of the stage. Reminiscent of the way the Testarossa was first unveiled to the public all those years ago. Continue...",

    "description": "2025 will see a lot of manufacturers update their bikes because of the looming Euro 5+ emissions standards and BMW has now hopped onto that bandwagon. The Bavarian company has updated the S 1000 R, M 1000 R, S 1000 RR and M 1000 RR models in one fell swoop, with the naked R models now getting new styling, while the fully-faired RRs get redesigned aero.  M 1000 RR now gets 218hp, up by 6hp S 1000 R, M 1000 R get new twin-pod LED headlight S 1000 R's engine now makes 170hp; 5hp more BMW S 1000 R, M 1000 R: what’s new for 2025? The most distinctive change for 2025 on the sporty BMW nakeds is the new face. Both the S 1000 R and M 1000 R now use a twin-pod LED headlight, which gives the BMW supernakeds a very mean front-end look. The changes under the skin are relatively small for the bikes, with the S 1000 R now benefiting from 5 additional horsepower, raising its peak output to 170hp. In a bid to spice up its acceleration, BMW has given the S 1000 R a quick throttle and shorter final gearing. Additionally, the bike also gets Engine Drag Torque Control, which helps minimise rear wheel lock-ups under hard downshifts, along with a USB-C charger under the seat. The updated M 1000 R remains mechanically identical to the older bike, but gets the same quick throttle as the S, and its winglets are now painted black.  Also see: BMW S 1000 XR launched at Rs 22.50 lakh BMW S 1000 RR, M 1000 RR: what’s new for 2025? BMW has been able to squeeze out 6 additional horsepower from the M 1000 RR’s motor, taking the peak output to a staggering 218hp. The bike’s electronic aids are also more lenient now with a dedicated ABS mode for slick tyres. The M 1000 RR’s winglets grow even bigger for 2025 and the fairing has seen slight tweaks. In a similar vein, the S 1000 RR sportbike also gets the redesigned fairing and winglets but remains mechanically unchaged. The other visual difference is the addition of wheel covers to the front wheel of the S, which incorporate cooling ducts that direct cool air to the brake calipers.  Also see: EXCLUSIVE! We rode the official MotoGP Safety bike at the Bharat GP We expect all four models to be brought to India next year with a slight hike over their existing prices. For reference, the BMW S 1000 R costs between Rs 19 lakh-23.30 lakh, while the M 1000 R price ranges between Rs 33 lakh-38 lakh. Meanwhile, the BMW S 1000 RR is priced between Rs 20.75 lakh-25.25 lakh, while the range-topping M 1000 RR costs between Rs 49 lakh-55 lakh.  All prices, ex-showroom, India Also see: 2023 BMW S 1000 RR review: Gives you wings!",

    "description": "A year since the global debut of the second-generation Kodiaq SUV, Skoda has unveiled a hot new RS version. In line with the RS badge, the sportier Kodiaq gets an uprated version of the 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine and sharper styling over the regular model.  Kodiaq RS produces 265hp from a 2.0-litre petrol engine Gets adaptive suspension as standard fitment Has a top-speed of 231kph  Skoda Kodiaq RS: powertrain, chassis upgrades The Kodiaq RS uses the same ‘EA888’ turbocharged 2.0-litre four-pot engine that also does duty in the range-topping Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line. It’s mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, and the engine produces 265hp and 400Nm of torque in the Kodiaq RS, sending power to all four wheels. That’s 60hp and 80Nm more than in the regular Kodiaq. Skoda claims the seven-seat family SUV can dispatch the 0-100kph sprint in 6.3 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 231kph. The RS also receives extra stopping power by way of slotted brake discs and more potent two-pot calipers on its front axle. VW’s Dynamic Chassis Control Plus adaptive suspension system is fitted as standard, offering 15 drive settings and active damper adjustment. Skoda Kodiaq RS: exterior and interior updates The Kodiaq RS is distinguished from the regular SUV by more aggressive bumpers with larger grille segments, as well as 20-inch ‘Elias’ alloy wheels with red brake callipers. It also gets a blacked-out treatment for the radiator grille, exterior mirror caps, the upper part of the window frames, and the roof rails. A cool touch is an illuminated grille that’s offered as standard, on the RS. Inside, it gets the larger 13-inch infotainment touchscreen as standard in addition to more thickly bolstered seats. The interior of the vehicle can be had in two trims – RS Suedia (Suede micro fiber and leatherette seats) and RS Suite (leather seats), with the latter also getting a ventilation function. Overall, the interior sports an all-black theme with contrast red stitching. Although there’s no word about Skoda getting the Kodiaq RS to India, it will bring the regular second-generation SUV here sometime by mid-2025. The model is currently on sale in India in its first generation with a petrol engine and is priced at Rs 39.99 lakh, ex-showroom.  Also See: Maruti eVX production version reveal on November 4 Skoda Kodiaq Armoured revealed",
