    "description": "Smallest car in the new-era line-up is a landmark EV for efficiency. Does it make Mercedes-Benz a technology leader again? Four hundred and eighty-three miles. That makes this new Mercedes-Benz CLA the longest-range EV you can buy in the UK, surpassing the firm’s other streamlined saloon, the EQS. Even when you remove the ‘in the UK’ qualifier, you need to look to the Lucid Air Touring to go further on a single charge.But that range is only really a by-product of the thing that could make the CLA a landmark car, which is its efficiency.The EQS and the Lucid are very expensive, very large cars with massive batteries, whereas the CLA isn’t. It costs from £45,615, which is only as much as a long-range Tesla Model 3, and instead of taking the brute force and ignorance route towards achieving a longer range by just fitting an enormous battery pack, Mercedes has gone to town on maximising the number of miles the CLA squeezes from every unit of energy. The result is a WLTP rating of 5.0mpkWh. When some rivals are muddling around in the 3s, that seems game-changing and it means that its averagely large battery pack of 85kWh gives a properly impressive range.Doing more with less seems like rather an obvious idea, doesn’t it? Particularly with an EV, the implications are huge, because a smaller battery is cheaper and lighter, it charges faster and it uses fewer precious resources. But the reality of achieving it, of course, is more complicated.",

    "title": "Meet the Skoda SUV range",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advertising-promotions-promoted-by-skoda/meet-skoda-suv-range",
    "description": "Skoda has an SUV to suit every lifestyle In the market for an SUV? We take a look at what Skoda's impressively varied lineup has to offer Over the past 18 years or so, the motoring landscape has changed beyond all recognition, with the rise of the SUV. It makes sense, because SUVs offer a loftier viewpoint, a greater feeling of safety, and more practicality than traditional vehicles. But things that haven’t changed in that time are the needs of family buyers, because people still need space, ease of use, and all those little touches that make living with a car from day to day that little bit easier. And that’s where Skoda has hit the nail on the head with its SUV range. There really is a Skoda SUV for you, no matter what you and your family’s requirements might be. Discover the Skoda range Skoda Kamiq The word Kamiq comes from the Inuit language, and means “something that fits perfectly”, which accurately describes the car and its ability to seamlessly blend into your family life. The Kamiq may be the entry point to the Skoda range, but it definitely makes a big impression, especially when it comes to interior space, because as our sister title What Car? says: “You’ll have no trouble fitting in the front of a Skoda Kamiq. Even if you’re a six-footer sitting behind someone else of a similar height, you’ll have a gap of several inches in front of your knees. And the Kamiq’s boxy shape means there’s a frankly ridiculous amount of rear head room.” Meanwhile, luggage is catered for thanks to a large 400-litre boot. So if you have a young family that’s growing faster than you can keep up with, a Skoda Kamiq is an ideal choice. There are three engines available in the Kamiq, all of which run on petrol. The first is a 95PS 1.0-litre TSI, which is linked to a five-speed manual gearbox, and which can manage a remarkable official WLTP economy figure of 51.8mpg. Next up is a 116PS version of the same engine, which is mated to a six-speed gearbox. It has plenty of zing and can do 52.2mpg. Finally, the 1.5TSI generates 150PS, which gives the Kamiq a real spring in its step. And yet it has an official economy figure of 48.0mpg (or 48.8mpg when fitted with the optional seven-speed DSG transmission). The entry-level trim is SE Edition, but you wouldn’t know it, because it is so well equipped. For example, it comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and LED running lights, rear parking sensors and a rearview camera, dual-zone air-conditioning and keyless start/stop. Not enough? Well how about a 9.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 10.25in virtual cockpit, plus four USB-C charging sockets, and front assist and lane assist systems. Moving up to Design Edition adds a Dynamic interior trim and a three-spoke sports steering wheel, then SE L enhances things with tech including keyless entry and start/stop, light and rain sensors, parking sensors at both ends, and selectable Drive modes. Monte Carlo trim is truly special, and comes with matrix LED headlights, wireless smartphone charging, adaptive cruise control and a panoramic glass roof. So, something that fits perfectly? That’ll be the Skoda Kamiq. Test drive the Skoda Kamiq Skoda Elroq The all-electric Skoda Elroq is What Car?'s reigning Family Electric SUV of the Year, so you know it’s good. It was the first car in the range to feature Skoda’s new ‘Modern Solid’ design language, which includes four front light units and a closed-off front grille – it’s a purposeful look. There are three versions of the Elroq available, called 50, 60, and 85. The numbers refer to the size of the batteries each model is powered by, so the 50 has a 52kWh battery, the 60 has a 59kWh unit, and the 85 has a 77kWh battery. These translate into range figures of 232 miles, 260 miles and 350 miles respectively, so there is an Elroq that will perfectly suit your daily driving cycle, no matter how far you need to travel. For a car to earn the title ‘Family Electric SUV of the Year’, it has to easily accommodate a family, and that’s something the Elroq can do without blinking. As What Car? says: “The driver and front passenger get plenty of space, but it’s in the back that the Elroq really impresses: even a six-footer will have plenty of head and leg room to spare when sitting behind a similarly tall driver.” There’s room for a family-quantity of stuff in the boot too, thanks to the 470-litre load space. Skoda has not skimped on standard equipment, because it has LED lights at both ends, dual-zone climate control, rear parking sensors and a rearview camera (ideal if you’re reversing up to a trailer, for example), and cruise control. SE L trim is ideal if you feel the cold, because it comes complete with heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, plus sat-nav and front parking sensors. What Car?’s preferred trim, Edition, adds predictive adaptive cruise control, wireless smartphone charging and cooling, and keyless entry with walk-away locking. Top-spec SportLine models feature matrix LED headlights that allow you to drive on full beam without dazzling other traffic, 20-inch alloy wheels and animated indicators, plus a plethora of neatly sporty styling touches. Test drive the Skoda Elroq New Skoda Enyaq Electric cars are expensive, right? Wrong. What Car? says: “Buying an electric car used to require deep pockets or an acceptance of mediocrity, but that’s no longer the case – and the Skoda Enyaq is a shining example of why.” The testers go on: “The new Skoda Enyaq electric SUV is practical, well-equipped, good to drive and smart inside.” Can’t say fairer than that. And with an impressively spacious interior and a massive 585-litre boot, it makes a fantastic family SUV. There are three drivetrain options available. The rear-drive 204PS Enyaq 60 model has a 63kWh battery and a range of 268 miles. Next up is the 85 version, which pairs an 82kWh battery with a 286PS electric motor on the rear axle, and has an official battery range of 359 miles. The Coupé version of the Enyaq is slightly more aerodynamic, so can travel 365 miles on a charge. The Enyaq 85x model features the same battery and electric motor as the 85 model, but has the benefit of four-wheel drive courtesy of an electric motor on the front axle. This version has a battery range of 332 miles (the Coupé can do 334 miles). What Car? is a fan of the Enyaq’s equipment levels: “Even if you go for the entry-level Enyaq trim – SE L – you get loads of standard equipment. That includes 19in alloys, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, tri-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control, wireless phone-charging and touchscreen infotainment.” However, What Car? considers the next trim level up, called Edition, to be the sweet spot in the range, saying: “Stepping up to one of the Edition trims adds the larger battery, along with matrix LED headlights, an electric driver’s seat with massage and some styling upgrades. It’s the one we’d go for.” There is also a SportLine trim, which comes with sportier styling, 20in alloys, a head-up display, an upgraded Canton sound system, sportier steering, sports suspension and a variable boot floor. Test drive the Skoda Enyaq Skoda Karoq The Skoda Karoq is the perfect car for those who need a family SUV but who don’t yet want to go electric. It also contains all the attributes people love about Skoda vehicles, namely huge interior space, a vast 521-litre boot, top-notch build quality, great driving manners and down-to-earth running costs. The engine range comprises four options, starting with a 116PS 1.0-litre petrol unit, which emits just 135g/km of CO2 and manages an official economy figure of 47.9mpg. Next is a 150PS 1.5 TSI engine, which is What Car?’s preferred option because it can do 46.3mpg and hustles the Karoq from 0-62mph in just 9 seconds. With the 190PS 2.0 TSI petrol in situ, the Karoq can sprint from 0-62mph in just 7.0sec, helped by its standard four-wheel-drive system and seven-speed DSG transmission. But Skoda has not forgotten customers who prefer diesel power, so there’s a 2.0-litre TDI model that produces 150PS, 360Nm of torque and which can manage a combined economy figure of 49.6mpg. And as What Car?’s testers note: “It gives you plenty of oomph at low revs and up to motorway speeds. Indeed, its official 0-62mph of 8.7 seconds makes it the second fastest Karoq in the range.” Family cars have to be tough, but the Karoq’s build quality is more than up to the task, according to What Car?, which says: “Everything feels solidly screwed together, suggesting that the Karoq will easily shrug off the rigours of family life.” SE Edition models come with luxury equipment including keyless entry, power-operated child locks, automatic lights and wipers, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, front and rear parking sensors, and an 8.0-inch Amundsen satellite-navigation unit, which also incorporates Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. SE L Edition models add an upgraded 9.2in Columbus navigation system, headlight washers, keyless entry and engine start/stop, adaptive cruise control and an electrically operated tailgate with virtual pedal. The purposeful-looking SportLine trim features touches such as gloss black exterior styling additions, a three-spoke sports steering wheel and matrix LED headlights. Test drive the Skoda Karoq Skoda Kodiaq If you’re going to name a car after a bear, you need to be pretty confident that it has the ability to see off allcomers. But that’s precisely what Skoda has done with the new Kodiaq, an SUV that’s designed to give growing families far more than just the bare necessities, and instead provide absolutely everything they need from their car. For a start, it’s a bargain; as What Car? says: “With Skoda’s aggressive pricing strategy, the Kodiaq’s starting price is a lot less grizzly than those of rivals.” So, prices are small, but interior space is exactly the opposite, because the Kodiaq is vast inside. Up front, What Car? notes: “There’s head and leg room going spare even if you’re well above 6ft tall.” And those behind have no reason to feel hard done by: “You can easily fit six-footers with leg room to spare in the outer two rear seats, even if the front seats are slid far back. There’s the width to fit a third passenger in the middle seat without things getting too friendly, and head room in the second row is so generous you can order the panoramic roof and still not worry about heads touching the roof lining.” But that’s not all. The Kodiaq is available as a five-seater with a cavernous 910-litre boot area, or as a seven-seater with a load area that’s barely any smaller. As What Car? says: “The difference really is minimal.” And even with all seven seats in use, there’s more luggage space than you’ll find in the boot of a small hatchback. There’s a powertrain to suit everyone in the Kodiaq. Petrol fans can choose from either a 150PS 1.5-litre TSI petrol engine, a 204PS 2.0 TSI, or a 265PS 2.0 TSI in the hot vRS version. Diesel fans haven’t been forgotten either, with the choice of a 150PS 2.0 TDI or a 193PS 2.0 TDI that’s linked to Skoda’s four-wheel-drive system as standard. Company car users can opt for the perfect Kodiaq, too, in the shape of the 1.5 TSI iV plug-in hybrid model, which has CO2 emissions as low as 9g/km, which equates to minimal Benefit-in-Kind taxation. What Car?’s testers are big fans of the entry-level Kodiaq SE, saying: “Its equipment inventory includes 18in alloy wheels, ambient interior lighting, keyless start, three-zone climate control, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, auto lights and wipers, power-folding door mirrors and heated front seats.” Generous is the word that springs to mind. SE L adds an electrically operated tailgate, matrix LED headlights, an electrically adjustable driver’s seat with memory, and keyless entry and start, among many other things. SportLine trim adds numerous sporty styling touches, plus Dynamic steering, adaptive cruise control, bespoke interior trim and materials, plus semi-automatic vehicle control in an emergency.

    "description": "Copenhagen is consistently ranked among the world’s most liveable cities, thanks to its pristine environment, unpolluted air, and passion for sustainable urban living. It’s fitting, then, that Mercedes-Benz chose the clean Danish capital as the venue for the media drive of its latest electric car—the all-new CLA Electric. More than just another EV, it’s a showcase of the brand’s cutting-edge technology, wrapped in compact luxury. And for Indian buyers seeking to go green without giving up prestige or performance, the CLA arrives at the end of this year as a truly compelling proposition. Mercedes-Benz CLA: exterior design and engineering Mercedes-Benz CLA dimensionsLength4,723mmWidth (w/o mirrors)1,855mmHeight 1,468mmWheelbase 2,790mmBoot volume 405-litres Frunk Volume 101-litres Kerb weight 2,055-2,135kg At its core lies the new Modular Architecture (MMA) – an EV-first platform ingeniously engineered to accommodate combustion engines and hybrid powertrains as well. It’s a quiet admission from Mercedes, once bullish about going all-electric by 2030, that customer sentiment has taken a different route. The road to electrification is a long one, especially in markets like India, where EV penetration is still under 5 percent. The CLA is underpinned by Mercedes' EV-first MMA architecture. The genius of the CLA Electric’s powertrain lies in its relentless pursuit of efficiency. Unlike most single-speed EVs, the in-house-developed, rear-mounted motor is paired with a two-speed gearbox. While this may seem counterintuitive for an EV, its goal is clear: to maximise efficiency across a broad speed range. Whereas Porsche’s Taycan uses a two-speed for brutal acceleration, the CLA uses it to squeeze out every last kilometre. By optimising the motor's operating point, the extra ratio delivers a more sustained power band and improved efficiency—key to achieving its standout range. This allows Mercedes to fit a smaller, lighter battery, which in turn means faster charging, lower costs, and fewer precious materials used. Sleek sedan design gives it a drag coefficient of just 0.21 Completing the efficiency puzzle are the car’s exceptional aerodynamics. Electric Mercs have always been slick, but the CLA pushes the envelope with a drag coefficient of just 0.21. That’s thanks to features like flush door handles, aero covers on the wheels and even the suspension arms. Every curve is sculpted to cut drag, helping the CLA deliver range figures rivalling larger and far more expensive EVs like the EQS or long-range BMW iX. The CLA has always been a design-first sedan, and the new electric version retains its distinctive four-door coupe silhouette. A 61mm stretch in the wheelbase improves interior space, while the low-slung, wide and athletic stance remains intact. Sealed-off grille is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars. The shark-nose front panel—replacing the ICE CLA’s grille—is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars and animated with playful welcome and goodbye sequences. Star-shaped DRLs and connected taillights complete a distinctive, high-tech look. One concern for India: the Euro-spec ground clearance is just 107mm. Great for autobahns, not for our speed breakers. A higher-riding Indian version is expected—and necessary. Mercedes-Benz CLA: interior space and comfort The longer wheelbase helps, but the CLA Electric’s rear seat still isn’t ideal for the chauffeur-driven. The backrest angle is a bit too upright, under-thigh support is limited, and the low roofline compromises headroom for taller passengers. The knees-up posture, due to the battery underfloor, also affects comfort. Mercedes engineers say the ICE versions will offer better posture with a lower floor. Rear seat comfort is compromised due to knees-up seating position and upright backrest. You do get a flip-down armrest with cupholders and a slot for your phone (though no wireless charging). A key talking point is the fixed panoramic glass roof. It opens up the cabin and looks stunning, but in India’s harsh summers, the lack of a physical shade raises concerns. Mercedes claims the glass is heat-insulated with a special coating, but only a real-world Indian summer will validate that. Boot space is slightly down on the previous CLA, but the 405 litres on offer is still usable, with a flat floor and good shape—enough for a long weekend’s luggage. For India, though, the lack of a spare wheel is a red flag. A puncture repair kit is standard, but many buyers will opt for a space-saver spare, which will eat into the boot’s capacity. Unlike the EQS EVs, the bonnet opens to a handy 101-litre of frunk space. On the plus side, the CLA gets a 101-litre frunk—unlike the sealed bonnets on larger EQS models. It’s perfect for storing charging cables, a small bag, or essentials—freeing up the main boot for bulkier items or that spare tyre. Mercedes-Benz CLA: features and safety   Step inside and the CLA Electric feels like a digital sanctuary, debuting Mercedes’ fourth-generation MBUX infotainment system, built on the new MB.OS software. The CLA 250+ we drove features a 10.25-inch driver displayand a large 14-inch central touchscreen. A 14-inch passenger screen is offered on the higher 350+ AWD variant (not coming to India), but we hope Mercedes India specifies the 250+ with the third screen as tech-laden cabins resonate strongly with Indian buyers. New CLA's interior feels like a digital sanctuary. The graphics are razor-sharp, the interface clean and intuitive, and the overall experience a clear generation leap. Ambient lighting offers 64 colours and 10 brightness levels, while the optional Burmester 3D audio system with Dolby Atmos transforms every drive into a sensory event. AI takes centre stage too: the “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant now draws on ChatGPT and Google Gemini, making it surprisingly conversational and capable of handling nuanced queries. The new MBUX system also significantly enhances navigation. By using Google as its base and layering Mercedes’ own interface, the result is one of the best nav systems we’ve seen—blending the accuracy and functionality of Google Maps with the elegance of MBUX, along with live traffic and smart routing. The 10.1-inch digital cluster also gets a refreshed layout, although with fewer customisation options, in line with customer preferences for classic dials and simplified navigation views. New MBUX system significantly enhances navigation which uses Google as its base. Practicality hasn’t been forgotten. A floating centre console frees up useful storage space, with cupholders and USB-C ports. The previously fiddly steering controls are now tactile and precise, while the electric seat adjust controls respond once again with a satisfying click—small details that matter. Mercedes-Benz CLA: performance and refinement Mercedes-Benz CLA powertrain and specsBattery capacity 85kWh Battery TypeLithium-ionDrive layout RWD/AWDPower 272hp/354hp Torque 335Nm/515NmTransmission 2-speed 0-100kph (claimed)6.7sec/4.9secTop-speed (claimed)210kph Our drive through the scenic Danish countryside highlighted the CLA Electric’s dynamic strength. We tested the CLA 250+, the rear-wheel-drive version headed to India, with 272hp on tap. The first impression is one of extraordinary refinement. Being electric, there’s no engine noise, but even road and wind noise are impressively muted. Only on coarse surfaces does tyre noise filter in—a testament to the excellent insulation. Refinement is astonishing; even road and wind noise are impressively muted.   Performance, while not overtly aggressive, is delivered with quintessential Mercedes smoothness and progression. The CLA builds power strongly and linearly, ensuring you never feel a shortage of punch. In Sport mode, the acceleration is more assertive, and the synthesized sound, piped through the speakers to mimic an engine note, actually sounds surprisingly good and adds to the driving engagement, without being intrusive. Overtaking on the single-lane Danish roads felt effortless, and the CLA can dart through city traffic with ease, making it equally adept at urban commutes and spirited drives. The 0-100kph sprint in 6.7 seconds and a top speed limited to 210kph are perfectly adequate for real-world driving conditions. Performance is smooth and progressive; overtakes come effortlessly. A new brake-by-wire system has largely banished the artificial and inconsistent pedal feel of previous electrified Mercs. The CLA’s brakes now inspire confidence and feel perfectly normal, offering a consistent and reassuring response. The regen controls, previously on steering paddles, have moved to the gear selector stalk. The push-pull action toggles between freewheeling, medium, one-pedal, and adaptive modes. It works fine, but the paddle-based setup was more engaging—mimicking gear shifts and adding involvement as you clicked through the regen levels like gears. Mercedes-Benz CLA: range and efficiency Mercedes-Benz CLA range and chargingVariant 250+ RWD/350 4Matic Range (WLTP-certified)Up to 792km/Up to 771km10-100% charging (11kW AC)9 hours DC Charging capacity Up to 320kW 10-80% DC fast charging 22 minutes The star of the MMA platform is its 800V electrical system, now the gold standard in premium EVs. Beyond numbers, it unlocks real-world advantages: ultra-fast charging that can inject 325km of range into its dense 85kWh NMC battery in just 10 minutes. That said, achieving such speeds requires a 320kW charger, which remains rare in India. Most customers will rely on AC home charging and, on highways, will have to depend on a charging network that largely comprises of slower 30–60kWchargers. The CLA has a WLTP-certified range of up to 792km. Still, it’s not charging speed but range that truly matters in the Indian context. On the WLTP cycle, the electric CLA delivers an astonishing range of up to 792km. Even more impressive was the real-world efficiency of 7.52km/kWh we achieved on our test drive—including several foot-to-the-floor bursts—translating to 734km of actual range and virtually eliminating range anxiety. Mercedes-Benz CLA: ride comfort and handling Out on winding roads, the CLA feels a joy to drive. The rear-wheel-drive setup keeps the steering uncorrupted, and modern Mercs have nailed steering feel. The CLA’s is precise, fluid, and perfectly weighted, with well-contained body roll lending it composed agility through quick corners. Out on smooth Danish roads, both ride comfort and handling were impressive.  Ride comfort is vastly improved over the older CLA, which was hard-edged and brittle. While still on the firm side, the new car has a rounded, mature damping that smooths out bumps well. The Danish roads may be misleadingly smooth, but this improved ride bodes well for Indian conditions too. Mercedes-Benz CLA: expected price and verdict Initially, the CLA Electric will be imported from Mercedes’ Rastatt plant in Germany, where costs are kept in check thanks to the platform’s dual-powertrain flexibility. CLA Electric stands out with its cutting-edge tech and remarkable efficiency. Mercedes-Benz plans to launch the CLA 250+ in India later this year, likely priced around ₹60 lakh. For those who prefer to be chauffeur-driven, the back seat might be a weak spot. But for the self-driven, the CLA Electric is a standout, stunning design with profound refinement, remarkable efficiency, and cutting-edge tech. This isn’t just another EV. It’s a symbol of where electric luxury is headed. And for Indian buyers, it’s an invitation to be part of that future.

    "description": "TVS has launched the updated Apache RTR 310, with prices starting at Rs 2.40 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) and crossing the Rs 3 lakh mark for a fully loaded bike. With this update, TVS has added some new features to the Apache RTR 310 while retaining the mechanicals. Apache RTR 310 becomes the first made-in-India bike with keyless ignition Engine and gearing have seen some changes Fully loaded RTR 310 costs above Rs 3 lakh  TVS Apache RTR 310: what’s new for 2025? Clear clutch cover, keyless ignition, launch control, and more on the RTR 310 The Apache RTR 310’s motor continues to make 35.6hp and 28.7Nm as before, but TVS has calibrated it to consider the level of throttle input given by the rider as well as the gear you’re in to tune its responsiveness, and the effort was to make it precise and linear without reducing its punch.  The rest of the key specifications of the bike remain unchanged. With this update, TVS has equipped the RTR 310 with the same rear sprocket as the RR 310 – earlier, the naked Apache 310 had a 4-tooth larger rear sprocket than the faired version. The RTR 310 now also gets Drag Torque Control, which prevents rear-wheel slip during engine braking and downshifting, working in tandem with the slip/assist clutch. Some other features that can also be optioned onto the RTR 310 with the BTO packs (more on this later) include launch control (which sets the engine speed at 7,250rpm) and keyless ignition. These features join an already well-specced suite of rider aids on the RTR 310, including cruise control, a bidirectional quickshifter, as well as switchable traction control and ABS.   In terms of visual differences, the list is much smaller. The Apache’s sharp silhouette remains unchanged – no bad thing, really – but it now gains an uber-cool transparent clutch cover, knuckle guards and sequential turn signals, all as standard equipment. A new colour, Fiery Red, joins the previously offered Arsenal black, Fury Yellow and Sepang Blue.   The base TVS Apache RTR 310 is priced at Rs 2.40 lakh and can only be had in black. Then, you step up to the Rs 2.57 lakh top variant, available in red and yellow, which brings in the bidirectional quickshifter. Do bear in mind that the base variant is very well-specced with traction control, cruise control, drag torque control and rear-wheel lift mitigation.  TVS Apache RTR 310 price and colours Beyond that, you have the option to spec the RTR 310 with a couple of BTO (Built To Order) kits. The Dynamic kit adds fully adjustable suspension at both ends, a brass-coated chain and a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), and is priced at Rs 18,000. The Dynamic Pro kit brings in a whole heap of electronics, such as keyless ignition, launch control, and makes all riding aids lean-sensitive. The Dynamic Pro kit is priced at Rs 28,000. This means that a fully specced Apache RTR 310 with both the Dynamic kits optioned will cost you Rs 3.03 lakh – more money than the seriously capable KTM 390 Duke (Rs 2.97 lakh). Currently, there is an introductory offer that gives you Rs 10,000 off the price of the base and top variants, although TVS hasn’t specified its end date.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-scrambler-400-xc-review-form-over-function-436163#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Bajaj-made Triumph Scrambler 400 X has been around for a couple of years, and while its sibling – the Speed 400 range – has seen some updates as well as the addition of the new T4 model, there hasn’t been much for the Scrambler, until now. Bajaj’s solution to spice things up for 2025 is the new Scrambler XC. In the big Scrambler 1200, the XC moniker meant more off-road capability, but that isn’t the case here. The XC is very similiar to the X in most fundamental ways. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC design and features - 8/10  Excel cross-spoke wheels look cool, replace the 400 X's alloys. Instead, the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC gets a number of additional components, but none of it change the way it performs. The biggest upgrade, from both a visual and functional standpoint, would be the new cross-spoked wheels. Unlike the Akront wheels on the Himalayan 450, these are Excel rims, which is no bad thing considering that Excel is widely considered as one of the best in the business.  The 400 XC's tubeless cross-spoke wheels come from Excel. There is a significant change in the weight (it's up by five kilos to 190kg), which is because there are a number of other additions made to the bike. All of these are available as accessories on the Scrambler 400 X, which includes a colour-matched flyscreen, headlamp grille, a colour-matched tall front fender, a radiator guard, sump guard and lower engine crash guard. The collective effect is handsome and more purposeful looking, at least to my eyes. Weight and dimensionsKerb weight190kgGround clearance195mmSeat height 835mmFuel tank capacity13 litresWheelbase1418mm The lower engine guard is standard fitment on the 400 XC. Aside from these changes and a couple of unique colour schemes, the Scrambler 400 XC is pretty much the same when it comes to the riding experience. Theoretically, the lighter wheels should make some improvement in the agility, but it’s not a huge change; you’d have to ride both the X and XC back to back to tell if it’s really noticeable. The same goes for the extra 5kg the XC is carrying.  The 400 XC is the heaviest of all the Bajaj-made Triumph 400s. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC engine and performance - 8/10 Engine is smooth in the city but a little buzzy on the highway. As before, this bike’s liquid-cooled 40hp/37.5Nm 300cc engine feels smooth and punchy at lower revs, and a little buzzy post the triple-digit mark. Performance is strong and it’ll go past the indicated 160kph mark, but high-speed cruising isn’t what this bike is about. Short gearing means it’s smooth and tractable in the city but a little buzzy at fast highway speeds. Throttle response is smooth and predictable and the Scrambler is pleasant to ride within the city. Riding the Scrambler 400 XC is a pleasant affair in the city. EngineEngine399cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower40hp at 8,000rpmTorque37.5Nm at 6,500rpmGearbox6-speed This city-friendly character is boosted by its 835mm seat height, which isn’t great for short riders but provides a very nice view of the road ahead. It also gives the slim Scrambler more of a comprehensive feeling compared to the compact Speed 400, which is otherwise the same size body-wise. The higher seat and more forward-set footpeg holders also result in a more relaxed knee position than on the Speed 400, and comfort is definitely a strong point here. The Scrambler continues to cut a handsome silhouette. Triumph is giving you all of this for Rs 26,000 more than the standard Scrambler, which is great value when you consider that buying just the wheels alone will set you back by Rs 70,000 at a Triumph service centre. As for existing Scrambler owners, yes, you can equip your bike with these if you don’t mind the huge price, but unfortunately, Bajaj says that doing so will void the warranty. The cross-spoke wheels can be equipped on the 400 X for a hefty sum of Rs 70,000. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC price and verdict - 8/10 Scrambler 400 XC is good VFM, but some areas could still be improved. While the value here is without doubt, there are some other areas that could have improved. For starters, the suspension is decently good for normal riding, but feels a little harsh when you ask too much of it either off road or at high corner speeds. However, what we really missed are better tyres and brakes. The MRF tyres used here are average at best and this bike deserves better. The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life. PricePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 2.94 lakh The front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average. The reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the updated KTM 390 Adventure X is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability. Then again, the KTM can’t match the Triumph’s classy appeal and if you’ve been swayed by the Scrambler’s handsome looks and all-round competence, we’d say the XC is worth the extra money.

    "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.
