    "description": "The RV BlazeX is Revolt’s latest electric commuter, positioned as an alternative to 125cc motorcycles. Sitting between the RV 400 BRZ and RV 400 models, the RV BlazeX emphasizes practicality and daily usability. However, our test was confined to a go-kart track, limiting our overall riding experience. Revolt RV BlazeX design and features Sporting a minimalist aesthetic, the RV BlazeX adopts design elements from the RV1 and RV1+. Unlike the RV 400 and RV 400 BRZ, this model follows a traditional commuter style, featuring a round LED headlamp, LED indicators, and a long single-piece seat. While fit and finish are adequate for the segment, the wiring around the handlebar and the charging socket cover could benefit from better quality materials. The charging cover, in particular, feels flimsy and might not withstand much force. The switchgear quality also seems budget-oriented, with buttons feeling soft and less tactile. A new kill switch is now present, but the absence of a traditional start button may require new riders to be extra cautious when getting on the bike because it is ready to go when you turn the key on. While the overall design mirrors Revolt's lower-tier models, the most noticeable addition is the 6-inch LCD display. This unit allows riders to switch between three modes (Eco, City, and Sport), offers Bluetooth connectivity, and supports app-based features like geo-fencing and over-the-air updates. Two buttons beside the screen enable toggling through trip meters, but they require a firm press, making operation less seamless. Our test unit came with an accessory windscreen, wheel stickering, and a crash guard. While the pricing for these extras was not disclosed, Revolt states that more accessories are available in addition to these three. Revolt RV BlazeX charging and practicality Reinforcing its commuter focus, the RV BlazeX offers a well-cushioned seat and an accessible 790mm seat height. Revolt has also upgraded the suspension to support a higher payload of 250kg. Additional storage is available under the tank, which also acts as a cover for the removable battery. Riders have the flexibility to remove and charge the battery at home. However, the 3.24kWh battery weighs 20kg, which could be cumbersome for those living in buildings without an elevator. The standard charger replenishes the battery from 0-80% in 3 hours and 30 minutes, while an optional fast charger reduces this time to 1 hour and 20 minutes. If purchased separately, the fast charger costs Rs 14,500, but buying it with the bike allows for a trade-in against the standard charger, reducing the price to Rs 4,500. Revolt RV BlazeX performance and handling The RV BlazeX is powered by a new electric motor, delivering a peak output of 4.1kW and 45Nm (at the motor) and 180Nm (at the wheel). Revolt claims a top speed of 85kph, matching its flagship model. While these figures may seem modest, the BlazeX provides a surprising level of punch, especially in Sport mode, making it engaging on the tight go-kart track. However, the throttle response is inconsistent, sometimes feeling imprecise or sluggish. This raises concerns about real-world traffic performance, where smooth throttle control is essential. The suspension setup includes a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers. Though the track had minimal bumps, the few encountered were absorbed well, ensuring a comfortable ride. The softer suspension setup makes it better suited for city roads rather than track use. Braking performance is strong, with 240mm disc brakes at both ends working effectively, assisted by the CBS (Combined Braking System) for added stability. Revolt RV BlazeX verdict The Revolt RV BlazeX blends  performance, range, and modern features at a competitive price. Its commuter-friendly design and smart connectivity features make it an attractive choice for those transitioning to electric mobility.  However, certain aspects, such as the finish quality and throttle calibration, leave room for refinement in an otherwise practical package.

    "description": "Traversing Mumbai’s congested streets is already harrowing enough, especially during rush hour. And in the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé, this experience is amplified manifold. Picture being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, with other vehicles precariously close to your oversized luxury SUV that costs more than some apartments.On several occasions, my heart raced as the SUV’s 360-degree camera system lit up, triggered by reckless bikers attempting to squeeze through non-existent gaps. I was on my way to meet my brother-in-law, but I had an ulterior motive. When he moved to Dubai in 2022, I suggested he purchase a GLE Coupé – not the AMG variant but the standard turbo-petrol version. It fit his budget and would have complemented Dubai’s opulent lifestyle. He didn’t heed my advice. Now, driving the 2025 AMG GLE through Mumbai’s Western suburbs, I was determined to prove a point. Feels huge when navigating through congested streets. The GLE’s substantial size, especially its 2.1-metre width, is particularly noticeable in city driving. Despite setting the GLE in Comfort mode (as it lacks an ‘Eco’ setting), the onboard computer never showed fuel efficiency exceeding 5kpl in traffic – unsurprising for an AMG-fettled 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine in a full-size SUV. The ride quality is also less than ideal. Even in Comfort mode, the suspension crashes through potholes, followed by a floaty, vertical movement that tosses passengers around. The front seats are comfortable, but their ventilation is ineffective, and at this price point, the absence of a massage function is disappointing. Moreover, the touch-sensitive steering controls are overly sensitive, often registering unintended inputs. Also, like in most Mercedes models, one must switch off the overly sensitive autonomous braking feature at the start of every journey. Besides sounding sweet, this 6-cyl unit is a strong performer. On the upside, the GLE’s touchscreen interface is one of the best in the business, and the sound quality from the Burmester audio system is equally impressive. Additionally, Mercedes’ integrated starter-generator delivers a seamless and non-intrusive auto stop/start function, making it easier to leave this feature enabled for fuel-saving while idling. After two hours and 20 kilometres, I finally arrived at my destination, relieved to have avoided any scratches on the vehicle. However, it’s worth noting a significant flaw – many modern Mercedes models, including this one, have a noticeable orange peel effect on their paint, giving the body panels an unfinished look that’s unacceptable at this price. When my brother-in-law saw the GLE, he was visibly impressed. The bold LEDs, imposing Panamericana grille and sleek, sloping roofline left him awestruck. The luxurious beige cabin, complemented by wood inlays, silver trims and dramatic ambient lighting, further elevated the experience. While I admired the impeccable fit and finish, I would have preferred a sportier interior with red seatbelts to enhance its AMG character. Also, though the rear seats are spacious, their cushioning is firm, and the upright backrest detracts from comfort. However, the AMG GLE’s highlight is its six-cylinder engine and exhaust note. With the exhaust flaps open, a few solid revs produced a thunderous roar and crackles that disrupted the serene neighbourhood. “I should have listened to you,” my brother-in-law admitted, promptly whipping out his phone to browse websites scouting for used examples in Dubai. Mission accomplished. Firm cushioning, upright backrest angle far from comfy. The following day, we drove the GLE to a popular eatery in Karjat. Traffic on the Western Express Highway was predictably slow, so I opted for the longer but less congested route via the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Coastal Road and AtalSetu before joining the old Mumbai-Pune highway. I’m really glad Mercedes didn’t downsize this six-cylinder turbo-petrol unit. The engine’s performance reserves make highway cruising effortless. It gets to three-digit speeds almost too quickly, and before you know it, you’re well past the speed limit. With the drive mode set to Sport, even the gearbox feels sharper and a touch quicker. The nine-speed automatic performed brilliantly, too, and I never found the need to use the paddle shifters to take manual control. Switching the suspension to Sport mode revealed a firmer yet more composed ride, with the car feeling flat and stable at higher speeds. The steering is sharp, and when driven with verve, the GLE feels surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable for its size. However, its bulk becomes evident during hard braking, with a noticeable nose-dive and a significant weight transfer. Ground clearance in its standard setting is plenty, but the GLE takes it a step ahead with a suspension-lift function to increase ride height further. Honestly, I don’t think this feature is needed for the typical on-road application the GLE AMG will be subjected to. Its bright interiors with wood and aluminium inserts feel luxurious. In conclusion, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé commands attention with its road presence, offers strong performance paired with an exhilarating exhaust note and is a pleasure to drive on open roads. However, its ride quality and rear-seat comfort could have been better, and certain features should have been added to justify its Rs 1.88 crore price tag.

This addition should prevent the cabin from becoming extremely hot after long spells of driving under the sun, something that we had reported in our Seal review. Now, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, too. The electric car has also been equipped with an improved air conditioning and purification system. The Seal’s mid-spec Premium variant gains Frequency Selective Dampers (FSD), a feature previously reserved for the top Performance trim. In the Performance variant, BYD has added its new DiSus-C damping system, which can soften the suspension on bumpy roads and stiffen it during cornering, acceleration and braking – all in real-time. New Seal booking details Starting March 11, buyers can book the 2025 Seal by depositing Rs 1.25 lakh, but the price announcement will happen in April. 2025 BYD Atto 3 new features The latest Atto 3 gets an all-black (previously three-tone) interior with ventilated front seats. BYD has also upgraded the electric SUV’s lead acid battery to a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) low-voltage battery. According to BYD, this new battery is six times lighter than conventional low-voltage batteries and has a lifespan of 15 years. New Atto 3 price, bookings BYD is offering the first 3,000 units of the MY2025 Atto 3 at the existing prices, which start at Rs 24.99 lakh for the 49.92kWh Dynamic variant.

    "description": "The 2026 BMW iX3 electric SUV has entered the final stages of testing ahead of its global debut later this year. BMW has released new images of the iX3 prototype undergoing hot weather testing in South Africa. The second-gen iX3, previewed by the Neue Klasse Vision X concept last year, will be the first in BMW's new family of EVs riding on the Gen6 EV platform. Its new EV-only architecture promises to bring significant improvements in range, functionality and cost. New iX3 will be officially revealed by the end of 2025 New Gen6 platform is claimed to improve range by 30 percent Will rival the likes of the Q6 e-tron and the upcoming GLC EV New BMW iX3 prototype: what do the images reveal? Concept design cues toned down The first impression when looking at these prototype images is that a lot of aggressive contouring and character lines have been toned in the production-spec SUV. The body panels are a lot smoother, the bumpers are less aggressive, and the flush door handles are now located on the doors rather than on the window line. Camera-based ORVMs have also made way for regular wing mirrors. BMW iX3 concept vs prototype What has been retained from the concept, however, are the front and rear lighting signatures and the two-part spoiler at the rear. Peeking through the camouflage, one can make out the slashed LED daytime running lamp signature for the headlamps, while the rear gets slim horizontal tail-lamps with an L-shaped signature, which, for a change, aren’t connected. The new iX3 is rumoured to be slightly longer and wider than the outgoing model, which was an EV conversion of the regular CLAR-based X3 SUV. New BMW iX3 platform and powertrain New Gen6 platform uses 800V electrical architecture Specific details about the new Gen6 platform are still under wraps, but BMW has confirmed that it will be equipped with 800V electrical hardware for rapid charging and will accommodate batteries that are 20 percent more energy-dense than the existing one. This is claimed to boost the overall range by as much as 30 percent. BMW has previously said that all Neue Klasse models will return “at least 600km (WLTP cycle) of range,” so it remains to be seen how much the next-gen iX3 actually offers.   The platform will also make use of the new generation of lighter and more efficient electric motors. The iX3 is expected to be offered with single- or dual-motor configurations. The Gen6 platform can accommodate up to four motors, which will likely be reserved for more performance-oriented variants. New BMW iX3 launch details The new iX3 will officially be revealed towards the end of this year, and it will go on sale in international markets in 2026. Following the iX3, there will also be the i3 sedan, which has been previewed by the Vision Neue Klasse concept. The combustion-engined BMW X3 will continue to be sold alongside the new iX3. The fourth generation of the X3 was launched in India earlier this year with petrol and diesel engines. The new iX3 can also be expected to be offered in India in due course.

Rather than quietly retreat to Renault’s heritage collection, the concept was developed into a production car that looks just as spectacular. And it’s not a mere small-series vanity project. The new 5 is here to be Renault’s mainstream hatchback, an entry point into its EV line-up. With a headline price of £22,995, it’s no more expensive than a mid-spec hybrid Renault Clio.The 5 has already won a number of awards – not least Car of the Year.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-ft-me-concept-previews-two-seat-citroen-ami-rival",
    "description": "New 2.5m-long EV is a signal of intent for the Japanese brand to move into the urban mobility space The new Toyota FT-Me Concept is a small, urban-focused, Citroën-Ami rivalling \"micro car” that showcases the future of mobility, claims Toyota. Dubbed a micro car rather than a quadricycle because of its claimed usability, the 2.5m-long EV is a signal of intent for the Japanese brand to move into the urban mobility space. “This is a big piece in the wider mobility jigsaw,” said Stijn Peeters, its head of new mobility projects. The concept will spawn a near-identical production model “very soon” – as well as an array of other vehicles. Pricing the FT-Me to be competitive with the £7695 Ami, Toyota is targeting those after a second runabout and teenagers wanting independence before they're legally allowed to drive a standard car. As it's designated an L6e quadricycle, most European countries allow drivers aged from 14, although the UK doesn't.  The FT-Me's key is controlled by its owners’ phones. Parents can set limits on when their children can access – and therefore use – the car. It has space for two inside, or the “light” passenger seat can be removed to create a storage space 1.6m in length.  The car is controlled by a square, almost yoke-like, wheel. In a nod to its “mobility for everyone” mantra, it can be completely driven using said wheel, meaning those with disabilities – especially concerning their legs – can control it. Its design was inspired by a helmet - to convey safety - and it's built from 90% recycled materials. A roof-mounted solar panel can add up to 19 miles of range per day. Toyota said the FT-Me is “affordable and easy to maintain” and claims the production car will have the best residual values in its class. Full technical details have yet to be released.",

    "description": "To say that Winston Yeh likes the color black would be a gross understatement. The man behind Taiwan’s Rough Crafts has a sense of style that would make Johnny Cash’s wardrobe blush, and seldom builds a custom motorcycle that isn’t swathed in various shades of black. We checked; a mere 10 percent of the Rough Crafts bikes featured on our pages buck this trend. So when Mr. Yeh does deviate from this formula, it’s usually for a good reason—like a special request from a client. “He wanted an old school chopper, he wanted it silver, and he wanted the ‘Rough Crafts’ style,” says Winston of the succinct brief he received for the project. The only other request was that Rough Crafts use a modern bike as a donor so that reliability wouldn’t be an issue.…",

    "title": "The ‘Loophole’ Dauer 962 That Wrote F.A.T International Into Porsche’s Le Mans Legend",
    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. [caption id=\"attachment_451612\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2880\"] Photo Courtesy of the Porsche Archive[/caption] Concurrently, the P1 prototype class persisted, with contenders like Toyota in the fray. However, the ACO's adjustments, dampening power and downforce, leveled the playing field, granting GT1 entrants a genuine shot at overall victory. Amidst this evolving landscape emerged an unexpected protagonist, backed by a brand yearning for its 13th Le Mans triumph.​ [caption id=\"attachment_451613\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2880\"] Photo Courtesy of the Porsche Archive[/caption] Jochen Dauer’s Unlikely Masterstroke Austrian entrepreneur and racer Jochen Dauer had acquired five Porsche 962C race cars in 1991 with the ambitious goal of converting them into road legal supercars. At the time, it seemed far fetched. But a few years later, Porsche saw an opportunity and stepped in to assist, modifying the car’s suspension to meet strict German road regulations. By 1993, Porsche discerned the potential in Dauer's endeavor and lent their expertise, tweaking the 962's suspension to align with stringent German road regulations. The metamorphosed Dauer 962 LM made its debut at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show. Shortly thereafter, a pact was forged to field the car in the GT1 class at Le Mans, with the seasoned Joest Racing team at the helm.​ Under the GT1 regulations, this iteration of the 962 enjoyed a power resurgence, a stark contrast to the constraints its prototype predecessors had endured. The compromise? Narrower tires. Yet, the ace up its sleeve was a substantially larger fuel tank compared to its P1 adversaries—a tactical advantage that would prove pivotal.​ As if to underscore Porsche’s full backing, the driver lineup was stacked with talent: two time Le Mans winner Hans Joachim Stuck, ex Formula One drivers Danny Sullivan and Thierry Boutsen, endurance racing aces Yannick Dalmas and Mauro Baldi, and American sportscar legend Hurley Haywood. [caption id=\"attachment_451614\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2880\"] Photo Courtesy of the Porsche Archive[/caption] The 1994 Le Mans Victory Competing under the banner of FATurbo Express, a transport brand of the logistics firm Français Allemande Transite, and erstwhile sponsor of Group C Porsche 962s, the #36 Dauer-Porsche, piloted by Dalmas, Baldi, and Haywood, seized a resounding victory.​ While rivals grappled to eke out 12 laps per fuel stint, the Dauer 962s extended their runs to 14 or 15 laps, securing a strategic upper hand. However, the triumph was not devoid of trials. The #36 car necessitated a driveshaft repair during the night and lagged behind the leading Toyota as the race neared its climax. Fate intervened when the Japanese prototype encountered a gear linkage malfunction on Sunday, catapulting the Dauer machine into the lead.​ The sister #35 car, with Sullivan, Boutsen, and Stuck at the wheel, clinched third place despite early setbacks, a puncture-induced spin and a tense episode where Boutsen navigated half a lap shrouded in darkness after shedding the front bodywork. The aspiration for a 1-2 finish slipped away in the waning moments, as future Ferrari F1 driver Eddie Irvine commandeered second place for Toyota amidst traffic, barely maintaining his position in a frenetic finale. A One and Done Success Story A total of thirteen Dauer 962 LM road cars were built, fewer than required under the revised 1995 ACO rulebook, which effectively closed the loophole that had enabled Porsche’s triumph. Some of these road cars were even fitted with DVD players, a futuristic touch for the era. Among the buyers? The Sultan of Brunei, who reportedly acquired six. On the racing side, only three Dauer 962 LMs were built, with a spare tub brought to Le Mans in 1994 that never saw competition. This meant that Porsche’s GT1 class victory was truly a one time deal. Dauer’s Rise and Fall Post-Le Mans, Jochen Dauer embarked on an even more ambitious venture, acquiring the remnants of the bankrupt Bugatti in 1995 and reengineering the EB110 with carbon fiber bodywork. However, the project stumbled, and Dauer's fortunes waned. In 2010, he faced imprisonment for tax evasion.​ Meanwhile, the F.A.T. International moniker faded into obscurity, until Ferdi Porsche resurrected it for contemporary endeavors, encompassing ice racing, karting, upscale dining establishments, and collaborations with Porsche Design. What started as a creative rule interpretation resulted in one of the most fascinating Le Mans victories in history, securing Dauer's place in motorsport folklore.   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",
