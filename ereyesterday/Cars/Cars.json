    "description": "Scout Traveler is due to hit the road in 2027 VW-backed US start-up Scout Motors unveils near-production concepts that preview 2027 models Scout Motors, the Volkswagen-backed revival of 4x4 brand International Harvester, has revealed the Traveler as an electric Land Rover Defender rival. It has been unveiled alongside the Terra, an electric pick-up that will rival the likes of the Rivian R1T, Tesla Cybertruck and Chevrolet Silverado EV. The duo has been unveiled in near-production concept form, with both due to enter production in 2027. They will both be based on a body-on-frame platform that is said to be completely unrelated to the Volkswagen Group's MEB and PPE architectures for electric cars, with 800V electricals. The batteries and electronics will be supplied by Canadian firm Magna.  Originally conceived as a pure-electric revival of the original Scout models made between 1960 and 1980, the pair will now be offered with optional petrol-powered range extenders. Michigan-based Scout says this is down to both a downturn in interest in electric cars, coupled with buyers “expressing concerns about the ability to recharge while on the road”. With the range extender equipped, the Terra and Traveler will be capable of driving more than 500 miles between fill-ups, up from the standard 350. Scout has yet to confirm a battery size, but it said its platform can support charging at up to 350kW.  The Traveler and Terra are offered with a dual-motor four wheel-drive powertrain, putting out a combined 1000lb ft. Scout said the Traveler can dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in 3.5sec, although it has yet to disclose a power figure. Visually, the pair retains their forebears' bluff-edged styling, with a long bonnet and a well-defined shoulder line. Short overhangs, reinforced bumpers, skidplates and body-on-frame construction are said to make the pair “multiuse tools” and “helpful companions”. Scout design chief Chris Benjamin said the brand's cars “should always enable the customer to do the things they want to do and make their experience easier, better, faster”.  Inside, the two cars are said to be  “reminiscent of the original Scout II”, but with modern amenites. The central infotainment touchscreen is placed above an array of physical toggles and switches that control functions such as the climate control, for instance. Both cars offer over-the-air updates and remote diagnostics. “Two years in the making, the day has finally come to share the next generation of Scout vehicles with the world,” said Scott Keogh, president and CEO, Scout Motors. “The original core idea — rugged, versatile vehicles capable of off-road adventure and family duty — is more relevant than ever. We couldn’t be prouder to revitalise this iconic American brand, create thousands of American jobs, and put American ingenuity back to work.” Prices for both are expected to start below $60,000 (£46,000) - though incentives in the US will leave them closer to $50,000 (£38,500), Scout claimed. Both the Traveler and Terra will be made at the firm’s factory in South Carolina, with the VW Group planning to gradually ramp up the factory’s output to 200,000 units per year.",

    "description": "Flagship 5 Series has turned PHEV and promises to be BMW's most extreme super-saloon yet Certain cars just define a genre. It’s the Golf for hatchbacks, the MX-5 for roadsters and probably the BMW M5 for super-saloons.But where a current-gen Mazda MX-5 is still a fundamentally similar car to a Mk1 from 1989, the M5 has always been a shape-shifter. At the launch for the new G90 M5, BMW put on a spread of historic M5s for us to drive. Aside from a dozen browser tabs of E34 M5 classified ads, the first thing I took away is that the new M5 is a very, very different car from a 1985 E28. Next to the compact, understated, manually shifted and deliciously slippy original, the latest fast Five might as well have come from a different galaxy.That’s not the salient point, however. More pertinent is that the M5 has always been a technical showcase, and back in 1985 that meant putting a race-derived straight six into an unassuming sports saloon; for the E60 M5 in 2005 it meant a 9000rpm V10, a single-clutch automated manual gearbox and a novel user interface concept; for the F10 M5 in 2012 it meant abandoning 28 years of naturally aspirated engines and embracing turbochargers; in 2018 it meant using four-wheel drive for entertainment rather than stability and understeer. For the F90 M5 in 2024 it means going all-in on plug-in hybrid powertrain technology.",

We pour our hearts, souls and wallets into our bikes, perfecting every detail of form and function, but when it comes time to pass it on to the next owner, too many of us are guilty of doing the bare minimum. When we choose to release a motorcycle from our clutches, it’s usually to fund the next bike, and that’s why all of this matters. As unique as your custom bike is, it’s worthwhile to put extra effort into the sale process—because it’s not just a motorcycle you’re selling—you’re selling your personality, your handiwork and your brand.…",

In that time, the South African designer became infamous for designing bikes that were polarizing at first but went on to become successful. The Ducati 999’s boxy bodywork and stacked headlights upset Ducati purists, but it was wildly successful on the race track. The Ducati Hypermotard was a massive departure from the Italian marque’s usual fare, but it was immensely popular among riders. And the Ducati Multistrada 1000 DS, although goofy as heck, went on to spawn one of Ducati’s most successful model ranges.

    "description": "The Pulsar 125, in its Classic guise, continues to be a massive seller for Bajaj, but the company needed something fresh and youthful to address the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R. After all, those two have carved out a new segment of about 50,000-60,000 sales per month. The N125 is Bajaj’s answer, and the interesting thing is that it has nothing to do with any other Pulsar before it. Bajaj Pulsar N125 design, colours, quality  Bajaj wanted to make a 125 that weighed 125 kilos (which is nearly 20kg less than the existing 125cc Pulsar models), and that necessitated an entirely new platform. The N125 also carries a new design language, and it’s great to see that this isn’t just another Pulsar wearing a familiar set of clothes. Plenty of floating panels all over and a rather un-Pulsar-like headlamp bring freshness to the design philosophy. But there’s also familiarity in elements like the shape of the tank extensions as well as the new take on the twin-slash brake lamps.  While so much aero-inspired bodywork on a tiny 125 is almost purely for aesthetics, the vents on the front mudguard shroud are actually functional. The story goes that the initial design did not have any vents, but the engine development team complained to the design department that their air-cooled engine wasn’t getting enough flow, which is why the vents were incorporated.  There are some unusual touches, like the body panel along the side of the subframe. We’re used to seeing this kind of bodywork at the tail section on most motorcycles, but it finds itself positioned between the rider and pillion seat on the N125. This has the effect of adding mass to the design but also keeps the tail quite slim. The fat fork shrouds do a good job of masking the skinny 30mm telescopic fork, but while they certainly give the bike more presence, some may find them to be excessively wide. Quality levels are decent, but some visible panel gaps on our bike do leave room for improvement. In all, the N125 has a striking design that will be a little polarising yet also easily identifiable, especially in the funky colour schemes Bajaj has gone with. It doesn’t have the same ‘big-bike’ look as the Hero Xtreme 125R, but it certainly stands out, and that’s a good thing. Bajaj Pulsar N125 ride and handling The seating position is more or less what you’d expect from a bike like this. At 795mm, the seat height isn’t the lowest in the class, but it’s still very manageable, and the seats are spacious and comfortable. The footpeg placement is a little sporty, which goes well with a bike like this. However, the narrow handlebar felt a bit too ‘commutery’, which slightly dilutes the special feeling a bike like this should have.  Happily, the new chassis makes up for this in its sheer lightness and behaviour. 125kg is nearly on par with the TVS Raider, and just like that bike, the N125 has a delightfully nimble, easy-going character without any nervousness. Bajaj let us experience this on a go-kart track, and the N125 was genuinely good fun, displaying an eagerness to change direction and lean over. The footpeg placement enabled plenty of cornering clearance without any scraping, and the bike never displayed any fidgety moments you might expect with a very light machine. The MRF tyres were nice and grippy in this situation as well, and the only thing I’d have liked was a bit more initial sharpness in the front brake. Bajaj Pulsar N125 engine refinement, mileage Nevertheless, the N125’s dynamics will translate into an enjoyable experience on densely packed city roads. Going nicely with this is a very light clutch effort, which they say is 50 percent less than the competition. With 12hp, the new engine is the most powerful in the segment alongside the NS125, but this bike has a much better power-to-weight ratio of nearly 100hp/tonne. More importantly, the engine is smooth and tractable, and it makes a nice sound as well. While the strong acceleration only arrives at quite high revs, the engine can also pull you along in third gear (out of 5) as low as 20kph, which is crucial in a city bike like this.  Refinement is excellent, but I noticed that the motor would stall if the revs got too low without any of the typical warning signs (like a juddering sound or feel) that come when an engine’s revs get too low. This isn’t really an issue on its own, but the problem arises in that the N125 doesn’t have a gear position indicator or even a rev counter. With its tractable nature, you will often find yourself riding around at rather low revs in heavy traffic, and that’s when these stalls can catch you out, so it’s something you’ll need to learn to work around. Bajaj claims a 0-60kph time of 6 seconds and a top speed of 97kph, although you’ll see over 110kph on the display. The bike hits about 80kph quickly, and overall performance feels up to the mark of the best in the segment. The company also claims an overall fuel efficiency of about 60kpl. Bajaj Pulsar N125 price, features and verdict One of the big success factors with bikes like the Raider and Xtreme 125R is that they offer the looks and feature set of bigger 150-200cc machines. When it comes to the latter, the Pulsar N125 isn’t quite up there with its rivals. On the one hand, it has a front disc brake and LED head/tail lamps as standard, while the top model gets Bluetooth connectivity and a silent start/start-stop system. But then it misses important things like a rev counter, gear position indicator or single-channel ABS – although Bajaj says it will introduce the latter if there’s demand. While the Pulsar N125 probably won’t sway buyers with segment-leading features, it has most of the essential fundamentals in place, the key among them being the price. At Rs 95,000 for the base model and 98,000 for the top model, it is more affordable than a similarly specced Raider and on par with the Hero Xtreme 125R. As of now, we can’t confirm whether it’s the best in its segment, but the new Pulsar N125 definitely has a fighting chance.  Also See: Bajaj Pulsar N125 video review",

    "description": "To say the Kia Carnival was a high-risk, high-reward product would be an understatement as big as the MPV itself. At the time of its launch in February 2020, the brand had only been in India for six months, and though its first product, the Seltos, was a runaway success, Kia was yet to become a household name.  To then launch a premium diesel MPV positioned above the near-untouchable Toyota Innova Crysta, and that too with an investment in local assembly? It sounded crazy. Sure, it sold nowhere near as many units as the rest of Kia’s products (or the Innova), averaging about 3,600 units a year, but it carved a niche for itself deep enough to warrant a sequel. Perhaps not many knew that the 2020 Carnival for India was really a 2014 model globally (Gen 3: YP) that was at the end of its life; in fact, the next model (Gen 4: KA4) was simultaneously going on sale in other markets. But, the YP lived on in India until April 2023, when it succumbed to the BS6 Phase II emissions norms.  New Carnival is a generation-and-a-half leap over its predecessor. However, rather than just launching the KA4 (it was shown at the 2023 Auto Expo) immediately, Kia opted to wait until it got a facelift so India would get the latest model possible and not lag the rest of the world like last time, and that’s the car you see here. 2024 Kia Carnival colours, dimensions, exterior design History lesson over, let’s talk about the new Carnival, whose basic premise hasn’t changed much. It’s still a massive vehicle, at 5,155mm long, 1,995mm wide and 1,775mm tall, with an E-class-like 3,090mm wheelbase, which are gains of just 40mm, 10mm, 20mm and 30mm, respectively, over the previous car.  It carves a silhouette similar to the previous car, even using the exact size of wheels - 18 inches, with a set of chunky tyres. Look closely, and you’ll notice the bonnet is longer, taller and more horizontal, while the front overhang is 20mm shorter and the rear overhang 30mm longer, all of which give it slightly more SUV-like proportions.  Wheel size at 18 inches is exactly the same as the previous Carnival.  Since this design is a facelift of a generation jump, the details are far removed from the previous car and in line with the newest Kias. The ‘Tiger Nose’ grille is wide, and hovering above it are LED strips that join the tall, slim headlamps pushed out to the very sides of the nose. Lighting is via prominent ‘ice cube’ LED projector elements stacked vertically, and even the fog lamps at the base of the bumper look similar. Spot the radar element in the centre of the air dam. To break the monotony of the slabby sides is a vertical dappled brushed silver trim piece, as well as a black element between the doors. Sadly, the exposed rail over the rear wheel arch for the sliding rear door returns and is an eyesore, as is the huge gap under the floor (for the same purpose), which you’ll see when you open the door.  Horizontal strip connecting the tail lamps help accentuate the width of the MPV.  The rear, similar to the front, adopts slim vertical LEDs joined by a thin horizontal strip, highlighting the added width, while a brushed metal trim element in the bumper adds some character. The rear wiper, meanwhile, is hidden under the spoiler when not in use.  Incidentally, the powered tailgate opening is wider than before, giving even better access to the mammoth 627-litre boot – that’s with all the seats in place, by the way, thanks to a deep underfloor storage as before, and Kia says it will hold four large suitcases. Fold everything down, and you’re looking at 2,900 litres of space.  Deep underfloor helps free up some additional storage in the boot.  The 2024 Kia Carnival is available in just two colours - Fusion Black and Glacier White Pearl - as that, the brand says, made up the bulk of the previous car’s sales. A small hint at the target demographic, if you will. 2024 Kia Carnival interior space and comfort Where the previous model offered 7-, 8-, or 9-seat configurations, the new Kia Carnival only comes in top-spec Limousine+ spec, with seven seats in a 2-2-3 layout. This was by far the most popular layout in the previous model, owing to buyers primarily purchasing it for second-row use.  The pair of vast captain’s chairs slide back and forth manually, requiring some muscle to move their bulk; that’s easier done once seated. They also slide left to right, but this is actually a functional requirement rather than a cool gimmick, as it might seem. With seats in their outermost position, you have ‘access mode’, placing them closer to the doors but also creating a gap between them to access the third row – the only access available. However, in this mode, their fore-and-aft movement is limited, so to access their full potential, they have to be pushed inward to the centre. Middle row captain chairs slide back and forth as well as left to right.  With this done, you can slide it a few inches further back and a few more still if you fold the third row away. And having them in the centre means they don’t foul with the third-row armrests, so you can fully recline the backrest and extend the ottoman with sufficient space to stretch out. For still more space, there’s a ‘boss mode’ to move the front passenger seat forward.  There’s even some height adjustment on the second row, and you can vary the seat base angle to an almost comical level. These functions, along with the recline and ottoman, are now powered, but the controls are oddly located on the inner side of the squabs, making them difficult to reach when the seats are pushed together. There's lots of adjustability for the second-row, including a powered ottoman. In terms of creature comforts, the second row once again gets its own separate sunroof; the seats are heated and ventilated; there are manual window shades; and there’s a pair of USB-C chargers, unusually located in the seat backs of the first row. The cup holders, too, are between the front seats, so if you have the second row slid back, you won’t be able to reach them.  There is a third climate zone for the second and third rows, but the AC controls are once again oddly located on the right side of the roof, above the driver’s seat, and you only get four small roof-mounted AC vents. That said, cooling didn’t seem to be a problem during our drive. The third row is a three-seat bench, which feels tight for three adults but just right for two, though the placement of the seat belts might restrict you. The headroom is decent; you can recline the backrest, and with the sheer range of fore and aft sliding for the second row, legroom can be either too little or a whole lot. So, as long as the middle seats are kept upright, there can be sufficient space for all. Third-row is a three-seat bench, but best only for two adults The front seats are big and comfortable, though a little firm in the upper back area. They’re ventilated and heated, with 12-way power adjustment and memory function for the driver. 2024 Kia Carnival features and safety Much like with the exterior, the cabin design and layout feel like the biggest leap forward for the Carnival. While the previous one was well-built, decently kitted out and practical, its look was decidedly last-generation. This one elevates things in every area, with the same futuristic design as all modern Kias. Dashboard is in line with latest Kias and material quality is really good. There’s a clean and horizontal layout to the dash, accentuated by the strip of ambient lighting on the passenger side and the slim AC vents in the centre. Below these, you’ll find a context-sensitive touch panel that switches between HVAC and audio controls, which looks cool but is frustrating to use in a hurry.  Further down is a wide central console that really highlights the space between driver and passenger, and it’s put to good use with a big storage bin, wireless charging tray, USB-C ports and large cup holders. The gear lever has made way for a crystalline rotary selector that looks and feels upmarket. Switchable HVAC and audio controls are frustrating to use in a hurry. In fact, that sensation is only enhanced by excellent material quality all around and generous use of soft-touch materials, typical of a modern Kia. A particularly high-quality touch is the row of metallic toggle switches for seat heating and ventilation and a few other functions. The twin 12.3-inch curved screen array feels bang up to date with its free-standing and hood-free design, and the graphics especially make it look techy and state-of-the-art. Touch sensitivity and smoothness aren’t up there with the best in the industry and are about the same as you’ll find in a Seltos; some might expect more at this price.  12.3-inch touchscreen looks slick and techy, and packs in a lot of functionality. The 12-speaker Bose audio system fills up the large cabin nicely, while other feature highlights include ADAS with Level 2 autonomous capability, eight airbags, a heads-up display, and powered, sliding rear doors that can be operated from the handle, the driver’s seat or even the key fob. 2024 Kia Carnival mileage, ride comfort and driving impressions The changes to the mechanical makeup might seem nonexistent at first glance, but there are a few important ones. For instance, the engine might still be a 2.2-litre diesel, but it’s an all-new unit that, crucially, moves from a cast-iron block to an aluminium one. The steering, meanwhile, uses electronic power assistance rather than hydraulic, which is another big difference. 2.2-litre diesel engine now uses an aluminium block instead of a cast-iron block. Power and torque are actually lower, at 193hp and 441Nm, and while Kia didn’t quote a figure, the kerb weight will no doubt have gone up. It doesn’t appear to have affected the driving character too much, though, and the Carnival’s powertrain remains unhurried but ample; Kia quotes a 0-100kph time of 10.7 seconds.  The 8-speed torque-converter automatic, too, isn’t the most eager, and that’s just as well in a big MPV, but its reluctance to kick down a gear quickly for an overtake can be annoying when you need it in a hurry. There’s a sport mode and paddle shifters, too, but you’ll seldom find yourself using them. While the obvious benefit of the aluminium diesel engine is weight reduction, the unfortunate side effect is greater engine noise. And though not loud and clattery like that of an Innova Crysta, it is something a premium vehicle at this price point should do without. New Carnival's performance is unhurried but ample. Kia has admirably stuck to its big diesel powerplant at a time when many are switching to petrol or hybrid, and apart from strong pulling power on the highway, its other advantage in a big car is fuel economy. The Kia Carnival’s fuel economy is rated at 14.85kpl by ARAI, but even in our day of hectic driving and shooting, we managed a respectable 10.9kpl. Ride comfort is also important in a chauffeur-driven car like this, and the new Carnival largely delivers. It was a wise choice to stick to the same size of wheels and their chunky 235/60 R18 tyres, as they do provide a degree of cushioning to the ride. Overall, though, it offers a solid and stable ride at high speed, with some harshness over larger bumps. Ride quality is solid and stable, with some harshness over larger bumps. The new electric power steering (EPS) makes this big MPV very easy to manoeuvre at low speeds, and even when making lane changes on the highway, it gives a degree of confidence to the driver. That said, the previous hydraulic unit wasn’t noticeably heavy or cumbersome, particularly compared to that of an Innova Crysta. 2024 Kia Carnival price and verdict With the generation-and-a-half leap that the Kia Carnival has taken, the advances over its predecessor are clear to see. It’s most evident in the features and tech, which now feel contemporary and right up there with the best. The updated look, which is modern and even a bit rugged, also adds to the appeal.  For all the updates, however, the basic proposition remains the same: that of a luxurious MPV that pampers the chauffeur-driven owner in the middle row with vast space and the ability to stretch out while also providing space for three more in the back and lots of luggage. As such, then, its price of Rs 63.9 lakh (ex-showroom), a jump of Rs 20 lakh (it is locally assembled as before), feels excessive. The fact is that MPVs are gaining better acceptance as desirable luxury transport; Kia, as a brand, has grown in stature, and buyers are willing to spend more. And Kia has chosen to make the most of it. There’s a gap between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1 crore (bookended by two very capable hybrid Toyotas), and while the old Carnival was positioned at the lower end of this space, it’s now moved up to the middle.   Carnival delivers in spades as a chauffeur-driven vehicle, but the price hike feels excessive. On paper, the updates might not seem to justify it, but the truth is people are willing to spend for the premium chauffeur-driven experience, as evidenced by the 3,000-plus bookings the new Carnival has received since launch, despite its price. And when it comes to delivering that experience, there’s no doubt the new Carnival has got the goods. Also See: New Kia Carnival video review",

    "description": "Mitsubishi has taken the wraps of the DST seven-seat SUV concept at the ongoing Philippine International Motor Show (PIMS 2024). Teaser images that were released a few weeks ago had confirmed that the SUV will preview of a larger derivative of the popular Mitsubishi Xforce SUV. The production-spec DST SUV will see a debut sometime next year. Mitsubishi DST concept previews three-row version of the Xforce SUV Will come with a 1.5-litre four cylinder petrol No 4WD tech expected Mitsubishi DST concept: what exactly is it? The DST concept from Mitsubishi will spawn a three-row SUV primarily for markets where the Xforce is currently sold. The Xforce is a popular SUV in Indonesia and a few other ASEAN nations and its three-row derivative will give the customers another option in the segment. The Xforce SUV is Mitsubishi’s answer to the Creta in these markets, and this extended version will be the Japanese brand’s equivalent of the Alcazar; do note that the Alcazar is not on sale in ASEAN markets, where the Carens-like Hyundai Stargazer MPV is sold instead. The first images of the concept released by Mitsubishi confirm that there will be a lot in common with the Xforce. The concept seems to have a longer wheelbase and bodyshell to accommodate the additional row of seats. The overall styling is quite similar to the Xforce when viewed from every side. It gets large alloy wheels and a decent amount of body cladding, which adds to its SUV character. The interior has multiple shades and soft touch materials. The steering wheel is all-new two-spoke unit and some of the controls and gauges are, naturally, a bit too concept-ish. These will be replaced by more conventional units once the SUV goes into production. The DST seems to share the 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen and 8-inch digital instrument cluster with the Xforce. While no powertrain details are given, we expect the production version of the DST concept to come with the same 1.5-litre petrol engine as the Xforce. A CVT automatic gearbox will be offered as standard, along with four drive modes: Normal, Wet, Gravel, and Mud. Will the Mitsubishi DST come to India? There is no word on Mitsubishi’s India re-entry at the moment despite the brand now being a part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. The Japanese company is currently focused on emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Mitsubishi's sister brands, Renault and Nissan, are working on bringing the all-new Duster SUV, its Nissan counterpart, and seven-seater variants of the same starting next year.  Also see: Mitsubishi Pajero Sport gets another facelift abroad 13 new special edition cars, SUVs launched this festive season Mahindra XUV700 waiting period increases to 2 months",
