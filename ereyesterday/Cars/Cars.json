    "description": "This 1934 Ford roadster is a modified Deluxe Cabriolet built between 1948 and 1953 by Robert Roeder, a metal finisher who worked for Mack Truck. It was retained by Roeder's wife until 1998, and following the selling dealer's acquisition in 2011 it was refreshed with a repaint in Ford Candy Apple Red urethane, off-white upholstery, and a top-end rebuilt of its Corvette 265ci V8. The seller tells us the car was hand-striped in front of the audience while on display at Amelia Island, and it was also featured on an episode of Chasing Classic Cars. The body is channeled, sectioned, and has custom details such as a narrowed '41 Continental bumper, a '48 Plymouth-based lift-off steel hardtop, a '37 Packard windshield, a forward-opening louvered aluminum hood, '40 Mercury front fenders, and '40 Ford rear fenders. Its Tri-power 265ci V8 was installed around 1958, and it is linked to a Ford three-speed manual and a 4.11 gearset. Inside are '40 Bantam Phaeton seats and a Studebaker cluster. This custom '34 roadster is now offered in Connecticut at no reserve with a clean New Jersey title.",

    "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z has always delivered stupendous value. It sits in a price bracket where it rivals a sharp-handling 150cc and versatile 250cc — yet it offers proper 40hp. But that value came with its fair share of compromises. To hit the tantalising Rs 1.85 lakh price point, Bajaj dipped heavily into its parts bin. The chassis and engine came from the Dominar 400, while the body panels and several cycle parts were borrowed from the NS200. So what were the flaws? For starters, the NS400Z came shod with bias-ply tyres — the rear being a 140-section — which simply didn’t offer the grip or confidence needed for a bike of this calibre. Braking was another weak link, with the use of organic pads limiting bite and feedback. And while the spec sheet looked solid on paper, the Sport mode never quite delivered the urgency those numbers suggested. Now though, Bajaj has gone back to the drawing board and reworked each of these key areas. The question prevails: have these changes made this affordable 400cc streetfighter a better all-rounder? 2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z: Design and Features - 8/10 The NS400Z borrows some of its cycle parts from the NS200 At first glance, it’s hard to tell whether this is the upgraded NS400Z or the outgoing model. As before, the front end looks aggressive, with the signature ‘Z’-shaped DRL and the mono projector headlamp gives the 400 its own identity, setting it apart from the NS200 and NS160. The side profile, too, is sharp and purposeful, thanks to the relatively short wheelbase and tight rake angle. The rear, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The box section swingarm looks basic, the tail light seems to have been lifted straight off the NS200, and you’d be hard-pressed to tell the two apart from behind. It’s not a bad design by any yardstick, but it’s starting to feel a bit long in the tooth. The signature 'Z' DRL and mono projector headlamp give the 400 its own identity. The NS400Z continues to offer a solid feature set — it continues to get a ride-by-wire throttle that enables traction control and four ride modes: Road, Rain, Off-road, and Sport. Sport mode is now sharper and exclusively activates a new software-based bi-directional quickshifter, which Bajaj calls ‘Sport-Shift’.  Instead of using a traditional sensor-based quickshifter, Bajaj has cleverly paired the gear-position sensor with the gear drum. This setup detects minute movements to interpret shift intent — essentially delivering clutchless shifts via software, helping keep costs down. The taillight design feels a little long in the tooth. I was a bit skeptical, but the system works impressively well — upshifts are timely, and downshifts are clean, with proper rev-matching. That said, at lower revs, the shifts can feel jerky and forced. I had queried Bajaj about this, and they explained that the system is tuned for higher revs, which is why it’s restricted to Sport mode. I also asked why it couldn’t be integrated into Road mode for daily riding. They said riders often rest their foot on the gear lever, which can confuse the software and lead to mis-shifts — whereas in Sport mode, rider inputs are more deliberate. Engine2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400ZEngine373cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower43hp at 9,000rpmTorque35Nm at 7,500rpmGearbox6-speed  2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z: Ride and handling - 9/10 The NS400Z now gets radial tyres at both ends, with a wider 150-section tyre The Pulsar NS400Z gets a 43mm USD fork up front and a monoshock at the rear. The front suspension is well-calibrated to absorb bumps and stays composed, but the rear can feel a bit harsh over a series of undulations, often tossing the rider slightly. A re-tune would help get it spot on. The front also suffers from noticeable nose dive under hard braking. That said, the bike feels planted in corners with no vague feedback. This is where the new radial Apollo H1 tyres shine. They offer excellent grip even in wet conditions, I never found a reason to second-guess them. The rear tyre has also gone up a size, from a 140-section to a 150-section, improving both grip and visual appeal, which is essential for a 40+ hp motorcycle. Grippier radial tyres have made a clear difference in both handling and confidence. The ABS and traction control systems work seamlessly. During my time with the NS400Z, I only managed to trigger traction control once—deliberately—in a mucky patch. The tail stepped out briefly, but the system kicked in instantly, pulling the bike back in line.  Despite the additions, the Pulsar retains its 174kg kerb weight and existing owners can upgrade to the radial tyres and wider rear tyre without requiring a wheel swap. The move to sintered pads has paid dividends. The NS400Z now features sintered front brake pads instead of organic ones. With the tyre grip sorted, Bajaj has now switched to sintered brake pads, drastically improving both feel and stopping power. The synergy between the improved brakes and grippy tyres means the electronics can now take a backseat—something that wasn’t true before.

The earlier model also featured a Sport riding mode, among others. However, one of our main gripes was that it didn’t feel as aggressive as its horsepower figure suggested. It built up pace quickly– no two ways about it—but not with the aggression we’ve come to expect from this 373cc engine. That changes with the updated NS400Z. Bajaj has bumped the power in Sport mode from 40hp to 43hp, sharpened the throttle response, and raised the redline by 1,000rpm—from 9,700rpm to 10,700rpm. As a result, the claimed top speed has increased from 150kph to 157kph, and the 0–100kph time has dropped from 7.5 seconds to 6.4 seconds. However, don’t expect KTM levels of hyper-aggression, and that’s not a bad thing because this is still a Pulsar. Peak power in Sport mode is up from 40hp to 43hp. To achieve these gains, Bajaj has reworked the engine internals. Key updates include revised valve timing, new cam profiles, a redesigned intake duct, and a forged piston for better thermal stability. The result is a powertrain that finally delivers the performance this platform has always promised. That said, the other riding modes continue to offer the same, quick progress with a non-aggressive approach and are limited to 40hp, which can be great fun for city commuting or even frugal highway touring. The dash does the job, but the dot-matrix display feels like a throwback. Despite the added performance, the ARAI-claimed efficiency remains unchanged at 28kmpl. For reference, the previous model returned 27.52kmpl in the city and 29.62kmpl on the highway in our tests. We’ll be putting this updated, more powerful Pulsar through our instrumented fuel-efficiency tests soon.  2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z: Price and verdict: 9/10 The 2025 Pulsar NS400Z gets several upgrades, yet it's only Rs 7,000 dearer. The Pulsar brand has always represented exceptional value. The NS400Z marked the second coming of a 40hp motorcycle from Bajaj, offered at a remarkably affordable price, given the performance on tap—the first being the original KTM 390 Duke, launched back in 2013. Naturally, it drew plenty of attention for all the right reasons. However, to hit that aggressive price point, Bajaj had to make several cost-saving compromises, which unfortunately became the bike’s Achilles’ heel.   The Pulsar brand has always offered stupendous value Now, with this update, Bajaj has addressed many of those shortcomings. And in true Bajaj fashion, all of this comes for just Rs 7,000 more. In our view, that not only maintains the Pulsar’s reputation for delivering stupendous value—it makes it an even better proposition than the outgoing model, price hike notwithstanding. At Rs 1.92 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Pulsar NS400Z is easily the best price to performance ratio you can get today— and really, this could be your entry into the 400cc space, at the price of a 250.

    "title": "New EV grants to be unveiled by government this week - report",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/new-ev-grants-be-unveiled-government-week-report",
    "description": "New allowances will be for retail buyers and favour UK-made cars, claims The Telegraph Grants to incentivise sales of electric cars are set to return as part of a tier system that will reward better subsidiaries to UK-made vehicles, reports The Telegraph. The outlet claims that £640 million in taxpayer cash will be used to fund the move as part of new plans to boost retail sales of EVs.  Official details of the fund will be fully announced on Tuesday by the Labour administration the transport secretary Heidi Alexander told The Telegraph. An extra £60m will also be announced to fund the building of more public chargers. She said: “We do know that the high upfront purchase cost of EVs is something that people are wary about. “I think we’ve got to be honest and say there are a lot of people out there who think that EVs are just for the very wealthiest. “We also want to really move away from people having range anxiety, to people having range awareness and knowing that they’re going to be able to make the journeys that they want to make. “It’s right that the government thinks in the round about what we can do to tackle both of the issues, on charging and on the upfront cost of purchase.” While this echoes the previous Conservative government’s Plug-in Car Grant that was pulled in 2022 – which took £1500 off the price of a new EV – what differs is that a tier system will be in place, effecting the amount of grant given. This, the outlet claims, will favour UK-made cars, such as those made by Nissan which this year will begin building the new Leaf EV, and next year the Juke EV, at its Sunderland factory. What’s more, it is expected the grant will only apply below a certain price band, meaning the most expensive and therefore more premium EVs will not be eligible. It comes as car makers struggle to hit the UK’s Zero Emissions Vehicles (ZEV) mandate, which this year requires car makers to achieve a EV sales mix of 28% – or be fined £12,000 per non compliant vehicle. So far this year, just under 25% of all new cars sold in the UK have been fully electric. What’s more, the worry from industry is that this number is heavily propped up by fleet sales – given the sector already has incentives via benefit-in-kind tax reliefs –which is why retail customers are now set to be supported. The grant is part of a wider offensive from the government to increase the appeal of EVs. On Sunday it announced Drive35, a £2.5billion fund “supporting projects which help the transition to zero-emission vehicle manufacturing”. This includes cash for manufacturing, R\u0026D, jobs, upskilling, and more to “help ensure the UK remains at the forefront of zero-emission vehicle development”, the government said.  Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Economic growth is our number one priority, and by funding our world leading auto sector we are creating the right conditions for increased investment, bringing growth,  jobs, and opportunities to every part of the UK.”   The announcement was welcomed by Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ chief executive Mike Hawes who said “is further evidence of the sector’s importance to economic growth”. He added: “The importance of a long term, cross-government strategy with specific measures for automotive cannot be understated given the challenges facing the sector amid geopolitical uncertainty and fierce global competition.”",

    "title": "When the McLaren F1 designer made a Ford Transit",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/when-mclaren-f1-designer-made-ford-transit",
    "description": "All the parts for the restoration were sourced from eBay sellers Peter Stevens is all about the camper van life – and his Mk1 Transit is quite the machine Car designer Peter Stevens, famed for the McLaren F1, is revealing the inspiration behind one of his latest projects: “I was working away from home in Coventry and staying in a very basic hotel. \"There wasn’t even a chair in my room. So, one evening, I’m sitting on my bed eating a takeaway and feeling quite depressed when I thought: I know, I’ll buy a camper van with all mod cons, park it in the car park of the firm I’m working at and sleep in that instead!” We’ve all got to kip somewhere, of course, but Stevens – the designer of all-time classics including the F1, Jaguar XJR-15, Lotus Elan ‘M100’, Lotus ‘X180’ Esprit and the 1999 Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR – putting his head down in a client’s car park? “There are some people who like being designers and some who like designing,” he explains. “I’m the latter. I certainly don’t expect special treatment. In any case, living in the motorhome gave me ideas for the project I was working on.” That project was designing the interior of a Mk1 Ford Transit, an event vehicle commissioned by eBay to promote the availability of new and used car parts on its website and which it has dubbed the eBay Lounge. The former German fire service Transit was registered in 1975 and restored and converted last year by the Envisage Group, based in Coventry. It had worked with Stevens in the past and thought the legendary designer the obvious choice to remodel the van’s interior. This year marks the Ford Transit’s 60th anniversary, and while eBay might have been tempted to commission an attention-grabbing tribute, instead it has respected the donor vehicle’s original design and specification. The eBay Lounge is still powered by its original 1.7-litre V4 petrol engine, for example, albeit modified to burn E5 fuel, and has the four-speed gearbox it left the factory with. The only major change, apart from Stevens’ redesigned event space, has been its conversion from left- to right-hand drive and the addition of a pop-up roof. “During the early discussions, we agreed it would have no silly 21in wheels or be lowered,” says Stevens. “Instead, we said it must respect the original design and specification and not spoil it with a sad caravan interior.” On that point, Stevens was able to draw on the experience of his motorhome. “That vehicle showed me what I don’t like in a caravan interior,” he says. So in place of pastel shades and floral fabrics, Stevens has chosen dark wood for the cabinets, a brushed steel sink with a smoked glass cover, a cool-looking counter-top fridge and a tough, uncarpeted floor, all from eBay sellers. Also from eBay are a Bentley alloy wheel table, passenger and driver seats that can turn 180deg and a pair of ‘old timer’ retro sports seats for use outside. Stevens’ favourite item is the Classic JLR retro radio sourced from the Jaguar Classic Parts store on eBay. Envisage also went shopping for parts on the website, sourcing everything from Mk1 Transit headlights to drivetrain and suspension components from the official eBay Ford store. Fuel pipes, brake lines and electrical and other parts also came from eBay. In his spare time, Stevens, 82, still races and enjoys driving his collection of cars, which includes a 2CV van, a Ford Model A roadster pick-up and a 1932 3.2-litre ‘Alexander Special’ hot rod. He rides shotgun with me as I take the Transit for a few circuits of the track at Bicester Heritage. I’m impressed by his composure as I wrestle with the old commercial’s woolly steering and wand-like gear selector. After a few laps, I’m getting the hang of it but the mushy brakes can still generate a few surprises. Either there’s nothing in the cabinets or whatever is there is stowed securely, but there are few rattles from the back.  It’s a pukka job and Stevens is pleased to have his name attached to it: “Whether it’s a supercar or a camper van, I just love designing!”",

    "description": "SUVs big and small are all the rage, but there's another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year and there's record interest in the body style high up the price ladder too. Kia's Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnival is sold out for the year while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet but has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. As you’d imagine, there’s lots to talk about.  MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 Being 5.27m long, 2m wide and 1.8m tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire.The 3.2m long wheelbase is huge in its own right and hints at the space inside. At 5.27m, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  In its basic shape, the M9 is boxy to allow max cabin space. It’s not a looker but then again, MPVs are all about what they are like on the inside, rather than visual appeal. The front end is home to slim DRLs up top, main headlights lower down on the bumper and a large grille at the base, with generous use of chrome to add some flash. This being an EV means the bonnet lifts to reveal storage - a handy 55 litre frunk in the M9’s case. 19-inch wheels and a stylistic chrome finish at the window line help uplift the slab-like sides. At the back, if the size doesn’t do it, the lighting that drops down at the side will sure help identify an M9.    Under the bonnet is a 55-litre frunk. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. The MG M9’s 19-inch rims come wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What makes these tyres special is a viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm.  19-inch rims come wrapped in self-healing tyres.   MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened via a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin and what gets you first are the middle row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency – delivering a VIP experience for the boss sat at the back. M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right and there’s 16-way power adjust too to control for everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and legrest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at max extension (made possible with the middle row seat all the way back and front passenger seat electrically slid forward). Backrest at full recline and legrest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk in but is convenient enough, as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold down armrest for the third row. Also note, the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. What’s noteworthy is that front seat occupants have it nice too. The seats are fully powered and also pack in heating, ventilation and massage functions. The driver environment does take some getting used. Partly because of the M9’s sheer size, and partly because of the layout of the controls - the gear selector sits on the right stalk behind the steering while the left stalk is for lights and wipers. Third row has space for three adults, but no middle seat headrest. The M9’s dash is neatly done but the flush finish to the climate control functions on the dash panel looks better than it is in practice.    MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those sat at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an onboard air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the rear section of the cabin, a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system and you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. Trouble is, the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also given the M9 powered sun shades for the middle row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third row windows and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their face at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. Up front, you get powered, heated, ventilated and massage seats, dual-zone climate control and a single-pane sunroof. Taking pride of place on the dash is a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/ Apple CarPlay, and eSIM-based connected tech. The 7-inch digital dials, in comparison, look small and basic. What is nicely done is the digital mirror. It relays a feed from a rear camera and gives a crisp view of the world behind. Touchscreen measures 12.3-inch size; supports wireless Android Audo/Apple Carplay. The MG M9 hasn’t been rated by Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP as yet but it’s reassuring to know that the big MPV is a 5 star Euro NCAP car. As standard, the M9 gets 7 airbags, ESC, all-around disc brakes, Isofix child seat mounts, a tyre pressure monitor and a 360-degree camera (the resolution is so-so). Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are included too. Functions such as lane departure assist worked well on the smooth and well marked roads in Goa. Also part of the package is a driver attention system that monitors for drowsiness, distractions like mobile use and even smoking!   MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Power delivery is strong and nicely measured out. The MG M9 has a front axle mounted motor that puts out 245hp and 350 Nm of torque. There’s also Normal, Eco and Sport drive modes, but that doesn’t transform this luxury cruiser into a rocket ship and that’s a very good thing. All too often, all manner of EVs dump their power in one go for wild acceleration, just because an EV can. Not in the M9, make no mistake though it’s not slow, a sub 10 second 0 to 100kph time is what should be possible and that’s quick enough, what’s nice however is that its power delivery is strong and nicely measured out, perfectly in sync with the vehicles character. Overtaking is thus easy, even in Eco mode, put your foot down and the M9 moves off smartly. Road, wind and suspension noise are very well contained on the M9.  Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quiet. Road, wind and suspension noise are also well contained yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. The M9 has a certified WLTP range of 430km. Given the unreliable charging infrastructure on our highways, the M9 isn’t ideal for long cross country trips. Delivering supreme comfort over intra city commutes is the M9’s forte.  MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup which means body movements are well contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   It handles surprisingly well for its size and mass.  The MG M9 manages its bulk around corners fairly well, driven sensibly or even slightly quickly, body roll is well contained, no doubt helped by the battery mass down below. The steering and brakes also have two drive settings – Normal and Sport, the latter of which firms up the steering and was generally nice to use. The Sport mode on the brakes though wasn’t to my liking given that at lower speeds it comes off as grabby. Speaking of brakes there’s adjustable regen modes with three levels on offer, L1 offers up a deceleration akin to a conventional ICE vehicle while L2 and L3 offer up stronger retardation, there is however no single pedal driving. MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The MG M9 is easy to drive for something so large but lets be honest, it’s not intended for the self drive owner. It’s for chauffeur-driven buyers. And it’s this target clientele that will have much to like about the M9. Middle row space and seat comfort are fantastic, refinement is really impressive and MG has also packed in a whole lot of goodies. Ride comfort could have been better but it’s not a deal breaker.  The M9 delivers on the brief of a luxury MPV quite appropriately.  The promise, then, is for Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh ex-showroom). To help convince buyers to see the M9 as a vehicle worthy of the big bucks, MG will retail the MPV from its new, premium MG Select dealerships. The M9 might not be the first luxury vehicle that comes to mind for anyone shopping at this price bracket, but it sure deserves a look. It might just surprise you.  Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

We also take a look at the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC, and a custom Indian Chieftain PowerPlus, built by an ex-freestyle motocrosser for a pro skateboarder. Brough Superior x Richard Mille RMB01 In what might seem like an unlikely alliance, boutique motorcycle brand Brough Superior, and prestigious watchmaking company Richard Mille, have teamed up to create a very special machine—the Brough Superior RMB01. Dive a little deeper into the history of both brands, though, and you’ll see that, just like high-end luxury timepieces, limited-production, hand-built motorcycles are constructed with meticulous craftsmanship and care. Both disciplines require the use of cutting-edge technology and are a labor of love, rather than a way to make a quick buck.…",

    "description": "Sean Skinner is the Jekyll and Hyde of custom motorcycles. Sometimes he builds tidy restomods that show restraint, and other times he builds idiosyncratic machines that put his imagination on full display. This sublime Yamaha RD350 street tracker sits somewhere in the middle. Sean runs MotoRelic as a one-man band, out of a small garage behind his house in Hamilton, Virginia, USA. This project was commissioned by a customer who had picked up a 1973 Yamaha RD350 for $350 (a proper barn find) and wanted it turned into a street tracker. “Normally, getting a bike for $1 per cc is a great deal,” says Sean. “But when he sent the photos, I felt like he overpaid. It was the crustiest, most forgotten bike I’d ever seen.”…",

    "description": "The all-electric Rimac Nevera R has smashed a whopping two dozen new world records for acceleration and braking, claimed the Croatia-headquartered hypercar brand. Ranging between the fastest 0-100kph and 0-400-0kph times recorded by a production EV, the Nevera R set these feats at the Automotive Testing Papenburg proving ground in Germany from July 5-8. For reference, the standard Rimac Nevera had 23 records to itself, all of which, except one, were bettered by the even more extreme R. The Rimac Nevera R takes just 1.72 seconds to go from 0-100kph It makes a total of 2,017hp, 103hp more than the standard Nevera \"When we first introduced Nevera, it almost seemed like the pinnacle of hypercar performance had been reached...In a single generation, we had created a performance jump that previously would have taken decades. But now, through relentless innovation, Nevera R goes even faster. Breaking records is in our DNA, and we won't stop here,\" stated founder and CEO Mate Rimac.

Combustion-powered hypercars still rule the outright speed game, with the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport's blistering 490kph. The Nevera R's 1.72 seconds for dispatching 0-100kph (Nevera - 1.81 seconds) is equally impressive, but the real standout is its 0-400-0kph acceleration-braking time of 25.79 seconds. That alone is a full 2.04 seconds quicker than the previous record holder-Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut's 27.83 seconds, and 4.14 seconds over the Nevera.  Rimac Nevera R powertrain and battery specs 2,107hp combined output, 120kWh battery pack Both Neveras share a 120kWh battery pack, though the R’s combined 2,017hp total output is 103hp more than the regular model. Rimac bills the Nevera R as an electric \"hyper sports car\" and has equipped it with torque-vectoring tech specifically tuned for its Michelin Cup 2 tyres. Along with that, it boasts an improved steering rack for sharper responses and crisper feedback.
