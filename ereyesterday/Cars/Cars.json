    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-sunderland-plant-will-build-motors-next-gen-nissan-evs",
    "description": "Government invests £50m in new factory that will create 183 jobs A new plant that will build powertrains for Nissan’s next-generation electric vehicles, including successors to the Leaf, Quashqai and Juke, will be built at its Sunderland site. Operated by Japan Automatic Transmission Company (JATCO), a firm majority owned by Nissan and which already produces transmissions for other car makers including Renault, the new factory will directly create 183 new jobs, with an additional 400 claimed to be made throughout the wider supply chain. The news comes as Nissan and JATCO agreed an investment deal with the UK government, with Westminster pumping £50 million into the project as part of a push “to build a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain,” said trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds. He added: “Not only will this boost our thriving auto industry, but it will help secure hundreds of jobs across the North East.” The site is JATCO’s first in Europe, and so represents a massive coup for the UK, said Reynolds, adding it was “a massive vote of confidence in the UK economy and this government’s plans to make Britain the destination of choice for investment”. The new cash injection arrives on top of the £2 billion Nissan and its partners had already pledged – and already begun spending – on upgrading its Sunderland site, a project called EV36Zero, in order to accommodate the building on its new wave of electric vehicles. This includes the construction of a second battery factory next door to supply batteries for the next Leaf, and a third gigafactory also planned nearby, both of which will be run by Nissan’s Chinese partner, Envision.  Speaking about the investment for the new powertrains plant, Alan Johnson, senior vice president, manufacturing, supply chain and purchasing for Nissan, said: “This is a fantastic step forward for our world-first EV36Zero plan. “Welcoming a key supplier to the North East of England provides a big boost to the efficiency of our supply chain. We look forward to continuing our long and successful partnership as we push towards our electric future.” Tomoyoshi Sato, CEO of JATCO, added: “I am very grateful for the support of the UK Government, Sunderland City Council, and all others involved in the establishment of JATCO UK, and look forward to supporting Nissan’s EV36Zero project with our electric powertrains.” The transformation of the Sunderland site also includes work within the factory, such as the converting of production lines to accommodate electric vehicles. The first car expected to run down it is the new Leaf, the iconic EV morphoring from hatchback to crossover.  This is likely to begin as early as March, Autocar understands, given testing began in the middle of 2024. Elsewhere with the factory, the former Leaf battery assembly line is being converted for the next-generation and electric-only Juke, due in around 2027 – around the same time as the also-electric-only new Qashqai. Nissan is also ramping up efforts to source renewable energy locally. Currently, 20% of the factory’s energy usage – which totals around 350MWh a week – comes from on-site wind and solar farms. The firm wants to boost this to 100%, but has not given a timeframe for achieving that.  Training the factory’s 6000 staff for EV production is another important strand of the investment package, as is recruiting more personnel to cope with a drastic rise in the number of cars built at Sunderland. Projections suggest the plant’s 300,000-unit annual output could double when the new EVs come on stream.   However, these plans could be somewhat hit given Nissan announced in November it planned to cut 9000 jobs from its global workforce, and slash production by 20% to five millions units per year as part of heavy cost-cutting measures. Nissan UK told Autocar that final decisions on where jobs would be cut had not yet been made.",

    "description": "Mazda has launched a rear-wheel-drive, six-cylinder diesel SUV. Mad or brilliant? Diesels. They’re falling like flies now. Vauxhall's Astra and Ford's Focus no longer sup from the black pump, and even BMW has killed off much of its diesel range. But Mazda likes to do things its own way, and it's continuing to do so with this Mazda CX-60.It seems that the CX-60 diesel comes about 20 years too late, but Mazda says it demonstrates a “commitment to a multi-solution approach to sustainable mobility and the principle of the right solution at the right time”. The idea is that the CX-60 also offers plug-in hybrid and petrol options, but that there is still a place in the range for a torquey, frugal powerplant to satisfy high-mileage private buyers, and people who need to tow.That makes sense in theory, but the reality is that diesels always used to be the darlings of the European fleet market, which has now switched more or less wholesale to plug-in hybrids and electric cars owing to incentives and rising diesel prices.The other problem is that although the CX-60 PHEV impressed us on the launch, we subsequently ran one as a long-term test car and found it wasn’t very efficient, the gearbox was clunky, it felt nowhere near as quick as the figures suggest and the ride and general refinement were poor. Can the diesel version save the CX-60 range?",

It was constructed and piloted by a German privateer named Helmut Fath, and spawned the next generation of sidecar racers known as ‘kneelers.’ A holy combination of old parts and new ideas, Helmut Fath’s BMW RS sidecar was pivotal to his rise to prominence in sidecar racing and his historic toppling of BMW’s championship reign Born in Ursenbach on May 24, 1929, Helmut Fath followed in his father’s footsteps with an immediate interest in motorcycles.

    "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",

    "description": "The Maruti Swift has been a part of our fleet for a couple of months now, during which it’s been a ‘fill it and forget it’ type of car. While its fuel efficiency may be its biggest draw for most in the office, I’ve discovered a few more virtues of the Swift in the time I’ve spent with it. The seat comfort and the driving position are absolutely spot on. First, it’s just so easy to drive and live with. The compact dimensions and light controls mean it’s effortless to operate, and its relatively affordable price tag (compared to the BMWs, Mercs and Audis in our fleet currently) means I don’t have to be stressed out about where I take it and where I park it. Then, of course, there’s the fuel efficiency. It’s actually down from Jay’s 14.2kpl to 13kpl – pardon my enthusiastic driving for that. But that’s still very good, given the traffic on my route to the office. Presence of a centre armrest would’ve added to the comfort. The reason for the enthusiastic driving is the gearbox and the steering. Sure, the engine lacks punch, but the smooth shifts and light clutch mean you don’t mind rowing through the gears. The steering is precise and feelsome. Living in Mumbai, I prefer the automatic version of a car, but it’s the complete opposite with the Swift. Smooth shifts, light clutch mean you don’t mind driving in traffic. What adds to the driving experience is the driver’s seat – there’s the right amount of support and plenty of adjustability, which makes it easy to find your ideal driving position. I also like that the driver’s seat goes really low, as that’s how I prefer to sit. Speaking of some things I’ve missed in the Swift, the presence of a centre armrest would’ve really added to the comfort factor. I’m sure there are some aftermarket solutions for that, but it would’ve been nice to see it from the factory. There’s also no tyre pressure monitor, and I recently found out why it’s an important bit of kit. On a shoot, one of my colleagues noticed that the rear right tyre was looking under inflated unbeknownst to me. A screw turned out to be the culprit and, thankfully, there was a repair shop close by to fix it. No TPMS means it takes time to realise that there’s a puncture. Other than that, the Swift is a hard car to fault – it’s no wonder, then, that it’s as successful as it is. Being the master of efficiency, it has been tough keeping a hold of the Swift’s keys for long, and it now has a new custodian. Hopefully, I can get it back soon to see what it’s like on a long road trip and tell you more about its highway efficiency, boot space, and rear-seat comfort.

    "description": "[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUU5nb1jAw[/embed] The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M3s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel or the embedded video up top and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",

    "description": "One of the most sprawling stalls at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025 will be that of Tata Motors. The homegrown carmaker will have a decided focus on EVs, but new models with other green technologies, such as flex fuel and CNG, are also expected to be showcased. Tata Motors will also display a few special editions and concepts at the pavilion. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect. Tata Harrier EV The most important model at Tata Motors’ stall will be the Harrier EV. It will be making a reappearance, having been showcased at previous years’ shows, but this time it is expected to debut in production-spec guise. The Harrier EV will likely sport a 60kWh battery with about 500km range. What will set it apart is that it’ll be the first all-electric model from Tata to sport an AWD setup, with an electric motor on each axle. In terms of design, it looks very similar to the ICE-powered Harrier, with some EV-specific updates. The interior is yet to be officially seen, but we expect loads to be shared with the regular Harrier and some with the Curvv EV. Prices of the Harrier EV are expected to be announced before March. Tata Sierra EV Another familiar sight at the stall will be the Sierra EV concept. We’ve seen different phases of the concept previously, and this time, it could be displayed in its closest-to-production form yet. Visually, the Sierra EV has some instantly recognisable design cues from the original Sierra from the ’90s. The signature curved-over rear-side windows, the squarish wheel arches and the high-set bonnet seen on the concept are all reminiscent of the original Sierra and are expected to make it to production. Not much has been said about its technical specifications, but we know it will be underpinned by Tata’s Acti.ev architecture and will be offered with electric, petrol and diesel powertrain options. The Sierra EV could also get a dual-motor AWD setup like the Harrier EV. The Sierra EV will have a 5-seater layout, and a 4-seater variant with ‘lounge seating’ is also a possibility. Tata Avinya Concept We have previously reported that Tata’s Avinya will not be a single model, but will spawn a new family of premium electric vehicles. This was previewed by a concept back in 2022. At the upcoming Expo, Tata Motors could give us a sneak peek at the first of these models, although the show car will still likely be in the concept stage. Technical details on Tata’s Avinya range are quite sparse.     Special Editions and alternative fuel vehicles Apart from new EVs, Tata Motors will be showcasing special editions of some of its existing models. Sources say two EVs and one ICE vehicle will be showcased in a new special edition on the lines of the Kaziranga Edition that the carmaker had introduced back in 2022 across its SUV line-up. Tata Motors could also showcase a flex-fuel version of Nexon or Punch SUV. The newly updated Tiago and Tiago EV and the carmaker’s existing range of CNG vehicles will also be present.
