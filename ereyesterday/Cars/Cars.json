    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-land-rover-defender-celebrates-classic-camel-trophy-cars",
    "description": "Trophy Edition drops historic tobacco reference but gains a host of off-road kit; priced from £89,810 Land Rover has revealed a new special-edition Defender that harks back to its classic Camel Trophy cars, gaining off-road accessories and retro paint colours. Based on the mid-sized Defender 110, it gains 20in alloy wheels, a choice of Deep Sandglow Yellow or Keswick Green paint – contrasted against a black bonnet, wheel arches and roof – and a black leather interior. The dashboard panel is also painted to match the car’s exterior colour. The optional Trophy Edition accessory pack (£4995) adds a roof rack, exterior panniers, an air-intake snorkel, a roof ladder and mud flaps. Matt-finish paint protection film can also be had as an optional extra. Although the new Defender isn't officially referred to as a Camel Trophy car (almost certainly due to the taboo that has enveloped tobacco firms since the sponsored off-road competition ended in 2000), it embraces the look and spirit of the cars that competed in the annual rally. Indeed, Land Rover said the Trophy Edition is a celebration of its “rich history of adventure challenges” and that its yellow shade is “synonymous with Defenders used on international Trophy-style events”. The Trophy Edition will make its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which takes place from 10-13 July. Prices start at £89,810. This comes after Land Rover Classic built 25 examples of the original Defender inspired by the Camel Trophy, with graphics and modifications closely referencing the expeditions. Revealed in 2021, that model sold out in just three days, despite its sizeable £195,000 price tag. A second run of 25 such models came a year later.",

    "description": "The V12 class may be an endangered species today, but these two uber-GTs show the world they're not going down without a fight - but which is best? These epic new Aston and Ferrari V12s have brought a famous old rivalry back to the boil. Our colleagues Matt Prior and Richard Lane took them to some heavenly roads in Scotland to find out which car is king of the V12 class today. If you want to compare Aston and Ferrari, there’s no end of criteria. Yet the comparison that hits hardest and means the most remains Il Classico. We’re talking grand tourers, especially the V12 ones. For us these extraordinary cars still define the companies. Does it matter which wins? In truth, not especially. We’ll tell you now that, barring the odd quirk, both the 12Cilindri and the Vanquish offer an experience so absurdly gratifying, exciting and evocative that you would give a kidney to own either. Today’s verdict is more of a gun-to-the-head affair – watch the film above to find it out…",

    "description": "There are a thousand ways to approach motorcycle customization. Some custom builders are slaves to geometry, creating machines that boast architectural levels of mathematical harmony. Then there are artisans like Mike Chen. Mike runs the eponymous Mike’s Garage in Taipei, Taiwan. His builds often appear to be cobbled together from mismatched parts, but the reality is that every part, detail, and finish is carefully considered. That’s how he manages to create bikes that are both offbeat and charming—like this Yamaha SR150 café racer. Made in Taiwan for the local market, the diminutive Yamaha SR150 has become a firm favorite among the current crop of young Taiwanese custom builders. “It’s a classic and iconic bike in Taiwan,” says Mike. “If you’re familiar with my previous work, you’ll know this model handles all types of modifications with ease.”…",

It has recently earned commendations, including a pair of Cavallino Classic trophies and a Platino award at last year's Concorso Ferrari Palm Beach, and it was also featured on the cover of issue 261 of Cavallino. The car is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Nero over Beige Connolly leather. Equipment includes 18\" multi-piece Speedline alloy wheels, fixed headlights, air conditioning, power windows, an Alpine radio, and a gated shifter. The seller purchased the car in July 2022, and a timing-belt service was carried out at that time. Approximately 500 miles have been covered since, and ~$25k of further service has been carried out at Ferrari of West Palm Beach in Florida, in preparation for the sale. This F512 M shows 28k miles and is now offered with a Ferrari Classiche red book, the owner's manual, service records, a GoodWool custom wool cover, tools, awards, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "In the ADV world, the GS moniker carries some serious baggage – but the good kind. A brand that’s instantly recognisable, even in the remotest of trails. But what if you want that GS clout without lugging around upwards of 250kg of flagship girth off-road? That’s where the F 900 GS rolls in. It costs Rs 1.25 lakh more than its predecessor and is now lighter, livelier, and loaded, but there’s also a bit of a catch. BMW F 900 GS design and quality (8/10) The F 900 is now more compact and lighter than its predecessor The F 850 GS looked like a skinnier F 850 GSA. The F 900 GS, however, comes across with a rally-raid aesthetic that looks even narrower and more focused. BMW has redesigned the fuel tank with plastic panels, resulting in a slimmer midsection. The entire silhouette looks leaner, and the motorcycle is now 14kg lighter than before. It appears someone has already kicked the indicator/brake light The bike is currently offered in two variants: Style Passion and Style GS Trophy. The Style Passion variant, which is the one tested here, features 20mm less suspension travel, a more accessible 835mm seat height, plastic handguards, a clear visor and misses out on a bash plate. For an additional Rs 25,000, you can opt for the Style GS Trophy variant, which offers 20mm more suspension travel, a taller 870mm seatheight, rugged metal handguards, a black tinted visor, and a slightly thicker, more comfortable seat. High quality and tactile switchgear make navigating the user interface a breeze While this motorcycle is specced out nicely, it misses out on the Enduro Pro Package available internationally. That would have included a 45mm fully adjustable Showa fork, a black handlebar with aluminium forged risers (20mm taller), and other enhancements that would’ve raised its off-road credentials. The new rally raid aesthetic looks more focused the F 850 GS Everything you see here is standard, except for the engine guard (Rs 40,000 extra). While the overall design is purposeful, the São Paulo Yellow paint may divide opinion. The headlight (same as the G 310 GS) could’ve been brighter, and the brake-light setup, which is integrated into the indicators, also looks like it could be a fall or an accidental snag away from a trip to the service centre. BMW F 900 GS position and comfort (7/10) Overall riding position is better suited for off-road riding The lower seat height of the Style Passion variant will help shorter riders, but this is still a tall bike. While the reach to the handlebar feels slightly stretched while seated, that same reach works well when you’re standing on the pegs. Seat padding and comfort could have been better The tank is now narrower, the seat more rally-style, and the overall ergonomics are off-road-biased. While standing on the pegs feels natural and confident, long-distance comfort is compromised. Another thing worth mentioning is that while the seat height is lower, the seat padding is also thinner, which eventually results in saddle soreness. It isn’t very pillion-friendly either. The advantage of this firm seat is that standing up from it feels a lot easier, but it will come at the cost of long-distance comfort. If height isn’t a concern, pay the extra money and get the GS Trophy variant instead Range is another limitation. The new tank holds 14.5 litres – half a litre less than before. Compared to the F 900 GS Adventure’s 23-litre tank, the standard F 900 GS will likely cover under 300km on a full tank. The lack of grab rails and mounting points also hurt its touring credentials. BMW does offer panniers and luggage racks, but these are optional extras that could set you back over a lakh. BMW F 900 GS performance and refinement (9/10) It has more performance and better refinement than the model it replaces Under the skin, BMW has worked on the old 853cc motor, bumping displacement to 895cc. It now makes 10hp and 1Nm more than before. Fire it up, and the engine has a bit more character, thanks in part to the standard Akrapovič can. Akrapovic exhaust looks great but not much louder than stock On the move, the bike feels livelier across the rev range. The broader torque spread allows for easy chugging in higher gears and confident overtakes. There’s no explosive top end, but the mid-range is very strong, perfect for trails and highway cruising. The F900 GS's motor is pretty refined at triple digit cruising speeds Despite its upright stance, the F 900 GS is deceptively quick and will get into high triple-digit territory with ease. Above 160kph, the blocky Metzeler Karoo 4 tyres become the limiting factor. City commutes don’t reveal much heat despite the season, and it shouldn’t be a problem in traffic. Punchy motor and well calibrated electronics ensure controlled slides Hit the dirt, and power delivery is strong but predictable, with plenty of bottom-end grunt to crawl up rocky climbs or make any overtakes on highways. The off-road traction control system also works well, enabling plenty of slide, but not too much. The six-speed gearbox is slick, but the bi-directional quickshifter requires a firmer foot, especially with standard road boots. It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals. BMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10) It handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage There has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS. It still retains that familiar, planted GS feel, but now with more willingness to play. Despite the knobby tyres the F 900 GS handles rather well At 226kg, it’s not light by enduro standards, but its weight is so well-balanced that it never feels intimidating. The suspension has a soft baseline tune but can feel firm over sharp bumps. Meanwhile, there’s not much you can do about the front on the Style variant as rebound and preload adjustability can only be tweaked at the rear. The F900 GS feels right at home off-road The GS Trophy variant gets an additional 20mm of travel and would be a better pick for serious trail work. Even in this spec, though, the F 900 GS manages light to moderate trails quite well, and it’s predictable and easy to handle on loose surfaces. While there is a lack of feedback, the F 900 GS is quite eager to fall into corners Enduro Pro mode is the only fully customisable mode, and, even with traction control on, it rarely cuts in unnecessarily. ABS, however, cannot be fully switched off at the front, and there were a few instances of it intervening unexpectedly. Early signs of wear are a bit concerning On the road, the bike feels surprisingly light and easy to filter through traffic. Around corners, the chassis feels composed, but the Karoo 4s start to show their dual-purpose nature. These tyres work well off-road but wear quickly, with significant wear already visible with less than 3,000km on the odo. BMW F 900 GS features and safety (8/10) The F900 GS has a whole host of electronic aids that can be fine tuned to suit your style It features a crisp and clear 6.5-inch TFT with an easy to read and use layout. Additionally, this TFF supports Bluetooth connectivity and other app based features. As standard, the F 900 GS gets four riding modes (Rain, Road, Enduro and Enduro Pro). The best TFT in its class with an excellent layout While the other modes cannot be tweaked, the Enduro Pro mode is the only one that allows you to fine tune its parameters. Additionally, this model also gets heated grips for India which should be handy in colder parts of our country. The F 900 GS also gets adjustable gearshift and brake levers to suit riders of different shapes and sizes.  BMW F 900 GS price and verdict (9/10) The F 900 GS significantly under cuts its closest rivals BMW hasn’t just added 50cc and changed the paint; it’s a proper evolution of the F 850 GS. With sharper handling, better ergonomics, and stronger mid-range performance, this is a much more focused machine than its predecessor. Even without the international-spec Showa fork or Enduro Pro pack, the Indian version remains a well-equipped and versatile ADV, especially for those who prefer trails to tarmac. Factor in BMW’s aggressive pricing, despite being a CBU, and this bike undercuts its key rival. If you prefer broken trails and dirt roads over well paved tarmac, the F 900 GS is one to consider If you were to throw in the extra Rs 25,000 to get the top variant and spec in some accessory extras, you’d still manage to undercut the Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro and the Ducati Desert X by a fair margin. If road touring is your goal, BMW has you covered with the F 900 GS Adventure. But if you’re after a lighter, more playful GS that still carries the badge’s spirit, the F 900 GS, particularly in GS Trophy trim, might just be your Goldilocks bike.

    "description": "Yamaha’s FZ family has been around long enough to earn the “old guard” tag in the 150cc space. It’s the motorcycle that brought muscle to the masses when it first launched and has since become a go-to for smooth, reliable everyday riding along with big-bike looks. Over the years, the bike has received numerous updates, and the latest one brings in some interesting new features. Enter the FZ-S Fi Hybrid, a variant that doesn’t promise earth-shattering performance, but what it does offer is more efficiency and a big step up in tech and features. The big question, though, is this: does the hybrid tech make a difference, or is it just a buzzword? Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid design and features (8/10) Muscular design with added TFT, Bluetooth, and hybrid tech Visually, Yamaha has played it safe, and there are no major design changes apart from some new colours and refreshed indicators. This is still unmistakably an FZ, and it continues to have that muscular streetfighter stance that made it so popular in the first place. Build quality is mostly very good, which is typical of Yamaha. A noticeable gap between the seat and the tank However, what caught my attention was a noticeable gap between the seat and the tank that effectively gives you a peep at the cylinder head. This Fi Hybrid variant is also available in an exclusive shade of grey and blue. The new colours, a touch of blue on the engine case, new switchgear and a brand-new TFT are the only ways to differentiate it.  Feature-packed TFT with good legibility is a boon The new 4.2-inch full-colour TFT display is a big step up from the drab LCD units we’re used to in this segment. It’s crisp and well laid out and offers Bluetooth connectivity through Yamaha’s Y-Connect app. The features list includes turn-by-turn navigation, call/SMS alerts, phone battery status, last parking location, and even malfunction notifications. It’s more tech than most 150cc buyers expect, and that’s a good thing.  New switchgear is well-finished but isn’t too tactile The LED headlamp does a decent job with illumination and is reliable for any late-night commutes. While single-channel ABS is standard, Yamaha has even thrown in traction control, which, with this amount of power, feels about as necessary as a raincoat in a desert. You’d have to ride through an oil spill to get it to kick in, and while it is a nice thing to have, dual-channel ABS would have been a more valuable safety feature. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid position and comfort (9/10) It has a relaxed, upright seating position with a spacious, well-padded seat Swing a leg over, and you’ll find that Yamaha gives you a commanding yet relaxed posture, which is ideal for city commutes and short highway stints. The seat is flat, spacious and adequately padded for both the rider and the pillion. At 790mm, its height remains accessible for most riders, and the bike’s 138kg kerb weight means it’s easy to manoeuvre in tight traffic. Add to that a well-judged footpeg position, and what you get is a very accommodating rider’s triangle for daily riding, with a hint of sportiness thrown in. Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid performance and refinement (8/10) Refined and smooth in the city, but performance feels more 125cc than 150cc The 149cc air-cooled SOHC engine makes 12.4hp and 13.3Nm; on paper, it’s the same as the regular FZ-S. But the big news here is the Smart Motor Generator (SMG), which supports the crankshaft by delivering assistance at low RPMs. This system is similar to what you’ll find in the likes of the TVS Jupiter, but it’s hard to feel the system at work in the Yamaha.  Our performance tests also show very similar figures to the older model, so it’s safe to assume that there are no real performance gains here. What has improved is the fuel efficiency, but how much of that is down to the hybrid tech and how much is thanks to the new start/stop system is unclear. Tested performance figures0-60kph5.73s0-90kph15.17s20-50kph (2nd gear)3.66s30-70-kph (3rd gear)6.96s50-80kph (4th gear)7.41s60-0kph16.59m What we can say for certain is that the start/stop system works well and is one of the best we’ve experienced so far. It restarts quickly and silently when you pull in the clutch, even if you accidentally stall the engine, which is a slick little party trick. Tested fuel efficiencyCity51.64kplHighway48.20kpl Out on the road, the motor is quite refined and tractable, with barely any vibration even at higher revs. The power delivery is rather linear, and the motor will happily pick up from 30kph in 5th gear. The performance is decent till about 80kph, but anything beyond that feels strenuous. Overall, it feels closer to a quick 125cc bike than a 150cc or 160cc one, and while the FZ is effortless to ride, it certainly isn’t exciting.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid ride comfort and handling (7/10) Well-balanced in the city, but its firm suspension compromises comfort over rough roads The chassis is unchanged, and that’s not a bad thing – mostly. The steering is light, the turning radius is tight, and the bike feels nicely balanced in the city. The suspension setup has a firm edge to it, which results in decent handling but comes as a compromise in city comfort. For a motorcycle whose engine has evolved in the direction of being a city commuter, the suspension should have become a bit softer as well. High-speed stability is decent, though this isn’t a bike that eggs you on to carve corners. Braking duties are handled by discs at both ends, and while the bite isn’t razor-sharp, it’s progressive and confidence-inspiring.  Yamaha FZ-S Fi Hybrid price and verdict (8/10) Tech-loaded, fuel-efficient commuter that feels overpriced for the performance it offers At Rs 1.45 lakh, the FZ-S Fi Hybrid costs about Rs 10,000 more than the standard FZ-S. While you get better efficiency and a TFT screen with Bluetooth, this bike is priced higher than the top versions of the Bajaj Pulsar N160 and TVS Apache RTR 160 4V. Those motorcycles offer vastly better performance, upside-down forks and dual-channel ABS. What Yamaha has created here is a good-looking city commuter that brings premium features and better fuel economy. But that comes at a steep price, and if you couldn’t care less about the TFT and don’t mind being your own stop/start system, you won’t be missing out by settling for a more affordable variant from the FZ line-up.  Price and specificationsPrice (Ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 1.45 lakhNo of Cylinders1Cubic Capacity (cc)149ccMax Power (hp @ rpm)12.4hp at 7250rpmMax Torque (nm @ rpm)13.3Nm at 5500rpmNo of Gears5-speedFront SuspensionTelescopic forkRear suspensionMonoshockFront Brake Size (mm)282mm discRear Brake Size (mm)220mm discFront wheel (inch)17-inchFront Tyre100/80-17Rear wheel (inch)17-inchRear wheel (inch)140/60-R17Kerb weight138kgWheelbase 1330mmGround Clearance165mmFuel Capacity13 litres Also see: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 review: Meaningful changes",

Thanks to the images found a month ago of the undisguised scooter at a dealership, we know the design will be much softer and more traditional compared to the V2’s aggressive styling. The VX2 will also be equipped similarly, though with a few downgrades, such as a smaller TFT, a physical key slot, a different set of switchgear and a flatter, single seat. This new teaser also reveals that it will be only getting drum brakes. The rest of the internals are likely to be quite similar to the V2. With respect to Vida’s current line-up, the VX2 is expected to be competitively priced and is likely to be offered in variants, as we saw a ‘Plus’ variant in the previously mentioned images. These scooters are likely to launch on July 1, and it remains to be seen what pricing strategy Hero will adopt. Also see: Hero Vida VX2 electric scooter teased ahead of July 1 launch",

    "description": "Happy tenth birthday to the Bentley Bentayga! It’s hard to believe the SUV has been around this long, and over the years, it has seen many powertrains, a much-needed facelift, and the addition of an extended-wheelbase version. But while it was a pioneer of sorts when it was launched, a decade on, the market is flooded with super-luxury sports SUVs. So, as a sort of birthday present to itself, the performance-oriented Speed variant has been reintroduced, albeit repositioned slightly to help it stand out better in a crowded marketplace. Where the previous Speed represented the ultimate in Bentley excess, the new one leans more into its sporty side. The W12 engine has been replaced by the twin-turbo V8, albeit without the hybrid system of the Continental GT Speed, the suspension has been stiffened, and almost all mechanical aspects of the car have been retuned to make it more agile, more responsive and more emotional. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed exterior design and engineering – 8/10 Bigger wheel option adds drama to an SUV already high on road presence. Optional 23-inch wheels are largest ever on a Bentley. You’ll have to be well versed in Bentley’s various model lines to identify the Bentayga Speed, because the visual cues are few and subtle, and much can be changed in customisation. For example, red brake calipers are standard on the Speed, but you can specify other colours. You can also specify silicon carbide brake discs – the largest in the world, measuring 440mm at the front. You can also option 23-inch wheels for the first time ever on a Bentley – finished here in Grey Satin – and these do well to highlight the Speed’s added performance. There are ‘Speed’ badges on the front doors of course, and by default, bright chrome is replaced by dark chrome, the headlamp internals are dark, while the tail-lamp lenses are clear. Headlamp internals get a darkened finish on the Speed variant. These changes aside, there are of course different bumpers on the Speed compared to other Bentaygas, and the options list does include a few unique extras. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed interior space and comfort – 8/10 Classy place to spend time, enhanced with a few sportier trim options. The Bentayga Speed is not available in EWB guise, but don’t think that means it is short on space, comfort or luxury. The rear seat can be had as a single bench or a split, two-seat layout with powered chairs, heating, ventilation and massage, and a fixed centre console between them. These offer exceptional support and comfort, ‘Speed’ embroidered into the seatbacks and the option of sportier upholstery options, like Alcantara. You get the option of a panoramic sunroof as well, and powered window blinds and a touchscreen controller are also part of the package. The Speed is not available in EWB guise, but there's no shortage of space or comfort.  Quality is, expectedly, exceptional, save for the front centre console, which as in all Bentleys, continues to be plagued by very ordinary-looking plastic buttons. Elsewhere though, you’ll find thick hides, generous cross stitching, shiny chrome and vast customisation possibility (although not quite as much as in the range-topping Mulliner variant). This includes a huge choice of trim levels, including stone instead of wood – something unique to Bentley. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed features and safety – 8/10 Good amount of standard features, and lots more possible via the options list. As with any luxury vehicle these days, prepare to spend for additional specification and personalisation, but in the Bentayga Speed, the upgrades are more performance oriented. That said, the standard specification for the SUV appears to be pretty generous as well. It includes a 590W, 12-speaker audio system (20-speaker Naim audio is optional), Matrix LED headlamps, 8 airbags, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, park assist, onboard Wifi and a digital assistant. Centre console still retains tactile physical controls for essential functions. The 10.9-inch central touchscreen will be familiar if you’ve used other VW Group luxury cars, and the layout is generally simple and easy to navigate. Bentley must be credited here for providing tactile physical controls on the centre console for all essential functions and then some. The digital driver’s display has also come a long way in a decade and now has several customisable displays, including some unique to the Speed, all of which look sensational. There’s also a heads-up display, and while clean looking, it doesn’t show you a whole lot of information; there’s an ADAS suite on offer as well. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed performance and refinement – 8/10 Feels strong and surprisingly aggressive, but not quite up there with the peak super SUVs. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed specsEngineTwin-turbocharged V8Displacement3996ccPower650hpTorque850NmGearbox8-speed automaticDrive layout Permanent all-wheel drive0-100kph (claimed)3.6 secondsTop-Speed (claimed)310kph Yes, the venerable 6.0-litre W12 that Bentley introduced in 2003 is no more – it was simply too expensive and low-volume to keep upgrading for newer emissions norms. Bentley says customers have been very accepting of the 4.0-litre V8, including its PHEV versions, but for the Bentayga, it will be non-hybrid only. This not only saves over 200kg in an already heavy car, but wound up to 650hp and 850Nm in the Speed, it’s more powerful than the W12 ever was. And it’s not just bigger turbos that have brought them to these figures. The V8 uses higher-flow fuel injectors, the compression ratio has been lowered and lag is said to be reduced too, thanks to greater turbo control. The throttle map has been made more responsive, and the gearshifts quickened, and there’s also launch control for the very first time. Venerable W12 has made way for a non-hybrid, 650hp 4.0-litre V8 engine. The result is 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 310kph, making this the quickest and fastest Bentayga ever, and Bentley says all this comes into play only in Sport mode; Comfort and ‘Bentley’ mode remain as refined as they ever were. What can’t be put into numbers is the effect the new sports exhaust has. By default, the Speed gets a steel sports exhaust different to the rest of the range, but as an option, there is a titanium Akrapovic option that saves 12.5kg. It also sounds utterly wild, especially from the outside; almost unbecoming of a car with the Flying B on its nose. Inside, they’ve chosen not to enhance the sound through the speakers, so though a little muted by all that sound insulation, what you hear is real. Acceleration is forceful in Sport mode, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes. Performance is every bit as strong as you’d expect, with launch control, in particular, feeling almost comically aggressive in a luxurious barge such as this. And, as Bentley said, there is a huge difference between Sport and the lesser modes. Acceleration is forceful, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes, and when you’re ready to rein it in, those massive brakes haul you back down with ease. It’s, of course, not as strong as some of its PHEV rivals like the Cayenne Turbo S e-hybrid or Lamborghini Urus SE, or even its stablemate, the new Continental GT Speed, but they’ve managed to deliver an eagerness and potency far greater than any previous Bentayga has delivered. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed mileage and efficiency – 6/10 The kind of efficiency you’d expect from an ultra-luxury performance SUV. Standard Bentayga V8 has a WLTP-rated fuel efficiency of 7.5kpl. Of course, mileage in a 2.5-tonne twin-turbo V8 SUV is not going to wow you, and at no point on our test drive did we even look at the figure. As the product is brand new, Bentley has yet to reveal an official fuel economy figure for it. However, for reference, the WLTP rating of the standard V8 variant is 7.5kpl, while the Speed’s W12-powered predecessor was rated at 6.99kpl. If you are after reasonable running costs, though, there is the V6 hybrid version of the Bentayga, rated at a solid 33.33kpl on the WLTP cycle. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed ride comfort and handling – 9/10 Deftly hops between limousine plush and razor sharp at the flick of a switch. More impressive than even the performance of the Bentayga Speed is its dual dynamic nature. Here too, there have been several key tweaks. Rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll bars are standard, as is a limited-slip differential. The suspension tune is 15 percent stiffer overall than the base Bentayga, and as mentioned before, silicone carbide brakes and 23-inch wheels (with Pirelli P Zero rubber) are optional. The torque vectoring system has been tuned to be far more aggressive, while the ESC system has been slackened to allow for far more slip. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight.  The results of these tweaks are easy to see, as they imbue the big Bentley with an agility never seen before. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight, and more akin to its sportier VW Group counterparts – the Urus and the Cayenne. It’s far more eager to turn in, and it now has a greater affinity for oversteer. This was made even clearer on the dirt track that Bentley had laid out for us, across which the large SUV bounded gleefully like a bucking bronco, kicking its tail out at every opportunity. On a dirt track, it was eager to kick its tail out at every oppurtunity. Even on the tarmac, though, you can feel the active roll-suppression system working overtime to keep the Bentayga level, as the rear-axle steering cuts the turning radius down to hatchback size. While luxury is what most of us associate Bentley with, the Speed wants to remind you that the brand has a history of sport too. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel plush; on the contrary, its air suspension manages the difficult task of oscillating between comfort and sport, and it does it seamlessly. You do feel the 23-inch wheels over bumps, though. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed price and verdict – 7/10 Bentayga’s new-found naughty side elevates it above the rest of the range. We’ll admit Bentley’s decision for the Bentayga Speed to forego the potent new 780hp PHEV powertrain, which its two-door Continental GT stablemate had recently received, left us a little confused. After all, the ultra-high-end performance luxury SUV, where a few 100 kilograms could easily be added or removed without anyone noticing, seems ideally suited to such a powertrain. And the Speed models have always been about excess, so why not give this Bentayga the most excessive powertrain? Foregoing the 780hp PHEV V8 gives the Speed a purer, more engaging experience. Bentley says that it wanted to go deeper into sports SUV territory, following customer feedback that cried out for a purer, more engaging experience. To that end, they’ve succeeded, and have also cleverly filled a void in the market vacated by VW Group’s own Lamborghini Urus. With the Urus having moved up into ludicrous 800hp PHEV hyper-SUV territory, Bentley’s decision not to follow it and instead fill the void might just be a masterstroke. Perhaps this should have been the new ‘Bentayga S’, which, fun fact, has been phased out by the Speed, since the two would have been too similar in proposition. While we do not have the Bentayga Speed India price just yet, expect it to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom, before options). It sounds ludicrous to think of such vehicles in terms of segments and rivals, but the Aston Martin DBX 707 does come to mind, an SUV which seems like it might be a tad more engaging, but not quite as plush and cossetting as the Bentley. Bentayga Speed India price expected to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom). The Bentayga, and indeed Bentley as a brand, has always been about the delicate confluence of luxury and sport, and should you have forgotten its storied and spirited motorsport history in recent times, the Speed’s slightly wilder approach is here to remind you of just that.

    "description": "In the end, no matter how well a car is engineered or how smartly it is priced, it’s the market that passes the final judgement. The customer is the ultimate arbiter. And our market is littered with examples of good cars that should have done better. The Hyundai Exter, it seems, is quietly joining that list. Spending a few weeks with our long-term Exter has left me a little perplexed. It’s a well-rounded package in nearly every respect, yet it doesn’t sell in the numbers it should. In contrast, the Tata Punch, which the Exter beats in several key areas, outsells it by a healthy margin. In fact, it emerged as the bestselling car in the country for several months. Yes, the Punch has a more upright, squared-off stance that gives it a mini-Tata Harrier look, and there’s no denying its presence. The Exter, in contrast, is a bit more funk than brute, with split headlamps, a busy grille, and lots of design elements fighting for attention. But still, it’s far from unattractive. If anything, it’s distinct and modern and stands out in a sea of safe, conservative shapes. All-black interior makes cabin gloomy. But the real story of the Exter begins once you get inside. First impressions matter, and while the cabin is well-laid-out and logically arranged, the all-black interior, with its shiny surfaces and hard plastics, does rob it of a sense of airiness and premiumness. It’s not bad per se, just rather dull. Lighter cabin tones, even as an option, would go a long way in making the interior feel more inviting. That said, the build quality is solid, and there’s good attention to detail in terms of fit and finish. What I particularly appreciate is the smart use of space. Storage is generous, and the wireless charging pad is one of the best I’ve used – it snugly fits my large iPhone 16 Pro Max without fuss. There’s even a thoughtful slot to route the cable cleanly in case you’re not wireless charging. A bit of a disappointment, though, is the very ordinary audio system, which lacks the clarity or ‘punch’ of rivals like the Punch. Audio system delivers average sound quality. But where the Exter genuinely comes into its own is out on the road. This is a car that thrives in the city, and the more I drive it, the more I appreciate just how easy it is to live with. The 1.2-litre, 4-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine won’t win any drag races, but it’s smooth, refined and delivers its power in a linear, predictable manner. You don’t need to keep wringing it out to get moving briskly in traffic, and that’s exactly what you want in a city runabout. Our long termer comes equipped with an AMT (automated manual transmission), and while I’m usually a bit sceptical about these clutchless manuals, the Exter’s unit is surprisingly good. Sure, there’s still that tell-tale pause between gearshifts, especially at low speeds. But it’s smoother and less jerky than in other AMTs I’ve driven. Hyundai has clearly worked hard on the calibration here, and it shows. Most of the time, it just does its job quietly in the background – exactly what you want from an urban automatic. AMT calibration is one of the best. The ride quality is another high point. There’s a certain tautness to the way the Exter goes over bumps – it doesn’t feel soft or wallowy like some of its rivals. In fact, there’s a bit of a ‘big car’ feel to the way it handles rough patches. And yet, it’s never uncomfortable. It soaks up potholes with a mature, composed feel, and that adds to your confidence when navigating Mumbai’s unpredictable roads. The steering also deserves a mention – it’s light, accurate and makes parking in tight spaces a breeze. But it doesn’t go numb at higher speeds either, which is encouraging when you do get the chance to stretch its legs. Speaking of which, I’m keen to take the Exter on a longer run. While it’s clearly built with urban use in mind, I suspect it might surprise me on the highway. Sure, you won’t be munching miles at triple-digit speeds in this, but with its decent ride comfort and a willing engine, it should do the job just fine. Well-thought-out cabin has good storage spaces. As I settle in for the next few weeks with the Exter, I’m genuinely looking forward to seeing how it fits into my daily life – and beyond. It’s already winning me over with its practicality, ease of use, and calm and composed character. And I can’t help but feel that more people need to give this car a second look. It may not shout for attention, but it quietly gets the job done – and sometimes, that’s exactly what makes a car a keeper.
