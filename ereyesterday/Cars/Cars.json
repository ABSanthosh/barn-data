    "description": "This 1993 Porsche Carrera RSR 3.8 is one of 51 examples built during a single year of production to help homologate the model for GT competition and was completed in December 1993 on order for Mark Sandridge’s Team Salad Racing. During the ensuing season, chassis 496081 finished second in its class and fourth overall at the 1994 24 Hours of Daytona before earning class wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring and Watkins Glen 6 Hours en route to the IMSA GT2 Championship. The car was sold in 1996 to a Georgia owner who campaigned it in SCCA and Porsche Club of America events through the mid-2000s, when it was purchased by Travis drummer Neil Primrose in the UK. Finished in Grand Prix White with a Team Salad Racing livery, the car is powered by a 3.8-liter M64/04 flat-six that was updated with a slide-valve fuel-injection system under previous ownership. Additional features include a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, three-way adjustable Koni shock absorbers, staggered-width 18” BBS multipiece wheels, aluminum opening panels, a fiberglass rear wing, a fuel cell, a welded-in roll cage, and a Recaro racing seat with a six-point harness. Purchased by the current owner five years ago, this 964 Carrera RSR is now offered in Miami, Florida, on dealer consignment with a copy of its Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin, factory order documents, invoices, a collection of spare parts, and a bill of sale.",

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.

Available in enduro and supermoto trim, the DR-Z400 boasts an enviable cult following thanks to its no-fuss, bang-for-buck vibe. Off-road riders and street hooligans alike love the DR-Z’s punchy single-cylinder motor, relatively light build, and endless upgrade possibilities. If that’s you, you’ll be happy to know that Suzuki has just treated the DR-Z to a major update, adding new styling, fuel injection, and a handful of other upgrades. Now rebranded as the DR-Z4S (dual-sport, above) and DR-Z4SM (supermoto), the new DR-Z sports more than just a facelift.

It turns out that he churned out a second Sportster around the same time, and it’s just as wild. The project was conceived when Mule’s client brought him a very unique Harley-Davidson motorcycle—an early ‘iron’ XR750 flat tracker that had previously been owned by the late Allan Girdler. A lifelong racer, journalist, and former editor of Cycle World magazine, Allan was also a good friend of Mule’s. The bike’s current owner wanted it upgraded for spirited road riding, before the project unexpectedly took a sharp left turn. “After some background research, he said that what he really wanted was one of my more straightforward Sportster street tracker builds, which I was only too happy to provide him with,” Mule tells us.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/mercedes-benz-cla-prototype-breaks-ev-24-hour-distance-record",
    "description": "Record beats Porsche Taycan’s 2019 run of 2128.2 miles, set on the same Nardò test track in Italy Mercedes-Benz has set a new electric car distance record during testing of its third-generation CLA. Building on the benchmarks established by the sleek EQXX engineering concept, a prototype of the new saloon covered 2309.6 miles within a 24-hour period at the Nardò test track in Italy This surpasses the 24-hour distance of 2128.2 miles set by the Porsche Taycan on the same 7.9-mile banked oval in 2019. Based on the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA) platform, the CLA is the first of four new compact electric models the German car maker plans to launch by the end of 2026. Successor models to the CLA Shooting Brake, EQA and EQB are also in the pipeline. All four models feature a newly developed 800V electric architecture – the first of its kind to be used by a series-production Mercedes-Benz – in combination with new-generation electric motors, heat pumps and the MB:OS operating system.   The CLA prototype used for the record attempt was taken from a fleet of production-based engineering mules already undergoing durability testing ahead of the model's planned launch early next year. It ran alongside a back-up prototype. Both cars featured a driver and front passenger as well as data loggers and other test equipment. Key to the record was a clever charging strategy, dubbed “plug and dash”, which was developed to maximise driving time. Rather than dipping well into the energy reserves on long periods of driving before recharging, Mercedes-Benz opted for shorter driving stints paired with frequent charging stops. “Regular charging brings a decisive advantage in both distance and time efficiency – essentially, how many kilometres or miles can be driven for every minute of charging,” said Christian Pfeiffer, team lead of Mercedes-Benz’s latest electric drive system. The CLA prototype underwent a total of 40 recharges during the 24-hour attempt, each around 10 minutes in duration.  Overall, the prototype was stationary for close to 28%, approximately six hours and 40 minutes, of the 24-hour record attempt. These short but regular stops enabled Mercedes-Benz to take advantage of a boost function that allows a high initial charging rate on a DC system compared with the average achieved over longer but fewer stops. Mercedes-Benz has yet to reveal the charging capacity of its upcoming electric model, but it has previously hinted it will be capable of accepting charge at around 250kW, with an additional 50kW boost function allowing it to reach 300kW for short periods. This will enable a 249-mile top up in just 15 minutes. The energy capacity of the new model’s lithium ion battery also remains under wraps, though it is claimed to be 89.6kWh. This is said to provide the new CLA with an average consumption of around 5.2mpkWh and an overall range of up to 466 miles, making it one of the most efficiency and longest-ranged cars on sale. Production versions of the new model are also expected to offer a less energy-dense lithium-ion-phosphate unit as a cheaper option. The CLA used in the record attempt was a rear-wheel-drive model featuring a single rear-mounted synchronous electric motor and two-speed transmission. Again, technical details have yet to be disclosed, though Mercedes-Benz is claimed to be developing the new saloon with drivetrains offering between 202bhp and up to 537bhp in an AMG-branded dual-motor, four-wheel-drive performance model. Despite being developed as an “electric first” model, the new saloon will also be sold with a turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol engine paired with a gearbox-mounted motor. Developed by Mercedes-Benz, the new four-cylinder petrol engine will be produced in China by Horse Powertrain – a company jointly operated by Chinese car maker Geely and France’s Renault. Leaked specifications reveal the new unit, known internally as the M252, develops 249bhp and up to 266lb ft of torque in an initial state of tune, although this has yet to be confirmed by Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz boss Ola Källenius said: “With the CLA, we are ushering in a new era at Mercedes‑Benz. We will substantially elevate every aspect of what our customers can expect from a Mercedes in this segment.  “The modular platform allows for maximum flexibility. We can offer the CLA in both a state-of-the-art electric drivetrain version and a hybrid electrified combustion-engine version.  And our operating system, MB.OS, will make it the most intelligent car we’ve ever built.” The third-generation CLA is planned to be revealed next year, with UK sales set to get under way by the end of 2025. Initial models will be electric only, with the hybrid option set to be made available six months after its launch.",

    "description": "I vividly remember my first dalliance with the charming Royal Enfield Classic 350 – our then long-termer when I was just an intern. It was early July, and I was riding to Mumbai from Pune with the monsoon in full swing. Despite the unforgiving weather, that ride is etched in my memory. After that, I remember asking Rishaad (the bike’s primary custodian) for it every chance I got, and while I absolutely adored it, I couldn’t help but wish for a bit more performance. Prior to this, my only other experience with an RE was my uncle’s Interceptor 650, and I wished for a bike that would marry the styling and comfort of the Classic 350 with the performance of the 650cc parallel-twin. And that’s exactly what the company has done (well, almost). Say hello to the gorgeous Classic 650 Twin. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin design, quality, colours There are good-looking bikes and then there are good-looking bikes. This Classic 650 Twin definitely falls in the latter category. The overall silhouette is a union between the Classic 350 and the Shotgun, both handsome bikes to begin with, and it keeps building on that. You can identify the Classic 650 Twin as a Classic for sure but you won’t mistake it for the smaller one. That big engine, twin pipes and its sheer size make the 650 easy to identify. The gorgeous Classic 650 Twin has the best finish of any modern Royal Enfield. While the visuals are derived from the smaller 350, the 650 Twin’s colour palette is unique. There are four colours on offer – Bruntingthorpe Blue, Vallam Red, Teal Green and the Black Chrome. The latter two are colours seen on the original UCE Classic models and the Teal Green is by far my favourite colour here. It is the only one amongst the four options to get a colour-matched frame and main stand (yes, you read that right). Beefy handlebar clamp and chromed-out switchgear cubes are a premium touch and unique to the Classic 650 Twin. Fit and finish is the best on any Royal Enfield yet and there are lashings of chrome everywhere. Even the switch cubes and wheel hubs are chromed out! RE wants to drive home the fact that you’re on the bigger Classic so there’s a beefy handlebar clamp (of course, it’s chrome) and fittingly, even the headlight housing is properly prodigious. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin weight, manageability At 243kg, the Classic 650 Twin is the heaviest modern-day RE yet (at least until the Himalayan 650 arrives). The weight is a non-issue at anything over walking speeds, but you’ll feel every ounce muscling the bike around in the parking lot and while putting it on the main stand. My only gripe on the design front is that the gap between the rear fender and the tyre is a little unsightly. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nowhere near as unseemly as on a Harley X440, but on an otherwise good-looking bike, it’s definitely a fly in the ointment. The bike you see in all the pictures has a solo seat, but customer bikes will come with a pillion seat and grab rails, just like the Shotgun. The riding position is very neutral and you can easily spend a lot of time in the saddle. Seat height is set at a relatively low 800mm, but this is perhaps the toughest bike with an 800mm perch to get your feet down on. I’m 5’11” and I could just about get both my feet flat on the ground – and I had to sit on the lowest part of the seat for that. To blame is the wide engine, which splays your legs out a fair bit. Shorter riders will have to find a workaround or look elsewhere. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin riding experience Enough praise has been showered on Royal Enfield’s twin-cylinder engine already, but I’m here to lay some more onto that pile. This is easily the best engine on any Indian motorcycle – in my books at least – and for good reason. Smooth, tractable and with torque almost everywhere, this motor excelled in every situation. Going through sleepy towns, blasting through corners and even holding 80mph (124kph) on the motorway, everything was navigated with reasonable ease. The motor is carried over as is from the Shotgun, with no mapping or gearing changes. The Classic 650’s chassis is similar to the Shotgun, with the same main frame and the same steering  geometry. The differences boil down to a telescopic fork here vs a USD on the Shotgun, and different wheel sizes (19/18-inch wheels, like the smaller Classic – the Shotgun uses an 18/17 setup). The Showa fork is 43mm in diameter and the twin shocks are the same as the Shotgun’s. Suspension travel, too, is the same fore and aft, at 120mm and 90mm, respectively. Stiff rear shocks are the main drawback here. While the Classic 650 is a willing companion if you want to attack corners, the mid-set pegs can scrape without too much trying and you need to adjust your body position accordingly. I also missed having a heel shifter, like on the smaller Classic, but these complaints are something I can easily look past. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin ride and handling What I simply cannot ignore is the stiff and jarring ride. And I’m saying this after riding the Classic 650 Twin in the UK, where the roads are head and shoulders better than ours. This is literally the only thing that is actively stopping me (and I suspect will do so for many others) from going out and buying one today, that’s how good the rest of the bike is. Brake sizes on the big Classic are the same as the Super Meteor and Shotgun, and that means they’re powerful enough but in a progressive manner. Fun fact: the calipers are RE branded but are the same ByBre units seen on the aforementioned two models. This is something, I’m told, will trickle down to other REs in time. Dash is same as 350, Tripper standard on all colours. The spec sheet worshippers may lament the lack of a USD fork but, honestly, I don’t think it’s any worse off without one – this look suits the Classic better. Never once did I feel that the front end was lacking in feel or stability and we were keeping a fair lick on these beautiful UK roads. Seats and mounting points same as Shotgun 650. While the laced wheels do mean tubed tyres today, Royal Enfield says tubeless wire-spoke wheels are in development, which is encouraging to hear. However, it’s still early days so don’t expect to see them anytime soon. Hopefully,  you will then be able to fit the tubeless wheels even on the single-cylinder Classic/Bullet models down the line. Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin expected price, verdict Royal Enfield hasn’t revealed the price of the Classic 650 Twin but has hinted that the starting price will be in the Shotgun’s ballpark and the top chrome colour in the Super Meteor’s territory. That is sure to make the Classic 650 Twin a heart-over-head purchase. You could also argue that the Shotgun and Classic are too similar in how they ride and that the extra cash you shell out is just for the form factor and riding position. With the Classic 650 Twin, Royal Enfield has been quite clear that its focus is on the relatively untapped export markets. With what I’ve experienced, I’m sure it will do well for them and I wish them all the best. However, I can’t help but shake this nagging feeling that the suspension will be a problem on our roads and while this is a wonderful bike in many days, it isn’t the Classic 650 I used to dream about. I hope to be wrong, but we’ll find out soon enough. Also See: Royal Enfield Classic 650 twin video review",

    "description": "It’s hard not to get carried away when riding on mountain roads in Southern California. Maybe it's the crisp, cool high-altitude air that tricks you into feeling relaxed, even when the speeds are anything but. We certainly got carried away in the twisties during our first ride aboard the new Royal Enfield Bear 650, and it wasn’t entirely to do with that cool mountain air. Confused? Understandable. After all, why should a scrambler-ised version of the already hefty and not very sharp Interceptor be egging us on in the corners? Well, as it turns out, the Bear is much more than just a scrambler-ised Interceptor. Royal Enfield Bear 650: design, features Sure, many of the changes have been made with the intent of making the Bear better suited to off-roading. You’ve now got an upside-down fork (in place of the Interceptor’s conventional unit) offering more travel – up from 110mm to 130mm. It’s a similar story at the rear, too; the Bear sticks with a twin shock setup, but travel has grown from 88mm to 115mm. As a result, seat height and ground clearance have also increased, and now stand at 830mm and 184mm, respectively. But to accommodate the new suspension components and adapt the bike to its more off-road-focused role, Royal Enfield has had to strengthen the frame in multiple areas. It’s the same basic frame as the Interceptor, but it has now been braced in various areas to add strength and stiffness, and the sub-frame has been revised as well. The end result is a chassis that feels noticeably stiffer than the Interceptor’s. Attacking corners hard, the Bear does feels hinged in the middle, and the sort of mid-corner bumps that would have the Interceptor wobbling and wallowing all over the place are simply shrugged off. There’s great feedback and you really have the confidence to keep carrying more speed into a corner, and leaning further and further, despite the more off-road centric 19in/17in wheel on offer. This is also, in no small part, down to the excellent new tyres wrapped around those wheels – you’re unlikely to have heard of the MRF Nylorex tyres before and that’s because they’re a new dual-purpose model that have been developed specifically for this motorcycle. Despite the blocky pattern, the grip, profile and predictably on the road were superb, and there were no complaints when on tarmac. Part of the Bear’s playfulness in the twisties can also be attributed to the suspension setup. The front fork strikes a nice balance between comfort and performance, but the shocks feel rather firm and unforgiving. This was the case across riders of different weights, even at the minimum preload setting. On the largely excellent Californian tarmac, it wasn’t a deal-breaker, but the firm edge could be felt, and rough patches translated to my backside without sufficient mitigation. How this setup fares on the less than perfect roads back home is something we’ll have to find out in due course. Royal Enfield Bear 650: performance, ergonomics Many of the numbers are bigger with the new Bear, and while most of that is good, one big number that’s got some people a little apprehensive is the seat height. Yes, 830mm is definitely on the taller side – I’m not very tall, only 5’8”, which means I can’t flat-foot both feet. That said, it isn’t unmanageable either, and with a little bit of forward planning, you can comfortably pick either one side to flat-foot. It also helps that the footpegs are now a little further forward, so they don’t foul your shins as much. The other change to the riding position is the handlebar, which is wider and a little further away from you. The wider part is nice, it gives you more leverage over the bike, which I like. The further away part, I’m not such a fan of – it’s a bit more of a forward reach than I’d like, and if you’re short like me, then this could become a point of fatigue over long rides. On the upside, this is now a lighter motorcycle than the model it’s based on. Moving to this new 2-into-1 exhaust setup has helped shed a bunch of weight, though some of that has been added back through the suspension and the frame strengthening. Nevertheless, it is still 2kg lighter than the Interceptor. However, at 216kg, still a fairly hefty motorcycle. You only really feel this at low speeds and when paddling about, and once you’re on the move, the Bear masks its weight rather well. The new exhaust has done more than just trimming the weight – it’s also allowed RE to squeeze out some more torque from the motor; it now produces 56.5Nm vs the 52Nm we’ve seen from it so far. So the engine feels a little more punchy now, while still remaining the pleasant, fairly refined, characterful motor that we’ve fallen in love with over the last 6 years. The new exhaust has slightly changed the sound, though. It exits a little closer to you and doesn’t run quite as far back as the twin-pipe designs, which is one of the factors at play. Overall, it’s a little more braap-y and raspy, as opposed to the more sweet-sounding twin pipe 650s. I think this suits the character of the Bear rather well. Royal Enfield Bear 650: off-road performance Now, we come to the big question of off-road performance. We didn’t have a great deal of opportunity to ride the Bear off-road – we only got a short spin up and down a fairly simple gravel track. But the feeling is that this is definitely more of a soft-roader than a hardcore off-roader. The suspension can absorb some hits, up to a point, and these new tyres seem to work well off-road. The rear ABS can also be turned off. So yes, you can have some fun off-road. But the weight makes its presence felt, and the ergos are halfway between on-road and off-road, so this is not a bike you’d want to push very hard when the tarmac runs out. But you won’t have to turn around either. Turning off that rear ABS is done through a fully-digital TFT display –  this is the first Royal Enfield 650 to get one, and it’s the same unit you’ll find on the Himalayan. Which means, you also get features like Bluetooth connectivity and Google Maps integration. It’s also the first RE 650 to get full-LED lighting. The only other noteworthy feature is a USB charging port, but as is the case with all REs now, there is a comprehensive list of accessories that covers the usual suspects, like touring mirrors and a touring seat, as well as more scrambler-specific items like a sump guard and a headlight grille. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The final piece of the puzzle is the price – and starting at Rs 3.39 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and going up to Rs 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), the Bear sits between the Interceptor and GT on one end and the Shotgun and Super Meteor on the other. Having ridden it around California, it feels like the most versatile and competent RE 650 today. It can cruise, it can tour, it can commute, you can corner pretty hard – it’s a great road bike – and it’s got some off-road ability as well. But how much of a pain the firm suspension setup will be back home in India is something we’ll only be able to tell you a little further down the road. Test rides and deliveries begin on November 10, so it shouldn’t be too long before we find out.",

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  Everest iconography shifted here from the spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular). But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "description": "It was one of those perfect drives, a rare window of relative emptiness on India’s busiest highway. A mid-morning dash to the BU Bhandari showroom for the launch of the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 was the easiest Mumbai-Pune trip I’ve done in a long time. Making the drive particularly relaxing was the new addition to Autocar India’s fleet, the all-electric Mercedes EQE SUV, which got its first highway outing. It took just two hours and six minutes in the ultra-smooth (and quick) EQE SUV to go from the Autocar HQ to the BU Bhandari Showroom on the Pune bypass. That’s less than what many office folks take to get home on a typical working day in Mumbai. It does help that the AtalSetu has brought our office closer to the edge of Mumbai, and a 10:15am departure was a sweet spot (or time). The early-morning highway rush was over, the toll plazas had no long queues, and even the Lonavala Ghat, which is choked most of the day (and night) on Google Maps, was surprisingly ‘blue’. Traffic flowed without holdups, even on the steepest sections where trucks otherwise block all lanes while trying to ‘overtake’ at a crawl. Strong and smooth powertrain effortlessly gobbles miles. The Atal Setu is always a great place to try out the ADAS system on any car. The wide and perfectly marked lanes and the gentle curves on this 21km sea bridge were perfect for checking out the EQE SUV’s ‘Level 2’ ADAS capability. That meant letting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which I have set at 99kph (just below the 100kph speed limit), and the Lane Keep Assist do the work while I sat back and relaxed with just a light hand on the wheel, enjoying the harbour’s breathtaking views. The Lane Keep Assist worked brilliantly, keeping the big Merc centred nicely in the fast lane. When changing lanes, I was impressed with how the ACC reacted smoothly. When you signal and shift into the overtaking lane, the ACC provides strong and linear acceleration without abrupt power surges to match the new lane’s speed. Active Brake Assist activates at the slightest hint of an obstacle. While the ADAS in the Mercedes EQE SUV is highly advanced, it has some limitations, especially when dealing with erratic drivers who slice across lanes like it’s a normal thing to do. If some idiot abruptly cuts into your lane from a sharp angle, the ADAS can struggle to react promptly. This is not the case with just the EQE SUV – no ADAS is fully capable of handling such unpredictable events, which is a reminder of why the tech can only assist and not replace the driver. Mercedes’ Active Brake Assist, while a great safety feature on paper, can become a nuisance – and even a potential hazard – in Mumbai’s chaotic traffic. Designed for controlled environments, it doesn’t quite account for the unpredictability of pedestrians darting across roads or scooters weaving through tight gaps. The system often triggers unnecessarily, slamming on the brakes at the slightest hint of an obstacle. In such congested conditions, this overly sensitive response can be more dangerous than helpful. These fierce and abrupt stops are hugely unnerving for the passengers and could catch a driver behind you off guard, increasing the risk of rear-end collisions. It’s best to switch the Brake Assist off, which you have to do every time you start the car. The monsoons have made mincemeat of the Nhava Sheva road, which connects the Atal Setu to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and on such surfaces, the EQE SUV is out of its comfort zone. To be honest, it doesn’t quite live up to its SUV credentials and isn’t comfortable dropping in and out of potholes like its IC engine brethren. That’s because the softly sprung EQE SUV uses up its suspension travel quite easily, and deep ruts and craters crash through. In fact, it’s best to use ‘Sport’ drive mode as the default setting. The suspension feels overtly soft in Comfort and Normal modes, which is fine when you are crawling in rush hour, but up the pace a bit on even a slightly smooth road, and you’ll find the EQE SUV tends to wallow and feel floaty. In Sport mode, the suspension tightens nicely to give a more settled ride, which is what you want on the highway. Wallows at speed because of soft suspension. Two areas where the EQE SUV stands out are performance and range, and both are interlinked because, with great range, you can enjoy the performance without keeping an eye on the SOC meter. Plant your foot down, and this big and heavy SUV lunges forward with an intensity that can take you aback but in a very pleasing way. The EQE SUV gathers with velvet smoothness, and before you know it, you’ve sailed past the speed limit. On the Mumbai-Pune expressway, which is now infested with speed cameras, it is hard not to get a speeding ticket. To stay out of trouble, I limit my indulgence to short jabs of the accelerator pedal just to enjoy all the 408hp and 858Nm of torque that puts most IC engine SUVs to shame. I averaged 66kph on the 140km drive to BU Bhandari, which is pretty good if you consider that this included slow, non-expressway sections. Not that the expressway raises your average speed dramatically because with so many cameras staring at you, I’m forced to show a lot of restraint! With 332km range left, I didn’t need to use the Pune Mercedes dealers’ on-site 180kW fast charger, but it’s good to know that it’s there and that the dealership is happy to let non-Merc owners plug in as well. Located just off the Pune bypass, it’s an incredibly convenient place for EVs on a long-distance trip to Mahabaleshwar or beyond to quickly top up their batteries. Phenomenal range eliminates range anxiety. The return journey was equally uneventful. Using the regen down the Lonavala Ghat, I could extend the range even further, which, on this round trip, I calculated to be 504km. That is a truly impressive figure, considering how hard I was driving the EQE SUV. In fact, there was enough charge left in the battery (36 percent) for me to make another trip to Pune! The other area where the EQE SUV shines is refinement. The EQE SUV is not just quiet; it’s like being inside a luxury vault on wheels. The adaptive air suspension noiselessly glides over any surface, and then there’s the acoustic insulation, which Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Road, tyre and wind noises, even the electric motor’s faint whir, are gone. The cabin is like a calm oasis, and that’s what makes the EQE SUV special. It is luxury in its most serene form.
