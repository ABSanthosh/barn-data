    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/next-lamborghini-urus-keep-hybrid-power-ev-delayed",
    "description": "Decision is down to ever-changing regulations, says CEO Stephan Winkelmann, which may also delay Lanzador EV The Lamborghini Urus will continue as a plug-in hybrid for its next generation after the electric variant was pushed back to the middle of the next decade, CEO Stephan Winkelmann has told Autocar. Winkelmann blamed the decision on the unpredictability of ever-changing regulations – something that may also delay the arrival of the car maker’s first EV, a production version of the Lanzador concept that is due to be launched in 2029. The Urus, Lamborghini’s best-selling model, was due to go fully electric for its next generation before the end of the decade – a plan announced when the Urus went hybrid-only in 2024. However, speaking to Autocar, Winkelmann has confirmed that the Urus will now continue in SE plug-in-hybrid form for an all-new generation.  “We want to have a new generation again as a plug-in hybrid,” he said. “This is something very important for us and for the customers. And they were very happy to hear about this.” He suggested this car would arrive in 2029, with the electric variant pencilled in for 2035 – the year all new cars on sale in Europe will need to produce zero emissions. He gave no technical details but it is most likely to build on the current model’s 789bhp output – the SUV’s most powerful iteration to date, which draws power from a hybridised V8 set-up. Lamborghini’s decision to keep the Urus PHEV on sale follows the move by Volkswagen Group sibling Porsche to continue selling the current ICE-powered Cayenne – a twin of the Urus – alongside the incoming EV in a profitability push as customer interest in electric cars stagnates. Asked if the electric Urus could be launched earlier than 2035 and, like the Cayenne, be sold alongside the third-generation ICE SUV, Winkelman said: “Now we [have] decided for the next generation, we have enough time to see what is happening in terms of acceptance, in terms of regulations, and in terms of infrastructure and, last but not least, also terms of generational change.” While the next Cayenne will be a heavily facelifted version of the current car, the new Urus will be an all-new generation, said Winkelman, so it is expected to arrive with a fresh design. Asked what we could expect, he said: “Future car designs are not yet fixed.” By the time the electric Urus arrives, it will be the second EV in Lamborghini’s stable. Winkelmann reiterated that “by the end of this decade should be the right timing” for the production version of the Lanzador, but he added that a decision on whether or not to delay it will be made at the start of next year. The car is currently due in 2029 after it was pushed back last year from 2028. “We still have seven months of window to decide what to do next,” he said. “We are very flexible and we are constantly thinking when it should be. \"We already postponed the car, because we saw that the adoption curve of the electrification around the globe is [under] the forecast we had a couple of years ago.” However, discussing reasons for the possible delay, he said: “Life cycles are becoming shorter due to a lot of new regulations coming in each and every year. This is making our life more complex.\"",

    "description": "Aston Martin, Hyundai and MG are among the brands making a splash at this year's Festival of Speed The Goodwood Festival of Speed (10-13 July) is taking place this week and looks set to be one of the highlights of the motoring year. It will host big reveals from Lanzante, Hyundai, MG and plenty more besides, as well as an array of debuts from Aston Martin, BMW and Honda. Below is our guide to the most important cars at this year's Festival of Speed. Automobili Mignatta Rina This Italian two-seater pays tribute to the sports cars of the 1960s with a striking speedster body, naturally aspirated 5.0-litre V8 and a manual gearbox.  Everything you need to know about the AM Rina Aston Martin DBX S This new performance-focused version of Aston’s luxury SUV outpunches the Ferrari Purosangue, putting out a substantial 717bhp. You'll be able to see it in the First Glance paddock at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin DBX S Aston Martin Valhalla The Festival of Speed will be your first chance to catch Aston Martin’s new 1064bhp hypercar rolling on home turf. Production of the Valhalla is scheduled to begin imminently. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Valhalla BMW M2 CS BMW’s junior sports car gets the Competition Sport treatment, gaining 50bhp more than the regular M2 and packing a generous 479lb ft. An abundance of carbonfibre also helps to reduce its kerb weight to 1700kg and it dispatches 0-62mph in just 3.8sec. Goodwood will mark the first time it’s been displayed to the public in the UK. Customer deliveries will start at the end of the summer. Everything you need to know about the BMW M2 CS BMW Concept Speedtop Last year’s striking Skytop convertible has been transformed into a svelte shooting brake for a lucky handful of BMW loyalists. It has been conceived as an “intentional counterpoint to our current models”, according to BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk, and is set to make limited production. This may be your only chance to catch one in the metal before they disappear into collections. Everything you need to know about the BMW Concept Speedtop BMW Vision Driving Experience Four motors, five downforce-producing fans and 13,269lb ft of torque: the Vision Driving Experience is BMW’s manifesto for driving enjoyment in the electric age. The firm's performance machines will still be rear-biased, for example, and they will use control electronics that can respond 10 times more quickly than those fitted to previous-generation M cars. This car will make its first UK appearance at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the BMW Vision Driving Experience Denza B5  BYD's premium offshoot is going after the Land Rover Defender with the new B5, a body-on-frame 4x4 with a 677bhp plug-in-hybrid powertrain. It will make its debut at the Festival of Speed, ahead of sales beginning next year. Everything you need to know about the Denza B5 Denza Z9 GT The first Denza model to arrive in Europe, the Z9 GT rivals the Porsche Panamera and its electric counterpart, the Taycan. It is available with the choice of an 858bhp plug-in hybrid powertrain or a 952bhp battery-electric set-up.  Read our Denza Z9 GT review Eccentrica Diablo restomod Described by its maker as the ultimate Diablo, this restomod intends to unleash the potential of Lamborghini’s famously tetchy flagship. Its chassis has been reinforced with carbonfibre, the brakes overhauled, traction control added and the V12 tweaked with new camshafts and springs. It has also received a redesign, with ‘pop-down’ headlights, flared wings and exposed exhaust pipes. It will take to the Goodwood hillclimb, marking the first time it will have been seen in action. Ferrari 296 Speciale Billed by Ferrari as the \"most fun-to-drive, emotionally charged\" car it has built to date, the 296 Speciale brings a swathe of upgrades compared with the existing GTB. Power is up by 49bhp, downforce is improved by 20% and it's 60kg lighter than the GTB. That's thanks in part to kit taken from the new F80 hypercar, such as its aluminium pistons and titanium conrods. The Festival of Speed marks your first chance to see one in the UK. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari 296 Speciale Ferrari Amalfi The new Amalfi replaces the Roma, bringing a fresh design and the promise of more accessible performance. It will break cover in public for the first time at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari Amalfi Ferrari F80 The LaFerrari's successor is virtually a Le Mans hypercar for the road, taking components from the marque's 499P racer to put out 1184bhp. Priced from £3 million and limited to 799 examples – all sold – it will run up the Goodwood hillclimb course. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari F80 GMA T33 Gordon Murray previously used the Goodwood Members’ Meeting to unveil the T33, but now is the general public’s chance to see it in the metal. Priced from £1.37 million and positioned as a more practical foil to the T50, it too packs a naturally aspirated V12, here kicking out 607bhp and revving out to 11,100rpm. Just 100 will be built, although there will be spin-off models, such as a Spider and a more aggressive, track-focused S variant. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 GMA T33 Spider Weighing just 18kg more than its coupé counterpart, the T33 Spider promises a more visceral experience, thanks to its Targa-style roof and air intake scoop positioned just proud of the roll bar. It will be on display to the general public for the first time at this year’s Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 Spider Honda 0 Series SUV This blocky MPV-like SUV serves as our first look at Honda’s rebirth for the electric age. Named the 0 Series to represent the brand starting afresh, it ushers in a dramatic new look and promises major developments in both efficiency and practicality. The Festival of Speed will mark its first appearance in Europe. Everything you need to know about the Honda 0 Series SUV Honda Civic Type R Ultimate One of our favourite hot hatches is about to bow out, but not before receiving a special-edition variant commemorating its 28-year production run. It’s painted in the Type R’s signature Championship White shade, with contrasting red racing stripes recalling its trademark interior colour. Only 40 will be built, of which a quarter are bound for the UK. Goodwood may just be your best chance to see one before they’re all gone. Everything you need to know about the Honda Civic Type R Ultimate Honda Prelude Honda’s sporting coupé returns with Civic underpinnings, a 181bhp hybrid powertrain and even a simulated sequential gearbox. The production car isn’t due until later this year, but Goodwood will be the first chance to spot it on the move, as it takes to the hillclimb. Everything you need to know about the Honda Prelude Honda Super EV Concept Honda will unveil its vision of a small, fun-to-drive EV at the Festival of Speed. Named the Super EV Concept, it previews a rival for the Hyundai Inster and Fiat 500e, and has already been tested in the UK.  Everything you need to know about the Honda Super EV Concept Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Hyundai will at last reveal the hot Ioniq 6 N at this year’s Festival of Speed, having hinted at the model since it unveiled the RN22e concept car three years ago. The car will bring major styling tweaks such as a huge rear spoiler, wider arches and a more aggressive-looking front fascia and it is likely to use the same 641bhp powertrain as the existing Ioniq 5 N. Everything you need to know about the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Jaecoo 5 This Range Rover Evoque rival will be the second car in Jaecoo's UK line-up, bringing a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Full technical details be revealed at the Festival of Speed, where the 5 will make its debut. Everything you need to know about the Jaecoo 5 Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition This special-edition Defender harks back to Land Rover’s Camel Trophy 4x4s, with chunky steelie-style wheels, a choice of Sandy Yellow or Forest Green paintwork and even the option of an intake snorkel. It will be seen in public for the first time at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition Lanzante 95-59 Petersfield-based hypercar specialist Lanzante will reveal its first bespoke model at the Festival of Speed.

Everything you need to know about the Lanzante 95-59 Maserati launch Maserati will make a \"highly anticipated world debut\" at the Festival of Speed. It has yet to confirm what it will unveil but a preview image appears to show the rear haunch of an MC20, suggesting it may be a new variant of its V6-powered supercar.  McLaren W1 McLaren's striking new flagship picks up the mantle from the P1 and F1 with an electrified 4.0-litre V8 that sends 1258bhp to its rear wheels. Just 399 examples will be built. Everything you need to know about the McLaren W1 MG Cyberster Black This special-edition roadster matches deep-black paintwork with chrome accents. Read our MG Cyberster review MG CyberX A boxy 4x4, this radical concept car hints at MG’s plans to expand into new segments and punch upmarket. The Festival of Speed will host its European debut and could bring more news about any plans to build the model. Everything we know about the MG CyberX MG/IM IM6 MG will reveal a new model at Goodwood and it looks to be one of several models from Audi-rivalling sibling brand IM. Their arrival in the UK would mark a shift in MG’s strategy, boldly taking the brand into new segments and away from its previous budget-focused positioning. Everything we know about the MG/IM reveal Praga Bohema This track-focused but road-legal supercar will take to the Goodwood hillclimb in a bid to topple some of the world’s biggest marques. Packing 700bhp and weighing just 982kg, it’s in with a fair chance. Everything we know about the Praga Bohema Renault 5 Turbo 3E Renault's tribute to the original 5 Turbo is every bit as ludicrous, employing a pair of rear-mounted in-wheel motors for a combined output of 533bhp. It is priced from £140,000 and 1980 examples will be built, in reference to the original 5 Turbo's launch year. A static design model will be displayed at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the Renault 5 Turbo 3E Toyota GR reveal  Toyota’s GR performance division is gearing up for a big reveal at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July. Speaking to Autocar recently, Toyota Europe vice-president Andrea Carlucci said “the UK is the most amazing country in terms of pure car lovers, even more than other countries” and he is “attached to Goodwood”. He added: “This year, you will see something – let’s put it like that.” Carlucci declined to disclose further details but said: “We have to bring [many] more cars as GR models to the marketplace and I hope the UK will bring as many as [it] wants.”",

But ask any seasoned rider who’s gone down at speed—your hands are often the first things to hit the pavement. So choosing the right motorcycle gloves isn’t just about comfort or aesthetics. Motorcycle gloves have evolved far beyond stitched leather and knuckle padding. Today’s market is awash with everything from featherweight motocross mitts to carbon-laced gauntlets pulled straight from the MotoGP paddock. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the options, you’re not alone. Why Gloves Matter Let’s start with the basics. Your hands are vulnerable, and not just in a crash.

There have been countless songs, poems, and paintings romanticizing their exploits; however, it was often lonely and treacherous work. These conditions are not unfamiliar to the modern motorcycle rider. Unlike the cowboys of the past, modern technology arms the savvy traveler with new levels of comfort, but a shelter that is good for one rider may not be the best option for another. While adventure bikes and baggers have more storage space, some motorcycles require more creative solutions. Regardless of what you ride, size and packability are key factors, not to mention an honest assessment of how much you’re willing to rough it on the road.…",

    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "A weekend escape in our long-term Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 4MATIC SUV was long overdue. No long termer of ours truly earns its stripes until it’s taken for a run up into the hills. And the Mumbai-Mahabaleshwar drive is nothing short of a trial by fire when it comes to real-world range. I’m happy to report that the big Merc absolutely aced it. Standard operating procedure is to top up our EV long termers at the Autocar India HQ on the 22kW AC charger before heading out. With the battery showing 99 percent, I was good to go. Within seven minutes, I was already on the lower entry ramp to the Atal Setu. This marvel of a bridge has been operational for over a year now, but I still find myself marvelling at how it has transformed the drive out of Mumbai. It’s dramatically reduced the journey time to Mahabaleshwar too – the drive took just three and a half hours! Phenomenal range makes road trips easy. The real highlight, though, was how effortlessly the EQS 450 devoured the kilometres. There was no need for hypermiling, no range anxiety, and absolutely no drama. At the base of the Ambenali ghat, 197km in, the state of charge still read a reassuring 48 percent. That gave me the confidence to push harder on the climb, which, admittedly, did eat up 22 percent of charge over the 30km ascent. Still, I rolled into Mahabaleshwar with 26 percent remaining – more than enough buffer. The return leg was even more impressive. I took the longer route back via Pune, with a detour through Wai that added nearly 50km. But thanks to a healthy dose of regeneration on the descent from 4,500 feet, I arrived back at base with a staggering 55 percent charge remaining after 320km of normal driving – and by that I mean no pussyfooting. That puts the real-world range at around 730km; downhill advantage, yes, but that’s exceptional for a car this size. Refinement levels are outstanding. Of course, efficiency like this doesn’t happen by chance. The EQS SUV’s design may not win over fans of traditional SUV styling – it’s more blob than brawn – but there’s serious aerodynamic intent behind its teardrop silhouette. Every curve and contour is tuned to cheat the wind, and it pays off handsomely in terms of range. It might lack visual ruggedness, but its slipperiness delivers where it counts. Inside, the EQS 450 continues to impress. The cabin is whisper-quiet, with barely any wind or tyre noise making its way in. On long road trips, that level of hush makes a huge difference. It’s genuinely relaxing – almost like travelling in a soundproof lounge. Brakes need better bite and stopping power. That said, it’s not without flaws. The brakes need work. The pedal lacks bite, and stopping power just doesn’t feel strong enough. You often find yourself relying heavily on regen to slow this 2,840kg SUV down, especially on steep descents. And while the air suspension does a decent job most of the time, it doesn’t always feel settled over broken surfaces, particularly on patchy sections of the NH66. Even in Sport mode, there’s noticeable vertical movement that takes away from the sense of composure. Lots of body movement can be felt on uneven roads. Charging in Mahabaleshwar wasn’t a problem, though it wasn’t quick either. I used a 3.3kW portable charger I keep at the house (bought online), which turned out to be twice as fast as the official 3.3kW 15A unit that, for some reason, wouldn’t go beyond 1.9kW. Even so, a full charge took 36 hours, but given that Mahabaleshwar is my hibernation zone, it suited the pace perfectly. So, what’s the takeaway? The EQS 450 4MATIC SUV may not fit the mould of a traditional luxury SUV, but it delivers where it matters most for an EV – range and refinement. It’s not without its quirks, but as a long-distance electric cruiser, it’s deeply impressive. This is the kind of machine that redefines the EV road trip, and does it with remarkable ease.

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "A few weeks ago, we reported that Kinetic Green had filed a design patent for what appeared to be a 21st-century electric reincarnation of the original Kinetic Honda DX scooter. Now this very scooter has been spotted testing, and there are some interesting details to talk about. Kinetic Honda DX to be revived as an EV, launch likely soon Has a boxy styling faithful to the original KiHo scooter Uses a hub-mounted motor and front disc brake New Kinetic electric scooter spotted testing It uses bodywork and wheels that remind one of the original KiHo scooter from the ’90s From these images, it is crystal clear that the design of this upcoming electric scooter will be a boxy one and will bear more than a passing resemblance to the original Kinetic Honda DX. The boxy headlight, as well as the rest of the panels, all point to that fact.  One interesting little detail that can be made out is that this particular test mule has red bodywork that’s peeking out from underneath all that camouflaged stickering. One neat touch is that the seat has red stitching, which leads us to believe that this could be offered on other colour options of the scooter as well.  Coming to the mechanical bits that can be seen, we can make out a hub-mounted motor, a front disc brake, a twin shock absorber setup, a centre stand and what appear to be 12-inch wheels at both ends. The hub-mounted motor suggests that performance is likely to be modest, perhaps somewhere in the iQube/Chetak ballpark.  Considering that this test mule has no rough edges or exposed wiring, we believe that this Kinetic electric scooter is in its final stages of development. It remains to be seen where this EV ends up in the market, but going by what we’ve seen in these images, it is likely to be a practical, family-centric offering. Given that Kinetic Green today doesn’t have as much brand equity in the electric scooter space and that other more established brands have been present for longer, we expect this new scooter to be priced at around Rs 1 lakh (ex-showroom) when it launches, which will likely be in the next couple of months, perhaps around the festive season.  Also See: Hero Vida VX2 electric scooter launched at Rs 59,490",

    "description": "A three-row derivative of the Renault Duster was recently spied testing in India. Likely to be called 'Boreal', as teased by Renault in April this year, this upcoming C-segment SUV is due for a global unveiling on July 10. As per Sylvia dos Santos from Renault's marketing department, the name Boreal comes from Boreas, the God of wind in Greek mythology, and it also means north wind in Latin. The SUV may share its powertrains with the Duster Gets B-pillar mounted door handles, a prominent roof spoiler with raised ends Though unconfirmed, it could be a rebadged version of the Dacia Bigster, which is currently sold in international markets. For those not in the know, Romania-headquartered Dacia is owned by the Renault Group. Renault Duster three row SUV: spy shot details Thick body cladding all around Both the front and rear bumpers have a chunky design, and thick cladding is present all around. Also notable are the LED DRLs, pull-type handles for the front doors and B-pillar-mounted handles for the rear doors, thick roof rails and a prominent spoiler with raised ends. The Renault SUV will most likely match the Dacia Bigster’s dimensions – 4,570mm in length, 1,810mm in width, and 1,710mm in height – and sit on a 2,700mm wheelbase. The upcoming Renault SUV's LED DRL is hidden by heavy camo. As for the interior, not a lot could be seen apart from a central touchscreen unit in landscape orientation, possibly 10.1 inches. The Duster and its larger sibling will be manufactured at Renault’s Chennai plant for both domestic and export markets. Renault Duster three row SUV: powertrain May share engine options with the Duster SUV UK-spec Duster's engine. (Used for representation only) It might share its powertrains with the Duster, which is going to have a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and a strong hybrid option as well; a naturally-aspirated petrol motor may also be offered. Further, manual and automatic transmissions are anticipated. CNG may also be on the cards for the three-row vehicle, but an all-wheel drive system is unlikely, as it may not be cost-effective. Renault Duster three row SUV: India launch, rivals Likely in 2026 Renault may introduce the three-row SUV a few months after launching the Duster SUV in early 2026. While the Dacia Bigster has been revealed as a 5-seater with a very large boot in markets abroad, the Renault equivalent is expected to be sold as a 7-seater in India. It will slot above the Duster and rival the Hyundai Alcazar, Tata Safari, Mahindra XUV700 and MG Hector Plus.  IMAGE CREDIT: TURBOSTART-L7X VIA YOUTUBE.
