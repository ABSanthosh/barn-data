    "description": "ID cars will get a new look \"going back to where we came from\" VW R\u0026D boss confirms cull for combustion car range, plus Polo refresh and when it will show ID 2 SUV Volkswagen will launch heavily updated versions of its ID models from 2026 as part of a significant upgrade to the MEB architecture on which they are based. VW R\u0026D boss Kai Grünitz confirmed the developments to Autocar at the LA motor show, along with the launch of a new ID 2 SUV concept car at the 2025 Munich motor show, a 2025 revamp for the Polo, a slimming down of the brand’s combustion engined range when EU7 emissions regulations kick in next year, and the role Rivian would play in the development of future VWs.  Grünitz said the “huge improvements” from 2026 to the current ID range would include an all-new look that is “going back to where we came from”, as well as improvements in battery costs and overall performance and new functionality. The look of the new ID models is set to be inspired by the ID 2all concept car, which presents design boss Andreas Mindt’s vision for the future of VW designs that is altogether friendlier and inspired by the likes of great Golf models from the past. Grünitz said this look would be more akin “to what Volkswagen stands for” from a design perspective, and along with the production version of the ID 2all itself will be a moment where there’s a big visual leap for VW as part of company boss Thomas Schafer’s desire to make VW a “loved brand” again. Grünitz confirmed that development of the production version of the VW ID 2all concept car remained on track for a late 2025/early 2026 launch. He said that it would be the “starting point” for this new era for VW, “because customers will see there has been a change, and a much bigger change than expected”. An SUV variant of the ID 2 will also be previewed at the Munich motor show in September 2025, Grünitz confirmed, as the second VW model to be built off the MEB Entry architecture. A GTI version of the ID 2 is also planned and has been previewed by a concept car, and Grünitz said that it was “easy” to add performance to electric cars but less so to add “DNA” with the likes of GTI of what has made Golf GTIs great in the past. However, Grünitz said the firm had “ideas that you’ll be surprised” by when the first electric GTI launches in 2026.  Development of the SSP (Scalable Systems Platform) is also continuing, said Grünitz, this electric car base is considered the most significant long-term architecture for the Volkswagen Group in being able to underpin everything from city cars to supercars.  The joint venture launched last week with Rivian was significant for SSP, as VW would tap into Rivian’s experience in electric architectures which Grünitz said were particularly advanced and “best in class” for over the air software updates. “They are much leaner and faster than traditional OEMs. They're closer to what we see in China. We combine that with our knowledge of building cars to high quality standards, so I think this is a good combination.” Upcoming EU7 emissions would result in a “line-up that’s slimmer than today”, said Grünitz, although it would also bring with it more mild hybrid options. He didn’t confirm which models would disappear but did say the Polo wouldn’t be one of them, and it would receive an extensive update at the same time. More broadly, Grünitz said investing in parallel architectures like the MQB for combustion engined models and MEB for electric ones was “a huge effort”, but there was no end date for the MQB architecture as electric car uptake had not been as predicted. Indeed, Grünitz said that it was possible the firm could integrate electric powertrains into it once again as part of the options on the table for its development. VW’s sales and marketing boss Martin Sander said that ultimately “it was better for customers” to have dedicated architectures for the different technologies but as the firm looked to “the next generation, we have to find a very smart way of keeping [individual] features, but also using components across the platforms in intelligent way”.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/kia-ev6-gt-updated-641bhp-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-powertrain",
    "description": "Outgoing EV6 GT packs 576bhp and 545lb ft Brand’s hottest car will receive an overhaul inside and out, thanks in part to its Hyundai sibling The hot Kia EV6 GT will be updated with the powertrain from the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, bringing a significant increase in power.  The dual-motor, four-wheel drive set-up puts out 601bhp and 545lb ft of torque in normal operation, but this temporarily increases to 641bhp and 568lb ft when the car’s GT drive mode is selected. This is up from the 576bhp and 545lb ft of the outgoing EV6 GT. Kia has yet to clarify how this affects the car’s straight-line performance, but it will doubtless improve on the outgoing car’s 0-62mph sprint time of 3.5sec. For reference, Hyundai claims that the Ioniq 5 N takes 3.4sec. The new EV6 GT also gets the simulated automatic gearbox used in the Ioniq 5 N and its bigger sibling, the Kia EV9 GT. This emulates the gearing and power delivery of a combustion-engined performance car, limiting torque and changing the sound played through the speakers according to the ‘engine’ revs and gear. It can be operated in a conventional automatic mode (and disabled entirely for a more typical electric driving experience), or it can be manually operated using paddles behind the steering wheel. As well as extra power and tactility, the new EV6 GT gets a larger 84kWh battery pack, up from 77kWh in the outgoing model. That should improve its range slightly from the previous car’s official rating of 263 miles between charges. Kia has yet to release pictures of the new EV6 GT, but it is expected to receive the same styling tweaks that the milder variants of the electric crossover got earlier this year. That means a revised look inspired by the EV3, EV5 and EV9, plus an updated interior with a new three-spoke steering wheel. It’s expected to arrive in the UK early next year, with prices likely to represent a slight increase compared with the outgoing EV6. For reference, that car started at £62,675.",

    "description": "A motorcycle like the 1974 Ducati 750SS simply couldn’t be manufactured and sold today, and it’s a small miracle that it even passed in the 1970s. A barely homologated version of Ducati’s Desmo L-twin road racer, the 750SS was finicky, raw and probably illegal for road use in most places with its fiberglass fuel tank, Conti megaphones and unfiltered 40 mm Dell’Orto pumper carburetors. Just 401 examples were built from late 1973 into 1974, and these ‘green frame’ 750s are regarded as one of the most significant and desirable production Ducatis ever built. The story has been told time and time again, about how Paul Smart and Bruno Spaggiari accomplished a legendary 1-2 finish at the inaugural Imola 200 in 1972, catapulting Ducati to new heights globally.…",

    "description": "The Indian monsoon is nothing to be trifled with when it comes to waterproof gear, so a little before its onset this year, I purchased the Viaterra P300 waterproof liner. I’ve used enough Viaterra products by now to know that they work as intended, which is why I splurged on the P300. There are more affordable rain liners from Viaterra if you’re on a tight budget. Wearing a rain liner over an armoured riding jacket is cumbersome – there’s no two ways about it. But the P300 eases things to quite an extent. For example, the cuffs are nice and wide, enough so that even if I’m wearing my Grid full-gauntlet gloves, my hand can also slip through without a second thought. Then, there is the inner mesh lining, which helps with comfort as it lets the P300 slide over your jacket instead of bunching up in areas. It also makes the rain jacket easier to get on and off. But by far, the most helpful feature is the zipped vents on the front of the jacket. I’ve found that even in the heaviest of downpours, it’s best for my comfort to keep them fully open, and since there is a Velcro closure that keeps the top and bottom of the zip closed, there’s no water ingress at all. Vents allow good airflow, and the zipper is easy to use. In fact, I remember using this exact trick when I was efficiency-testing the Bajaj Freedom CNG bike at slow-moving Mumbai city speeds for nearly three hours with the P300 on in the pouring rain, and I remember being pleasantly surprised by the airflow that was allowed through to me. This is what makes it worth the extra money for me. My only gripe is that this jacket is slightly shorter at the front, which Viaterra has done to prevent the jacket from bunching and pooling water. On the one hand, Rishaad liked this feature in his P300, but I found that the bottom two inches of my riding jacket got wet in continuous heavy rain. Perhaps the next iteration can have a slight increase in the length. Another point is that the hood is removable, which is a great feature, but it would be nice if there was a pocket or some provision in the jacket to store it. At Rs 2,499, the Viaterra P300 is the most expensive of the made-in-India rain liners, but after staying dry as well as reasonably cool for this past monsoon, I can confidently say it’s well worth the investment.

    "description": "The newest entrant in the compact SUV space is the Mahindra XUV 3XO, which builds on the strengths of its predecessor, the XUV300, and ups its desirability quotient on account of a new interior, more features and an overall fresher design language. Mahindra’s changes seem to have paid off, as the 3XO has been well received by the market, with waiting periods on the rise. We put the diesel manual version through our real-world tests and, for perspective, compare it to the Tata Nexon diesel – one of the best-sellers in the segment – to find out which is better. The XUV 3XO’s squat stance, larger 17-inch alloys and connected LED tail-lamps give it a more premium look than the 300. However, certain design elements could come across as overdone to some. The Nexon’s sharper styling – the distinct Tata family look, coupé-like roofline and harmonious curves – lends it a more modern look. While both cars are similar in dimensions, the XUV 3XO’s wheelbase is much longer, which translates into more cabin room (more on that later). The Nexon sits slightly higher above the ground with a clearance of 208mm versus the XUV’s 201mm.   Mahindra XUV 3XO interior and seating The XUV 3XO’s cabin certainly looks more upmarket, thanks to a generous use of bright colours and a segment-first panoramic sunroof. Furthermore, soft-touch materials on the dashboard and door cards, as well as the dimpled, leather-wrapped steering, feel high quality – the overall fit and finish are top-notch. On the whole, the Mahindra’s cabin makes you feel like you’ve spent your money well, although it will require more effort to keep clean. Narrow seat, limited thigh support on offer in the Mahindra. The cabin fares well in terms of user-friendliness, too – ergonomics are agreeable, storage areas are well-defined, and the use of proper buttons and knobs makes things easier to use on the move. The driver’s seat, however, isn’t very comfy due to a snug backrest, inadequate thigh support and a cramped footwell, leaving no room for a dead pedal. XUV's longer wheelbase liberates more room. The rear seat experience is much better, though, with a broader seat, a comfier backrest angle and an overall greater sense of space than the Nexon. The shoulder room is good, too, so three abreast will be an easier fit. However, thigh support for the outer passengers will feel inadequate due to the curvy seat base design. What’s nice is that even the middle occupant gets a three-point seat belt as well as an adjustable head restraint. Three abreast comfier here; adjustable headrests, 3-point seat belts for all.   Tata Nexon interior and seating Shifting focus to the Nexon, the dark-coloured cabin hampers its sense of roominess and makes it appear a lot smaller, at least visually. The dashboard sports some modern-looking bits like a floating touchscreen, two-spoke steering wheel and capacitive touch controls for the HVAC system, but these bits are finished in piano black, which is likely to pick up surface scratches and smudge marks easily. Nexon's firm backrest isn’t very comfy. The Nexon continues to be plagued by ergonomic foibles, such as the inconvenient placement of its USB ports deep in a recess and the awkwardly angled bottle holders in the door. The buttons on the thick-rimmed steering protrude out a fair bit, and a wireless charging pad has replaced the front cup holders. Supportive seating in the Nexon, though contoured for two. The front seats have a ventilation function, but the seats are about as narrow as the 3XO’s. Knee and legroom at the rear are tighter, and even though there isn’t any dearth of shoulder room, its back seat seems to be designed to accommodate just two adults, as the thick, concave side bolsters force the outer passengers inward. Also, the middle passenger will have to make peace with the tall central floor hump and protruding air-con console. Adequate shoulder room, but concave shape is not comfy for outer occupants. In terms of boot space, the Nexon’s is a bit larger than the XUV’s, and its loading lip is higher, too. Interestingly, the 3XO only gets a temporary spare tyre (T135/90 R16), which is one of the reasons its boot space is more than that of its predecessor, which had a larger spare. Also, for an otherwise well-equipped car, the 3XO doesn’t get a parcel shelf as standard; it has to be bought as an accessory.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO has a much lower starting point, with its base variant priced at Rs 9.99 lakh – Rs 1 lakh lower than the Nexon’s. For this comparison, we have the XUV 3XO’s second-from-top AX7 variant priced at Rs 13.69 lakh and the Nexon’s fully loaded Fearless +S DT variant, which costs Rs 14.70 lakh. The Nexon’s Fearless variant is priced at Rs 13.70 lakh, but it misses the JBL sound system and the sunroof. The Mahindra also gets a fully loaded AX7 L variant priced at Rs 14.99 lakh, which adds ADAS, a 360-degree camera and an electronic parking brake. Excellent fit and finish and high-quality materials used in the cabin; Wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto didn’t work in test car; Bright colours, large sunroof elevate the cabin’s appeal; Footwell is too cramped in an otherwise user-friendly cabin. The Mahindra doesn’t get ventilated front seats, which the Nexon offers, but even this AX7 variant gets 17-inch alloys (vs Nexon’s 16 inchers) and a panoramic sunroof and rear disc brakes, which the Tata doesn’t get. As far as their user experience, user interface and sound systems go, the Nexon certainly has an edge. The touchscreen feels nicer to use, and the JBL speakerssound more immersive and deliver a better aural experience. In our XUV 3XO test vehicle, many features, such as wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, hadn’t been activated. Even the different sound modes didn’t change the audio experience. Performance is stronger, and acceleration times are better, too; Diesel engine sounds gravelly and coarse at all times; The sound quality of the JBL speakers is excellent; Its dark colour scheme hampers the sense of roominess. What worked better, though, were the XUV’s LED headlamps, which illuminated the road more evenly and had a better spread, too. Interestingly, the Nexon’s 360-degree camera is clearer in the day, but in low-light conditions, the XUV’s two reversing lights brighten up the area better. The Nexon’s single reversing light results in a camera feed that isn’t as clear, although it displays a much wider view. Both the cars are powered by 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel engines mated to 6-speed manual transmissions. But that’s where their similarities end. To meet stringent BS6.2 emissions norms, Tata uses a Lean NOx Trap (LNT) and diesel particulate filter (DPF). It is accompanied by the cost-effective Passive Selective Catalytic Reduction that eliminates the need for a urea tank and an injection system, which are a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The XUV 3XO diesel deploys the latter, which is more expensive as it warrants a separate AdBlue tank and other ancillaries. It also needs regular maintenance as owners have to refill the AdBlue tank at fixed intervals, which is an added cost. Right off the bat, the Mahindra’s diesel feels smoother and more refined. Yes, you can hear some diesel clatter at idle, but the engine note isn’t as coarse or as gravelly as the Tata’s. With 117hp and 300Nm, the XUV’s diesel has the numbers in its favour – 2hp and 40Nm more than the Nexon’s. However, its 1,469kg kerb weight makes it 112kg heavier than the Nexon diesel, which negates its advantage on paper. Like other Mahindras, a crisp throttle response lends it a nice feeling of power each time you dab the accelerator. There is some turbo lag below 1,700rpm, but the gush of torque beyond that makes the XUV sail past slower-moving traffic with ease. The Tata’s engine feels stronger, thanks to its lighter kerb weight and more aggressive power delivery. Turbo lag is also managed better, and the drive modes, which transform the way the Nexon behaves, make a significant difference. In ‘Eco’ mode, it feels starved of power in the interest of efficiency. However, dial it to ‘Sport’ mode, and the Nexon sprints forward with gusto. In our tests, both cars were neck and neck when accelerating from 0kph to 100, but in rolling acceleration, the Nexon leaves the XUV trailing by a significant margin in every gear. So, while the Nexon diesel impresses with its performance, refinement isn’t its strong suit. The gravelly diesel note gets progressively louder as you spin this engine harder.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO gets an automatic engine stop-start system to save fuel while idling, whereas the Nexon gets an Eco drive mode to abate fuel consumption. In our real-world test, the Nexon’s 1.5-litre diesel delivered an average fuel efficiency of 18kpl, which is 2.5kpl higher than what the XUV 3XO diesel achieved. In the city, the Nexon bettered the XUV’s number by 3kpl, delivering 16.5kpl. On the highway, the Nexon returned 19.4kpl in our tests, 2kpl better than the Mahindra. Also see: Mahindra XUV 3XO real-world fuel economy tested, explained Tata Nexon real-world fuel economy tested, explained Typical of a Mahindra, the XUV 3XO’s underpinnings feel tough. It soaks up harsh blows from bad roads with an added layer of cushioning, resulting in a plush low-speed ride, although the suspension can get quite loud while at work. At highway speeds, too, the XUV feels planted, and while vertical movement is greater than the Nexon’s, body movements aren’t to the point of feeling uncomfortable. There are steering modes on offer in the XUV 3XO that alter the weight and resistance of the electric power steering, and while ‘Sport’ mode makes the steering unnaturally heavy, ‘Comfort’ feels light and effortless, which is what most users are likely to prefer. While on the topic of user-friendliness, the clutch pedal doesn’t warrant any more effort than the Nexon’s, and even though its gearbox has long throws, it feels smoother and easier to slot into gates. The XUV gets rear disc brakes (the Nexon gets drums at the rear), so despite being 112kg heavier, in our panic braking tests from 80kph to a standstill, it stopped at a shorter distance. XUV’s suspension tackles bad roads with an added layer of cushioning; The Nexon is sportier to drive, and high-speed stability is excellent. The Nexon feels sportier thanks to sharper steering, a tighter chassis and an overall stiffer suspension setup. Its structure feels inherently robust, and it shrugs off bad roads and does so in a quieter manner. What’s also nice is that the Nexon remains glued to the road at highway speeds, and the body roll is well in check. However, since its suspension isn’t as absorbent as the XUV’s, passengers in the Nexon are likely to feel sharp body movements over rough sections of road, especially at city speeds.     The Tata Nexon brings a lot to the table, such as a spacious cabin, a long list of features, and a fantastic infotainment and audio experience. And besides feeling tough, it boasts a 5-star Global NCAP crash-test rating. The 3XO has scored five stars, too. What’s more, the Nexon’s strong diesel engine makes it both quicker and much more fuel-efficient than the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, the XUV 3XO’s diesel engine is far ahead on smoothness and refinement; its driving controls are lighter, and ride quality in the city is plusher. A generous use of bright colours and higher-quality materials make its interiors feel more upmarket, too. Yes, it misses ventilated front seats, a very popular feature these days, but it makes up for it with others like a panoramic sunroof and ADAS (on the AX7 L), for a price very close to the Nexon’s. In summary, while the Nexon has strong fundamentals, it is the Mahindra that feels more polished and upmarket, and that’s why it wins this comparison test.

    "description": "BMW has launched the all-new, seventh-generation M5 in India at Rs 1.99 crore (ex-showroom, India), before options. The new BMW M5 uses a plug-in hybrid V8 powertrain and is the most powerful iteration of the performance sedan yet. However, it sees a significant markup in price compared to the previous generation model, which was launched at Rs 1.62 crore (ex-showroom) in India in 2021. New BMW M5 uses a 727hp, plug-in hybrid V8 Gets adaptive suspension, rear-wheel steering, carbon-fibre roof as standard Can also be driven in electric-only mode for 69km The new M5 is just Rs 4 lakh more expensive than the recently launched Mercedes-AMG C 63 (Rs 1.95 crore), which uses a smaller 2.0-litre, four-cylinder plug-in hybrid engine. The BMW is also a lot more powerful and has a greater electric-only range. BMW M5 powertrain, specs The new BMW M5 retains the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine but now includes an electric motor in the eight-speed automatic transmission, akin to the BMW XM SUV. The engine produces 585hp and 750Nm, with an additional 199hp and 280Nm from the electric motor, resulting in a total system output of 727hp and 100Nm of torque. Power is distributed to all four wheels via BMW’s rear-biased xDrive all-wheel-drive system. It also comes fitted with adaptive suspension and rear-wheel steering as standard. The new M5 can sprint from 0-100kph in 3.5 seconds despite the added weight of the motor and battery, tipping the scales at around 2.5 tonnes – about 500kg heavier than its predecessor. The top speed is limited to 250kph as standard but can be extended to 305kph with the optional M Driver’s Package. Its 18.6kWh battery pack enables an electric-only range of 69km, as per the WLTP cycle. In this mode, the BMW M5 can hit speeds up to 140kph and supports AC charging up to 7.4kW. The powertrain allows for three drive modes – Hybrid, Electric and eControl, the last of which allows brake energy recuperation to maintain battery charge at a constant level.  As standard, the M5 gets M compound brakes, and carbon ceramics are optional. BMW M5 exterior design Compared to the regular 5-Series, the M5 looks a lot more aggressive, thanks to sculpted bumpers and flared wheel arches. Also, unlike the regular sedan, which comes in a long-wheelbase guise in India, the M5 uses a shorter wheelbase and has a much sportier stance. Up front, the grille gets a gloss black surround with an ‘M5’ logo in the centre. The front bumper is sharply chiselled with larger air inlets at the edges and a more pronounced central air dam, which is surrounded by more gloss black trim. The M5 gets redesigned front and rear wheel arches, along with more pronounced sills; there is also an embossed M5 logo on the rear quarter glass area. At the rear, it gets a rear spoiler and a two-section diffuser, with the quad exhausts finished in gloss black jutting out from below. The vertical reflectors positioned at the outer edges of the rear bumper further accentuates the width of the car. The M5 rides on staggered 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels, and a carbon fibre roof is standard fitment. Customers can, however, opt for a panoramic sunroof, although this adds 50kg of additional weight. The mirror caps also come finished in carbon fibre. BMW M5 interior and features Not much has changed on the inside, though. If you’ve been inside the regular 5-Series, the interior will be familiar, with the curved infotainment display screen. It, however, gets a flat-bottomed M-specific steering wheel, M-specific ambient lighting, and M-spec seats with an illuminated M5 logo. The centre console also features some revised switchgear, such as a revised gear lever and a few additional buttons to better suit the needs of the performance sedan. The feature list includes a 14.9-inch touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a head-up display, four-zone automatic climate control, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Surround Sound System, and a wireless charging tray, among others.

    "description": "Mahindra has revealed new details about its upcoming BE 6e and XEV 9e electric SUVs in the latest round of teasers. The all-new models are set to debut on November 26 and will be the first of ‘born EVs’ from the Indian brand. Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e to get 59kWh and 79kWh battery options Claimed 20-80% charge in 20 minutes with a 175kW charger Outputs range from 231hp to 286hp for RWD models Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e battery, charging details As we had reported, both e-SUVs are underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform. Both will also come with the option of 59kWh and 79kWh battery packs with an LFP (Lithium iron phosphate) chemistry. In addition, Mahindra has revealed that using a 175kW DC fast charger, the batteries can charge from 20 percent to 80 percent in just 20 minutes. Mahindra BE 6e, XEV 9e powertrain details The Mahindra BE 6e and XEV 9e will feature what the brand calls a ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ made up of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. The outputs for the motor range between 231hp and 286hp, depending on the application. Do note that these figures are for the rear axle-mounted motor only and that the BE 6e, which is expected to come in AWD form, will have a higher combined output due to the addition of a motor on the front axle. While other details are scarce, the company has said both e-SUVs will get drive modes, a semi-active suspension system and brake-by-wire technology. We already have some info on the interior and exterior of Mahindra’s BE 6e and XEV 9e, and more details on these models will be revealed closer to their debut on November 26. Stay tuned.

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",
