    "description": "This 2003 Lamborghini Murciélago is a left-hand-drive, non-US-market coupe that spent years in Japan before it was brought to Canada in December 2024. It is reported that just 985 first-generation Murciélago coupes were ordered with a gated manual transmission, and this car has 38k kilometers (~24k miles). Finished in Arancio Atlas over Nero Perseus leather with orange stitching, the car is powered by a 6.2-liter V12. Equipment includes LP-style lower bodywork and taillights, an aftermarket exhaust system, a front-axle lift system, 18\" Hermera wheels, an aftermarket carbon-fiber rear wing, air conditioning, and an aftermarket Pioneer stereo with a back-up camera. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this Murciélago is now offered in Canada at no reserve with a clean British Columbia registration.",

    "description": "Motorcycle dealer build-offs are a great way for brands to showcase their bikes, and for bike dealers to flex their customization muscles. But there’s a catch. Once the competition is over, those dealers often need to sell the bikes they built to recoup costs—so it pays to balance style and usability. This BMW R12 nineT street tracker rides that line deftly. It was built by Unikat Motorworks for their local BMW dealership in Wrocław, as part of BMW Poland’s custom build contest. Even though the workshop had free rein on the project, practicality was always front of mind. “This is a pure custom build—one that’s visually striking, but also remains highly functional,” says Unikat co-owner, Michał Pamuła. “And we think that’s an often overlooked advantage in the world of competition customs, where bikes need to find new homes after the contest—and continue to bring joy, not just from their looks.”…",

    "description": "Michelangelo famously said, “I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.” I’ve long suspected that Yuichi Yoshizawa applies a similar philosophy to building custom motorcycles. The frontman of the Japanese workshop CW Zon has the ability to take even the most mundane motorcycle, stare into its soul, and turn it into something magical. This time, he’s done it to the venerable 1981 Yamaha XV1000. Known as the TR1 in some markets and the Virago in others, the XV1000 featured an oddball combination of Japanese engineering and American sensibilities. It now enjoys regular attention from custom builders—but there are only so many ways you can spin it. Unsurprisingly, Yoshizawa-san’s Yamaha XV1000 looks like no other custom Virago out there.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/range-rover-electric-fresh-pictures-ahead-suvs-arrive-later-year",
    "description": "Land Rover brand's first EV is pictured testing in extreme conditions as it approaches launch The new Range Rover Electric has completed a second round of winter testing ahead of its launch. Key aspects put to the test included the EV's new thermal management system: how well it could heat the cabin and maintain rapid-charging performance in extreme sub-zero temperatures. The prototypes also faced high-angle inclines and declines on frozen surfaces, testing that their one-pedal driving modes (using the motors' regenerative effect to slow and stop the car while off the throttle) work across a range of terrains. \"Rigorous testing procedures in extreme and unpredictable conditions like those experienced in Arjeplog [Sweden] are crucial to Range Rover Electric's real-world reliability and resilience,\" said JLR product engineering chief Thomas Müller. JLR has also confirmed that the Range Rover Electric uses a 117kWh battery pack designed and assembled in-house, comprising 344 prismatic cells and running at 800V. The firm has yet to detail a range figure, but such a large capacity should comfortably yield more than 300 miles between charges. The winter testing comes after prototypes were last year driven in the UAE in temperatures approaching 50deg C. They were sent up Big Red, a 300ft sand dune in the heart of Sharjah’s Al Badayer desert, to test the EV’s new Intelligent Torque Management system, which replaces a conventional ABS-based traction control system. This is claimed to improve traction control off road by diverting power to each electric motor to reduce torque reaction time from around 100 milliseconds to as little as one millisecond. JLR says, after five continuous attempts, none of the cars demonstrated any fall in performance.  Müller said: “A hot climate is one of the most challenging for any battery-electric vehicle, because of the need to cool the cabin and optimise battery performance at the same time.  “The additional challenge of driving on sand requires controlled low-speed torque, so our specially developed traction control and thermal management systems work in harmony to ensure power delivery is unaffected.  “Our tests have shown that in this climate, repeatedly driving the equivalent of 100 metres uphill on fine sand, Range Rover Electric matches the performance of its ICE equivalents; in some instances, even surpassing them – thanks to the introduction of these new features.” Like the cars pictured in the Arctic Circle, these Range Rover EV mules are  shown completely uncamouflaged – a decision made to \"underline the build quality of the initial prototypes\", according to JLR. Painted all in black and without the contrasting matt trim elements that JLR has previously suggested will mark out the EV powertrain, the prototype looks all but identical to the ICE Range Rover that has been on sale since 2022. JLR said this shows how the prototype's \"modernist design language stays true to the Range Rover bloodline\", suggesting that the Range Rover Electric – as it is officially named – will only be subtly differentiated from the straight-six, V8 and plug-in hybrid derivatives.  JLR previously highlighted that this is the first car to use a battery and electric drive unit assembled in-house. Although bosses have yet to give any performance details for the new Range Rover, it has been promised to have the same “go-anywhere” capability as the ICE version, with a pledge that it will offer towing, wading and all-terrain capability that will exceed any other luxury electric SUV – including the ability to wade through 850mm-deep water. The hint that the Range Rover Electric will offer performance “comparable” to the existing V8 suggests a total output close to the 523bhp that model offers. It's expected to adopt a dual-motor system, which will allow for greater four-wheel-drive ability and systems such as torque vectoring to boost its off-road potential.  JLR said its test programme has been adapted to particularly examine the vehicle’s underfloor, battery durability and thermal derating.  The Range Rover Electric will be built in Solihull alongside the existing mild-hybrid and PHEV versions. It will initially use batteries from a third-party supplier before eventually switching to packs produced in the new Somerset gigafactory that JLR parent firm Tata is planning.",

    "description": "BMW says its smallest car has a “very important role to play” as it moves into the Neue Klasse era The BMW 1 Series will return for a radically reinvented fourth generation within the next three years, as the German brand goes against its rivals in committing to its entry-level model.  As Mercedes-Benz prepares to retire the A-Class for good at the end of its current generation and Audi winds down production of the A1 and Q2, BMW says its smallest car remains an important part of its model range and a next-generation model will be the entry point into the new-gen Neue Klasse family. BMW will launch this new EV line-up in September with the unveiling of the second-generation iX3 at the Munich motor show, before following that up soon after with the closely related next-generation 3 Series. Prototypes for the Neue Klasse X5 have been spotted recently too, and the current 5 Series will receive a substantial design overhaul to bring it into line with its new siblings. BMW hasn't officially confirmed plans for a new 1 Series, but Autocar previously reported it had been green-lit internally and now BMW product boss Bernd Körber has said the hatchback still has a crucial role to play in Munich. \"We are a global player and we cover the full portfolio; the entry models have a very important role to play for various reasons,” he told Autocar at the Shanghai motor show. \"First of all, take markets like Italy and France, where the 1 Series has shares of 20, 30, 40% in some regions: if you want to be a global player, you have to also take care of markets where the share of 1 Series is extremely high, otherwise you run the danger of losing them.” Körber also said that offering a BMW model at a lower price point than the big-selling saloon and SUV models is important in the context of broadening the brand’s reach and diversifying its target market. \"The 1 Series is especially important for younger customers. If you want to keep the brand young, if you want to develop customers within your portfolio, the 1 Series is very important.\" Finally, he said, remaining in the notoriously challenging and low-margin small car market will help BMW to be as competitive and efficient as possible across all its segments. \"You have to stay in the challenge, and it's a similar story with Mini. A lot of the capabilities in terms of 'how flexible are you?' and 'how cost-efficient are you?' you gain in competing in the small car segment. To retreat out of the small car segment means you get out of the challenge of being the most cost-efficient player.  \"So for us it has the role of gross volume being relevant in all markets. But it also has a relevance for the brand in terms of younger customers and for the pressure we put on ourselves to find solutions that work in lower-cost segments.\" Körber didn't give any details of the next 1 Series, but it’s expected to arrive in around 2028, with the current car having recently been updated and BMW planning to complete its Neue Klasse roll-out within the next three and a half years. Like its rangemates, the next 1 Series is expected to be offered with a choice of petrol and electric powertrains - meaning it will continue to serve as a rival to traditional ICE competitors like the Volkswagen Golf and Audi A3 while also being put up against new contenders like the Cupra Born and Renault Megane E-Tech.",

    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "The Vellfire is Toyota’s big global MPV. It’s the current craze among India’s rich and famous, and has even gone on to become an unlikely red carpet regular. Mind you, this new-gen model was launched in India way back in 2023, but such has been the demand (nearly 1,200 were delivered last year), even the team at Toyota – that wouldn’t cut a queue – seemingly got their hands on their own media car only now. 2025 Toyota Vellfire exterior design and engineering: 7/10 5 metres long and 2 metres tall Vellfire has big presence You wouldn’t buy a Vellfire – or any MPV for that matter – primarily for the way it looks, but this latest-gen model does look more luxury product and less upscale airport pickup than the last one did. Of course, it’s the 5-metre length, 2-metre height and massive body that make the hulking Toyota unmissable even amidst luxury sedans and SUVs. Chrome treatment extends to 19-inch rims. Chrome details add bling to large MPV There’s more bling too. The huge 6-slat grille that almost extends to the floor is slathered in dark chrome, there’s more of the shiny stuff lining the bumper and even the headlamps sport a jewelled effect. You get the full effect of the Vellfire’s towering size at the side. Even the 19-inch rims look small amidst the vast body. A stylistic fold at the window line does give the slab-sided Vellfire some distinction in the world of MPVs. At the back, a roof spoiler and protruding bumper add some sportiness, if you will. Upward sweep of window line limits visibility for middle row passengers. The Vellfire uses a monocoque construction and is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform meant for large models. Toyota claims the new Vellfire is significantly stiffer in its construction yet engineered to be comfier and quieter than the last-gen model. 2025 Toyota Vellfire interior space and comfort: 9.5/10 Middle row comfort is exceptional Make what you want of the way the Vellfire looks, because the real story starts when you get inside. The first and perhaps only place of interest for the Vellfire’s chauffeur-driven clientele will be the middle row seats, access to which is via powered sliding doors. It is a bit of a step up into the living room-sized cabin. However, the short trek is worth it, ending in a pair of individual chairs that are no less than thrones. Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar. Vellfire's middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar.  Physical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests. There’s a wide range of motion, and, at full extension, you can really stretch out business-class style to catch a power nap on the go. Heating, ventilation and massage functions only up the comfort levels. However, the upswept rear windows don’t give the panoramic view out you’d expect in an MPV. Detachable screens mounted on armrests control seat adjustment, heating, ventilation and massage.   Third row offers enough room for three adults to sit in comfort Middle-row space and comfort is just brilliant, but it isn’t too bad for your entourage at the very back either. In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage. Access to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.   Access to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that's large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’. There's loads of flexibility built in: push the third row seats far forward or manually swivel them up and to the sides to free up courier van-levels of room. For all its space though, the Vellfire doesn't offer enough room for a spare tyre. Vellfire's boot offers courier van-levels of space, but there’s no provision for a spare tyre.   Cabin quality sees a huge jump over last-gen Vellfire We don’t foresee too many Vellfire owners getting into the intricacies of the front section of the cabin, but even so, the news is good. The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality. There’s more generous use of leather and padded surfaces, and even the wood-like detailing is convincing. Front seat comfort is also really good. Wraparound look to dash and high quality materials make cabin look rich and inviting.  The Vellfire gets abundant storage spaces across all three rows (including roof-mounted boxes), although the glovebox is unusually small. 2025 Toyota Vellfire features and safety: 8/10 14-inch touchscreen and digital dials are part of long equipment list The Vellfire comes loaded with goodies, so let’s break down the features set row-wise. Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either. 14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn't cutting edge.    Middle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos The multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system. Also, there won't be any quarreling with your co-passenger over sunroof opening thanks to the presence of individual glass panels with powered sunshades atop both seats. Middle row passengers get dedicated sunroofs. Adjustable seats, AC vents and powered sunshades for the quarter glass are features of note for third-row passengers. ADAS is part of Vellfire’s safety suite Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are also included. Lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control worked well on the smooth and well-marked Coastal Road in Mumbai, though it was the Blind Spot Warning function that came in most handy when piloting the oversized Vellfire. 14-inch rear entertainment screen folds out of the roof.    2025 Toyota Vellfire performance and refinement: 7/10 Vellfire offered in India only in front-wheel drive form Before we get moving, you should know that the Vellfire is sold in India only in front-wheel-drive format. Versions on sale overseas can be had with a rear electric motor that powers the rear wheels, effectively enabling all-wheel drive when driving conditions require. As things stand, the Vellfire is the most expensive front-wheel-drive vehicle on sale in India. Strong hybrid powertrain delivers a max of 250hp Driving the front wheels via an eCVT is a strong-hybrid arrangement. The powertrain comprises a 192hp, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine and a 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp. Vellfire doesn’t like to be rushed and feels its best in city confines.  It goes without saying that this is not a vehicle you buy for performance. If you’re in a hurry, the Vellfire is probably not the right vehicle to pick from your garage. This one’s job is to transport seven passengers in comfort. Vellfire can run in electric-only mode when battery has enough charge The Vellfire loves easy-going driving and gentle cruises, but ask anything more of it by pressing down harder on the accelerator pedal and that CVT-ness of the drivetrain comes right through. The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point. When there is enough charge in the battery, the Vellfire will slip into all-electric EV mode, which brings the decibel levels right back down. This is when you see the Vellfire in its best light. The Vellfire is ideal for easy-going driving and gentle cruises.  The Vellfire actually feels its best in stop-start urban confines, where the hybrid setup keeps the big Toyota in its comfort zone. It works as a long-distance vehicle too, but the powertrain simply doesn't feel as effortless as a strong diesel or even a strong turbo-petrol engine would. 2025 Toyota Vellfire ride comfort and handling: 7/10 Suspension doesn’t iron out all bumps and road noise creeps in to the cabin On the go, the VIP sat at the back will have reason to nitpick. Ride comfort is good but not good enough for a vehicle that sets you back by Rs 1.5 crore. The bumps and potholes do get filtered to quite an extent (it’s far nicer than the last Vellfire on this front), but the experience is not as pliant as it should have been. There’s also a fair bit of road noise that makes its way into the cabin, and at high speeds, you’ll hear air slamming against the A-pillar. Drivers will take some time getting used to the Vellfire’s size.    Drivers will need some time to get comfortable with the Vellfire’s size Also, the Vellfire isn’t the kind of vehicle that you just get into and get comfortable behind the wheel of. Sure, the high-set seat and large glasshouse give a commanding view of the world, but the windscreen that extends far forward makes it tricky to judge the Vellfire’s frontal extremities, at least initially. The size takes some getting used to and U-turns will need a bit of planning. There’s more ground clearance than the low floor would suggest. Ground clearance might appear inadequate but the Vellfire clears big speedbreakers without scraping its belly. No height adjustable air suspension here; the Vellfire rides on steel springs. 2025 Toyota Vellfire price and verdict: 8.5/10 Toyota Vellfire prices start at Rs 1.22 crore (ex-showroom) The Vellfire starts at Rs 1.22 crore for the Hi trim, while this VIP Executive Lounge spec is yours for Rs 1.32 crore (ex-showroom). Fun fact? That’s a crazy Rs 40 lakh-plus jump over the last-gen model’s launch price in 2020! The Vellfire is clearly not your average level-headed Toyota, nor is it your typical practicality-above-all-else MPV. It’s a luxury good and Toyota would like you to think it’s priced as such too. The Vellfire is for the chauffeur-driven who want to lounge on their way to work or home. A like-priced luxury sedan or SUV will get you more power and deliver a quieter experience, and of course, there’s the lure of a more prestigious badge too. But nothing, and I mean nothing, at this price can match the Vellfire’s rear seats for comfort. For the chauffeur-driven who merely want to lounge on their way to work or home, the Vellfire will be money well-spent. Toyota’s peace of mind ownership and a claimed 19.28kpl fuel economy figure would perhaps help strengthen the case for the Vellfire with the company CA too. But you know what? There’s an even more exclusive, more refined and comfier option from the house of Toyota – the Vellfire’s cousin. It’s called the Lexus LM, and it goes up to Rs 2.6 crore. Van damn!

    "description": "The Delhi government has drafted its EV Policy 2.0, which proposes extending benefits currently offered to all-electric cars to hybrid vehicles. Several carmakers, especially those heavily invested in developing BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) technology, have expressed concerns about the proposed policy change. Delhi govt proposes inclusion of hybrid cars in EV benefits structure The proposal states that registration and road tax for hybrid cars (up to Rs 20 lakh) to be waived EV makers like Mahindra, Tata and Hyundai are reportedly unhappy with the proposed policy change Delhi EV Policy 2.0 hybrid cars benefit proposal According to a recent report from Mint, the Delhi government shared the EV Policy 2.0 draft with many domestic and foreign carmakers earlier this week to gauge their feedback. The policy states that in Delhi-NCR, road tax and registration fees for EVs and hybrid cars priced up to Rs 20 lakh (ex-showroom) will be waived. It’s worth noting that these exemptions will only apply to strong hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles; mild hybrid cars have been excluded. Hybrid types explained Strong hybrids typically feature a small lithium-ion battery working in conjunction with the engine to power the vehicle. These setups yield a small amount of electric-only range, and once it’s exhausted, the engine takes over and recharges the battery. Plug-in hybrids have comparatively larger batteries and can therefore travel much longer distances solely on electric power. Once the range is depleted, the battery can be recharged either by the engine (takes longer than a strong hybrid) or by plugging it into an EV charging socket. The latter option is not present on a strong hybrid. Unlike the above two, mild hybrids cannot be driven on electrical power alone. They use a small electric motor to provide gentle electrical assistance to the engine when accelerating at lower speeds, and can also recuperate energy from braking and use it to power ancillary systems in the vehicle. Carmakers’ response to Delhi EV Policy 2.0 draft EV proponents are critical of the proposed policy change Manufacturers that have allocated enormous funds and resources towards EV development, such as Tata, Mahindra, and Hyundai, have reportedly spoken up against the prospect of hybrid cars being included in the benefits umbrella. They’re also worried that should the Delhi government implement equal benefits for EVs and hybrids, other states may follow suit quickly. Uttar Pradesh was the first to waive these charges for hybrid vehicles in July 2024, a move that attracted criticism from various carmakers back then as well. Due to their heightened emphasis on EVs, Tata, Hyundai and Mahindra currently do not offer any strong hybrid or plug-in hybrid models in India. However, Hyundai does sell hybrid versions of models like the Kona, Santa Fe, Palisade, and Tucson in overseas markets. Maruti Suzuki and Toyota lagging behind in the Indian EV race, but not for long On the other end of the spectrum, Maruti Suzuki, Honda and Toyota are selling strong hybrid models like the Grand Vitara, Urban Cruiser Hyryder, City e:HEV, Innova Hycross and Invicto in India, but are yet to launch any all-electric models here. However, Maruti Suzuki is set to launch its first BEV – the eVitara – this year, and Toyota will follow suit with a fraternal twin based on the Urban Cruiser EV concept. It should be noted that the EV Policy 2.0 draft is not final. The Delhi government will take a call on hybrid car benefits after assessing the responses from carmakers.

    "description": "About 43 lakh passenger vehicles were sold in India in the financial year that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025), of which 4,48,233 units, or around 10 percent, were MPVs. Among factors that draw buyers in a value-conscious market like India to the MPV segment are the high levels of practicality, the ability to transport seven people and their luggage comfortably, and the fact that more and more car-owning families are taking the road for their holidays across the country. So, here’s a quick look at the bestselling MPVs of FY2025. Maruti Ertiga was India’s bestselling MPV for the sixth year in a row Maruti’s XL6 and Invicto, along with Renault Triber, saw a decrease in sales Luxury MPVs Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire sold over 1,000 units each in FY2025 Best-selling MPVs in India in FY2025ModelFY25 salesMarket share (%)FY24 salesYoY change (%)Maruti Ertiga1,90,97442.611,49,75727.52Toyota Innova Crysta+Hycross1,07,20423.9298,1089.27Kia Carens64,60914.4163,1672.28Maruti XL637,1118.2845,130-17.77Toyota Rumion21,8784.885,973266.28Renault Triber19,9054.4422,446-11.32Maruti Invicto4,0360.904,598-12.22Kia Carnival1,3610.30--Toyota Vellfire1,1550.26400188.75TOTAL4,48,2331003,89,57915.06 Maruti Ertiga 1,90,974 units sold, up 28 percent Maruti Suzuki India’s first crack at the MPV segment continues to win over buyers and has been India’s No. 1 MPV for the past six fiscal years. In FY2025, the Maruti Ertiga, which is available in petrol and CNG powertrains, sold 1,90,974 units, up 28 percent year on year (YoY). This is its best-ever fiscal year performance, making it Maruti’s bestselling utility vehicle and India’s fourth best-selling car in FY2025 after the Maruti Wagon R, Tata Punch and Hyundai Creta. In FY2025, Maruti sold 41,217 more Ertigas than it did in the previous year, which speaks volumes for the demand this popular family mover continues to command. Ertiga accounted for 26 percent of Maruti’s UV sales of 7,20,186 units, up 11 percent from FY2024. In fact, it missed out on being the company’s No. 1 passenger vehicle model by just 7,477 units, with the Wagon R (1,98,451 units) winning that accolade. Toyota Innova Hycross and Crysta 1,07,204 units sold, up 9 percent Toyota Kirloskar Motor sold 1,07,204 units of its bestselling product, the Innova MPV, an increase of 9 per cent YoY. The Innova comes in Crysta and hybrid Hycross forms, and the demand has been particularly strong for the latter, which has helped accelerate sales for this popular model.  In FY2025, TKM hit its best-ever sales of 3,09,000-plus units, and the Innova was a key growth driver, along with the Urban Cruiser Hyryder and Fortuner SUVs, Taisor compact SUV and the Rumion MPV. Kia Carens 64,609 units sold, up 2 percent The high-on-space-and-comfort Kia Carens MPV, with 64,609 units dispatched, has posted marginal YoY growth of 2 percent. The Carens’ best fiscal was FY2023, with 70,314 units sold. In early February 2025, the versatile and spacious MPV drove past the cumulative sales milestone of 2 lakh units in the domestic market, 36 months after its launch. The Carens is targeted at large families scouting for a premium, spacious cabin, as well as day-to-day practicality. It comes with a choice of multiple powertrains. It is likely that the somewhat slower sales of the model this year were due to the news that there is a new Carens, as well as an electric Carens, slated for launch later this year. Maruti XL6 37,111 units sold, down 18 percent The Maruti XL6 is the premium, 6-seat avatar of the popular Ertiga. It is powered by the same 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine and offers the same automatic and manual gearbox options. However, while the Ertiga has hit its best-ever sales, the XL6’s numbers are down 18 percent YoY to 37,111 units in FY2025. Toyota Rumion 21,878 units sold, up 266 percent The Toyota Rumion MPV is one of the Japanese brand’s most successful products in the past two years. Since its launch in August 2023, the sensible, no-nonsense Ertiga-based people-mover – which is among the four rebadged Maruti Suzuki models in Toyota’s portfolio – has made its presence felt in the affordable MPV market. After all, 21,878 units of it were sold in FY2025, up 266 percent YoY on a low year-ago base of 5,973 units. Renault Triber 19,905 units sold, down 11 percent The sub-4-metre, 7-seat Renault Triber which offers MPV-like versatility for hatchback money and size, continued to see a decline in its sales. Renault dispatched 19,905 Tribers in FY2025, down 11 percent YoY. What doesn’t help is the meek 72hp, 96Nm, 1.0-litre petrol engine – a CNG version arrived in February – that comes paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard. The Triber facelift has been spied testing and is expected to launch later this year. Maruti Invicto 4,036 units sold, down 12 percent The Maruti Invicto, which is produced by Toyota for Maruti, sold 4,036 units in FY2025, down 12 percent YoY. Maruti launched the Invicto in July 2023, and the MPV’s total sales over these 21 months stand at 8,634 units. Like the Innova Hycross, the Invicto is big on space, comfort and features. However, unlike the Toyota, it is only sold with a strong hybrid engine, which delivers impressive fuel economy. Kia Carnival 1,361 units sold Launched in October 2024, the Kia Carnival builds on the legacy of its predecessor while offering enhanced features aimed at redefining passenger comfort. Notwithstanding the high sticker price of Rs 63.91 lakh, the Carnival has sold 1,361 units in the last six months of FY2025. The large diesel-engined MPV scores high on comfort and flexibility and goes all out to pamper its occupants to the hilt. Toyota Vellfire 1,155 units sold, up 189 percent Proof that even a very high sticker price for an MPV cannot dissuade buyers is the ultra-luxurious Toyota Vellfire. Priced between Rs 1.22 and Rs 1.33 crore, the XL-sized MPV has sold 1,155 units – 755 additional units than FY2024’s 400 units, registering a whopping 189 percent growth. The Vellfire boasts a cavernous cabin that’s home to some of the best seats. A sister product to the more luxuriously appointed Lexus LM, the Vellfire is powered by a 193hp, 240Nm, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine combined with an 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp and is paired with an e-CVT; our Vellfire review tells you what it’s like to drive and be driven in. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
