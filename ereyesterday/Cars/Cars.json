    "description": "Hero MotoCorp has recently faced turbulence in its sales numbers and market share. Part of the problem is that its overarching success lies in the 100-110cc commuter bike category, which has seen a declining trend in recent years. The other part is that none of its more recent, premium products – except for the Xtreme 125R – have set the sales charts on fire. The company is seeking to replicate that sort of success in the premium 125cc scooter segment as well, and the all-new Destini 125 is its first tool at chipping into that space. So, can this revamped Destini 125 help Hero on its journey towards a more premium identity? Hero Destini 125 design and features - 7/10 Has the basics covered but is lacking in some crucial areas The Destini 125 has a typical family scooter look (for the most part), with pleasing lines and a safe design. This holds true when you see the scooter from the front, but as your eyes snake their way to the back, you’ll notice that Hero has gone down an unconventional route when it comes to the tail-lamp and rear indicators. The tail-lamp is shaped like the letter H – an increasingly common signature across Hero products – and the turn signals are stacked on top of it. While there is no functional problem, this is a polarising design choice in a segment dominated by inoffensive designs.  Hero Destini 125 key specificationsHero Destini 125Kerb Weight115kgSeat Height770mmGround Clearance162mmFuel Tank capacity5.3 litresWheelbase1302mm A concealed fuel filler cap is an improvement, but the space to get your fingers around the cap is a little tight. Fit and finish is one area where Hero still has some ways to go. The indicator and horn buttons feel quite plasticky, the cover for the USB charging port feels flimsy, and the fuel filler lid’s panel doesn’t sit flush on the left side. Speaking of the fuel filler, the empty space around the lid is a little tight for those with larger hands, and tightening the cap once you’ve refuelled takes a little dexterity.  Lack of a brake lock clasp is a crucial miss on a gearless scooter; parking on a slope will necessitate some caution. It also misses out on a brake lock clasp, which is a must-have on a gearless scooter. The mirrors, while well-shaped, have rather short stalks, which means a quarter of your rear view is obstructed by your elbow. Another area where the Destini lags behind its rivals is storage capacity. While it has the basics covered, with a luggage hook on the front apron and a spacious cubby that can fit a 1-litre water bottle, its 19-litre underseat storage area is quite small. This is especially true in comparison to the TVS Jupiter models, which offer class-leading levels of boot space in the ICE scooter game.  A boot light is a nice feature to have, but the 19-litre underseat storage area is one of the smallest in this class. That’s not to say it’s devoid of features, and in addition to a side-stand cutoff, auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and a USB charger, you also have the option to pair your smartphone with the display. Once paired, you can receive turn-by-turn navigation prompts, as well as call and SMS alerts. While all of this is nice to have, the display has its oddities. For instance, the odometer and clock are hard to tell apart at a quick glance, and, on a sunny day, even at full brightness, the smaller digits on the screen are hard to make out. The digital LCD screen has some good features like turn-by-turn navigation, although it could be a little brighter. Hero Destini 125 ride and handling - 8/10 Overall comfort levels are quite high; it is a predictable handler One area where the Destini is a rather accomplished machine is in its ride comfort. The generously padded seat, spacious ergonomics, and plush suspension setup work together to make the Destini one of the most comfortable scooters around. We recently tested the newest Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter 110, so with that fresh in our minds, we can report back that the suspension and seat comfort on the Destini feel superior to those of the aforementioned scooters.   Hero Destini 125 underpinningsHero Destini 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc / DrumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12 The suspension absorbs most of what comes in the way very well and is among the best in this segment. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, the Destini is a sure-footed machine even at higher speeds, and the larger rear wheel also helps to some extent when going over bigger bumps. Being a family scooter, the Destini makes no pretences of being an energetic handler, and it prioritises stability over flickability.  Stopping performance is commensurate with rivals and the CBS works well, but the brakes are devoid of feel. As with other offerings in the class, the Destini gets combi-brakes, and while there is sufficient stopping power to be had, the brakes felt devoid of feel and always necessitated a firm pull when coming to a halt. Hero Destini 125 performance and fuel economy - 7/10 Fuel efficiency and performance are commendable, but refinement could improve At the first ride event last year, Hero told us that while the latest Destini uses the same engine block as the previous-gen model, the company had gone to great lengths to improve refinement, mileage, and reliability over a longer duration. While it has succeeded in some areas, there’s still some work to be done.  Hero Destini 125 performanceAcceleration0-40kph3.8s0-80kph16.07sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.97s30-70kph10.86s50-80kph10.62sBraking 60-0kph (in metres)18.53m We’ll begin with the positives. The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well.  The 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better. Fuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel.  With its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class. While the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds.  Mirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view. What was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark. We have reached out to Hero and will update the web version of this story once we discover what the issue was. Hero Destini 125 price and verdict - 7/10 It is now a better scooter, but still some distance away from the best in class In our time with it, we’ve discovered that the Destini 125 has strengths and weaknesses that are common across most Hero products. It is exceptionally comfortable, rather frugal, and backed by the company’s extensive retail sales network. At the same time, weaknesses such as fit and finish that leaves you wanting, and a lacklustre engine sour this package, especially now that the 125cc scooter class has some seriously impressive competitors.  The i3s start-stop system could be quicker in its operation. Ranging between Rs 81,850 and Rs 91,700 (ex-showroom, Delhi), it is priced on par with its rivals and doesn’t have the upper hand there either. Comfort and frugality are two big factors people look for in a scooter, and the Destini has those areas covered, but its shortcomings are enough to prevent it from rising to the top of the class.

    "description": "In a fiercely competitive segment, the Raida Carbonite gloves promise a blend of robust protection and everyday comfort. But having put them through their paces on Mumbai’s chaotic roads, allow me to delve into whether they live up to the promise. Straight out of the box, the quality of the stitching and materials is impressive for the price. The full-grain leather feels substantial, and the carbon-fibre knuckle protectors, alongside the rubberised plastic scaphoid shield, inspire a good degree of confidence.  The gloves feature pre-curved fingers and a neoprene wrist cuff, which contribute to a generally pleasant feel. Ventilation is adequate, with mesh panels on the thumb, index and middle fingers, and vented TPR protectors on the leather ring and pinky fingers. However, in Mumbai’s humid climate, you’ll inevitably feel sweat building on your palms, especially during prolonged stops.  A significant point of contention here is the fit. I consulted the online size chart and opted for the large size. However, I noted empty voids on top of the ring and pinky fingers. This slightly loose fit at the fingertips can reduce feel but won’t pose a risk while riding. I also experienced a distinct tugging sensation on the thumb during initial rides. While this improved as the gloves broke in over time, it still persists, albeit to a lesser degree.  Fit can be an issue, so it’s best to try them before buying. Finally, the touch-compatible fingertips are a feature many riders look for today. My experience, however, aligns with a known issue across many gloves. While they technically work, precise inputs are difficult. Don’t expect to compose messages or navigate intricate menus; they’re best for quick taps to answer calls or skip tracks. Despite the minor fit nuances and the expected heat build-up, the Raida Carbonite gloves offer a solid package of protection and decent comfort for the price. They are a good VFM option for urban commuters and occasional tourers, provided you find a size that fits your hands well.

    "description": "Diane Miller's remarkable leadership has helped transform Stellantis' massive UK plant Diane Miller, Stellantis’s top UK car manufacturing executive and winner of Autocar’s 2025 Editors’ Award, has loved cars all her adult life – preferably in very large numbers – and can vividly remember the day the obsession began. From a post-graduate job at Ford’s then mighty Ford Fiesta plant in Dagenham, Essex, Miller has spent the past 30-odd years mastering ever more responsible automotive jobs around the world – for Ford, Aston Martin, GM and most recently Stellantis, in the UK, Europe and the US. Miller is decisive but modest and as a result reluctant to identify any particular secret of success. But if you converse with her long enough, she will eventually admit to one asset: “Finding a way to get on with people.” It is for this that she is known and loved by the people who have worked for her. Having discovered its effectiveness early on, she has deployed her liking for people in every car job she has had, and she has become famous for it. Miller’s most spectacular achievement to date has been the 18-month conversion of the former Vauxhall Astra plant at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, to the manufacture of battery-powered delivery vans for five Stellantis marques: Vauxhall, Opel, Citroën, Peugeot and Fiat. It has been a vital move in rescuing volume vehicle manufacturing in this country. Now that this EV factory conversion has been achieved, Miller is turning her hand to running Stellantis’s massive new national parts distribution centre, located just down the road from the van plant at Ellesmere, where the company is spending £500 million to expand and improve the way it delivers components to its customers in the UK and Ireland. The parts centre project has required another wholesale reorganisation, entailing both the redeployment of car-making people and the importation of new workers into a business that, despite its size and scale, has to be very labour-intensive. It is a perfect place for a unique character like Miller, a highly experienced engineer who discovered early how to get on with people. “I went to an all-girls convent grammar school in Northern Ireland,” she explains, “and three of us opted for A-level physics. Our teacher loved engineering, and the upshot was all three of us chose engineering at university: mechanical and production engineering for me; civil and aeronautical for the others. “My degree was from Liverpool John Moores University, and as part of a ‘jobs milk-round’ for graduates I was invited to Ford’s Dagenham plant to see how it was run. I was instantly amazed and intrigued that they could build 60 cars an hour, and the experience had a lasting effect on me. Even after more than 30 years in the business, I still find it amazing.” Miller joined Ford, moved to Dagenham and stayed five years. She achieved rapid promotions, first to senior process engineer and then to a manager’s job in the paint engineering area, launching new technology in Ford plants across Europe. Paint doesn’t suit everyone, but Miller earned an early reputation for being willing to try anything and work anywhere. “Crossing the Irish Sea to go to university was the big move,” she says. “After that, anything was okay.” Pretty soon Miller was heading to Chicago on a two-year paint unit training scheme that extended to four. “It was a situation that occurs in many companies,” she says. “You go on a training scheme and the money runs out, so they get you to do the job anyway. It was great training because no one else knew about paint, so I had to make the decisions. It worked out okay.” Miller’s career progressed more rapidly than most young engineers her age, but she’s careful not to give herself much credit. “I had very good mentors,” she says. “And there were so few women in the industry in those days that people probably noticed you more. Mind you, even today I’m very sad that there aren’t more women in these engineering jobs. There are great careers here for those who want to try it.” Women can succeed in a male-dominated arena like car-making just by being who they are, says Miller. They tend to humanise the place, she says: “Right from the start, I’d go to a factory, talk to the operators and ask how their job should be done. It was a bit different from some managers who arrive and think, well, ‘I’ve got the degree, so I know how things should be run’. But people on the floor can work smart better than anyone, and if they trust you, they’ll tell you how.” When the Chicago gig ended, Ford wanted Miller to go back into central engineering at Dagenham, but she wanted to stay in a plant and felt that would have been a waste of her paint know-how. So she worked happily for several years at the Ford Transit plant in Southampton, leaving before it closed in 2013 because its manager was heading for Aston Martin (then a Ford company) and asked her to join him, bringing her paint expertise. It made sense, because her husband, an American, was already a paint supplier there. Aston Martin paint is quite different from Ford Transit paint, she found: “I started off thinking five jobs an hour would be easier than 60 jobs an hour, but that was completely wrong. True, Aston paint was very different – many more coats and lots of polishing – but the big difference was the fact that the operators had so much to remember. The Transit takt (process) time was around five minutes, explains Miller, whereas at Aston it was more like 25 minutes. People had to remember 25 minutes’ work rather thanfive, which is clearly much more difficult. Still, Miller thrived there for six years – until Ford sold Aston Martin and suggested, once again, that she return to central engineering. Just in time a GM headhunter arrived with an offer to move to Ellesmere Port where Vauxhall was about to launch the Astra D2, but there were big problems with the paint shop. Miller, uniquely qualified to take hold of the process and fix it, was perfect for the job. Aston was small by comparison, and Miller liked the Liverpool area where she had been at university. “We decided to make the move, and I joined the company at a high enough level to make the changes needed,” she says. “Our Astra launch was the best in the company’s history, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. From that I was asked to take over general assembly, another progression. I had enjoyed paint, but there are many more people in general assembly, and I guess that’s where my skills are. We made some good progress; people felt able to tell me about their difficulties. “They knew if there was a problem and I could fix it, I’d do it right away.” Astra production ended in April 2022 – with quality levels higher than they had ever been. Then came the bombshell decision to start making Stellantis electric vans. “It was a funny time,” says Miller. “The whole of Europe thought this plant would never reopen, but we already knew [then Stellantis boss] Mr Tavares had decided to keep it going because he’d discovered – from the first time he visited us – that there was an ethos among Ellesmere people that we’d find a way to do whatever was needed to keep the place open.” In order to make the changes, the factory was shut for 18 months. Staff who couldn’t make cars helped move robots and build new rest areas. Managers went to Madrid, where changes planned for Ellesmere had already been made, to see exactly what was needed. Everyone adapted, in no small part because Miller’s can-do culture had spread throughout the place. By September 2023 electric vans were flowing down the lines. The success isn’t complete. For Miller and Stellantis, the current 20,000-unit annual output isn’t nearly enough, mostly because they believe the government’s re-adoption of 2035 as an ICE cut-off date has hurt demand for Ellesmere’s all-EV output. As a stopgap, they have begun building bodies for an ICE van plant in Algeria (boosting output to 50,000 units), and production will soon be further augmented by the arrival of a range of larger, Vivaro-sized electric vans for the five Stellantis marques. Ultimately, demand will be much higher – perhaps as high as the plant’s 100,000-a-year, seven-day, three-shift capacity. Ellesmere Port is ready. Miller, meanwhile, is several months into her demanding new project – and she will be happy with more after that. She has spent most of her three-plus decades in automotive providing a great role model for other people, not just women, but she says the lessons she has learned have been important in her own personal development, too. “I’ll never forget how those early days at Dagenham flipped my mind,” she says. “They taught me that if you think clearly, you can do anything. I started applying those principles to my own life and found that there’s nearly always a way you can make things happen. This industry has been a great teacher.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/scouting-report-inside-vws-new-road-brand",
    "description": "Terra pick-up and Traveler SUV will form the new Scout EV line-up The Scout name is being revived as a VW Group-backed maker of off-road EVs It would be easy to dismiss Scout Motors as yet another retro revival, a way of trying to attach some emotion to new electric vehicles by sticking a nostalgic logo on the bonnet. Or even as just another new Volkswagen Group sub-brand designed to protect the conglomerate’s share in the tough North American market. Dig beneath the surface, though, and Scout is far more interesting – even if it isn’t a brand too well known to UK readers, and one that, for now, won’t be sold here. For one thing, what’s not to love about a retro-styled Jeep Wrangler rival? For another, the unusual set-up of Scout could have a significant influence on the future development processes of one of the world’s biggest car firms. Scout Motors isn’t technically a Volkswagen Group brand: it’s an independent stand-alone company based in the US but owned by the VW Group. While Scott Keogh, boss of Volkswagen USA, also serves as CEO of Scout, it otherwise has its own staff and facilities. It is, in effect, a start-up created purely to make a new line of highly capable off-road EVs. “The intent is to combine an American start-up – speed, innovation, ingenuity, adaptability – with the backing, scale and money of one of the world’s leading manufacturers,” explains Ryan Decker, Scout’s strategy boss (and employee number one). “Nobody has really done that before.” But this is an electric vehicle start-up housed in some nostalgic wrapping. A quick history lesson may be in order first because, despite its name, the original International Scout was very much an American machine. It was developed by International Harvester, a longtime US manufacturer of agricultural and construction vehicles that in the early 1900s expanded into light trucks and pick-ups. With the Jeep CJ gaining popularity in the 1950s, the Indiana firm decided to develop its own four-wheel-drive recreational vehicle. The Scout 80 arrived in 1961 and was sold in various forms across two model generations until 1980. Even if the name isn’t that familiar, chances are the model’s styling would offer a familiar ring of Americana. International Harvester slipped into decline in the 1980s, with its various divisions sold off. The truck and engine division was eventually rebranded as Navistar, and in 2021 it was bought by Traton, the VW Group’s heavy commercial vehicle arm. That also gave VW the rights to the Scout model name. Here’s where it comes full circle: Volkswagen USA spotted the incredible popularity of the Jeep Wrangler and retro-infused off-roaders such as the revived Ford Bronco, and it wanted a piece of the action. So in 2022 it decided to create its own start-up to produce one – and it just so happened the company now owned a brand with its own rich heritage. “To be a start-up, but to have the heritage and legacy of a really cool brand that has a passionate fanbase and can evoke nostalgic memories, is really unusual,” says Decker. And while it’s been 45 years since a Scout last rolled off the production line, he insists the name is still known to US buyers. “Some guy came up  to me earlier today and told me his grandfather had a Scout they used to go on fishing trips in,” continues Decker. “Having that as your starting place to build a brand from, how special is that?” Last year Scout revealed two concept models: the Terra pick-up and the Traveler SUV (named after old Scout variants). Few details have yet been divulged, but there’s talk of 1000lb ft and 350 miles of range, rising to 500 miles for the range-extender, and 0-60mph times under 3.5sec. This is where Scout really diverges from VW Group models: they won’t be built on a shared EV architecture, such as the now well-established MEB. Instead, if you want to offer genuine off-road ability with the chops to take on a Wrangler on the trails, you will need a ladder-on-frame chassis – and, as Scout technical chief Burkhard Huhnke notes, “there’s no body-on-frame platform in the entire Volkswagen Group – so we have to start from scratch”. Huhnke’s appointment as technical boss encapsulates Scout’s ethos: he has spent much of his career at the Volkswagen Group but was most recently technical chief at the now-defunct EV start-up Fisker. The brief he was given was simple, he says: “The target is to become the benchmark in the off-road segment.” To do that, the new Scout vehicles won’t just be styled like the original. “The Scout was a working horse in the past,” says Huhnke. \"“It was the eight-days-a-week vehicle that could go off road but you could also do your daily business in. “Off-road capability means it needs to be very different. It’s very simple: I get targets from an engineering perspective. We’re focused on ability, on approach angles, the torque, weight distribution, everything. We’re working on an e-beam and a special axle design. We have 35in wheels. You have to have the sway bar disconnect. But we can combine the tradition of an off-road car with the innovations of an electric vehicle, and we can see a real sweet spot.” Scout vehicles will be offered with electric or range-extender powertrains. They will be ‘software-defined vehicles’, designed around advanced computer systems that allow for over-the-air updates and the like. Huhnke describes it as “heritage combined with innovation”. That innovation will be seen in both the pure-electric powertrain and the range-extender variant that Scout is working on. Huhnke is proud that the latter – which drives the wheels with an electric motor but features a small combustion engine used to charge the battery – is the firm’s own development and intellectual property. He says: “We’re not a guinea pig for the Volkswagen Group to try this out; it’s where we see our biggest opportunity.” It’s about that go-anywhere, off-road brief, and providing functionality in remote places where EV charging infrastructure might not be the best. “We are customer-centric and listen to their concerns,” adds Huhnke. “People loved the concept and the BEV platform, but the feedback led us to a range-extender. It’s like carrying a charging station with you.” Huhnke is also excited by the potential that an electric vehicle powertrain, with its instant power, torque vectoring and even weight distribution, has for an off-roader. Software development will also be key, and it’s notable Huhnke started his automotive career in software and electronics. For that side, the VW Group’s recent tie-up with software-focused EV firm Rivian will be a major boost. The joint venture between the two companies is centred on the development of a new zonal software architecture, and Huhnke says that “Scout will be one of the first brands” in the VW Group empire to use it: “It will be the most modern architecture, so we’ll have full connectivity to the cloud for diagnostics, predictive maintenance and new functions to keep the car fresh.” While Scout has shown concepts of its first two models, production versions are unlikely to appear until 2027 or 2028. Before then, the firm needs to finish development, while construction is also under way on a dedicated US factory in Georgia. Needless to say, not many automotive start-ups can invest in a vast $2 billion (£1.6bn) facility that could employ around 4000 people and produce 200,000 vehicles a year. Aside from the need to finish building that factory, it’s a rapid cycle for a new start-up to launch products in, especially given the huge technical demands on off-roaders. “Being a start-up means we can focus,” says Huhnke, “and we are laser-focused on two products. “I don’t want to judge traditional car manufacturers, but we can focus on our first bullets without distraction. And by using digital technology and digital twins [testing simulated versions of cars], we can speed up the process.” Conversely, unlike some start-ups with a limited pool of investment, Scout has the luxury of time. Huhnke adds: “Sometimes you can see start-ups that have to push the product because of cash flow, but we can take time to get it right before it goes to the customer. We can do full-speed development and testing now and really work on the architecture and ability.” Scout won’t just work on the models for the next few years, though: there’s also a brand to build. Decker describes that process as “building a community”, adding: “We want to nurture existing Scout fans out there. But we want to make new fans as well.” While he won’t be drawn on reservations to date, Decker says the firm is “happy with where we are” – with the Traveler SUV making up the bulk of buyer interest. He says the focus is on ensuring an ongoing dialogue with the people who have signed up, adding: “We won’t treat them like a marketing database.” Similarly, Decker won’t give specifics about any sales or growth ambitions for Scout, but he notes “the two products we’ll launch will cover more than 40% of the US market in terms of revenue and profit pools”. Pricing is expected to start from around $50,000 (£40,000). But beyond a new Jeep rival for the US market, what about that bigger picture? While both Huhnke and Decker insist Scout was conceived purely to fill a business opportunity, its unique set-up and technology could provide lessons and hardware for its Volkswagen parent. “You never get money for free,” laughs Huhnke. “Efficiency is key. I’ve taken the challenge to become a benchmark R\u0026D organisation in the world, from a size and cost perspective. That is an interesting challenge appreciated by our sponsors as well. Of course, we are under observation.” There are already reports that both Volkswagen and Audi are interested in Scout’s platform for their own off-roaders, along with hints that the new Scout factory could be used to produce models for other brands while the marque is ramped up. It’s certainly an intriguing prospect, and Scout is worth watching because of how unusual it is as a start-up backed by a global car giant. “You have a bunch of incumbent firms that are 100-plus years old with millions of loyal customers, but they also have a lot of complexity with lots of cars, powertrains and factories,” says Decker. “Complexity is a challenge to growing a business. On the other hand, you have pure-play start-ups, who can react quicker, but they bring lots of questions. \"Will they have success? Will they go bankrupt? Can they service your car? “If you can take the scale offered by an incumbent and mix it with the enthusiasm of a start-up, think what a superpower that is.”",

    "description": "Harley-Davidson’s core business is, and will always be, big American V-twins. But there are moments in The Motor Co.’s history where it has deviated from this formula in a bid to attract a wider audience, with varying levels of success. In the 60s and 70s, Harley leveraged their part (and later full) ownership of the Italian manufacturer Aermacchi to create a handful of smaller bikes—like the 1974 Harley-Davidson SX250. Released during Harley’s infamous AMF era, this single-cylinder two-stroke was designed to compete with the lightweight Japanese enduro bikes of the day. But since it was effectively just a rebadged Aermacchi, it faded from existence when Harley sold the Italian firm to Cagiva in 1978. These days, Aermacchi Harleys enjoy a niche following among vintage racers, and anyone else who has a soft spot for 1970s oddballs.…",

    "description": "Motorcycle tech has evolved exponentially over the past two decades—making today’s bikes easier to ride, but harder to customize. Complex wiring harnesses are a nightmare to navigate, and CAN bus systems limit what you can unplug without risking a bricked ECU. Luckily, the 2006 Triumph Scrambler sidesteps these modern afflictions. Triumph’s current crop of modern classics are liquid-cooled, ride-by-wire machines with rider aids and TFT screens. The older Triumph Scrambler is delightfully simple by comparison. You get a torquey, air-cooled parallel-twin, fed by twin carbs… and not much else. That makes it a fantastic base for stylish custom builds—like this Triumph Scrambler from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom. Known for blending eclectic flair with refined craftsmanship, 2LOUD’s approach suits the Scrambler perfectly.…",

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO specificationsKylaqXUV 3XOLength (mm)3,9953,990Width (mm)1,7831,821Height (mm)1,6191,647Wheelbase (mm)2,5662,600Boot capacity (litres)360295Ground clearance (mm)189201Tyre size205/55 R17215/55 R17Engine3 cyls, 999cc, turbo-petrol3cyl, 1197cc, turbo-petrolPower115hp at 5000-5500rpm131hp at 5000rpmTorque178Nm at 1750-4000rpm230Nm at 1500-2500rpmGearbox6-speed torque converter auto6-speed torque converter auto Overall, the XUV does appear to be the more substantial of the two, given that it’s the widest and has the longest wheelbase in the segment. The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful.

Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

    "description": "Don’t let the ‘Sport’ in its name mislead you; what makes this Range Rover quick is the little SV badge instead, though that also needs some clarification. You see, per JLR, SV cars in the JLR-verse are the ‘exquisite interpretations by Special Vehicle Operations’. So, while on the Range Rover, SV denotes ‘even more luxury’, on the Range Rover Sport, it signals ‘the fastest Range Rover of all time’. SV on the Range Rover Sport signals the fastest Range Rover of all time.  Indeed, powered by JLR’s BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo petrol V8, tuned here to 635hp, this Range Rover Sport SV does the 0 to 100kph dash in a claimed 3.8 seconds and tops out at an impressive 290kph. So, while it’s got some off-road chops, it’s quite a different take from its regular off-roading siblings, and we got a day to experience it in the UK. Range Rover Sport SV Performance and Refinement: 8/10 The breadth of the powertrain’s character transformation is impressive Engage SV mode via the illuminated button positioned towards the base of the steering wheel, and the Sport SV preps the entire car, chassis, engine and all for a performance level beyond the regular Dynamic mode. Ride height drops by another 15mm, and torque bumps up 50Nm to 800Nm with the Dynamic launch mode. Range Rover Sport SV specsEngine Mild-hybrid, twin-turbo V8Displacement 4395ccPower635hpTorque 750Nm (800Nm with dynamic launch mode)Gearbox8-speed AT Drive layout All-wheel drive 0-100kph (claimed)3.8 seconds Top-speed (claimed) 290kph And boy, it is quick. I floor it in manual mode first and hit the redline in first and second gears before I can tug at the paddle. Cog swaps need to be supercar-style quick, and after telling my brain that, I get the full-bore launch – what a rush that is. Power delivery is thick and fast, and it revs freely past 7,000rpm; the acceleration feels nice and raw with sharp and quick gearshifts, quite uncharacteristically for a planetary torque converter autobox and quite a transformation from the unit’s daily driver abilities that it does just fine, too. Sport SV's straight-line speed and the engine’s flexible character are a delight.  What’s nice is there’s a neat soundtrack as well; perhaps some of the engine note is piped in through the speakers. But I’m not complaining; the gurgle from the exhausts is something we may soon not hear at all. Dynamic mode dials things down from wild to energetic. And left in Auto mode, the Sport SV is quite the relaxed town cruiser. Range Rover Sport SV Ride Comfort and Handling: 7/10 Can hold its own around corners but isn’t what you could call agile With all that propulsion, keeping a two-and-a-half-tonne SUV on the road is tricky business, so JLR has thrown a lot in terms of chassis systems. There’s all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, torque vectoring by braking, an active rear locking differential and a setup that the company calls 6D Dynamics, a system that combines hydraulically linked dampers and height-adjustable air springs. Not light on its feet but hydraulically linked dampers help keep things sane around corners.  The semi-active 6D system does away with the need for anti-roll bars, and instead, the hydraulically linked dampers pump fluid between each other to keep roll and pitch in check. It does work to an extent; cornering around some twisty British B and C roads, the Sport SV feels composed, but it’s never agile or light on its feet like a Porsche Cayenne, for instance. Ride quality is firm, and you can easily feel every rut and crack from the road surface. Move out of SV mode, and things improve, but even at its most plush setting, there is a sharp edge to the ride. 23-inch carbon-fibre wheels look neat but lend a firm edge to ride quality. No doubt the 23-inch carbon fibre rims with the slim Michelin Pilot Sport All Season tyres do no favours. The steering weight is fine and changes with the drive mode, but it lacks an incisive feel to it. Braking performance is just fine, and the optional carbon-ceramic disc did a good job hauling this massive brute down from high speeds. Range Rover Sport SV Mileage: 6/10 The combined WLTP fuel efficiency rating for the Sport SV is 8kpl It might have mild hybrid tech, but with its weight and performance tuning, don’t expect the SV’s kilometre per litre figure to be in two digits. The official WLTP rating for the Range Rover Sport SV’s fuel efficiency is 8kpl. Range Rover Sport SV Exterior Design and Engineering: 8/10 The SV does not shout sport in your face but has enough presence to draw attention Range Rover Sport SV dimensionsLength 4970mm Width2209mm Height 1814mm Wheelbase 2998mm Kerb weight 2560kg Tyres (F, R)285/40 R23, 305/35 R23 Now in its third generation, the Sport moves to a new platform: JLR’s MLA-Flex, which gives it multiple powertrain options, including full electric due later. The exterior, though, features familiar styling cues as its predecessor; it’s just a bit sleeker and meaner – for instance, the grille, the headlights and the glasshouse area are slimmer, giving the car a sportier look. SV variant gets a healthy splash of carbon fibre trim all around.  The SV version, which is dialled up further, has broader air intakes at the bumper’s edges, reprofiled lower sides and functional quad-exit tailpipes. And, of course, there’s plenty of carbon fibre: from the aforementioned 23-inch rims to trim bits around the tailpipes, as well as for the front bumper slats, grille, and hood and side vents. There’s also the option of a carbon-fibre hood. Then there are vivid colours for the body and brake calipers, too, that you can also spec. All in all, to these eyes at least, the SV does the sport look just right, not too much but not too little either. Range Rover Sport SV Space and Comfort: 7/10 Spacious insides are more luxurious than outright sporty The insides look luxurious with a minimalistic styling theme, though it’s almost to the point of being quite bland, especially so for those who like things blinged-up. The dashboard is presented as a large, clean surface upon which a 13.1-inch touchscreen is placed. The central console, too, has its cubbies closed off and just a small stubby gear lever sticking out. Being the SV, there are some sporty bits like illuminated SV logos on the backrests and edge-illuminated paddle shifters, but on the whole, the interior does not scream sport. The cabin is classy, but some will find the minimalistic style bland. The SV also debuts JLR’s new ‘body and soul seats’ (BASS), which, as the acronym suggests, generate audio vibrations corresponding to the media played on the 29-speaker Meridian sound system. Available on the front seats only, there are also six different soundscapes – designed in collaboration with the National Transport Design Centre at Coventry University and the School of Media and Performing Arts – that combine sound and vibrations to relax or energise you. It’s hard to accurately describe the feeling, but it’s somewhere between a massage and a vibrating seat. Speaking of the seats, I found the lumbar a touch extra, but seating space both at the front and rear is ample enough. Range Rover Sport SV Features and Safety: 8/10 The Sport SV Edition Two trim comes well equipped The car we had in the UK was the ‘Edition Two’ spec, which meant it was well-equipped with bits like digital LED headlights, illuminated metal treadplates, 4-zone climate control, a 13.1-inch touchscreen, Meridian signature sound, 3D surround cameras, remote park assist, HUD, and heated ventilated and reclining seats at the front and rear. As for safety equipment, it has six airbags and a full ADAS suite, which works just fine on UK roads. Range Rover Sport SV Price and Verdict: 8/10 The Sport SV is certainly the most capable all-rounder in the JLR fleet Super SUVs of today are remarkable feats of engineering that have to deliver on diverse fronts: they have to be large and spacious like family SUVs, comfy like luxury sedans and quick like sports cars. So, they come at a price; in this one’s case, that’s Rs 2.95 crore ex-showroom, India. It’s a lot, but no more – in fact, exactly the same – as the Audi RS Q8 Performance, and in that aspect, it’s a fair ask. It’s the Sport SV’s breadth of talents that is truly impressive. It’s wanting in some places for sure. Like around corners, it’s not very agile, and ride quality, too, is not as pliant as some rivals. But while it cedes ground on dynamics, it gains in many areas. The interior, for example, is spacious and comfy, with a luxurious and classy feel. Outside, the styling is sleek and sporty, with a nice, elegant flair to it, and then, given its family lineage, the Range Rover Sport SV also has some off-roading chops baked into its DNA – 23-inch rims notwithstanding – and, in the end, that’s where its appeal lies. It’s the most capable all-rounder in the JLR portfolio and, against rivals, has a truly wide set of talents.

    "description": "Royal Enfield has substantially increased the price of its cross-spoke wheels offered as an accessory for the Himalayan 450. The price has risen from Rs 12,424 to Rs 40,645. It is no longer as affordable for existing Himalayan buyers, but will continue to be offered at the same price for those who bundle it with their Himalayan purchase. First-time Himalayan 450 buyers can still get the cross-spoke wheels for Rs 11,000 if bundled with the bike. Earlier, it was priced at Rs 12,424 for existing owners Royal Enfield Himalayan 450’s cross-spoke wheel colours It is available in three different colours The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is one of the few affordable adventure tourers offered with cross-spoke wheels. At launch, these wheels received immense appreciation for their pricing. They were introduced at just Rs 12,424 for existing Himalayan owners looking to upgrade from the stock tubed wheel setup to cross-spoke wheels. Royal Enfield had managed to price them so competitively that they even undercut the cost of most tubeless-conversion kits. However, Royal Enfield has now substantially increased the price. Previously priced at Rs 12,424, the cross-spoke wheels now cost Rs 40,645. That said, this revised pricing appears to apply only to existing owners purchasing the wheels as an accessory. First-time buyers who bundle the cross-spoke wheels with their new Himalayan purchase can still avail them at a significantly lower price of Rs 11,000. These cross-spoke wheels are available in three colours—black, black olive, and gold—to better match the variants, with no price difference between them. Given this steep price hike, many existing Himalayan owners who had planned to upgrade to the tubeless cross-spoke setup may now reconsider. The Himalayan 450 is priced between Rs 2.85 lakh and Rs 2.98 lakh (ex-showroom) and is powered by a 452cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine producing 40hp and 40Nm. It comes mated to a six-speed gearbox. Also see: KTM 390 Adventure X to get cruise control and updated electronics soon",

    "description": "The automotive industry has had quite a week, from news about government policy on small cars and two wheelers, to new car and bike launches. We take a quick look at the highlights of the week that was. New car launches Tata Harrier EV While the entry-level Harrier EV’s price was revealed early this month, Tata has now revealed the full price list of its flagship electric SUV. The Tata Harrier EV’s price range is Rs 21.49 lakh-28.99 lakh, not inclusive of the cost of a fast charger and installation. Crash test results for the Mahindra XEV 9e rival were also announced; the Harrier EV scored a full 5-star BNCAP safety rating. Mahindra Scorpio N with ADAS The Mahindra Scorpio N now gets a Level 2 ADAS suite. Available only on the top-spec Z8L variant, prices for the Scorpio N with ADAS range between Rs 21.35 lakh-25.42 lakh.

Prices start at Rs 23.52 lakh for the Indian Chief and go up to Rs 48.49 lakh for the Indian Roadmaster. New government policy ABS likely to be mandatory on all new bikes and scooters The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is likely to announce that ABS is mandatory for all new two-wheelers sold in India from January 2026, regardless of engine capacity. In addition, it will be mandatory for dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with every new vehicle. Government mulling easing CAFE norms for small cars The Indian government is reportedly considering easing CAFE norms for small cars – defined as cars weighing less than 1,000kg. Carmakers that stand to benefit include Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Renault, Tata Motors, Toyota, Honda, and Citroen. No toll charges for bikes and scooters The Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have clarified that reports on toll being levied on two-wheelers from July 15 onwards are false.
