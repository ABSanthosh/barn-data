Try drawing a pick-up truck with your non-writing hand and I’d bet you’d come up with something closely resembling the Tesla Cybertruck, a true automotive alien in just how different it is to every single vehicle on the road.Maybe Elon Musk did such a thing himself and nobody dared challenge him, and it just ended up in showrooms in raw form, so absolute is his power. Maybe he is simply goading legislators and legislation in the US that somehow allow a sharp-edged, flat-fronted vehicle you would not want to crash into you, however or whatever you’re travelling in, to be legally sold, to check their small print. Maybe he’s an alien, and this is just a Ford Mondeo where he comes from? The blurb says it can travel on any planet, after all; how could they know how it’d handle the Saturn ring road?Not normally one to entertain conspiracy theories, I had my doubts about whether the Cybertruck really did exist, and whether you could actually drive such a thing on public roads. In America at least, for crash legislation in the UK and EU rightly and thankfully prevents the Cybertruck’s sale here. Trust me, you’d agree if you ran your finger over one of its sharp edges. Yet it is real: when you do see your first one on the road, your jaw drops and your eyes track it for as long as possible.",

    "description": "25m-high jumps become reality at Monster Jam University Part drag car, part rally car, part low-flying aircraft. So we yump it “You’re going to catch some air,” says Tristan England, driver of the JCB Digatron Monster Jam truck, the subject of this year’s Christmas road test. This was unexpected. If you’ll excuse the behind-the-scenes indulgence, sometimes we get a brief go in a Christmas road test vehicle, sometimes an extended run, but often – if it’s, say, the Space Shuttle – no go at all. Our first nose around the Digatron was in JCB’s test and demonstration quarry in Staffordshire, which is full of sharp immovable objects and very much ‘no go’ territory. But, suggested JCB, if you can come to the broad expanse of Monster Jam University, that can be amended. I expected to arrive there and be given a short pootle around a yard. Instead, as I pull on fireproof race overalls, England tells me: “It’s going to be a thrill rush the whole time. Your adrenaline is going to be pumping.” Autocar is going to learn to jump a monster truck. The JCB Digatron is one of the newest trucks running in Monster Jam, the world’s biggest monster truck series. Founded in 1992, the series easily fills huge stadiums with truck competitions that feature racing, two-wheel skills and freestyle stunt elements. Before Monster Jam arrived, monster trucks were for the most part ordinary trucks with big lift kits and agricultural tyres, and would travel around the US putting on shows that featured, say, driving over scrap cars. Today’s Monster Jam truck is a far more serious piece of kit, a bespoke bit of engineering, and Monster Jam itself is a vast enterprise that operates dozens of trucks across multiple events, each with tens of thousands of spectators, frequently at the same time. It’s not unusual for there to be three, four or even five different Monster Jam events taking place at once across different stadiums, eight trucks competing at each. It’s a big business, family-friendly entertainment, and the trucks need to be extremely robust, specially engineered for reliability and durability, to perform at a level that, as England says, “can give the fans an event of a lifetime”. It’s why one of the very newest from the box, the JCB Digatron, is a worthy subject for this year’s Christmas road test. Design and engineering Monster Jam trucks measure 5.5m long and around 3.2m to 3.6m tall and, for the most part, the dozens that Monster Jam runs are the same as each other, save for the fact that one might look like a van and another a dog. They all have a steel spaceframe chassis with the engine in the middle. It’s an 8.8-litre (540cu in) drag motor that burns methanol and makes in the region of 1320bhp. (US horses being the same as ours, there’s no need for a clumsy conversion.) The motor exists to be incredibly powerful but also surprisingly durable because it must deliver oil when the truck is, say, standing on its nose for an extended period, or doing a double backflip. Essentially, it’s a modified big-block Chevy motor, wet-sumped but with various baffles and wells to keep oil flowing, and it must be very well built because they only need stripping down once every 20 hours of use. Most mechanicals are control parts and Monster Jam looks after them, so if something blows up, whatever part is next in line is installed into that truck. The performance differences are negligible. The engine drives through a two-speed (plus reverse) torque-converter automatic transmission, permanent four-wheel drive, to live axles that start out as military-grade but are beefed up in Monster Jam’s Florida factory, where all the trucks are made. Braking is by discs acting on the prop shafts, one ahead of each differential. The Digatron runs mechanical limited-slip differentials front and rear: one of the few mechanical differences between trucks is that some drivers like to run a spool (locked) rear differential, but England prefers a slipper. There are eight nitrogen-filled spring/dampers units, two on each corner, offering 76cm of travel, with leading and trailing arms locating the front and rear suspension respectively. Steering is hydraulically actuated and incorporates a shock-bypass system so that big hits aren’t fed back to the steering wheel. This means straight ahead on the wheel is not necessarily where you left it before you turned, because the steering wheel and front wheels are linked by fluid. There’s also active rear steer, though it doesn’t just turn the wheels the opposite way to the fronts. With the same maximum steer angle as the front wheels, they’re turned independently via a switch beneath the driver’s right thumb. Intelligent use of rear steer not only makes a Monster Jam truck able to crab sideways or shorten its turning circle, but the good people of Monster Jam University tell me it’s also the fastest-doughnuting race car the world, and that I’ll find out later. Wheels are 25x43in alloys with bead-locked BKT tyres, specifically designed ‘for monster truck use only’, as it says on the sidewalls, wonderfully. Monster Jam tested a few design iterations before settling on this one. They’re pumped to 22psi and their behaviour differs depending on the type of dirt. brought into the stadium. On a fine dry dirt, they’ll wash out easily, but if it’s a little more clammy, they generate more lateral grip. Plus they last basically forever. Monster Jam doesn’t travel with its own dirt but it has to filter what it sources locally so that spinning tyres don’t fire stones into the crowd. Similarly, unwanted flying debris is the main reason they don’t run over scrap cars any more. Part of the spectator appeal is that, while very similar inside, Monster Jam trucks make a play of looking different on the outside. (It’s good for toy replica sales too.) So there are different roll-cage designs to accommodate. The Digatron’s JCB-designed bodywork, reminiscent of a backhoe digger, gives it good visibility because of the amount of clear polycarbonate on it. Not that, once you’re ensconced in the cockpit, you can see a great deal. Interior  At more than six feet off the ground, it’s quite the clamber up to the Digatron’s cabin, especially if they’ve taken off the bottom step of the aluminium ladder, making it an awkward scramble. Your correspondent is approaching 50 and I could just get my foot onto the bottom rung of the ladder, then by gripping the top step haul myself up and through the lightweight polycarbonate-clad door and into a mostly harsh cockpit. One only normally gets in from the left because there’s switchgear to the right, though you could climb out through the right side if you had to. In an unusually luxurious nod, the Digatron’s aluminium seat is the only Monster Jam driver’s seat with a red leather cushion, because JCB’s diggers traditionally had them. The steering wheel is meant to mimic a JCB excavator’s too. England and I are a similar height so I can easily reach the two pedals in front of me – a large brake and floor-hinged throttle, which has a hook over the top of it so one’s foot doesn’t slip off the pedal during manoeuvres. There’s no need to brace oneself because the seat holds the driver so tightly. There is a five-point harness, with the cleverest way of adjusting the lap belts that I’ve yet seen: a ratchet, seemingly from a socket set, is mounted each side to click it tight, which if you’re used to hauling on a lap belt strap is a godsend. Once I’ve tightened the shoulder straps down over a Hans device, my range of head movement is extremely limited. There are also large bolsters to the left and right of my head, essential for limiting movement when the cabin is subjected to 10g-plus impacts. One has to rely on peripheral vision for some of the switchgear. Fortunately, it’s not like there’s a complicated touchscreen by your knees or anything, so the controls are very straightforward. England advises that I palm the steering wheel with my left hand, which steers the front wheels, while keeping my right hand on an upright metal handle, topped with a small left-right toggle switch, which turns the rears. A finger stretch in front of that, a second toggle switch has two positions: pushed forwards, the rear wheels automatically recentre when you stop thumbing the switch; flicked backwards, the rear wheels retain whatever angle you've left them. It's primarily used for doughnuts. There is a push-to-talk radio button, a screen with rev counter and, most importantly, a temperature gauge. On a bank of switches to the right of my head, there are cut-off, ignition and starter switches, plus those for fans, fuel pump and lamps. Low to my right is the dog-legged gearlever. It feels to me like a daunting place to sit, an unnatural environment even for somebody who drives a lot of vehicles. And that's even before I start the engine. Performance and handling To start a Monster Jam truck, rotate the big red battery cut-off switch clockwise, flick on the ignition locker and push the start button. Then cower as the big-block race engine behind you vibrates your internal organs, and don’t forget to flick the supplementary switches to bring the fans and fuel pump into life. The noise is uncomfortable. It’s quite a smooth engine but it’s loud, idling at around 2000rpm, with a quick blip of the throttle taking it to 5000rpm. But it’s a deep, stomach- and chest-troubling sound rather than an ear-splitting one. Put your foot on the brake, haul the transmission back to first gear and, as you ease off the long-travel, steadily weighted brake pedal, the Digatron will creep forwards like a conventional automatic, on idle at a little over walking pace. I’m doing this while England instructs me over the radio – at low revs, anyway. I won’t hear him when the taps are open. I turn the front wheels and the Digatron will respond, but it weighs 5.6 tonnes and the huge tyres are squishy, so it takes quite a lot of time for things to happen. “You have to turn early,” England has advised me already. Rear-wheel steering makes a massive difference to responsiveness. Without it, to an extent I suppose it’s a bit like turning a trials car without using the independent rear brakes, or trying to turn a jet ski without much power on: not much happens. With more power applied, the soft suspension and big tyres squat down, permitting weight to fall to the outside rear wheel, getting the Digatron’s power to the ground much more readily and shifting its attitude that way. At a little over 230bhp per tonne, the power-to-weight ratio is similar to a Porsche Cayenne Turbo’s. But because the rotational masses are so much higher, it will take longer to get going and, crucially, to get stopping. I’m aware of those inertias when I’m driving it, even though I’m in a large area set aside for monster truck driver training. I find it impossible to know exactly how fast I’m going, perhaps because the environment is so unfamiliar, because I’m so far from the ground, or because of the body movements. If you watch Monster Jam videos, you’ll note the trucks don’t run at full throttle for very long. Even 5.6 tonnes will quickly pick up speed and run out of space in an arena. It is therefore one of the most dramatic yet also one of the slower motorsports. A monster truck doing amazing things at 30mph looks and feels more exciting than most single-seaters going 100mph faster, which I suspect is partly the closed environment. What I can say is that when England instructs me to “make some noise”, it gets very unsettling, very quickly, with rough terrain knocking wheels from the ground, the bumpy ride making vision blurry in an assault of vibration and noise. And all I'm doing is getting to know how it steers while doing some figure of eights around two tyres. The only time I ever cantered on a horse I imagine it looked relatively undramatic for spectators, but from the saddle I was overwhelmed, petrified and clinging on because it felt like the least bad option. I'm enjoying the Digatron more but finding it similarly overwhelming, with a Nascar/drag engine noise meeting a hybrid of agricultural equipment, haulage and race car engineering and huge inertia or momentum. The combination of them all takes, one imagines, some getting used to. I'm told we should do some holeshots (standing starts) so I can feel the full acceleration. I'm relatively familiar with these from the day job and the procedure is much the same as in a torque-converter automatic car. I put a foot on the brake pedal, gently ease the throttle down to wind some tension in the transmission, then have to put my foot harder on the brake because it just wants to drive forwards. England pops a light from red to green at the end of a strip, I sidestep the brake and mash the throttle. He tells me that almost as soon as I'm moving, I should shift from first to second and that I'll feel a kick in the back as I do it, which I don't. Nor do I notice a difference in engine note. In both cases that's because, I think, it’s too much of a rush. Later, looking at the back of Jack Harrison’s camera, I can see the nose dip and then rise again. In the moment, there’s too much noise, blur, drama, squat and a soupçon of terror that if I don’t quite have the wheels straight, I could veer onto a nearby ramp or into a lake. And because there’s no self-centring or feel from the front wheels, I’ve only the Digatron’s general trajectory to guide me. I try it a few times until I’m more familiar with it. My briefing notes say that next I’ll try a “1-2 shift over ramp”. When I first read that, I took it to mean I’d get a feel of what it’s like to run up and down a slope, but it transpires that means I’ll be getting air under the tyres. Like an airport marshal, England guides me backwards to a decent starting position. There’s to be a holeshot towards a ramp and, as soon as I’m in the air, I’m told, I should lift off the throttle. This means that the engine won’t be revving into the stratosphere. But, more importantly, the wheel and tyre combo is heavy (each weighs 300kg-plus here) and their rotational inertia can make quite a big difference to the attitude of the truck while it’s in the air. Ideally, one would land on all four wheels at once. If I smash the throttle in mid-air, that will pitch the truck backwards; if I tap the brakes, it will pitch the truck forwards. What I absolutely don’t want to do is land while touching the brakes because that will be “a $9000 landing” as it puts such a strain and shock through the transmission that it will break something, and it will cost £7000 to put it right. With that warning ringing in my ears, away I go. I build up some tension in the torque converter, wait for a green light, give it death, whump into a ramp that I promise feels much bigger than it looks, and lift off when I get airborne. On my first attempt, I think I lift before I should because the Digatron lands slightly front wheels first and it’s a little uncomfortable. I tighten my belts and am told to try again. Run two feels better. The sort of better that I’ll still be talking about as career highlights long after I’ve retired. “You know, I once raced an Aston Martin in a 24-hour race and rode a Harley-Davidson over the Golden Gate Bridge for work,” I’ll be boring people. “And I once jumped a monster truck.” Sure, it only went about five feet in the air but it landed so square and rolled out so smoothly that I barely felt it come down. I doubt I’ve whooped so loudly since I was a small child watching a monster truck drive over a scrap Vauxhall Nova. I think I’ve gone miles. Of course I haven’t. The next morning England shows us just how high and far a Monster Jam truck can really go.  Buying and owning Monster Jam runs two JCB Digatrons, one on its North American tour with Tristan England at the wheel and one that is on an international tour. That one’s in JCB’s Staffordshire visitor centre now if you’d like to see it. At around £300,000, they’re not prohibitively expensive machines. But like buying an old fighter plane, it’s not the cost to buy that’s the difficult bit, but finding ways to use it. Monster Jam’s organisation makes that as easy as it can. With race wheels swapped for smaller conveyancing ones, trucks drive easily into shipping containers; race trucks are accompanied by lorries with spare parts, and there are teams of mechanics, so it’s rare that a truck is rendered unable to complete an event. Fuel consumption is lumpy at three gallons a minute, but the tyres will last as long as you need them.  Verdict Monster trucks have come a long way since the 1970s, when they were lifted regular trucks wearing some kind of agricultural tyre. Today’s truck is a piece of precision engineering that straddles a number of forms of motorsport. The engine is straight out of a drag car, yet has to run longer, more durably, and sometimes at 90deg to the road. And it won’t get a rebuild for 20 hours. The chassis and suspension are as beefy as a military or agricultural vehicle’s. But the steering system attached needs to respond quickly, accurately and predictably time and again. Even if the driver has just failed to land a double backflip. Then there’s the driving environment, which is one of the harshest in motordom. Sure, some rally cars will go faster, or deeper into dust and dirt, and they have offs too. But they won’t have to protect their occupants from rollovers after deliberate 25m-high jumps, with six tonnes of machine pressing down on their own roofs. A Monster Jam truck needs to have all of the durability of a piece of construction equipment, the crash-readiness and integrity of rally car, and the engine note of a drag car. It’s a unique piece of motorsport engineering and one of the most compelling there is to see, hear and drive. Sensational fun to watch, even more so to drive.",

    "description": "STG Tracker is one of the most versatile custom workshops in operation today. The Argentine duo of Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp works on myriad makes and models, constantly flitting between different build styles. So if you give them carte blanche on a project, you can bet they’ll deliver something highly imaginative—like a Royal Enfield bobber with a bespoke frame and a dazzling livery. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 [known as the INT650 in the USA] is a cracking donor bike for a custom build. It’s not crazy expensive, its parallel twin engine is easy to get along with, and it looks great out of the box with lots of room for tweaking. But for Marcelo and Germán, this particular project called for something more… “A client came to us asking to make a bobber out of his Interceptor 650, but it had to be different,” Marcelo tells us.…",

    "description": "Right-sized premium. That’s how I’d describe the Audi Q3, and for me, this is a brilliant formula for a city like Mumbai. You want a car that’s manageable through the narrow and crowded streets but also something that isolates you from the chaos in a nice premium ambience, and that’s what the Q3 does well.  Despite the sloping roofline, the Q3 Sportback can take in large cargo easily. The dimensions are just right, placing it between the Creta and Hector; the steering is light and easy, and the ride is comfortable. Perfect, then, for chaotic city streets with surfaces in various states of (dis)repair. And then there’s the insides, which I really like a lot. Some will find the interior lacking flash and dazzle, but I really like these straightforward, sensible and quality interiors. This may be the baby of the Q range in India, but there’s no skimping on quality. The insides are very well made with high-quality bits, and the switches and controls operate with a nice heft. But what I really like about the insides is that everything is so logical, and that, surprisingly, is a hard thing to find these days.  The centre console is so logically designed. Oddly, that’s a rarity these days. There’s the option of traditional dials on the digital IP, and the design is clear and easily legible. And then there’s the centre console, which has everything so well laid out. I think I posted on Instagram some time ago about this being the perfect centre console. The touchscreen is neatly integrated into the dash and very easy to reach with a natural drop-down of your hand from the steering wheel. Below that is an HVAC button bank; physical controls are always welcome, and these fall easily to hand as well. And the dials operate with a click, which is easily felt and audible, too. The leather/leatherette combo has no perforation, and the seats aren’t ventilated. Below that is the media controller, placed closer to the passenger; the driver, after all, has steering controls. Below that is another button bank for the drive-mode selection – again, far better than touch controls – and the buttons are large and easy to hit while on the move. USB ports are easy to access and right next to the phone storage cubby, which is deep enough for larger phones and has a recess to keep the phone in place. So yes, oddly specific as this may seem, the Q3 centre console is really well-designed – not something you can take for granted these days.   HVAC knobs feel great and operate with a quality feeling and sounding click. The seats are comfortable and supportive, though I would have liked them to be cooled, and the material isn’t perforated either; so you can get sweaty on a hot day. The rear is a comfy place to be, but my son, who is now taller than me, does find the headroom tight; that’s the trade-off you make with the Sportback.  It misses out on a 360-degree camera, and the rear view camera isn’t very sharp. Speaking of the Sportback, I had to transport a large wheelchair recently, which, in our long-term Creta, pretty much filled the boot. While Audi says the internal volume of the Sportback and the SUV-body-style Q3 is identical at 530 litres, I thought the tapering roofline might pose a problem for the large box. But it fit very easily inside the boot. So, the boot does take in a lot, and this is with a space-saver spare below. I’ve got a trip to Goa coming up soon, and as I write this, I’m beginning to think that the Q3 would make a good car for it. The 190hp, 2.0-litre TFSI engine is a delight. Sure, handling isn’t sharp; it’s more neutral, but that’s fine. With my daughter quite prone to motion sickness, I hardly carve up the corners, and even if I do indulge in some spirited driving, I think the Q3 will have tidy body control and thus reduce the chances of motion sickness. If I do end up taking this to Goa, I will include it in the next report.

    "description": "The Honda Elevate CVT entered our long-term fleet at a time when a number of its segment rivals were already present. But while the others were in demand – the Hyundai Creta IVT for its easy-going nature, the Toyota Hyryder for its frugal strong-hybrid and the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 TSI for its performance – the Elevate was, in a way, overlooked. When the time came for me to hand over the keys to the Creta and take the Honda, I was intrigued to see what it had to offer. Having spent over a month with it, here’s what my experience has been like. Responsive and peppy 1.5 engine is fun in traffic, allowing you to close gaps quickly. Starting from the exterior, I’m a big fan of the way this SUV looks. The tall, squared-off stance, the imposing grille and the minimalist yet stylish rear end all look cohesive and give it a really good road presence. You jump in, and things get even better. The dashboard has a neat, uncluttered layout, and there aren’t too many textures and colours, which I like. The wood panel on the dash is tasteful, and so is the tan colour for the upholstery. The slick touchscreen has been glitch-free. The seats are also supremely comfy and support you in all the right places. However, I find the lumbar a bit excessive, and I would have liked the seats to have ventilation and power adjustment. My parents also appreciated the easy access to the rear seat and the space offered here. Overall, I really grew to appreciate the Elevate’s mature demeanour. And that goes for the way it drives, too. Bonnet flares help you place the car in tight spots. The ride is well-judged, as the Elevate just takes road imperfections in its stride and feels composed doing so. The engine, though a bit noisy, is eager to respond, which helps in darting through the gaps in traffic. This, coupled with the elevated seating and easy-to-twirl steering, means it’s a breeze in traffic. What’s also really useful are the flares on either end of the bonnet, which help you place the car. These are particularly useful, as it doesn’t have a front camera or parking sensors that should have been there. It lacks plenty of features, such as cooled seats, pano sunroof, 360-degree camera, etc.. Fuel efficiency has also been respectable, hovering around the 10-11kpl mark in the city. In our time with this SUV, the efficiency rarely dipped to single digits, which is impressive because it has no mild-hybrid assist or fuel-saving auto start/stop tech. What’s also nice is that the on-board computer is quite accurate with its economy readings. In my short time, I wasn’t able to stretch the Elevate’s legs on a highway, but drives on Mumbai’s eastern freeway and the new coastal road point to a good road trip companion, especially considering it also has a class-leading 480-litre boot. Despite no hybrid or auto start/stop tech, its efficiency remained around 10-11kpl. However, there are things that I haven’t gelled well with. The audio system is not good, especially since I’m moving from the Creta, which has a great-sounding Bose system. The other irritant is that you have to turn off the ADAS functions every time you start the car, unlike the Creta, in which it stays off. And I have to do that given Mumbai’s chaotic roads. It’s also only a camera-based system and not the more sophisticated radar-based system offered by rivals. Then there’s the feed from the cameras, which is low-res and choppy. Speaking of which, the blind-view camera’s feed appears on the touchscreen, so you lose the navigation feed for a few seconds when you’re about to make a turn. Moving from the Creta also highlights the paucity of features. Even in top-spec ZX form, it misses out on kit, such as a 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, electric handbrake, drive modes and more. Even the roof liner is woven and not the more premium, knitted type. Seat cushioning is very well-judged; it will take the pain out of a long journey. But while I did miss these features, the little things I did appreciate were the tactile switches for the AC controls, which don’t require me to take my eyes off the road, and the neat, well-executed and customisable part-digital instrument cluster. So, on the whole, it’s a car that’s got the fundamentals right, and it grows on you in a jack-of-all-trades way. And while it’s a frill-free SUV, it’s a fuss-free one, too.

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km and 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "The new Skoda Superb will be shown in India for the first time in January at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo alongside the new Kodiaq and Octavia RS. The fourth-gen Superb debuted globally in late 2023 and is more of an evolution of the outgoing third-gen car.  The new Superb has Skoda’s ‘Modern Solid’ design theme It shares a lot of interior bits with the new Kodiaq Likely to have a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol unit; diesel mill a possibility, too  New Skoda Superb is familiar yet new The new Superb looks more stylish than its predecessor and draws from the brand’s Modern Solid design language that incorporates angular, sharply drawn lines with a mix of traditional Skoda cues. Inside, the new Superb gets the ‘smart dial’ controls on the dashboard, just like the ones seen on the second-gen Kodiaq. These controls can be customised for different functions according to user preferences. It also gets some physical buttons on the dashboard, while a majority of functions have moved to the new 13-inch infotainment screen, which is again similar to the new Kodiaq. Under the hood, the Superb comes with multiple petrol and diesel engine options, depending on the market. For India, we expect the 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 204hp or 265hp output.  New Skoda Superb will be sold as a full import in India Just like the outgoing Superb, which was reintroduced as a full import last year, the new-gen car being displayed at the show will also be launched in India as a fully imported unit. Skoda confirmed this development to us a few months ago. The key reason, as reported earlier, is the shifting of the Superb’s production facility from Kvasiny, Czechia, to the VW Group’s plant in Bratislava, Slovakia. The Bratislava plant does not have a facility to build CKD (completely knocked down) kits of the Superb and can only produce complete vehicles for local sale and exports.  For India, too, local assembly won’t be cost-effective. The previous-gen Superb, which was locally assembled, struggled to cross monthly sales of 400 units. The fully imported third-gen Superb launched last year has also been finding it tough to attract customers, with some unsold units being offered at tempting discounts that bring the car’s price almost on par with the locally assembled version. Though the fourth-gen Superb will be imported as completely built units, some small changes will have to be carried out, such as ADAS calibration for Indian conditions, which will add to costs. Skoda could bring back the Superb diesel via the CBU route to attract diesel loyalists. But all in all, the idea of bringing the fourth-gen Superb even as a full import would turn out to be highly expensive. Expect more details on the Superb’s India launch at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo, which starts on January 17.
