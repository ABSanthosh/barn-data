    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/buy-low-cell-high-what-look-out-when-buying-used-ev",
    "description": "You don't have to stick with low-mileage or younger EVs as long as you're realistic about range There are some great used electric car deals to be had at the moment – and cheap prices don’t mean dead batteries It’s been a rollercoaster for the used electric car market over the past few years. In the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the following chip crisis restricting the supply of new cars, some used EVs were commanding more than their original list prices. But with a much broader array of EVs going on sale, decent availability and widespread uncertainty about EVs, prices slid dramatically. Indeed, data from market analyst Cap HPI shows that by September 2024, a three-year-old EV was some 8.5% cheaper to buy than a petrol car of equivalent age and mileage. However, that trend is now changing again. In the latter half of 2024, used EV values stabilised and actually rose very slightly against falling used ICE car values. And the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders recorded more than 53,400 used electric car sales in the third quarter of 2024, a rise of 57% on the same period in 2023, so the lower prices are certainly driving demand. This of course is either terrible or brilliant news, depending on whether you’re selling or buying. But regardless of this mercurial market, there has never been such a great variety of used EVs at such low prices, so now is a superb time to buy before those prices rise any further. What to look out for when buying a used EV The golden rules for buying a used EV are much the same as for a used ICE car: checking for even gaps and matching paint across all the panels for signs of accident damage, reading its previous MOT test reports and running thorough checks on its history for finance, theft or other misdemeanours. All of that still stands. Right, now for the big thing: the battery. This is what worries most buyers. We all know that batteries degrade over time and usage, yet very few EVs offer a battery health readout on the dashboard. We would be the first to point out to legislators that a clear battery health readout would be very simple for manufacturers to provide and should be mandated in order to improve buyer confidence. There’s no reason why checking battery life on your EV shouldn’t be just as simple as checking the battery life on your phone. But, frustratingly, it’s not. And it’s understandable why that makes people edgy about buying a used EV. The thing to remember is that EV battery longevity is very good these days, and as a rough guide you should expect one (regardless of whether it uses nickel-manganese-cobalt or lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry) to lose roughly 1.6% to 2.0% of capacity each year. You can buy OBD-port readers that you can plug into an EV in order to get a read on its battery health, but even that can be a bit inaccurate, as it’s affected by the battery’s temperature at the time you take the reading, whether it has been fully cycled prior to testing and the OBD device’s own vagaries. It’s still absolutely worth doing if you’re confident enough to take a device along when viewing a car you’re considering, but even better advice is to buy from a reputable dealer who is happy to provide a detailed report on the car’s battery health. As a rough guide for battery health and range potential, you can of course go by the range readout on the car’s dash. Bear in mind that it will be affected by how the car has been driven previously, and some models are rather optimistic when fully charged (early Stellantis EVs are particularly guilty of this). Going by the car’s long-term efficiency and calculating range from that tends to give a more realistic average real-world range. Owners’ clubs are also a great place to ask for feedback on a used EV’s realistic range. If battery health is a concern, then a lower-mileage EV that hasn’t been rapid-charged too frequently is likely to be the best choice, but don’t discount high-mileage cars, because you may be pleasantly surprised by the battery health and real-world range even on a well-used EV. Indeed, I drove a nine-year-old, 260,000-mile Tesla Model S that still had 84% of its original battery capacity remaining despite a life spent at Superchargers (Autocar, 6 November 2024). So don’t feel that you have to stick with low-mileage or younger EVs; just look for one that has a realistic range that suits your lifestyle. Martin Miller of EV Experts, a specialist dealership in Surrey, points out that heating systems are another area worth checking on a used EV: “The air-con and heating systems are 400V, so to put a new air-con pump in an EV can cost £1000. We recently paid £2200 for a heating element on a Jaguar I-Pace.  It’s one area that can be very expensive.”Suspension wear is something else to look out for, especially on higher-mileage cars: “An EV is still a car, that means that miles do matter. Although not in the same way as an ICE car, where the engine and gearbox are subject to wear each mile, you still need to look for wear in the suspension and braking systems.” Listen out for clunks and creaks from suspension – especially as EVs are heavier than equivalent ICE cars so can wear suspension parts a touch faster. Brake pads often last far longer on EVs than on ICE cars, given the presence of regenerative braking systems, but pads should be a routine check on any used car purchase regardless of age, mileage and power source. Ditto the tyres, of course. In short, the options out there for those buying a used EV are better than ever. Just try to buy from a reputable dealer who knows what they’re talking about and can provide a thorough battery health report. Make sure to look for a car that offers at least 10-15% more real-world range than you routinely need and a used EV needn’t be a scary prospect.",

    "title": "DS should consider its past while shaping its future",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/ds-should-consider-its-past-while-shaping-its-future",
    "description": "The firm's design boss says it would be a \"dream\" to take on brands like Bentley and Rolls-Royce in the future If you thought that DS was optimistic in believing it was a rival to premium brands such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz, I wonder what you made of the news that it would in future like to become “the Louis Vuitton of the automotive industry”, rubbing shoulders with Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Let’s take it seriously for a moment. DS design director Thierry Métroz acknowledges that this is a “dream”, that it could take the brand another 10 years to achieve (on top of the 10 for which it has existed in its present form) and that it ultimately might never get there. I’ll be amazed if it does – and it won’t do so by taking existing Stellantis platforms and tweaking them a bit, no matter how much the interiors, like that of the new N°8 crossover, are “more like Bentley than our German competitors” and regardless of how many key parts are changed. Pushing back windscreens and lowering rooflines won’t be particularly persuasive. True luxury is also territory never before occupied by a DS – not even one of the most striking cars in existence, the original Citroën DS19 of 1955. That’s pretty old history, it’s true, but if they thought it didn’t matter, they wouldn’t have reused the DS name in the first place. When new, the DS19 cost £150 more than other Citroën models, at over £1400. That turned out to be too expensive for many buyers in its home market, yet it wasn’t even near luxury pricing. The Bentley Continental of the day cost £3295 and the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud £3395, off the peg. By the time they had been to a coachbuilder, they could cost much more. The DS19 was never in that sphere. It was advertised as “one of the world’s most advanced cars” at the same time as a Rolls-Royce was being marketed as “the best car in the world”. Could a modern DS be one of the world’s most advanced cars? Perhaps, but even if DS were, say, the first brand within the Stellantis group to be given the newest battery or motor technology, it would have to offer a tremendous advantage, of the sort that’s harder to come by today, to cut through. Besides, would the average car buyer even know, remember or care that the original DS was about new technology? What they would do is remember the way it looked. It’s a unique, beautiful and in some ways still futuristic shape 70 years on. You don’t have to be a car nerd to know and appreciate the design. It strikes me as odd, then, for Métroz to bang on about interior materials or “an attractive design with a lot of character” as DS makes a car that, while making a couple of tiny nods to the original, doesn’t have overtly identifiable cues, stance or lines, nor its impossible elegance. The N°8 doesn’t look to me like a 21st-century DS19. You might disagree. But if I’d been shown it without badges and asked who it was made by, I’d have answered: “Haven’t a clue, mate.” To avoid retro cues is clearly deliberate. As Citroën design chief Pierre Leclercq said last week about the brand potentially reprising the 2CV: “The things you remember from Citroën is not especially that you want to redo the shape of the vehicles that have been good.” That’s laudable enough, because car designers like to design new things. But are new things what customers want to buy? Keeping shapes but changing philosophy seems a safer bet. Take the Land Rover Defender, Fiat 500 and Mini: models that spent time out of production and don’t do the same things they started out doing but are easily identifiable as modern iterations of decades-old designs. Entering this arena, too, is the Renault 5.  It won a couple of big awards recently, but what will please Renault most is that nearly 10,000 examples left French showrooms last month. Perhaps I’m exposing the reason why I don’t run a car company. But if I intended to restart the DS brand and wanted to push it as far upmarket as I could, I think the first thing I’d do is actually make a new DS.",

    "description": "The latest addition to our long-term garage is the TVS Apache RTR 310 and, unfortunately, the recent heap of launches and the Auto Expo left me with very little time with it. Due to this, I’ve only been able to clock a little over 100km on it. During that time, I used it for my commutes to work and a quick grocery run or two.  There’s no denying the Apache RTR 310 is a cool-looking motorcycle, forcing me to turn back each time I’ve parked it. While its design may seem a little too in your face and youthful to some, I’ve slowly taken a liking to it. My only gripe is with how busy the overall design can seem, and I would have appreciated a more minimalist approach towards stickering and branding.  The Apache RTR 310’s headlight offers excellent illumination, making night rides a breeze. This is one of the most tech-loaded Apaches one can buy and will require you to be a little tech-savvy to navigate its 5-inch TFT and the plethora of information on display. The RTR 310 has a total of five ride modes, dual-channel ABS, a TPMS, traction control and even cruise control, making it an extremely well-equipped motorcycle for its price. However, its 5-inch TFT can be quite tightly packed with information and, at times, a bit too overwhelming to keep track of on the go. While the seat offers good comfort, its slippery texture leaves you hunting for grip. The seat provides decent comfort, and I am grateful our unit isn’t equipped with the cooling seat option, as we found the hardware of that system to feel quite uncomfortable under the seat padding. The slightly raised pillion seat also provides great support when riding fast. I find that the tank and seat tend to feel slippery, leaving you rocking back and forth under hard acceleration or braking. Perhaps a set of tank grips could be added to omit this.  The reactive throttle means you have to be a lot more cautious and sensitive about your inputs. The majority of my commute is on highways, and this 310cc packs enough poke to keep it fun and engaging. I usually kept the bike in Rain or Urban mode, as these were the calmest modes on offer. But even so, the reactive throttle paired with the short gearing made the Apache RTR 310 almost over-eager and quite KTM-like in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Part of me is still getting acquainted with its snappy mannerisms, and hopefully, this is something that will start to grow on me as time passes. Michelin Road 5 tyres offer great traction, even on our concrete roads. Another thing that has impressed me so far is the immense grip from the top-quality Michelin Road 5 tyres, which provide excellent grip in both dry and wet conditions. I’ve had plenty of experience with these tyres in the past and look forward to clocking more miles on them. Also see: TVS Apache RTR 310 road test, review",

    "description": "Think Maserati, and you’d probably picture a seductive, low-slung sports car or perhaps a sharply suited sedan. The Maserati featured here is of a very different type, shape and form. This is the Grecale, and by virtue of being an SUV, it’s the most India-friendly Maserati you can buy. Maserati Grecale exterior design The Grecale is Maserati’s second SUV after the Levante, which is now in its run-out phase, with production having stopped earlier this year. The Grecale is half a size smaller than the Levante, and in dimensions, it slots in between a Porsche Macan and Cayenne. The Grecale’s job is to fly the Italian flag in a segment crowded by German alternatives, and design is the differentiator. The classic Maserati elements are all there – low-set concave grille, a trio of vents at the sides, the distinctive cut to the glass house and the trident logo on the D-pillar. The Grecale is undoubtedly sporty in its stance and, like the latest Maseratis, looks better in person than it does on screen. To my eyes, though, larger headlights would have given the Grecale a stronger face. Quad exhausts establish the Grecale as something serious at the back. Not to get geeky, but the boomerang shape of the rear running lights and ridge on the bumpers are a visual link to the 3200 GT’s iconic LED lights. All in all, the Grecale looks exotic, and that’s half the job done. Maserati Grecale interior and features Grecale’s interior neatly blends a new-age vibe with an old-world feel. The Grecale is very inviting inside, too, and it’s where old-school Italian craftsmanship meets new-age tech. There’s a generous use of leather all throughout the cabin, and the pattern stitched on the dashboard is a particularly rich touch. In fact, there’s a warmth to the Grecale’s cabin that you wouldn’t get in a Porsche. I’m not entirely sold on the classic analogue clock atop the dash making way for a digital one, but you can shuffle between three clock faces or have the screen display either a compass or a G-meter or brake and throttle measure. Touchscreen climate control is (relatively) easy to use There are three other screens – of course, large in size. The 12.3-inch IP is neat, while the 12.3-inch centre touchscreen is slick to respond, though it has lots to display, so the menus take some getting used to. There’s another 8.8-inch touchscreen lower down for the climate control system, among other functions. Touchscreens for climate control are not an ideal solution, but at least the Maserati’s is among the best of the kind: swipe left or right anywhere on the screen to control blower speed, swipe up or down to adjust the temperature. In effect, you don’t need to take your eyes off the road to aim at a specific area. The Grecale does have its quirks. For instance, while the steering is home to a lot of buttons, including the start-stop and drive mode selector, you won’t find any audio or volume buttons here. That’s because they’re hidden from view, behind the steering spokes. Then, there’s no gear lever at the centre console or Mercedes-like gear stalk behind the steering wheel either. Rather, the Grecale has buttons on the dash for park, reverse, neutral and drive, with dagger-sized paddles mounted on the steering column for gear selection. And when it’s time to exit the car, you’ll realise that there’s no lever to pull; a button does the job. In terms of features, the Grecale gets quite a bit, including a panoramic sunroof, front seat heating and cooling, a head-up display, a 360-degree camera, and three-zone climate control, with many of these being paid options. There’s plenty of kneeroom, but headroom is limited, and the backrest is a tad upright. The Grecale is not an SUV we’d wholeheartedly recommend for chauffeur-driven buyers. The kneeroom is comfortable for six-footers, but the headroom is limited, and the backrest adjust is also missed. Maserati has packaged in a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders as well as storage for a mobile phone, and rear-seat passengers get a dedicated zone for the climate control system. There’s a very usable 535 litres of luggage space behind the rear seats, and flat-fold seats mean the space can be enhanced further. Sadly, there’s no spare tyre. All you get is a puncture-repair kit. Maserati Grecale performance and powertrain The Grecale is available in three flavours. There’s the range-topping GrecaleTrofeo with the 530hp Nettuno 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol engine from the MC20. The Grecale Modena and this Grecale GT aren’t quite as special under the hood. A 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine is the source of power, but it packs in mild-hybrid tech to assist the engine at full load, and there’s also an electric compressor to help bottom-end performance. The numbers sure are promising: 330hp on the Modena and 300hp on this GT. This engine might not be large in absolute terms, but it’s got the soul of a larger engine. It’s got more to give low down in the rev band than you’d expect, and it doesn’t necessarily feel turbocharged as you go further up the rev range. The Grecale always feels light on its feet and very likeable. Find the right road, press down hard on the accelerator, and the Grecale will also rev very urgently to 6,000rpm. The 5.6-second 0-100kph time means that even in this mildest of guises, the Grecale is fast. Top speed is limited to 240kph. The Grecale sends power to all four wheels via ZF’s 8-speed gearbox. You’ll be very tempted to use the feelsome paddle shifters, but the gearbox isn’t lightning-quick in its responses and won’t grant you a high rpm downshift when you really want it. It’s best to leave the gearbox to its own devices. Maserati Grecale handling and ride quality The build of speed is backed up by a nice soundtrack. The engine sounds sweet, and the exhaust note is really wholesome. There is a buzzkill, though, and that’s the speed-warning buzzer. The other thing? The Grecale is quite muted inside and actually sounds better and louder when it passes by you. For the full sound effect, you’ll need to dial things up to Sport. There’s also a Sport setting for the suspension and steering that brings in a bit more weight and makes the Grecale feel pointier. The Grecale really comes into its own on a winding road. There’s a crispness to the whole setup; the steering is light but precise, and grip levels are good throughout. The Grecale really is up there with a Porsche Macan in handling, and that is very high praise. I’m not sure how many buyers will give handling much weightage, but the Grecale does comfort well, too. No, it’s not pillowy soft, and there is a firmness to the setup, but you won’t be chucked about even on the worst of patches. And remember I said it’s the most India-friendly Maserati? Speed breakers are the nemesis of low-slung Maseratis. Thankfully, this is not a problem for the Grecale as it glides over bumps without the underbody making ground contact. The Grecale GT packs in a few advanced driver-assistance systems, and they worked well enough on wide, well-marked roads on our route. Maserati Grecale price and verdict That’s a quick taste of the Maserati Grecale. It’s fast, comfy and stylish enough to stand out in a crowd of luxury SUVs. The thing is, the Grecale is not the largest SUV by size or engine capacity, and for the money Maserati wants for one, it’s sure to be a sticky point. Prices start at Rs 1.31 crore (ex-showroom) for this Grecale GT, which makes it more expensive than a Macan, though the Porsche is older and makes less power in base spec, too. At the top end, the Rs 2.05 crore GrecaleTrofeo does have the performance to hold its own amongst the super SUV heavyweights. The Grecale doesn’t quite make a watertight case for itself, and your decision to buy one would be one of heart over head. Then again, isn’t that true for all Italian exotics?

    "description": "In a move sure to bring cheer to vintage and classic car enthusiasts, the government of India has relaxed its import policy. Previously, only cars built before 1950 were eligible, but under the new norms, cars 50 years or older can be imported licence-free. So, this year, cars built up to 1975 are eligible, extending the import period from pre-1950 to 1975 and covering an additional 25 years of the automobile history. These vintage cars can be imported by their actual users Resale of these vehicles is strictly prohibited Furthermore, the 50-year limit is on a rolling basis, meaning that cars built up to 1976 would be eligible next year, and so forth. The exact date to determine the vehicle’s age will be from the date of its first registration after the initial sale. Iconic classics from brands like Mercedes, Jaguar, Porsche and American muscle cars are among the notable examples. Is the import of vintage and classic cars completely free? No, there are fees to be paid. The import is only licence-free, which implies the actual users don't need an import licence, and they can now bring in these cars after paying the stated duties and fees. Customs duty, GST and registration all together work out to about 250 percent of the car's invoice (traded) value. What are the restrictions on the usage of these cars?  The Directorate General of Foreign Trade has strictly prohibited the resale of imported vintage cars in the Indian domestic market, stating that these cars must be for personal use and cannot be traded in any form whatsoever. It further noted that if someone resells these vehicles, stricter conditions, such as a five-year no-sale rule, could be introduced in the future. Also, cars intended for use on public roads must comply with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The policy is a significant move for vintage car collectors in India and is also expected to create more employment opportunities for restorers.

    "description": "Honda has officially entered the Indian electric two-wheeler market with its maiden offerings, the QC1 and Activa e:, launched last month at the Auto Expo. Just a few days ago, we reported that the company is looking to set up a dedicated EV manufacturing plant in India, which will likely be operational by 2028 Now, our sister publication, Autocar Professional, has exclusively learned that these are just the initial steps, and Honda is working on bringing ten new electric vehicles to India over the next five years, of which four will come between 2025 and 2027. Four new Honda EVs coming by 2027 10 new EVs coming in the next five years India will serve as a manufacturing hub for global EV models First things first, why has Honda chosen India as one of its manufacturing hubs for producing its next-generation EVs? The company’s top brass believes that the Indian market will be the fastest-growing in the coming decade, with EV penetration set to rise. Today, the electric two-wheeler market is not the fledgling niche it once was, with models like the Bajaj Chetak and TVS iQube among the top 10 bestselling scooters in the country. Not much is yet known about the future Honda EVs coming to India, but what we do know is that the company has lined up a total of 10 electric two-wheelers over the next five years. People in the know tell us that Honda is targeting a cumulative 3 lakh units per annum with the four models, which will debut in the 2025-27 timeframe. While the Activa e: and QC1 have just been launched, these two are just the first step in the grand scheme of things. Sources tell us that the next wave of EV products from Honda will be better tailored to our needs, as the company will be looking at the limitations of these two models, as well as those of its rivals and noting down the specific requirements of Indian customers.  With inputs from KETAN THAKKAR Also See: Honda showcases electric scooter, e-bike concepts at EICMA 2024",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "title": "Is This The New Le Mans Golden Age We've Been Waiting For?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",
