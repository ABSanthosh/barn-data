He does it so well, that most customers request ‘a Rough Crafts-style Harley’ and leave it at that. That was almost the story with this imposing, yet refined, Harley-Davidson Street Bob. “He requested the more bling side of Rough Crafts—if that makes sense,” Winston explains. “Some of our bikes are ‘black black,’ and some have some shiny bits and a more luxurious feel. That’s what he was looking for.” Rough Crafts started with a 2022-model Street Bob—a bike that Winston favors for its simple layout and minimalist build. Rough Crafts is based in Taiwan, where strict regulations rule out the possibility of altering a bike’s frame and keeping it street-legal.…",

    "description": "One of the oddest news reports in recent memory was the announcement that Ducati, a brand synonymous with lusty Italian sportbikes, was planning to enter the world of motocross. A race-ready prototype of their contender broke cover soon after, before being fielded in a handful of events throughout the course of last year. Now the Borgo Panigale brand has unveiled the production version of their first-ever motocross bike—the Ducati Desmo450 MX—and we’re intrigued. The most pertinent question is why the almost 100-year-old marque is diversifying, and why they’ve chosen the world of off-road racing as their next stomping ground. Ducati CEO Claudio Domenicali’s official statement offers reasons (once you’ve waded through the marketing speak). “Over the past 18 months many people have asked me why Ducati decided to enter the world of professional off-road racing,” he says.…",

    "description": "Elon Musk hasn't been doing Tesla any favours in recent weeks, with both shares and sales on the decline 'Go woke, go broke’, goes a catchphrase beloved by below-the-line internet commenters when a company adopts a controversially progressive stance. And like so many clichés, its origins have some truth behind them. When Bud Light partnered a transgender influencer in 2023, it cost its brewer roughly a 28% drop in profits and itself its position as the US’s best-selling beer. American retail giant Target’s share price took a 10% hit when it launched some controversial Pride-month merchandise in the same year. Saying you really love a cause when not everybody feels the same way carries corporate risk. And it works both ways: there are protests or boycotts against non-progressive company stances too, of course, whether perceived or otherwise; pushback against corporate ethics that people think are particularly nasty.  Basically, if someone shouts particularly loudly about an issue they say really matters to them, I don’t suppose it should be a surprise when people shout back. Although it can be: Jaguar said it didn’t mean to send any particular messages, take any stance or alienate anyone with its ‘copy nothing’ advert last year, but that didn’t stop it being perceived that way. Given that the company doesn’t have any new cars to sell at the moment, it has time to work it out and perhaps, even if it has been wrongly understood, it will inadvertently end up on the right side of things. Because I wonder if the sands are shifting a bit. Here we must talk about Elon Musk, whose positions as de facto head of the US government’s new Department of Government Efficiency and agitator for right-wing politics and mocker of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on social media bin fire X haven’t been doing his car company any huge favours in recent weeks. Tesla’s shares are down and, depending on where you look, its sales are too. As the Financial Times titled it last month: “Tesla stock is falling because Elon Musk’s stock is falling.” We will have to wait to see how much this matters, because while it feels significant, it might be just online fuss that passes. Loads of people buy things from companies or places they don’t like, knowingly or otherwise, all the time, and saying you’re not going to is about the easiest thing you can do. I’m not buying anything Russian at the moment, but given that I wasn’t likely or able to anyway, it turns out that’s a doddle and makes no difference – something that Tesla might note about the kinds of people currently planning to protest against Musk outside its US retailers. And while I know that I would prefer to be seen in a Jaguar than a Tesla, the company with the Oval Office’s chief scruffbag will sell 1.5 million or more cars this year, while the one with the pink advert will sell none. So it’s rather hard to argue that what’s known as virtue signalling – the root cause of the ‘go woke, go broke’ cliché – feels a less cringy or controversial thing to do than it did only a couple of years ago. Still, call it a hunch, a bit of Spidey-sense or whatever, but the ethics, principles and actions of companies seem to have been thrown into wider focus. It should be possible to distinguish between a company employee’s politics and the company itself. We’ve all met people who have some pretty rum viewpoints, they’ve all worked somewhere and we can usually dissociate the two. The thing about Musk is that he makes that so difficult. Other companies don’t. Witness a letter to The Telegraph’s motoring advice page in January, in which a man said he would like a replacement for his MG, electric, preferably flat-floored and which would fit his dogs but importantly not something made by the Chinese, thank you very much. To which our friend Alex Robbins, the paper’s car agony uncle, delicately pointed out that not only was his current car, with its famous British nameplate, made in China but by a brand wholly owned by the Chinese state. Every time something like this happens, I’m reminded of a quote whose origin I wish I could remember. I think it was about Nissan’s Sunderland plant. When asked why it was successful, a manager said: “Keep your head down. Make cars people want.” I wonder if more people should take his advice.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/going-full-circle-uks-biggest-fan-roundabouts",
    "description": "Kevin Beresford is the president of the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society (UKRAS) Most people barely even have an opinion about roundabouts – some just can’t get enough of them Surely, if anyone knows a dull car when he sees one, Kevin Beresford does. That’s why I’ve asked the creator of those tedious but inexplicably popular wall calendars ‘Car Parks of the UK’ and ‘Motability Scooter Riders of Benidorm’ to consider another: ‘Dull Cars of Redditch’, a potential companion calendar to his recently launched ‘Roadworks of Redditch’, the relevance of the place being only that he lives there. So it is that I find myself standing in a car park in the Worcestershire town with the Lord of the Rings – so called on account of his presidency of the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society (UKRAS) and his 12 calendars so far dedicated to the UK’s greatest gyratory traffic systems – as he considers its assortment of dull cars, earnestly deciding which is the dullest. “That one,” he says, pointing at a grey city car. It’s a Suzuki Wagon R+. You and I may know why this early-2000s box is not as dull as he imagines (indeed, Autocar described it as “the UK’s best-kept secret” at the time), but since he was once invited to be deputy assistant vice-president of no less an organisation than America’s Dull Men’s Club, I have little choice but to agree. “It’s the ‘R’ that makes it,” he explains. “If it stands for ‘racing’, it’s being ironic, which is the defining quality of the best dullest things. The Wagon is box-like and grey and it says ‘R’. Ergo it’s Redditch’s dullest car.” In fact, the ‘R’ stands for ‘revolution’ and ‘relaxation’, I inform him, but he isn’t to be discouraged: “It might do, but most people will think it stands for ‘racing’. I don’t imagine Suzuki would have been too eager to correct that impression. \"What car maker doesn’t want to be associated with motorsport?” He has a point, so Redditch’s dullest car the Wagon R+ is. Beresford is fresh from advising on an episode of new Discovery+ show James May \u0026 The Dull Men’s Club. In it, the former Autocar staffer (and former Top Gear presenter) attempts to drive across Milton Keynes without stopping – a feat made easier by the town’s many roundabouts. Beresford’s association with roundabouts dates back to 2003, when, as the manager of a small printing firm in Redditch, he needed a theme for the following year’s calendar and, with help from staff, came up with ‘Roundabouts of Redditch’. TV’s Graham Norton got wind of the new calendar and featured it on his show. Within weeks, 100,000 copies had been sold around the world. It spawned other calendars, including ‘Best of British Roundabouts’ and ‘Roundabouts of the World’, plus books devoted to them – one of which Beresford now hands me, autographed by no less a figure than Sharon Osbourne. Nowadays, he and fellow members of UKRAS – usually six of them – meet twice a month to talk about roundabouts. Clocking my alarmed expression, he explains: “Artists have always been fascinated by the mundane. Think Andy Warhol and Campbell’s Soup Cans, Tracey Emin and My Bed… \"There’s nothing more expressive than a roundabout: it’s English in its good manners, with people giving way to each other, whereas a set of traffic lights is fascist in its demands that you stop and go only when it allows you to. “Roundabouts also boost your spirits on a tedious journey. I’ve seen them with statues, trains, planes and even a cricket pitch [Basin Reserve in Wellington, New Zealand, if you’re interested] on them. London’s Marble Arch and Paris’s Arc de Triomphe are both in roundabouts.”  At this rate, Beresford is at risk of a seventh member joining his bi-monthly UKRAS sessions – right up until he lapses into jargon: “We call a roundabout with a flower bed on it a Titchmarsh and one with a dwarf wall a brick ringer.” The roundabout we subsequently photograph him on has both, making it a Titchmarsh brick ringer – a condition no one would want. Away from roundabouts, Beresford’s calendar ‘Roadworks of Redditch’ is back for a second year.  “I like to see the positive in something negative and roadworks are not only necessary but also put people to work, earning a wage,” he explains.  Another popular calendar is ‘Car Parks of the UK’ – an idea inspired by a job that Beresford did for the AA in 2006, when the motoring organisation commissioned him to travel the length of the UK for a book celebrating them. In 2022, his Car Park Appreciation Society named Trinity Street Car Park in Digbeth its Car Park of the Year, describing it as “charismatic” and praising its entrance, which is constructed from bales of crushed car parts. However, it’s roundabouts that most attract Beresford, he reassures me: “In his book In the South Seas, Robert Louis Stevenson writes: ‘Few men who come to the islands leave them… \"No part of the world exerts the same attractive power upon the visitor.’ I like to think he was talking about roundabouts.”",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "Hyundai has officially teased the Ioniq 6 N all-electric performance sedan ahead of its global debut scheduled for July 2025. The tease came as part of the recent unveiling of the facelifted Ioniq 6 and its N Line variant, where the full-blown N model was hiding in the background of one image. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N teaser reveals two rear spoilers, larger diffuser, and more Interior to get three-spoke steering wheel, N-specific badging and drive modes, sports seats 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain likely; 650hp, 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds, 448km range The Ioniq 6 N’s formal reveal is scheduled for July 2025, possibly at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N exterior and interior design Gets two rear spoilers Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Although the image partially shows off the Ioniq 6 N’s rear end, the performance EV is immediately recognisable thanks to the hallmark Performance Blue finish popularised by Hyundai’s N models. Furthermore, the Ioniq 6 N sports two rear spoilers - a ducktail extending from the boot, and a larger wing mounted right beneath the windshield - and the N logo is in clear view on the blacked-out tailgate. The rear bumper includes a chunky diffuser, which looks to be inspired by Hyundai’s race-inspired RN22e concept car, and has red accents like other N models. While the front end remains a mystery for now, it’s expected to feature design elements similar to the newly-revealed Ioniq 6 N Line, including sporty color-contrasting strakes in the grille cover. Simon Loasby, Head of Hyundai Design, confirmed to our sister publication Autocar UK that the  Ioniq 6 N’s design changes are intended to “maintain aerodynamic performance while achieving a smoother, more refined silhouette.” Loasby also revealed that the large rear wing was added to counter lift more effectively, and that the Ioniq 6 N will have wider fenders than the Ioniq 5 N. Ioniq 6 N to offer exclusive interior features The Ioniq 6 N’s cabin is anticipated to largely resemble that of the regular facelifted model, but include the Ioniq 5 N’s performance features, such as a three-spoke N steering wheel, N badging, exclusive drive mode buttons, sporty front bucket seats, and more. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N powertrain and performance Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Under the hood, the Ioniq 6 N will likely share the Ioniq 5 N’s 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain with simulated automatic gear shifts. This setup yields 650hp, a 0-100kph time of 3.4 seconds, and a top speed of 260kph in the Ioniq 5 N, with a WLTP-tested range of up to 448km.

    "description": "BMW has discontinued two of its long-standing and only budget offerings– the G 310 GS and G 310 R. They were built in collaboration with TVS and first launched back in 2018. Both the G 310 duos were launched back in 2018 It was conceived as part of a joint venture between BMW and TVS BMW G 310 R and G 310 GS discontinued They were developed as part of a joint venture between BMW and TVS BMW Motorrad has discontinued the G 310 R and G 310 GS models due to the new OBD-2B regulations that came into effect on April 1, 2025, and because the bikes were at the end of their product life cycle. These models struggled to stay competitive against more powerful and feature-rich alternatives. The G 310 R and G 310 GS were part of a joint venture between TVS and BMW and served as entry-level bikes. Production of both stopped in January 2025. With generous year-end discounts, it’s unlikely there’s any unsold stock. While the G 310 R has been removed from BMW's website, the G 310 GS is still listed, indicating some remaining availability.  Moving forward, BMW will be actively offering only the G 310 RR, which is based on the TVS Apache RR 310 with BMW branding and livery. It continues to be powered by the same 312cc, liquid-cooled, single cylinder producing 34hp and 27Nm. This motor was part of the joint venture and post this discontinuation, this engine continues to live on in the TVS Apache RR 310, RTR 310 and the previously mentioned BMW G 310 RR. In the foreseeable future, BMW plans on launching the F 450 GS Enduro which was earlier unveiled at Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. Also see: Most powerful bikes under Rs 10 lakh",
