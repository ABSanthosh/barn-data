    "description": "You are probably already familiar with the Suzuki Access 125 because it is a common sight on our roads. Ever since its launch in India in 2007, the Access has been an extremely popular choice in the 125cc scooter category because it offers a practical, efficient and ultra-reliable scooter experience combined with zippy performance for a decent price. In nearly two decades, this is only the second major update the Access has received. So, what has Suzuki changed? Catering to this end of the Indian scooter market is tricky because traditional consumers identify with the established body style that is prevalent, but, at the same time, the company needs to keep its product fresh against its rivals. Which is why Suzuki has not strayed very far from the previous Access’ design ethos. The underseat storage space has grown by 2.6 litres to 24.4 litres. Park the old and new scooters side by side, and the 2025 model looks just new enough to differentiate itself but not so much that the average consumer will mistake it for anything else. We think the Access manages to cut a pleasing figure with its neo-retro aesthetic, and this shade of sea green only helps things further. It has two front cubbies now, but their opening is rather narrow. While not much is new in terms of features and technology, the 2025 Access has improved upon its predecessor in the storage capacity. The boot measures 24.4 litres (up from 21.8), and this scooter now has two slim cubbies on the front apron. Do bear in mind that these cubbies have a rather slender opening, and you cannot fit a 1-litre water bottle like you could in the previous scooter’s single cubby.   The Suzuki Access is very much a family scooter, but unlike most of its rivals, it never feels dull to ride. And its fun character doesn’t come at the expense of any sacrifice in practicality or handling. True to its family-scooter roots, the Access has a plush suspension setup, which never feels out of sorts unless you turn up the wick to the point where seldom any staid rider will venture. Neutral ergos, a spacious seat and balanced suspension keep you comfy. For 2025, Suzuki has given the Access a new frame and heavily reworked the engine – we will address the chassis first and the motor a little later. To be perfectly frank, ride this 2025 model and a previous-gen scooter back to back, and you will be hard-pressed to tell the difference – we actually did just that, so you can take our word for it. That’s really no bad thing because the 106kg Access feels light in traffic (despite its weight having gone up by 2 kilos) and is manageable for riders of all sizes, both attributes expected of a family scooter. Seat has grown slightly longer, and cushioning is on the firmer side. However, for all that has changed, we would have liked to see a 12-inch rear wheel on the Access with this update. Because it still rides on an archaic 10-inch unit (just like it did way back in 2007), at higher speeds and while going through turns, the Access doesn’t feel as stable as its Indian rivals that use 12-inch wheels at both ends (think TVS Jupiter 125 and Hero Destini 125).   That small gripe aside, we are happy to report that the Access retains its zippy, playful demeanour. And a big part of that is down to the tried and tested 124cc engine. This mill is energetic right from the get-go. Even if you’re holding a steady 70kph on the highway, if you open the throttle, there’s still enough left in reserve to manage a reasonably quick and effortless overtaking. Heavily revised engine retains its pep and turbine-smooth character. By and large, Japanese engines are known to have two major USPs: refinement and reliability. As for the former, the most vibration is actually felt only when you are at a standstill, as is typical for scooters. It disappears as soon as you get moving. In fact, it is so smooth that even at an indicated 90kph, there is absolutely no buzz either in the floorboard or the handlebar. Disc brake is reserved for the top two variants and has sufficient bite. In our tests, the new Access was quicker than the BS6 version in roll-on acceleration as well as the sprint to 80kph, which is impressive considering it is a little heavier now and has to comply with stricter emissions norms. Moreover, along with its energetic performance, the Access continues to have great fuel efficiency. In fact, these numbers could have been even better if the Access had start/stop tech like the Burgman, but you can’t opt for that feature here.   The 2025 Access has stuck to the same formula as its predecessor but with minor refinements all across. While it doesn’t have any one standout feature, it blends frugality, practicality and comfort with a dash of zippiness wonderfully. Another important factor to consider is that Suzukis are generally light on the pocket to purchase as well as run, which now brings us to the price. Round chrome mirrors look nice, but the field of view isn’t the best. With prices ranging from Rs 81,700 to Rs 93,300, the new Access is Rs 1,000-1,500 more expensive than the outgoing model. It is also nearly on par with competitors in pricing. The aforementioned factors are why the Access has achieved such widespread success. Even today, if you’re in the market for a new 125cc scooter, the Access remains a really compelling option. Also See: 2025 Suzuki Access video review",

    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

    "description": "First up, props to Skoda for organising a night drive in Mumbai as part of the new Kodiaq’s media introduction. Mumbai’s historic areas and new roads are best experienced in the calm and quiet of the after hours, and the event presented the opportunity to get some meaningful driving over roads very familiar to us. The Kodiaq, for those who may not know, is a relatively large three-row SUV from Skoda’s global portfolio. It's a big deal for the Czech carmaker with the first-gen model raking up sales of over 9,00,000 units worldwide, 10,000 of which went to buyers in India. Skoda wants to add to that tally significantly with this second-gen model. Skoda Kodiaq Exterior Design and Engineering - 8/10 Familiar elements sit amidst new-gen Skoda design New Kodiaq's styling is evolutionary with modern treatment to individual elements. The new Kodiaq is easily identifiable as a Kodiaq, at least when viewed head-on. Styling up front is an evolution with a modern treatment to individual elements. The bonnet is more sculpted and adds visual volume to the front. You will also find a larger interpretation of Skoda's traditional octagonal grille, this time around embellished with an LED light strip that flows into the headlight DRLs. The headlights sport a split look with the main cluster up top beautifully detailed with a crystal-like effect. Effective LED lighting is standard, but interestingly, matrix LEDs with more precise light control could be offered in the future. Lower down, there's a neat air intake flanked by air curtains that are among many elements that have helped aerodynamics. I do wish the quest for enhanced aero didn't extend to the wheels. The 18-inch wheels have a concealed look and appear unexciting.  Grille is embellished with an LED strip that flows into the LED DRLs. Squared-out wheel arches are a link to the original model, but it's in profile that the Kodiaq's design and styling evolution is most apparent. Where the last one was all about crisp creases and straight lines, the new Kodiaq's surfacing is an interplay of soft contours and well-defined elements. While the 2,791mm wheelbase is common to Gen 1 and Gen 2 Kodiaqs, overall length is up 59mm. The length increase concentrated at the rear overhang gives the new model an elongated look, and the upswept rear quarter glass that sits flush with the contrast dark chrome panel on the D pillar is a very clear point of distinction too. Wide tail-lamps with a C-shaped LED light signature define the tail end. Interestingly, while the lights are linked, the middle section doesn't illuminate.  18-inch alloys with an aero-optimised design look unexciting. The Skoda Kodiaq uses a monocoque construction and uses the Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform, which is the latest iteration of the modular MQB platform. The Skoda Kushaq and Slavia, for reference, are based on the ‘Indian-ised’ MQB A0 IN. Skoda Kodiaq interior space and comfort - 8.5/10 Plush cabin feels worthy of price tag.  Open the Kodiaq's doors and you'll like the carpet of light (floor projection) that welcomes you on board. And while not all too apparent in the dark, you'll appreciate the presence of door edge protectors that pop out to keep neighbouring vehicles scratch-free in tight parkings. The Kodiaq’s interior will instantly win you over. The high quality materials (padded surfaces and ash wood on the dash, for instance) and great attention to detail (the knurled effect on knobs and controls is particularly nice) deliver the all-important sensation of being in an expensive car. A stylish winged dashboard and tastefully done ambient lighting help to this end.  Kodiaq's cabin feels high quality and has great attention to detail. The Kodiaq also scores highly on comfort, especially for those sat up front. The well cushioned front seats are not only large and accommodating but also pack in heating, ventilation and massage (it’s really good) functions. Second row occupants have it nice too. There’s enough room for three average-sized adults to sit comfortably and even six footers will be content on knee room. The middle row can be slid forwards and backwards to balance space for the third row of passengers. It’s a pity the flip-down neck supports haven’t been included on the new-gen Kodiaq. Middle row has enough space for three passengers. Third row is tight but useable over short commutes Access to the third row via a small passage between the body and middle row seats (they don’t flip forwards) is inconvenient and space at the very back is simply tight for large adults. However, sit size-wise across the Kodiaq’s three rows, and it's possible to work out a reasonable compromise for short intra-city commutes. Spend time in a Kodiaq and you’ll also appreciate how well thought out its cabin is. With gear selection duties relegated to a stalk behind the steering wheel, the centre console is freed up to offer loads of space for small items. There are two wireless charging pads, four cupholders and a large centre box between the seats. Dual gloveboxes and sizeable door pockets (felt-lined, no less) are other storage spaces on offer up front. Tablet/mobile phone holders for the middle row are a clever inclusion, and Skoda has also packed in a handy removable storage box that mounts conveniently on the centre tunnel.  Space in the third row is tight for large adults. Remember the longer rear overhang I mentioned earlier? You see the benefit of that when you open the powered and gesture-controlled tailgate. With all seats up, there's 281 litres of luggage space, up 11 litres on the older Kodiaq. The 50:50 split third row seats fold flat to free up to 786 litres of luggage room while the second row seats split 40:20:40 and fold flat to unlock a massive 1,976 litres. Again, the boot area is well thought out and includes detachable holders to keep your luggage in place. Before you ask, there's an enclosure for a space saver spare tyre packaged under the boot floor.  Boot has 281-litres of space with all rows up, extentable up to 1976-litres. Skoda Kodiaq performance and refinement - 9/10 Exciting 204hp turbo-petrol engine will liven up everyday drives. The new-gen Kodiaq has been launched in India with a 204hp, 320Nm 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine. The older Kodiaq put out 190hp; torque was the same 320Nm. All-wheel drive is standard with drive channeled through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Also in consideration for India is the Kodiaq RS with a 265hp version of the same petrol engine and a 2.0-litre diesel. Yes, diesel is a possibility too. However, those are stories for another day. Let's focus on the version you can buy today. The news is good. Crisp responses make the 2.0-litre TSI engine feel alert and alive. The energetic engine is ever ready with a nice dose of power and makes the large Kodiaq feel light on its feet. The Skoda is quick to build speed and performance on the whole is very satisfying. As an added plus, the engine sounds quite nice too. The gravelly note at lower speeds gets throatier as you go faster and makes for a playful soundtrack. 204hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine feels energetic and alive. While you see the Kodiaq in its best light on open roads, slow-moving traffic can reveal some rough edges. Like many other dual-clutch units, the gearbox tends to feel a bit clunky at low speeds. Things do smoothen out as you build speed. There's a sport mode and you also get paddle shifters for times when you want to take manual control. Skoda Kodiaq mileage - 6/10 Petrol-only Kodiaq is not most efficient option for the money.    The Skoda Kodiaq features auto stop/start to help economy but makes do without any form of hybrid assistance. Its official ARAI-tested fuel economy of 14.86kpl is an improvement over the last model's 12.78kpl official figure. However, the fact is, you'd be lucky to see double-digit figures in congested city driving. Then again, that's true for most SUVs with large turbo-petrol engines. Skoda Kodiaq ride comfort and handling - 7.5/10 Suspension setup feels a touch firm over potholes.  The Kodiaq offers 155mm of laden ground clearance (with a full load of passengers), so you won't have issues on big speed breakers. As for ride comfort, there is a firmness to the suspension setup, and it doesn't quite smoothen out our uneven surfaces. It’s not to the extent of being a reason for complaint, though.  Without the DCC, new Kodiaq doesn't feel as composed as the old one. A thing to bring up is that the new-gen Kodiaq doesn't get damper control like the last model did. That’s a shame because there is a bit more vertical movement at high speeds, giving the impression that the new Kodiaq is not quite as tied down as the earlier model was. Good manoeuvrability makes large Kodiaq easy to live with.    In other ways, the Skoda drives like a typical VW Group car. High speed handling is neat and tidy, while at lower speeds, the light steering makes the large Kodiaq feel quite manoeuverable and easy to live with. All-wheel drive does its work in the background but we’ll need the Kodiaq for a longer duration to put the system to the test. Skoda Kodiaq features and safety - 8.5/10 It packs in all the creature comforts you'd want but ADAS is missed. The Skoda Kodiaq is available in two variants. Featured here is the top-end L\u0026K in the new bronze gold metallic paint shade. There's also the option of a Sportline trim that trades many chrome details for gloss black, wears different 18-inch rims and also features a blacked-out D pillar that collectively lend the SUV a sportier vibe. Sportline versions are predominantly black inside and feature leatherette and suede upholstery. A three-spoke steering and sporty front seats with integrated headrests are also unique to the Sportline.  Front seats on the L\u0026K trim get a massage function. The fully loaded Skoda Kodiaq L\u0026K is more traditional luxury car in its exterior and interior treatment. The L\u0026K is also the only one to get front seat ventilation and massage, a 360-degree camera and auto park. Both versions of the Kodiaq pack in goodies like a panoramic sunroof, 3-zone climate control, an onboard air purifier, rear window shades, sweet 725W, 13-speaker Canton sound system and 10.25-inch digital dials. The Virtual Cockpit display – as Skoda calls it – includes a full map view, though it’ll only relay info from the onboard navigation and not Google Maps through a connected phone. Virtual cockpit relays info only from onboard navigation.  Delivering the big screen experience is the 13-inch touchscreen. It is a large screen, yes, but it has been incorporated well into the dash to not appear too in your face. The screen is super smooth and ticks the essential boxes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Shortcut buttons in easy access and large icons make the screen user-friendly but what makes the biggest difference is that not all functions are bundled on to the touchscreen. Separate physical knobs for driver and passenger side temperature and seat heating/cooling are included and there’s also a third knob that can uniquely be programmed with four additional functions. Pressing down on the knob toggles to the next function which can then be controlled via a turn. In effect, you can use the same knob for volume control, drive mode selection, blower speed settings and map zoom. The tactile feel counts for a lot and greatly reduces the need to look away from the road to adjust oft used functions, and resultantly enhances how you interact with your vehicle. On the subject, Skoda has also packaged in a screen cleaner housed within the centre console to remove fingerprints and smudges. People with OCD will approve.  Central rotary dial is configurable for volume, fan speed, map zoom and drives modes.  The Skoda Kodiaq has not been rated by Bharat NCAP or Global NCAP as yet, but there's comfort in knowing it's a Euro NCAP 5-star rated car. In terms of safety kit, the Skoda Kodiaq for India packs in nine airbags, including one between the front passengers. There's ESC, hill descent control, ISOFIX child seat mounts, and more. Unfortunately, there's no advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS, at least for the moment. The Volkswagen Group is working on ADAS for India, but a timeline for rollout of these features hasn't been announced. Panoramic sunroof gets a thin sunshade, but it doesn't block much heat on a hot day.   Skoda Kodiaq price and verdict - 8.5/10 Skoda has priced the Kodiaq Sportline at Rs 46.89 lakh, while the L\u0026K variant costs Rs 48.69 lakh (ex-showroom). That’s not only a substantial price jump over the last-gen model (Rs 37 lakh) but also makes the Kodiaq significantly pricier than the Hyundai Tucson (Rs 29 lakh-36 lakh) which is the go-to model in the premium SUV segment. However, the Kodiaq does go one up on the Tucson as well as its recently launched cousin, the new gen Volkswagen Tiguan, with a third row of seats. The third row isn’t great, but brings in a seating flexibility that many buyers will value. The bigger draw is the premium experience the Kodiaq delivers. Talk interior quality or drive experience, the Skoda feels like an expensive European vehicle. In fact, objectively speaking, the Kodiaq is a more wholesome package than the entry luxury SUV offerings from Mercedes, BMW and Audi. See it in this light, and you’ll find a compelling proposition in the new-gen Kodiaq.   Also see: 2025 Skoda Kodiaq walkaround video",

    "description": "Joint venture announces new hybrid powertrain that fits into the same space as a traditional EV motor Horse, the engine-making joint venture of Geely and the Renault Group, has revealed a hybrid powertrain designed to be retrofitted into electric cars. It contains the internal combustion engine, electric motor, gearbox and related electronics in a single unit that, Horse said, can be squeezed into the same space as an EV’s main drive motor. This means manufacturers could retrofit an electric car with the unit without needing to comprehensively re-engineer the car or having to set up a new production line. The powertrain can be fuelled using petrol, E85 ethanol-petrol mix, pure methanol and synthetic fuels, Horse said. It can operate both as a traditional parallel hybrid (driving the wheels) and as a range-extender (generating electricity for a drive motor). It bolts directly into a car’s subframe. Although it has been conceived to replace the front motor in an EV, it can also be used in ICE car platforms. The new Horse unit comes as several manufacturers slow their transition to all-electric line-ups. Notably, Fiat is currently developing a new version of the 500e retrofitted with a hybrid powertrain to replace the old petrol 500 and to buoy its business amid slow sales of the EV. “For over a decade, it looked like battery-electric vehicles were the only path to net-zero and OEMs planned accordingly,\" said Horse Powertrain CEO Matias Giannini. “However, we’re now shifting towards a technology-neutral world, with different markets and applications each pursuing their own sustainable mobility journey.” Giannini added that the company’s new hybrid unit “allows OEMs to offer powertrain diversity with minimal disruption to production process and resource expenditure”.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/porsche-911-gt3-fastest-manual-car-nurburgring",
    "description": "Latest version of hardcore 911 dips under the seven-minute mark to outpace the V10-engined Dodge Viper ACR The Porsche 911 GT3 is now the fastest manual car to lap the Nürburgring, beating the previous record-holder by nearly 10 seconds. Porsche has sent the recently updated '992.2' around the Nordschleife – with ambassador and ex-racer Jörg Bergmeister at the wheel – in 6min 56.294sec. That's not only 3.6sec quicker than the pre-facelift 992 with a PDK automatic gearbox but also substantially quicker than the previous fastest manual car, the hardcore Dodge Viper ACR, which Porsche notes has a \"significantly more powerful engine\".  The American supercar, with a 645bhp 8.4-litre V10, claimed its record lap time of 7min 1.3sec in 2017 - but that was around the shortened 20.6km circuit and corresponds to a time of 7min 5.8sec around the full-length 20.832km loop, according to Porsche. By that metric, the stick-shift GT3, with a 503bhp flat six, was 9.5sec faster around the Green Hell.  The car used for the attempt was equipped with the Weissach Package – a £20k optional extra that brings a raft of weight-saving measures to shave 12kg over the standard GT3 – and was shod with sticky (but still road-legal) Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 R tyres. Andreas Preuninger, who runs Porsche's GT division, said: \"More and more 911 GT3 customers are opting for the six-speed manual transmission. And more and more often we are asked by these customers how fast a 911 GT3 with manual transmission would be on the Nordschleife. We have now answered this question and, although we know that the variant with PDK is significantly faster, we drove our official lap time with a manual six-speed gearbox.\" Porsche told Autocar that just under a quarter of standard GT3s are ordered with a manual gearbox in the UK, while just over half of wingless GT3 Touring orders are manual.",

    "description": "The Spanish workshop Tamarit Motorcycles has been in business for a decade, focusing almost exclusively on Triumph modern classics. So they know the Triumph Bonneville inside out—and they know how to transform it into just about anything. Tamarit Motorcycles has used this experience to build a stacked catalog of bolt-on Triumph parts and a handful of made-to-order customs. But what they relish most are the opportunities to build one-off specials, like this vivid Triumph Bonneville scrambler. Numbered 142 and nicknamed ‘Bull Ring,’ the 2006-model carbureted Triumph Bonneville was commissioned by a returning client. Tamarit had previously built a Triumph Thruxton café racer for him, but this time, he wanted a street scrambler. Some details—like the mono-shock conversion and under-seat exhaust—were carried over from the previous project, but this is no copycat.…",

And yet, custom motorcycle builders have been putting their spin on the maligned Virago (and its variants) for longer than Bike EXIF has been around. One workshop that knows how to turn a sow’s ear into a purse; STG Tracker. Run by Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp, the Argentinian outfit is versatile and seldom builds the same thing twice. So they didn’t blink when a client asked them to turn his 1981 Yamaha XV920R into a scrambler. The XV920R was Yamaha’s attempt at turning their awkward cruiser into a standard-type motorcycle with sports touring aspirations. Highlights included a taller stance, rear-mounted foot pegs, and an enclosed chain drive.…",

The updated S90 will first go on sale in China sometime in the middle of this year, followed by other markets.

    "description": "The Porsche Macan petrol will now only be available in entry-level guise as the German brand has discontinued the S and GTS variants of the SUV and delisted them from its website. Porsche India has confirmed that new orders for the Macan S and GTS cannot be placed, though there are some units still available with dealers that customers can get. Porsche Macan petrol price is Rs 96.05 lakh ex-showroom EV available in Macan Electric, 4S Electric and Turbo Electric variants Porsche 911, Taycan, Cayenne and Panamera prices have increased Porsche Macan range in India Macan now available in 1 petrol and 3 electric variants, priced from Rs 96.05 lakh to 1.69 crore Macan S had the same 2.9-litre V6 as the GTS but in a lower state of tune. As the current Porsche Macan petrol is being phased out globally – it was discontinued in the EU in April last year – and is expected to go off the shelves by next year, it isn’t surprising that allocations for the Indian market are finishing. The Macan petrol is now only available with the 265hp, 400Nm, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine and is priced at Rs 96.05 lakh. While the Macan S and GTS shared the 2.9-litre turbocharged V6 petrol mill, the S had it in a 380hp, 520Nm state of tune, and the GTS had a 440hp, 550Nm version. The Macan S cost Rs 1.45 crore, and the Macan GTS Rs 1.53 crore.
