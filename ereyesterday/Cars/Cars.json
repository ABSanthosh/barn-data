    "description": "This Riley \u0026 Scott Mk III is one of approximately 21 examples built and was initially constructed for the 1999 season as chassis number 019 before competing for Yojiro Terada’s AutoExe Motorsport. The car was campaigned under the AutoExe LMP99 name through 1999, including a start at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it retired from the race early due to engine failure. After a crash at Fuji Speedway at the end of the season, the car was rebuilt using portions of chassis 021 with redesigned bodywork in anticipation of a return to Le Mans in 2000. The project was not completed in time for acceptance into the Le Mans field, and the car, then called the LMP-X, was instead retired from racing but remained with Terada until 2009. It was then purchased by an owner who had it refurbished and moved it to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where it remained until being sold to its current owner in 2022. Finished in a red \"ampm\" livery over carbon Kevlar body panels, the car is powered by a 6.0-liter Ford OHV V8 that is paired with a Hewland six-speed sequential transaxle. Additional features include ventilated disc brakes, pushrod suspension, staggered-width 18” wheels, and a single racing seat equipped with a six-point harness. This AutoExe-built Riley \u0026 Scott Mk III is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owner in Union Dale, Pennsylvania, with a spare parts collection and a bill of sale.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-pictures-released-upcoming-range-rover-electric",
    "description": "Land Rover brand's first EV tests in extreme conditions as it approaches a launch next year The new electric Range Rover is undergoing final-stage testing ahead of its launch next year. New images show JLR's second production EV testing in the United Arab Emirates – following Arctic Circle testing earlier this year – where temperatures are hitting as high as 50deg C with humidity levels of 90%. One of the key aspects the cars were testing, besides their off-road capabilities, is whether the new thermal management system – the most intelligent ever fitted to a Range Rover – could cope with the heat “in pursuit of maximum client cabin comfort”. JLR says all cars surpassed expectations.  The test mules are also being thrown up Big Red, a 300ft sand dune in the heart of Sharjah’s Al Badayer desert, to test the EV’s new Intelligent Torque Management system, which replaces a conventional ABS-based traction control system. This is claimed to improve traction control off road by diverting power to each electric motor to reduce torque reaction time from around 100 milliseconds to as little as one millisecond. JLR says, after five continuous attempts, none of the cars demonstrated any fall in performance.  Product engineering director Thomas Müller said: “A hot climate is one of the most challenging for any battery-electric vehicle, because of the need to cool the cabin and optimise battery performance at the same time.  “The additional challenge of driving on sand requires controlled low-speed torque, so our specially developed traction control and thermal management systems work in harmony to ensure power delivery is unaffected.  “Our tests have shown that in this climate, repeatedly driving the equivalent of 100 metres uphill on fine sand, Range Rover Electric matches the performance of its ICE equivalents; in some instances, even surpassing them – thanks to the introduction of these new features.” Like the cars pictured in the Arctic Circle, these Range Rover EV mules are  shown completely uncamouflaged – a decision made to \"underline the build quality of the initial prototypes\", according to JLR. Painted all in black and without the contrasting matt trim elements that JLR has previously suggested will mark out the EV powertrain, the prototype looks all but identical to the ICE Range Rover that has been on sale since 2022. JLR said this shows how the prototype's \"modernist design language stays true to the Range Rover bloodline\", suggesting that the Range Rover Electric – as it is officially named – will only be subtly differentiated from the straight-six, V8 and plug-in hybrid derivatives.  JLR previously highlighted that this is the first car to use a battery and electric drive unit assembled in-house. No specific technical details or performance figures have yet been given, however, beyond the earlier confirmation that it will use an 800V charging architecture. Although bosses have yet to give any performance details for the new Range Rover, it has been promised to have the same “go-anywhere” capability as the ICE version, with a pledge that it will offer towing, wading and all-terrain capability that will exceed any other luxury electric SUV – including the ability to wade through 850mm-deep water. The hint that the Range Rover Electric will offer performance “comparable” to the existing V8 suggests a total output close to the 523bhp that model offers. It's expected to adopt a dual-motor system, which will allow for greater four-wheel-drive ability and systems such as torque vectoring to boost its off-road potential.  JLR said its test programme has been adapted to particularly examine the vehicle’s underfloor, battery durability and thermal derating.  The Range Rover Electric will be built in Solihull alongside the existing mild-hybrid and PHEV versions. It will initially use batteries from a third-party supplier before eventually switching to packs produced in the new Somerset gigafactory that JLR parent firm Tata is planning.  Interestingly, Land Rover programme director Nick Miller previously told Autocar that the MLA architecture can also readily accommodate a hydrogen powertrain, which means a Range Rover FCEV could be on the cards – although the company hasn't given an update on its Project Zeus hydrogen development programme for some time.  Land Rover was previously testing a hydrogen-fuelled Defender prototype and said hydrogen will be “complementary” to battery-electric technology across its line-up as it strives to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036.",

    "description": "Changes could “significantly reduce” collisions that result in injury or death Speed limits for cars in Scotland could be reduced on selected roads if proposed new laws are given the go-ahead. Transport Scotland has proposed lowering the 60mph limit on single-carriageway roads to 50mph. This could “significantly reduce” collisions that result in injury or death while maintaining journey times, according to the government transport agency. The changes have already been trialled on the A9 between Falkirk and Scrabster Harbour, resulting in a reduction in “risky overtaking with a resultant improvement in safety”, said Road Haulage Association’s Martin Reid. He added: “The extension of a 50mph limit across all Scottish single-carriageway A-roads should be expected to yield similar results.” The proposals are part of the National Speed Management Review and would also raise speed limits for goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes from 40mph to 50mph on single-carriageway roads and from 50mph to 60mph on dual carriageways. “We must never lose sight of the fact that one death on our roads is one too many,” said Scottish government transport secretary Fiona Hyslop. “These proposed changes represent a vital step towards achieving national casualty reduction targets and I urge everyone to take part in the consultation and help shape the future of road safety in Scotland.” The consultation is now open to the public, with views sought before a decision is made in 2025.",

Where the stock RC8 is a fully faired superbike, albeit with some snarling angular character, it’s a race bike through and through. It’s more of a fencer — a scorekeeper, so to speak. “The Scrappier,” as our featured bike is known, is a cage fighter — less about the numbers and more about the experience.

The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original.

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Ford India will stop providing the FordPass connected car suite on its cars and SUVs from January 1. It was introduced in 2020 along with the launch of the brand’s BS6 line-up, such as the Endeavour, EcoSport, Figo, Freestyle, and Aspire compact sedan. The FordPass app to move to a new platform from January 1 The new platform is incompatible with Ford models in India Ford India's re-entry is likely by next year Why is FordPass being discontinued in India? In an exclusive statement shared with Autocar India, Ford India said that the FordPass app is a global product and will be transitioning to a new platform, which will not support the technology that is being offered on Ford vehicles in India. Active users of the FordPass app will be able to use its features until their free subscription ends on December 31, 2024. This change will not affect the vehicle’s functionality. What features did FordPass app offer? Like most other connected car apps, FordPass works on an in-built 4G data connection that was offered for free, depending on the vehicle. Buyers have access to the FordPass app on their phones, which controls various features like starting, stopping, locking, or unlocking the vehicle. Additionally, owners can grant authorisation for the temporary use of their vehicles. The app also has a 'Move' function that provides real-time vehicle information, such as tyre pressure readings, fuel level, and odometer, and allows for remote start/stop and lock/unlock of the vehicle. Owners can also locate the nearest fuel stations, Ford dealers in the vicinity, and access a guide-on-call for roadside assistance from the brand. Ford's India re-entry plans Ford India has been working on re-entering the domestic market sometime next year. As per the latest update, the brand will initially start selling the Endeavour (known as the Everest globally) as a fully imported model, with local assembly slated to begin a little later.
