A Tremec five-speed manual transmission was installed in 2024. The car is equipped with 15\" Boyd Coddington wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a side-exit exhaust system, and triple taillights as well as a Corvette-branded cassette player and C4 Corvette bucket seats trimmed in red and black leather.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/radical-renault-5-turbo-3e-get-public-debut-summer",
    "description": "Yellow, black and white livery clearly takes inspiration from the rally car driven by Jean Ragnotti Renault CEO confirms hyper-hatchback's debut is imminent and \"much more\" than 150 units will be built Renault will reveal its wild Turbo 3E hyper-hatchback in the coming months before starting production of \"much more\" than 150 units next year - and there could be more hardcore performance models in the firm's future. Developed in collaboration with Alpine, the outlandish 3E is the electric reincarnation of the original Renault 5 Turbo. It is loosely based on today's retro Renault 5 supermini but with bespoke bodywork, its own platform and a pair of in-wheel motors pumping out more than 500bhp.  It is far removed in its conception from any Renault model past or present, but CEO Fabrice Cambolive told Autocar that it \"was a kind of logical consequence when you look at the design of the R5, which already takes some elements from the old Turbo\". He also said it plays an important role as an expansion of the Renault 5 range: \"For me, it was very important to be able to have as extensive as possible coverage in terms of customer needs for R5 - beginning with a very interesting price bracket but opening the adoption of this car to people who want extreme sensations. \"When you have such a car which is such fun to drive, why not push the boundaries?\"  He hailed the 3E's ability to \"drift permanently\" and carry \"much more speed\" as headline attributes but said these \"extreme conditions\" were developed with a keen eye on efficiency, so as to ensure the hyper-hatch retained a usable range.  \"That's why the idea of having engines on wheels was very interesting for us,\" he said, referring to the 3E's in-wheel EV motors, a technology that is widely touted as bringing dramatic advantages in packaging, efficiency and power delivery compared with conventional 'e-axles'.  Renault will prove the potential of this technology when the 3E makes its dynamic debut, Cambolive said, without naming a date or venue. The original 3E concept was driven in anger for the first time at the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed, and sibling brand Alpine hosted the global debut of the R5-based A290 hot hatch there last year - but the company hasn't confirmed its attendance at the 2025 event.  He also wouldn't give specifics on the 3E's pricing but said \"we will have a fair price linked, of course, with the power of the car\" and it will be far below the £200,000-plus commanded by sibling brand Alpine's similarly extreme A110 R Ultime track car. However, Cambolive did say Renault will build \"much more\" than 150 units and has been encouraged by early reaction to the car.  \"A lot of people who know the price already are ready to invest because they think this kind of car will never lose value,\" he said, highlighting the collector status that has been achieved by the original Turbo. \"If you browse the R5 Turbo 1, you have prices that are quite significant…\" Original Turbos are vanishingly rare and prices for the best examples currently push well past £150,000.  \"I don't think the price will be a barrier,\" said Cambolive. \"As long as it's fair, as long as the car delivers the power, the efficiency, the technology, the innovation and a very high-quality dimension, I think we'll find our public – especially a public which remembers the ultra-sporty aspects of Renault in the past.\" The decision not to revive the dormant Renault Sport moniker used by previous Renault hot hatches is because \"we are focusing a lot on product\", Cambolive said, \"and speaking about Renault Sport without any products is not essential\".  He did suggest, however, that there could be more performance models in the pipeline for Renault after this. \"I prefer to speak about Turbo 3E, and after that to see what we can do on top of that if Turbo 3E is a success,\" he said. \"Let's build our 'sportivity' step by step.\" Renault product boss Bruno Vanel recently promised the 5 Turbo 3E will deliver an “outstanding driving sensation, something completely unexpected” that is “agile like nothing else” as a result of its innovative drivetrain. The two in-wheel motors enable more precise control of each wheel and the wheels can effectively “do what they want”, said Vanel. In-wheel technology – which, Autocar understands, has been supplied by British specialist Protean Electric – removes the need for an electronic differential or the type of simulated ‘manual’ gearshift used on the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. The 0-62mph time will be less than 3.5sec, and Vanel described the performance as “breathtaking”.  The electric hot hatch will have a bespoke carbon-composite body. Renault has yet to confirm the car’s dimensions but its proportions are significantly different from those of the standard 5 on which it is loosely based. Only the windscreen angle is shared between the two. A longer dash-to-axle ratio in particular reveals that the production car will follow the concept in using a bespoke architecture. The two-seat concept used a tubular chassis with a roll-cage in the rear. Its extreme bodywork is created with aerodynamic efficiency and cooling in mind, including a vast rear spoiler and diffuser, flared wheel arches, and side air intakes to cool the motors. One of the key features of the concept version was its three drift modes for different levels of playfulness, including the ability to do doughnuts. The concept also used a manual handbrake and, given how important that is to the ethos of the project, it’s something Renault would want to retain for production. Sandeep Bhambra, Renault’s head of advanced design, said the brief from Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo was to “make me a little beast”. Bhambra said the “intention had always been to make it” for production after the positive reaction garnered by the concept that previewed it in 2022.",

    "description": "Hard-working, hard-wearing pick-up turns to fresh style and equipment to keep fuelling its rising popularity You will have read about the decline of the UK pick-up truck market and lately about new benefit-in-kind tax rules set to hasten its demise further.Well, it isn’t declining in all quarters. The self-proclaimed 'pick-up professionals' at Isuzu had their most successful year with the Isuzu D-Max in 2024, selling more than 6600 - more even than they managed during the 'lifestyle pick-up' boom of 2015. The Japanese company now expects to be less exposed to the April 2025 exit of people who have been running a pick-up as a way of paying less BIK tax.Most people who run a D-Max, Isuzu claims, do so because they genuinely need its capabilities: to carry 1200kg of bulky stuff around with them, to tow heavy trailers, to access remote places well off the road network. The D-Max also sells on its well-established reliability, we’re told, and is backed up by a five-year/125,00-mile warranty and as many years of roadside breakdown assistance.This isn’t the flashiest-looking flatbed on the market, nor the most powerful or desirable, but, they say, it’s the one that won’t let you down.The Isuzu D-Max range at a glanceBeing Isuzu's sole passenger vehicle offering in the UK, the D-Max range is fairly extensive.The entry-level Utility model comes with a choice or two- and four-wheel drive and can be had as a single-, extended- or double-cab vehicle, from as little as £33,000 including VAT (which many pick-up buyers either don't pay or can can claim back).Stepping up to the DL20 costs around £5000 more and grants you four-wheel drive as standard, with a locking rear differential and low-range transfer gearing, as well as 18in alloy wheels.The DL40 doesn't add any off-road equipment but gets additional luxuries such as LED headlights, push-button ignition and a reversing camera.The V-Cross, meanwhile, which is the primary subject of this review and the model Isuzu uses to target lifestyle pickup buyers, gets a 9.0in infotainment screen, dual-zone climate control and adjustable lumbar support for the driver.You can additionally specify a camping kit complete with a two-man tent, sink, barbecue, awning and foldaway chairs.At the top of the range sits the Arctic Trucks AT35 edition and the Mudmaster V-Cross, the latter of which is new to the fleet and comes with a winch, a light-bar mounted to the roof, a snorkel and all-terrain tyres mounted to 20in alloys.All D-Maxes are powered by a 1.9-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel engine with 162bhp and 266lb ft. As standard, you get a six-speed manual gearbox but you can specify a six-speed Aisin automatic, said to shift 25% faster than its predecessor. The sales split between the automatic and manual stands at roughly 50:50.",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/2025-indian-sport-chief-rt",
    "description": "When the Indian Sport Chief debuted two years ago, it showed that the American motorcycle company had its finger on the pulse of the performance cruiser custom scene. Dripping with Californian club-style details, it wore the sort of parts that riders of that ilk would add to their bikes anyway; tall risers, wide bars, a small fairing, and upgraded shocks. Now Indian is pushing that concept further with the Indian Sport Chief RT. New for 2025, the Sport Chief RT takes everything good about the Sport Chief, and cranks it up with just enough extra parts to make it a skosh more versatile. It’s a short list, with the changes mainly focused on adding storage and a passenger. While the ‘regular’ Sport Chief wears a solo seat, the new Sport Chief RT has pillion pegs and a generously padded two-up seat that looks like it was plucked straight from the Saddlemen catalog.…",

    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "description": "Ducati has teased the new Panigale V4 via its social media accounts. The caption reads “Gen 7, enroute”, suggesting an imminent launch in India. New Panigale V4 gets redesigned fairing with reworked aero Loses the signature single-sided swingarm Ducati Panigale V4: what’s new for 2025? Powering the motorcycle is a 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, which is now Euro5+ certified. Compared to the outgoing model, it delivers 216hp at 13,500rpm – just a 0.5hp increase but at 500rpm higher. The peak torque is down by 2.7Nm to 120.9Nm and is delivered 1,750rpm later than the outgoing model at 11,250rpm. Suspension duties are managed by Öhlins, featuring the smart EC 3.0 electronic units. Ducati claims it has refined the rear monoshock to shed 600 grams of weight. The bike rides on the new Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa V4 tyres; the sizes remain at 120/70-ZR17 and 200/60-ZR17. This supersport is the first motorcycle in the world to feature the new Brembo Hypure monobloc calipers. The earlier model used Stylema calipers for braking.  The Ducati Panigale V4 for 2025 has received substantial updates in the form of design and internal reworking, marking the biggest change since the model debuted in 2018. The headlights are sleeker, and the refreshed tail-light has two U-shaped LED strips. The aerodynamics have also been reworked. There’s a redesigned fairing, and the winglets have been repositioned while providing the same amount of downforce as before. After a long hiatus, Ducati has equipped the Panigale V4 with a conventional double-sided swingarm. The last Ducati flagship supersport to get this type of swingarm was the iconic 916. The new swingarm-rear wheel assembly is 2.7 kg lighter, and the bike now features 37 percent less lateral stiffness, improving overall handling. In typical Ducati fashion, its flagship is loaded with electronic rider aids. The 2025 Panigale V4 debuts a new feature called Race eCBS, which essentially manages the rear load without the need to tap the rear brake – all thanks to a system that monitors the bike’s lean angle, throttle position and intervening when required. Additionally, the bike has power modes, traction control, launch control, wheelie control, riding modes, a bi-directional quickshifter and ABS. Each of these electronic aids offers extensive customisation via a new 6.9-inch TFT display.  The Ducati Panigale V4’s chief rival is the BMW S 1000 RR, which was also recently updated and launched at the 2025 edition of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. The outgoing Ducati Panigale V4 commands Rs 27.72 lakh for the base model and Rs 33.48 lakh for the up-spec S variant, but we expect an increase in prices.

    "description": "Alpina has taken the wraps off its most powerful model, the B8 GT based on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe. The B8 GT comes with an uprated version of the 4.4-litre V8 engine and will likely be Alpina’s last model as a standalone tuner as the company becomes a part of BMW as per a 2022 agreement. Alpina B8 GT gets 634hp and 850Nm of torque Its claimed 0-100kph time is 3.3 seconds Production will be limited to 99 units Powering the B8 GT is BMW’s 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine that makes 634hp at 5,500-6,500rpm and 850Nm of peak torque at 3,500-5,000rpm. Interestingly, the output figure is 1hp less than the M5 CS, and the B8 GT is just 0.4 seconds slower to sprint from 0-100kph than BMW’s sporty four-door sedan. Alpina also claims a 0-200kph time of 10.5 seconds and a top speed of 330kph. The tuning brand has tweaked the ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic gearbox to handle the extra torque. Alpina says the B8 GT production is capped at 99 units, and only 20 will get a dual-tone paint scheme that combines a blue or green finish with a contrasting black. All units will sport a subtle carbon fibre body kit, including a more prominent rear diffuser, forged 21-inch alloy wheels, bespoke Pirelli P Zero tyres, special badges, a leather and wood interior and a metal insert in the cup holder bearing founder Burkard Bovensiepen’s signature. Bovensiepen passed away in October 2023 at the age of 87.

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us. Maybe bring some tissues along for the ride, too. Continue...",
