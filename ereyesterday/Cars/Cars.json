    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/change-wurst-vw-puts-best-selling-sausage-supermarkets",
    "description": "Currywurst is estimated to generate seven-figure revenues annually – and now it's a ready meal Volkswagen has launched a new version of its best-selling product and it has the potential to dramatically increase revenues and profitability – but it’s nothing to do with cars. In a twist that might make even the most seasoned automotive analyst do a double-take, one of the firm’s most important product lines isn’t a vehicle, or even a vehicle component, but a traditional type of German sausage. The world’s second-largest car maker is also a heavyweight in the processed meat business, and its famed Volkswagen currywurst is now heading for the ready meal aisle in supermarkets. First grilled into existence in 1973 at the company’s own butchery in Wolfsburg, the sausage was originally intended for internal use only, fuelling staff in Volkswagen’s canteens, but it soon escaped the factory gates and quickly attained cult status among the German public. In 2024 alone, Volkswagen sold close to 8.6 million currywursts, comfortably eclipsing the 5.2m Volkswagen-branded cars and commercial vehicles it delivered globally. Even counting all Volkswagen Group brands combined (9.03m), currywurst runs a close second. From June 2025, it’s getting the full ready meal supermarket treatment, with a microwave-ready version launching at retailers such as Edeka and Netto in northern and eastern Germany. A national rollout is reportedly in the works. While microwave currywurst trays have been available since the early 2000s, Volkswagen’s version has a factory-fresh twist: no sachet of curry powder for the tomato sauce, which Dietmar Schulz, head of Volkswagen’s in-house meat department, says is because “there’s already enough curry in there – in the sausage and in the sauce”. Currywurst isn’t just a PR novelty: it’s big business. Although Volkswagen doesn’t specifically detail its sausage sales in its annual report, estimates suggest its processed meat operation generates seven-figure annual revenues in euros. The currywurst even has an official Volkswagen part number: 199 398 500 A. Over the decades, currywurst has become part of Volkswagen folklore. When the German car maker attempted to replace it with a vegetarian alternative in one factory canteen, the backlash was swift and fierce. “No Volkswagen sausage? No way!” became the rallying cry. Now, with the new microwave-ready version, Volkswagen is keeping things properly seasoned and aiming for even bigger sales.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-official-pictures-new-jeep-cherokee-ahead-2026-launch",
    "description": "New Cherokee looks like a larger Compass – and will also get EV power Go-anywhere Discovery rival moves onto a new platform to add the option of EV power for the first time Jeep has provided the first look at the next-generation Cherokee ahead of its official debut later this year and an expected European launch in 2026. The first pictures of Jeep's Land Rover Discovery rival confirm that it will look very similar to the recently revealed Compass, above which it sits in the SUV brand's line-up. This new version will be completely unrelated to its predecessor, swapping onto parent company Stellantis's new STLA Large architecture, which will enable it to be offered with hybrid and pure-electric power. Jeep has not confirmed which will come first and has yet to disclose any technical details. It will be closely related to the next-generation Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which will use the same platform.  The first images of the new Cherokee have been published just a day after former Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa was named as the new CEO of Stellantis, following Carlos Tavares's exit from the role late last year.  His replacement at Jeep, CEO Bob Broderdorf, said: “The all-new Jeep Cherokee headlines our efforts to deliver more product, innovation, choice and standard content to customers than ever before. “Jeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream line-up.” These official images, and earlier spy shots, confirm that the Cherokee shares several design cues with the electric Wagoneer S, including a sloping roofline, squared-off haunches, rear doors set into the wheel arches and door handles recessed into the body. Up front, however, it features a more prominent variant of Jeep’s seven-slot grille, mirroring that on the new Compass. It's possible that the combustion version of the Cherokee will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre ‘Hurricane’ straight six from the petrol-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, offered with outputs of 420bhp and 510bhp. An electric Cherokee is likely to be equipped with the 600bhp dual-motor, four-wheel-drive powertrain from the Wagoneer S. This is paired with a 118kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery in that car, giving it a range of 303 miles (according to the US’s EPA test, which is less lenient than the WLTP regime used in Europe).  Inside, spy shots reveal that the new Cherokee has a large infotainment touchscreen similar to the 12.3in unit featured in the Wagoneer S, with rotary control dials on its sides. The climate functions, meanwhile, are operated using a touchbar recessed into the dashboard, just below the main screen. The Grand Cherokee will be withdrawn from sale in Europe in the coming months to make room for the Wagoneer S. A similar decision may be made about the Wrangler when the upcoming Recon EV lands in Europe next year.",

Lucky guess. Pioneering purpose-built gear from straps and wheel chocks to ramps and dollies, Acebikes supplies just about everything your motorcycle needs when your bum’s not in the saddle, short of storage insurance and STA-BIL. Admittedly, Acebikes loaded us down with new kit right in the middle of our off-season, but we’ve had time to put it to the test now that spring has sprung. With our web cred on the line, I seized every opportunity to use what Acebikes sent, and loaned it out to every friend in need. The most notable of these hauls was the transport of a Honda Rune (that’s an 890-pound bike for the uninitiated) from Florida to Northern Wisconsin, just short of 1,600 miles.…",

    "description": "There’s no denying the popularity of the classic BMW boxer—but it does have its idiosyncrasies. Perhaps the most infamous of these is the way its fuel tank leans one way, while its substantial engine block leans another. This visual disharmony didn’t sit well with Earth Motorcycles. Faced with a 1987 BMW R80RT and a client who wanted a slick café racer, the Slovakian custom shop resolved to massage the old boxer’s individual parts into alignment. “Typically, this imbalance forces builders to angle the rear of the seat upwards, giving the bike a more aggressive, dramatic posture,” says Earth’s founder, Vlado Dinga. “Like many others, Earth has gone that route before. But this time, we chose to challenge the geometry instead of accepting it.”…",

    "description": "We rode this bike in Portugal alongside the new CFMoto 675s, and while it isn’t as dynamically impressive as those three-cylinder bikes, it excels at offering a huge amount of motorcycle at a frankly phenomenal price point. Priced at €6,900 in Italy, it costs less than a KTM 390 Adventure R in that market, yet it gives you a full-size adventure tourer experience that’s knocking on the doors of bikes twice its price. CFMoto 700MT engine and performance The engine is up to the task but not exciting Powering the 700MT is a 693cc parallel-twin that CFMoto says is a heavily reworked version of its older 650 engine – which itself was closely benchmarked to Kawasaki’s 650 twin. The company says that this new engine not only offers a better riding experience but also improved reliability. 693cc engine quick and tractable but not exciting. On the move, it’s not got that modern-day 270-degree crank charisma and is more of an old-school, gruff-sounding engine, much like the Kawasaki 650. But what it lacks in character, it makes up for in functionality. It’s tractable, flexible, and pulls cleanly through the rev range. There’s a noticeable thrum through the footpegs, but vibes at the handlebar are well-contained, even as you wind it up. Gear ratios are well spaced, and it never feels out of its element – whether you’re chugging through a roundabout in the third or cruising calmly at 120kph in the sixth. You can rev it out to extract the most of the 68hp/60Nm, but this motor is best enjoyed at a more relaxed pace, where you can effortlessly surf the midrange. CFMoto 700MT suspension and comfort Suspension doesn't have lot of travel but still feels composed We rode the 700MT through winding country lanes, and it proved to be an enjoyable companion at a relaxed pace. This is a machine that invites you to sit back, take in the scenery, and enjoy the journey. That relaxed nature is backed by solid ergonomics. The 800mm seat height is welcoming, especially for a bike of this size, though the seat is quite wide and shorter riders may still struggle to get both feet down. Cross-spoked tubeless wheels come as standard. The suspension setup offers only 150mm of travel, and it worked decently well on Portugal’s roads, but this most certainly isn’t an off-road bike. However, for long-distance tarmac touring and the odd rough patch or dirt trail, the suspension feels controlled and planted. It doesn’t float over bad roads like a plush ADV would, but it gets the job done with composure. Its overall identity is similar to the Kawasaki Versys, despite the more ADV-style looks with those spoked rims and the 19-inch front wheel. CFMoto 700MT weight and handling It is a heavy bike but still handles decently well The big downside is the weight. The 700MT looks big, and its weight matches this – 240kg as standard and 258kg with the three optional aluminium panniers fitted. That puts it firmly in full-size ADV territory and even heavier than BMW’s R1300GS. The 700MT is a properly heavy thing and weighs more than some full-size ADVs. From the saddle, the bike definitely feels large but the steering is light, and it’s easy to manoeuvre. What I did find interesting – and a little unusual – is how far the windscreen sits from the rider. It’s nearly three feet ahead, which means adjusting it on the fly takes a decent stretch, but the upside is that wind protection is excellent. It was cold and rainy during our test ride, and with the screen set high, the protection it offered was genuinely impressive. CFMoto 700MT features and quality The TFT display and cross-spoke wheels are premium touches The 700MT comes from a Chinese brand that is all about low-cost products, but you wouldn’t guess that from its features or build quality. Fit and finish is at a high level, the 5-inch TFT display has smooth animations and an intuitive layout, and the bike comes with switchable ABS basic traction control, adjustable suspension and tubeless spoked wheels. What it doesn’t get are things like a bi-directional quickshifter or cruise control, which is partly down to the fact that this bike has a cable-operated throttle. 5-inch TFT has a clean and functional interface. CFMoto 700MT India launch and expected price Remains to be seen if the 700MT comes here in the future The big question is whether we’ll get this bike in India, and there is no clear answer right now. CFMoto has already confirmed that the smaller, lighter 450MT will launch here first, and we already rode that bike in Hyderabad last month. But the 700MT? I’d argue it deserves a spot here as well for its big-bike vibe, real-world usability, and fantastic value for money. As with all these CFMoto bikes, questions remain around long-term reliability and after-sales support, especially in India. CFMoto has been building a strong reputation in Europe and Australia in this regard, and that’s a promising sign. But it will ultimately come down to how well their local partner’s (who has asked to remain unnamed for now) service network can support these bikes here. For now, though, the 700MT is another clear signal that modern-day CFMoto is here to play, and the competition should be paying close attention. Also See: CFMoto MT 700 video review",

    "description": "The Rynox Air GT gloves have been a compelling choice for urban riders seeking a balance between comfort, protection and affordability. Rynox has now updated them with some flexible rubber protection that covers the carpal bones for better abrasion resistance. While they remain the same overall, this new addition has driven up their price by Rs 700.  These gloves are crafted from perforated, soft, full-grain leather with additional leather panels in high-abrasion zones. They are designed to offer both durability and ventilation, making them pretty usable in our tropical climate. Flexible armour doesn’t compromise overall comfort. While Rynox says the fingers are pre-curved and don’t require any wear-in, these gloves felt a bit too rigid initially, and I found that they do require a bit of breaking in. After this, they feel quite comfortable, thanks partly to the accordion stretch panels, allowing for easier hand movements. The built-in touchscreen-compatible fingertips work well enough but don’t allow for very precise inputs due to the rounded edges on the fingertips, although this holds true for most gloves. Despite the leather construction these gloves have decent ventilation. The cuff has a small elastic panel that allows for easier ingress and egress of your hand. This, paired with the adjuster on the wrist, ensures a tight yet comfortable fit. In terms of protection, these gloves are CE certified to the EN 13594:2015 standard and offer TPU protectors with HD foam backing on the knuckles, HD foam inserts on the fingertips and joints and the newly added protection for the carpus bones.  The only change is the added protection on the palm. Despite our summer heat, these gloves feel decently ventilated and don’t add any discomfort to my commutes or rides. However, it’s worth noting that they are not waterproof, making them less ideal for the monsoons.

    "description": "Tata Motors has had a busy few years with a slew of EV launches and revitalised SUVs, but if there’s one model that seemed left behind it’s the Altroz. Sure, it received a new dual-clutch gearbox, a (now-discontinued) turbo-petrol engine and a CNG variant in the time since its launch in 2020, but the basic package itself has largely been untouched. Things change with the Altroz facelift you see here. Fresher styling, a redone interior and a massive feature upgrade bring the likeable Tata premium hatchback to the present. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift exterior design and engineering - 9/10 The facelift adds new-age glam to a very appealing design. The updated Altroz conforms to Tata’s sharper new style sheet, and the effect is great. Making the biggest impact up front is the new bumper that sports more pronounced cuts and creases at the side vents and fog lamp enclosures. The fog lamps are smaller, sit lower down and have been upgraded to LEDs on top-spec versions. A slimmer grille with a textured finish is part of the updates too and flows slickly into the swept-back headlamps. While the headlamps are familiar in shape, the internals have been redone with new LED DRLs and, on top-spec versions, full-LED lighting. Headlamp shape remains similar, but internals are new; LED fog lamps on top trim. New alloy wheels (with EV-like aero streaks) are part of the updates but aren’t the only changes at the sides. Tata Motors has gone the distance with new doors with softer lines as well as a slimmer iteration of the black band that underlines the windows. It’s a cleaner look but the updated Altroz has lost some of the original’s sporty tipped-forward stance. Flush-fitting front door handles are new but aren’t the easiest to use, requiring a firm press to get the lever out. As before, the rear door handles are mounted on the C-pillar and, again, take some getting used to. Altroz facelift has sheet metal changes in the form of new doors with softer lines. Styling at the back has been revamped, although at first glance, you might think just the rear bumper is new. However, while the tail-lamp housing is unchanged, lighting is from slim LEDs inside. Top models also get a light bar that up the wow factor. Just wish Tata gave the Altroz chunkier rubber. The 185-section tyres take away a bit from the stance. Notably, 195-section tyres were dropped over the Altroz’s life perhaps in the interest of upping economy. Slim 185-section tyres take away from the stance of the hatchback. The Altroz is built on Tata Motors' ALFA architecture. Side protection has been beefed up with this update to meet the more stringent requirements for a 5-star crash test rating in today’s Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP protocols. The original Altroz was a 5-star Global NCAP rated car and Tata will sure be gunning for full marks for the 2025 model. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift interior space and comfort - 8/10 Lots of shared elements with other Tata models, but it's premium and modern Light colours and new textures lend the cabin a premium feel. Where the Altroz takes a big step forwards is on the inside. Sure, there are a lot of elements common to other Tata models but the combined effect is that of an up-to-date and premium interior. The digital instruments, 10.25-inch touchscreen, a two-spoke steering with an illuminated logo and new centre console go a long way to enhance the look of things inside. The dashboard has also been spruced up with lighter colours and new textures, and there’s nice use of ambient lighting, too. Fit and finish is good, but keeping the light upholstery clean will require some commitment on your part. Also, the gloss black panel for the climate control system is easy to scratch, so it could lose its sheen soon. Gloss black HVAC panel could be prone to losing its sheen over time. Tata Motors has enhanced the seats with greater thigh support, and this does aid comfort over long drives. Drivers will miss steering reach adjust (it still adjusts for angle only) and will also find that the thick A-pillar hampers visibility at crossroads. Doors that open 90 degrees (a feature on ALFA architecture cars) make getting in and out easy, but it’s quite a reach to shut the door when fully open. Rear seat space is satisfactory (a Hyundai i20 is roomier) for average-sized adults, but taller occupants will find headroom just about adequate. Also, the rear seat is a touch upright. Front seats now have better thigh support, enhancing comfort over long drives.  The Altroz does well to offer enough storage spaces inside the cabin, including a handily large glovebox. 345 litres of boot space is a class-best stat and what’s particularly impressive is that even the CNG versions offer a very usable 210 litres of room, made possible by Tata’s clever use of two slim CNG tanks, in place of a larger single tank. Rear seat space is satisfactory for average-sized adults   2025 Tata Altroz facelift features and safety - 8/10 Few niceties missing, but overall it's a techy and feature-packed hatchback The Tata Altroz is available in four trims (or personas as Tata calls them), namely Pure, Smart, Creative and Accomplished S, with the last three further available with ‘+’ add-on packs. However, only the Altroz DCA can be had in fully loaded Accomplished S+ form, which makes it the only one with features like 10.25-inch digital dials (integrated with a map view and blind view monitor), connected tech and an onboard air purifier. 10.25-inch touchscreen is slick and responsive.  Our Accomplished S trim test cars did not disappoint on kit, though. The 10.25-inch touchscreen is responsive and quick, and worked without glitch. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included and the 360-degree camera’s resolution is good too. Wireless charging is a part of the package and there are also 65W type-C chargers at the front and rear that can power a laptop. Ambient lighting adds some colour to the dash and you can further brighten proceedings with a sunroof (offered as an option on the Smart and Creative trims). Of the other things, the part-digital instruments with a 7-inch MID are informative as well. Leatherette upholstery is no longer offered on the Altroz and a bigger miss is the exclusion of front seat ventilation that was only recently rolled out on the Altroz Racer. Ambient lighting has been put to good use to spruce up the dashboard. Standard safety kit includes 6 airbags, electronic stability control, Isofix child seat mounts and 3-point seat belts for all seats. Irritatingly, the rear seats lack load sensors and the seat belt reminder buzzes even if the seats are not occupied. Higher-spec models add in auto lights and wipers, tyre pressure monitors and height adjustable rear headrests.  2025 Tata Altroz facelift performance and refinement - 7/10 CNG variant is only best for urban use; highway duties are handled better by the diesel With the update, Tata Motors has made some changes to the engine and gearbox options on offer. The turbo-petrol engine-powered Altroz Racer has been dropped (at least for now) and there’s a new AMT option on the 1.2-litre petrol engine. To put the powertrain matrix in words, the 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, petrol engine (88hp and 115Nm) can be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox, a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic and a new 5-speed AMT. The Altroz CNG uses the same 1.2 engine as its base (power drops to 73.5hp and 103Nm in CNG mode) and it can be had with a 5-speed manual; a 5-speed AMT comes soon. And finally, there’s a 90hp and 200Nm, 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel that can only be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Featured here are the CNG and diesel versions of the Altroz. Altroz CNG performance not particular peppy, but it's better than the numbers suggest. Drivers will appreciate the option to start the Altroz in CNG mode and you’ll realise performance is better on the go than the power numbers will have you believe. Sure, it’s not particularly peppy, but keeping up with the flow of traffic and general city driving is well taken care of. It’s an unexciting engine, but that’s unlikely to be a deterrent for a CNG buyer who is primarily interested in the low running costs. A light clutch helps the experience in town. The Altroz CNG does feel out of its comfort zone on expressways, where the lack of ready power becomes evident. You do have the option to switch to petrol mode when you need more from the engine, but high-speed performance remains humdrum. Revving the engine hard will have the noise levels rise sharply with an audible whine from under the engine bay. Altroz CNG feels out of its comfort zone on expressways.  The Altroz diesel is better suited for those with lots of highway running. The engine delivers a wide spread of power and the 200Nm of torque sure comes handy when you want to make your way past traffic. Thing is, the diesel engine is loud. You can hear a clatter at idle, and it remains quite noisy throughout the rev band. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift efficiency/range - 7/10 Tata hasn’t released official fuel economy numbers for the 2025 Altroz. We did test the Altroz CNG earlier this year and got real-world figures of 20.56km/kg in city driving and 29.65km/kg on the highway. The Altroz petrol and diesel feature a fairly small 37-litre fuel tank. The CNG’s twin cylinders have 60 litres of gas capacity.   2025 Tata Altroz facelift ride comfort and handling - 9/10 Ride and handling balance is best in class; highway manners are confident  Ride and handling have been highlights on the Altroz since day one and the story is no different even today. There is a slight firmness that comes through from the suspension and tyres at low speeds, but when the surface deteriorates, the Altroz shines. It gobbles potholes with ease and there’s a toughness from the package that you don’t get in any other hatchback. There's a feel of robustness in the way the Altroz rides. High-speed manners are also polished and confident, and what adds to the experience is the handling. You get a great sense of connect from the steering, with the Altroz changing direction with grace. The steering requires little effort to twirl at low speeds too. What is a downer is the insufficient noise insulation. Over high speed cruises, there’s quite a bit of road noise as well as wind noise emanating in the region of the wing mirrors.    2025 Tata Altroz facelift price and verdict - 8/10 Up-to-date and more premium, but few shortcomings still  Tata has launched the Altroz at Rs 6.89 lakh (ex-showroom) with the range-topping version priced at Rs 11.49 lakh. Pricing is in the same ballpark as comparable engine-gearbox versions of rivals like the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and Hyundai i20. The comprehensive updates with the facelift lend the Altroz a more upmarket vibe.  Buyers with lots of running or diesel fans will find a good fit in the Altroz diesel, while the CNG makes great sense for city dwellers looking to keep running costs in check without compromising on creature comforts. The petrol engine isn’t up there with Suzuki’s K12 unit but is fine for city use. AMT and dual-clutch auto options also promise added convenience. What’s a pity is that Altroz buyers don’t have the option of a sporty turbo-petrol engine that would really complement the slick handling.  While refinement could be better, the comprehensive update addresses some of the Altroz’s more glaring shortcomings like features. There’s a more upmarket vibe to the package now making the Altroz more compelling than ever before. Also See: Tata Altroz facelift video review",

    "description": "F1 heads to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for the Spanish GP this weekend (May 30-June 1). McLaren has won six of the first seven races so far this season, but Spain offers an opportunity to mix up the pecking order with a new rule change coming into force. The F2 support series will also be held alongside F1, while Formula E heads to China for the Shanghai E-Prix double-header. Here’s your complete guide for when and where to tune in from India: 2025 F1 Spanish GP schedule Lando Norris’ Monaco GP win has intensified the title battle, with just three points separating him and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri. So far, McLaren has clearly dominated, with Red Bull showing some bursts of pace. But the Spanish GP could be a potential turning point for the season, with the introduction of stronger tests for front wing flexing. As per the new rules, deflection allowance under static load will be reduced from 15mm to 10mm. Speaking earlier this year, Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur described this as a potential “gamechanger” for the competitive order.

He followed that up with a P6 finish in the Feature Race, collecting his highest points haul of the season. This catapulted him from 17th to 12th in the championship, and more crucially, gave him a much-needed confidence boost after a difficult start to the year. “It feels like this is the start of our season, and as we head straight to Barcelona, we’ll aim to keep this momentum going as we build on these results,” said Maini. Luke Browning currently leads the standings, just three points ahead of Alexander Dunne.

The smaller dual-battery setup gets a 4.1kWh battery pack with a WMTC-claimed range of 120km and a kerb weight of 143kg. It can be charged using a home charger in 1 hour 30 minutes or with a traditional car charger in 1 hour. The larger triple-battery configuration gets a 6.2kWh battery and a higher 170km (WMTC) range. This model weighs in at 156kg, and can be charged in 2 hours and 30 minutes via a home charger and in 1 hour and 30 minutes using a traditional car charger. Both the battery packs power the motor that produces a peak power of 15.3kW. The E-VO runs on an unconventional 16/14-inch (F/R) wheel setup shod in semi-slick tyres. It gets dual-channel ABS. The chassis features a forged all-aluminium build. Wuyang Honda E VO features The E-VO’s features list is also generous with some innovative firsts. It gets three riding modes (Eco/Normal/Sport), a 7-inch TFT dash with a secondary TFT of the same size that communicates navigation, music, tyre pressure and battery SOC information, among others. The smaller battery pack gets a front dash cam whereas the larger battery model adds a rear dash cam to the package. It is available in two colours – black and white. It is priced at CNY 30,000 (Rs 3.56 lakh approx) for the 4.1kWh battery variant and CNY 37,000 (Rs 4.39 lakh approx) for the 6.2kWh variant. This electric bike is made specially for the Chinese market with their regional partner Wuyang, and it is unlikely that Honda launches the E-VO in India.
