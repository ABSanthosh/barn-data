    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-comparison-reviews/bsa-gold-star-650-vs-royal-enfield-interceptor-650-comparison-review-433196#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Here are two modern retro motorcycles that carry a British badge and a sizeable chunk of motorcycling history behind their names. At first glance, these two bikes seem relatively identical since they have similar designs, performance, engine capacity, weight and price. However, the difference is more apparent when these two are ridden back to back. BSA’s Gold Star is the new kid on the block and has no direct rival apart from Royal Enfield’s Interceptor 650. Both these motorcycles approach the same goal in a different manner, which delivers a very different riding experience overall. We’re here to tell you what those differences are and how these two stack up in the real world. Flamboyance \u0026 Flair Given their retro credentials, both motorcycles take a rather minimalist approach to their throwback aesthetics. There is abundant use of chrome, and while looks are subjective, I found myself gravitating a little more towards the Gold Star. Both motorcycles get a round headlamp, flat seats and a well-shaped fuel tank. They are available in multiple colours, depending on which the price can vary. Classy retro dials fit the aesthetic, but the tiny screens are hard to read. The feature list, too, is relatively minimal, and while the Interceptor 650 now gets an LED headlamp that outperforms the simple halogen setup on the Gold Star, BSA’s approach seems a tad more authentic, given the overall aesthetic. On the flip side, both motorcycles get analogue-styled dials, but I quite like the amber backlight on the Gold Star. However, there is no denying that the Interceptor 650’s dials are more readable and that the LCD screen has better visibility. The Gold Star is equipped with a Type-A and Type-C charging socket, while the Interceptor 650 gets a USB port that’s hidden away. Royal Enfield has also equipped the Interceptor with a set of adjustable levers – a welcome addition. While the 650 has more expensive-feeling switchgear with aluminium housings, the Gold Star’s conventional switches are more straightforward to use. In terms of build quality, both motorcycles lack the premium touch and feel like they’re built on a budget. That said, the Gold Star is by far the best offering to come out of Classic Legends’ stable despite having areas that could use improvement. Early signs of rust and  a loose-fitting side panel did seem concerning, but the brand says it is working on improving its overall quality. The Interceptor 650, too, has some signs of rust, but overall, it feels like the better-built machine in this comparison. Interceptor’s clocks are simpler, but the larger digital display is more legible. It is worth mentioning that the Gold Star does not come with a main stand as standard, and BSA – for now – doesn’t offer one as an accessory either. RE’s footpeg placement is a well-known issue. The Interceptor 650 is not only equipped with a main stand but also has a higher ground clearance. My issue with this RE is with its footpegs, which tend to jut out and come in the way while you ‘walk’ the motorcycle in traffic. While this issue is less bothersome for taller riders, shorter ones will find it more tedious. In the saddle The Gold Star’s riding position feels more natural and less aggressive in comparison. You get a slightly more upright seating posture and a more relaxed footpeg position. Coupled with a soft seat and a 780mm seat height, this is more approachable for shorter riders, but someone over 6 feet may find the leg space to be a bit cramped. Rishaad did wish for a slightly firmer seat, which is an easy fix in comparison to the Interceptor 650’s shortcomings. Gold Star has a wider seat with softer padding. Royal Enfield has built the Interceptor 650 with slightly more sportier ergonomics. It’s noticeable from the moment you swing your leg over its taller and narrower seat, and you’ll notice a more forward lean as you reach for the handlebar. Its footpegs, too, are slightly higher, and the narrow seat does rob it of some comfort as it puts more pressure on your tail bones and causes saddle soreness sooner than you’d expect. Royal Enfield does sell a more comfortable accessory, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem – only makes it slightly more bearable. Seat is well cushioned but uncomfortably narrow. Take aim, fire! The BSA Gold Star’s single-cylinder engine is one of the largest in its class and traces its roots back to the Rotax engine used in the BMW Funduro F650. This motor packs a healthy low- to mid-range performance, builds power from as low as 2,500rpm, and does so linearly. Despite the single-cylinder unit, BSA has done a commendable job of keeping the vibrations in check. Though it is short on one gear, the Gold Star’s engine and gearbox combination work well in tandem and will rarely ever leave you wanting that extra gear. That said, I have a few gripes with this motor, starting with its low-speed throttle response, which can sometimes feel too snatchy. We faced low-speed stalling issues with both motorcycles, but the Gold Star stalled more frequently. Underdamped rear shocks are the main complaint. The Interceptor 650, on the other hand, felt a lot smoother thanks to its extra cylinder and had a more pleasant sound to its exhaust. RE’s 650cc motor will happily cruise in higher gears at lower speeds, and the tractable motor will even reward you with a soothing note each time you downshift, but it is no match for the BSA’s mid-range punch. It felt like the more engaging motor, regardless of the speed or riding style I took up. Our numbers reveal that the Gold Star is the quicker motorcycle of the two. Not only did the Gold Star have better acceleration figures, but it also showcased quicker in-gear acceleration. It is also worth noting that we tested the BSA in the wet, which means we could expect even better numbers with dry tarmac. Interceptor’s suspension setup does a better job. Fuel economy is where the Interceptor 650 shines with a larger fuel tank, longer range and better city and highway efficiency. Its engine also handles high-speed touring better, with a calmer demeanour at higher RPMs. However, in city traffic, the BSA is more accessible to ride due to its more relaxed riding position and lighter clutch. Neither engine had a heating issue in bumper-to-bumper traffic and kept their cool in tight jams.  It’s about to get bumpy   In terms of weight, both motorcycles have a mere 5kg variance, but the difference feels higher, and the Interceptor comes across as a heavier, more cumbersome machine. The Gold Star is nimble at low speeds and showcases capable handling around flat, well-paved corners. However, its underdamped rear suspension is its biggest flaw and renders the ride and handling a bit too wallowy around most bumpy roads. It can take getting used to, but it does hamper the overall day-to-day experience with this motorcycle. On the flip side, the Gold Star’s Pirelli tyres and Brembo brakes do a fantastic job of providing stopping power, and the lever packs a decent amount of feedback. All in all, the bike rides well, but it deserves better rear suspension.  RE’s brakes and tyres aren’t as good as the BSA’s. While not exceptional, the Interceptor 650’s suspension has been improved over time and feels more balanced than the BSA’s. However, its brakes and tyres could use some improvement. Regarding handling, the Interceptor feels more capable with higher lean angles, but it takes more work to manage at low speeds in heavy traffic. BSA’s fit and finish can be improved. Old but gold Price isn’t likely to be the deciding factor, as both bikes are similarly priced. The actual choice comes down to the experience you’re looking for. The BSA Gold Star offers a more authentic retro experience with a delightful torque-driven engine. It’s more comfortable, easier to manage in the city, and can be fun around well-paved corners. Although it falls short on one cylinder and the lower refinement that comes with it, it makes up for it with its engaging power delivery and solid braking performance. It is our choice when it comes to a modern, classic riding experience. However, Classic Legends must prove its long-term reliability. And while the quality levels on its bikes have improved over time, there is still some way to go. BSA’s brake and tyre combo works surprisingly well. The Royal Enfield has a gem of an engine, and if you want a twin-cylinder experience, it has to be the RE. What also works in its favour is RE’s extensive service network and its vast accessory list. So, while we enjoyed riding the BSA more, the Interceptor 650 might be the safer bet for some people. Also See: BSA Gold Star 650 vs Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 comparison video",

    "description": "It’s been nearly a year since I got my hands on RS Taichi’s waterproof backpack, which is available in five colours and a unique Resident Evil edition. I’ve gone for the plain black shade due to its stealthy look and was quite eager to see just how usable this bag would be during monsoon. The WP backpack’s construction mainly comprises polyester and thermoplastic polyurethane. The bag consists of a primary 25-litre waterproof compartment, a smaller compartment located near the primary compartment’s opening and an external quick-access pocket that isn’t waterproof. Main compartment holds 25L. The bag uses a roll-up top system to seal the main compartment and can be adjusted based on how full it gets. It’s easy to use and even includes a Velcro strap to keep it tightly sealed. Its 25-litre storage is a boon for when I’m travelling, and over time, I’ve fit huge items in this compartment, including Rishaad’s fully packed Kriega R25 backpack! Secondary compartment is handy storage for small items The secondary compartment is only water-resistant, even though it uses the same opening as the main compartment. It can be used for smaller items, such as a pair of gloves, balaclavas and cleaning cloths. The third external pocket is mainly designed for items you’d like to keep handy that aren’t fazed by the rain, like a set of keys. Outer pocket is not waterproof. This bag gets a chest harness and a waist belt; both of these can be further adjusted to your size and do a good job of preventing the straps from slipping off the shoulders and distributing luggage weight evenly, especially when on the bike. Chest harness divides the load and provides a better fit. The overall fit, finish and feel of this bag are premium, and it feels built to last. However, after all this time, I did lose the rubberised end on the zipper pull tab located on the external pocket. Honestly, this is quite a minor issue and can be easily replaced. I’ve had absolutely no complaints with this bag otherwise. It’s been quite handy and dependable through my daily commute during peak Mumbai monsoon. Waist harness helps keep the bag secure while riding. Given that this bag is waterproof, you are prone to wearing it outside your protective rain gear, which can make it susceptible to dirt and grime being flung on it by the rear wheel. In such cases, a quick wipe-down with a wet cloth helps, and fortunately, the bag doesn’t stain permanently. This bag is currently available on special order at 6kiom.com and will cost approximately Rs 15,000. Velcro strap help seat the two main compartments well. I managed to buy it for far less overseas, and you may also have to wait anywhere from one to four months for it to be delivered. Just like most imported products, the RS Taichi WP backpack comes at a price, but it gives you good quality and performance in return. Also see: Ixon Dirt Air gloves review",

    "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a long, storied history with India with the first model officially launched almost 30 years ago. It has been going strong ever since and has been the bestselling Mercedes in India for years. Its popularity only grew with the introduction of the long-wheelbase V213 model in 2017. In its sixth generation now, the V214 E-Class is bigger, techier and promises the same chart-topping performance. We test the claim with the entry-level E 200. Mercedes-Benz E-Class exterior The new E-Class is longer, taller, and has a longer wheelbase than before, and as a result, road presence is considerable. Up front it gets LED headlamps in Merc’s latest design language, but the digital LED lights with projector elements are reserved for the top-of-the-line E 450. The star-studded grille with the huge Mercedes logo further adds the necessary bling, though its thick black surround seems at odds with the otherwise restrained and classy look. It doesn't scrape over large bumps, but you still need to be careful due to its long wheelbase. Over to the side, the added length gives it that much-needed limousine look, while the S-Class-like flush door handles are a techy touch. Like the new BMW 5 Series, the E-Class also gets 18-inch wheels, but, as the spokes stretch to the end of the rim, they feel bigger and don’t look as disproportionate as the ones on the BMW. The separated rear quarter glass is a nod to the Maybach S-Class. Gets 18-inch alloys like the 5 Series, but the Merc's look more proportional. At the rear, it gets LED tail-lamps with the tri-arrow design embedded and a healthy dose of chrome.  Mercedes-Benz E-Class interior The E-Class has also grown on the inside, both in terms of space and modernity. The front section is dominated by what’s called a ‘Superscreen’, which means the dashboard itself is made of three individual screens: the digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch main infotainment system and a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen. We’ve seen this cluster on new Mercs with a host of customisation options (although not as much as in larger Mercs), but the large centre screen is where most of the functionality is. So much so that even the AC vents are digitally controlled via the settings in the climate menu of the screen. Definitely a handful, but something that would mostly concern the chauffeur more than the owner seated in the rear, and luckily can be manually overriden. Moreover, HVAC controls are now exclusively in the touchscreen like the S- and C-Class, but less intuitively, require a two-step process to access. Dash dominated by Superscreen; passenger gets 12.3-inch touchscreen. What’s impressive are the seats that offer good room and support with the right amount of cushioning. The soft pillows help, but ventilation is sorely missed on hot days. Also, strangely, the Burmester sound system’s stunning 4D experience is exclusive to the front seats. The speakers inside the seats can be altered up to 10 levels, and at their maximum, are strong enough to double up as a massage function as well. Aesthetically, it gets a large open-pore wood panel for the centre console and soft-touch materials all around. What is a slight irritant is the cramped footwell with a cramped dead pedal – noticeable if you are someone with a UK12 foot size.  Burmester sound system's 4D experience exclusive to the front seats. In the back, space is even more generous than before. But it’s not just the sheer room on offer, the overall comfort is impressive as well. The seats, like at the front, are hugely comfy with the right amount of support and cushioning; however, the party piece is the recline that’s increased from 26 degrees to 36 degrees. And that's not all, the seat squab also features an extendable underthigh support for added comfort. Add to that the ‘Boss’ mode, which allows you to push the passenger seat all the way to the front, and you get enough room to sit as comfortably as you would in a lounge chair. It also features powered sunblinds for the rear windshield and windows with manual blinds for the rear quarter glass. AC performance was a sore point for the earlier version, but the four-zone climate control and the AC vents housed in the centre and B-pillars help cool the cabin much faster now. However, a command touchpad to control the infotainment screens would have been a cherry on top. The India-spec E-Class gets the ‘Chauffeur Pack’ as standard, which brings with it a foldable centre armrest for the rear with cup holders, a wireless charging pad and some storage space. Fold the armrest back and you’ll have a centre seat, but it’s far from comfortable due to the large centre tunnel hump. This makes the E-Class only an occasional 5-seater. Boss mode and 36-degree reclining seats mean it's as comfortable as a lounge chair. What does improve practicality, however, is the fact that you no longer have to sacrifice boot space with a spare wheel. The space saver now sits under the boot floor and results in a rather generous 510-litre boot. Mercedes-Benz E-Class performance The new E-Class comes with three powertrain options: the E 200 seen here with a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine, the E 220d with a 2.0-litre diesel and the E 450 with a 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine. In terms of performance, the 2.0-litre petrol engine makes 204hp and 320Nm but also features a 48V mild-hybrid setup that bumps up the power by 23hp under acceleration. That said, the response is linear and the surge in acceleration is gentle. Although it’s more responsive in Sport mode, it never feels too aggressive. Mated to the engine is a 9-speed automatic, which, thanks to the closely stacked gears, always ensures you are in the power band. The mild-hybrid setup aids in bottom-end response and the torque flattens out once you’re over triple-digit speeds. The engine is refined, but there’s a raspy exhaust note that seeps into the cabin past 3,200rpm; it is far from sounding coarse. 0-100kph is a relaxed 8.25 seconds but there is no dearth of pulling power during overtakes. Mercedes-Benz E-Class ride and handling While the performance might not be something to boast about, the focus of an E-Class is always comfort and ride quality. With 18-inch wheels and a soft suspension setup, the new E rides well and composed on smooth highways. However, over broken roads, especially at low speeds, there is a fair bit of movement inside the cabin, and it can thud over bad patches. That said, ground clearance is something you don't have to worry about much with the new E. Large speed bumps are well managed, and the car almost never scrapes its underbelly. Impressive, but you still need to be wary of the long wheelbase over some poorly built speed bumps, and cannot treat it like an SUV.  0-100kph takes 8.25 seconds, but there's no dearth of pulling power during overtakes. Handling manners are neutral with a light yet sharp and linear steering that aids manoeuvrability. You can tweak the response in the drive modes, but it remains a comfy cruiser and not a corner carver. That said, grip levels are good and body roll, despite the soft suspension, is only marginal. Mercedes-Benz E-Class price and verdict Priced at Rs 78.5 lakh, the E 200 is almost Rs 2 lakh more than its predecessor and a good Rs 5.8 lakh more than its arch rival, the BMW 5 Series, which is also available in long-wheelbase guise now. A comparison of the two is inevitable, but as things stand, the new E-Class – especially in this E 200 guise – has got a lot of things right. It gets the stately look expected of a limousine, plenty of tech to keep it modern for a few years, and an even more spacious and comfy rear seat than before. Yes, the ride isn’t the most comfy, but it's not a deal-breaker. It is a vast improvement over the previous version, which is a feat in itself. The real question though, is if it is better than the new BMW 5 Series, and we will find that out soon.  Also see: Next-gen Mercedes CLA previewed ahead of global debut Constant changes in EV taxation distort the market, says Mercedes India CEO",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ferrari-f80-succeeds-laferrari-1184bhp-f1-v6-powertrain",
    "description": "The F80 is powered by a wild 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 hybrid engine which makes 1184bhp F1 and Le Mans inspired hypercar is the most powerful road-going Ferrari ever made Ferrari’s long-awaited successor to the LaFerrari is the Italian marque’s most powerful road car to date, drawing 1184bhp from a wild electrified V6 powertrain that fuses technology from the firm’s Le Mans-winning 499P with that of its Formula 1 racing cars. Named the F80, the new hypercar has been unveiled just weeks after McLaren revealed its own new halo model, the W1. The F80 reignites the two manufacturers’ long–standing rivalry and reboots two-thirds of the iconic ‘Holy Trinity’ of hypercars from the early 2010s. The new hypercar is priced from £3 million and limited to just 799 examples (all sold), and it follows in the footsteps of the F40, F50, Enzo and LaFerrari in rewriting the rulebook for a road-going Ferrari, while also being fitted with a host of tech that makes it a “new benchmark for innovation”. Powertrain At the heart of the F80’s powertrain is a new version of Ferrari’s 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6. The engine can rev to 9200rpm and has been completely overhauled compared with the unit that powers the 296 GTB. Parts from the 499P Le Mans car have been added to give it 888bhp in its own right, making it the most powerful engine Maranello has yet produced but no heavier than the 296’s engine. Working in conjunction with the V6 engine are three electric motors: two on the front axle and one on the rear. Produced in-house (a first for Maranello), the front motors make 140bhp apiece, while the rear motor takes the form of an ‘MGU-K’ energy recovery unit. The latter is similar in design to that found in the brand’s F1 cars and can recover as much as 94bhp through braking to automatically fill power gaps. For the first time in a Ferrari, the F80 features ‘E-turbos’. Connected to an F1-derived ‘MGU-H’ heat recovery device, they have electric motors between the turbine and compressor to reduce lag and enhance throttle response. All in, the powertrain sends a combined 1184bhp to all four wheels for a claimed 0-62mph in 2.15sec and 0-124mph in just 5.75sec. This trumps both the McLaren W1 and the Mercedes-AMG One. Different modes offer varying power levels, with Hybrid, Performance and Qualify selectable via the eManettino switch on the steering wheel. There is no pure-electric mode, as on the 296, because the F80 is not a plug-in hybrid: its 2.3kWh battery serves to boost power and allows low-speed, short-distance engine-off running. While the default Hybrid mode optimises the powertrain for efficiency, Performance and Qualify modes give access to the F80’s Boost Optimisation function, which records the track during a sighting lap and then delivers power boosts when needed on the next pass – on straights or uphill sections, for example. Aerodynamics The F80 draws on the aerodynamic expertise of Ferrari’s top-class motorsport teams to maximise downforce. As Ferrari’s chief product development boss, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, explained, the underbody of the new F80 is heavily inspired by the firm’s F1 car, with large barge boards used to channel air underneath the car. Up front, the aggressively styled nose is dominated by a huge ‘S-Duct’, which takes inspiration from the 499P and moves air over the cabin and towards the rear. The black fascia across the nose, which is of a similar vein to that of the new 12Cilindri, features a small lip at the top edge to channel air over the top of the cabin to the rear wing. Endowing the radical F80 with greater visual presence is the active rear wing, which adjusts not only its height but also its angle to optimise downforce and minimise drag. With help from a huge rear diffuser, the rear of the car is able to create up to 590kg of downforce. All in, the new F80 generates up to 1000kg of downforce at 155mph (250kph), which puts it on par with the McLaren W1; Ferrari says the front end alone can generate up to 460kg of downforce. In comparison, an F1 car generates some 1200kg at the same speed. Chassis At 4840mm long, 2060mm wide and 1130mm tall, the F80 is marginally bigger than the W1, and it is 125kg heavier at 1525kg (dry). However, the mix of lightweight, race-honed materials (carbonfibre, titanium and aluminium) used in its construction make it 60kg lighter than its LaFerrari predecessor. The F80’s chassis is also 50% stiffer than its forebear’s. The cell and roof are made from carbonfibre, with the front and rear subframes made from aluminium. Ferrari has also used the front subframe for heat management purposes, with the hollow structure used as cooling ducts for the brakes. Crucial to the F80’s set-up is the active suspension, which is powered by four 48V actuators. 3D printing is used to create parts of the double-wishbone set-up employed by the F80. “We developed the system with Multimatic because it helped us with the active suspension on the Purosangue,” said Fulgenzi. “In the F80, the system is totally new. The centre of gravity is naturally lower, with most of the car’s weight in the centre of the car. “Also with the aerodynamics, we need to keep the car stable and balanced through corners, and the active suspension is the perfect system to ensure this.” Design Draped over the lightweight carbonfibre chassis is a design that is “absolutely new” and avoids “anything nostalgic”, according to designer Flavio Manzoni, who cited spaceships and sci-fi as the inspiration for the car’s outlandish look. The influence of icons from past Ferrari is evident, with the pronounced front wheel arches nodding to the F40 and Enzo, while the rear styling echoes that of the classic 330 P3. Early discussions about making the F80 a single-seater did not come to fruition, but the cabin has been designed primarily for the driver with what Ferrari calls a ‘1+’ configuration. This translates to an asymmetrical layout that gives the driver priority in the cabin, while relegating the passenger to a ‘seat’ that’s offset and carved into the chassis. The majority of the controls and functions on both the new ovoid steering wheel and slim centre console are physical, which Ferrari says are easy to use while driving. “A 0-62mph time of 2.15sec and 5.75sec to 124mph are only numbers, but when you experience this kind of driving, people want it more and more everyday,” said Fulgenzi. “That’s what we want to create: for owners to be addicted to driving the car and not just own it.”",

    "description": "The GT2 Stradale can sprint from 0-62mph in a time of 2.8sec Road-going GT2-inspired track car shaves 60kg, is boosted to 632bhp and gains prominent aero kit Maserati's track-ready, GT2-inspired version of its MC20 supercar has gone on sale in the UK, eclipsing rivals with a £338,880 price tag and making it the first most expensive ever model. Compared with the regular MC20, the Maserati GT2 Stradale is 60kg lighter, it gets an extra 11bhp from its twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 and it is fitted with a prominent aero kit. This leaves the rear-wheel-drive coupé weighing 1365kg and producing 632bhp at 7500rpm, giving it a 2.8sec 0-62mph time – on par with the more powerful but slightly heavier 740bhp McLaren 750S and faster than the 819bhp plug-in hybrid Ferrari 296 GTB. It also pushes beyond those rivals – and the standard MC20 – in terms of cost by some £100,000 before options, putting it on par with the likes of the 819bhp Ferrari 12Cilindri and 824bhp Aston Martin Vanquish. Elsewhere, the GT2 Stradale adopts the same sophisticated suspension set-up and steering-rack tuning as the GT2 in an effort to enhance its handling.  It also uses the same braking set-up, including ventilated discs, callipers and pads and a slightly track-biased anti-lock system. The additions of a new front diffuser and the GT2’s large rear wing boost downforce to a maximum of 500kg, prompting Maserati to say the GT2 Stradale “promises unparalleled sensations and superior performance”. A new Corsa Evo driving mode also features. Only available with the optional performance packs (which also add Michelin semi-slick tyres, an electronic limited-slip differential, four-point seatbelts and more), it works as an advanced traction control system, with four levels. Maserati boss Davide Grasso has previously told Autocar how special editions like this are crucial to the firm's goal of achieving \"benchmark margins in the industry\". That has become especially pertinent now, as the firm seeks to recover from a recorded €82 million (£69m) adjusted operating loss in 2023. Deliveries of the new GT2 Stradale being in April next year.",

    "description": "The best custom motorcycles aren’t always the ones that scream the loudest. Some captivate with simplicity, inviting a closer look that reveals a visually enticing, perfectly proportioned, and tastefully upgraded machine. Mastering all of these elements takes years. This frosty BMW R80 scrambler ticks all of those boxes. Remarkably, it’s Tomas Janicek’s first custom motorcycle—but it took him a decade to create, giving him time to hone every detail. “I’ve always been more of a car guy, and was never really interested in motorcycles,” Tomas tells us. “But back in 2014, while studying at the Art Academy in the Netherlands, I felt a strong urge to create something with my hands.” “Since I couldn’t find a car shop that excited me, I decided to take a chance.…",

    "description": "Long relegated to youth and playbike riders, the heyday for electric dirt bikes has somewhat lagged behind the catapulting popularity of other e-bike segments; I guess many of us just aren’t ready to give up our clutch levers. Expect that to change in coming years though, as today’s electric bikes are coming closer to meeting and exceeding their internal combustion counterparts. The KTM Freeride E platform has proven to be a serious contender year after year, and the 2025 model is hot off the press, offering increased power and range, a 60 mph top speed and street-legal status. It also happens to be endorsed by one of the biggest names in hard enduro. Convinced yet? If you’re reading this, we’ll assume you’re somewhat familiar with the Freeride E platform, ranked among our favorite electric offerings for 2024.…",

Especially if you’ve never driven, or navigated, on its epic route that spans over 8,500 miles – which crosses some of the world’s toughest terrain... Katarina Kyvalova is no ordinary racing driver.  It was fitting that someone who made their racing debut in a 24-hour event in a pre-war Bentley should get her first taste of the Prodrive Peking to Paris in a wild, first-of-its-kind restomod from British racing and rallying legends Prodrive, based – of all things – on a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback donor car. A regular in historic motorsports, usually seen racing a 4.5-liter Bentley, a Cooper Jaguar or a Jaguar E-Type, Katarina took a huge leap out of her comfort zone by signing up for one of the most gruelling and prestigious endurance rallies in the world before the global health pandemic of 2020. She finally got to compete in the 2024 edition of this quite unique event, that was first held way back in 1907. Continue...",

    "description": "The successor to the Ferrari LaFerrari hypercar has been revealed. Called the Ferrari F80, it is the Italian marque’s most powerful road car to date with a 1,200hp hybrid V6 powertrain that combines technology from the company’s Le Mans-winning 499P, along with that of its Formula 1 cars. Interestingly, Ferrari has taken the wraps off its new hypercar just weeks after McLaren revealed the W1. The F80 is priced from GBP 3 million (about Rs 33 lakh) and will have a limited run of just 799 units, all of which have already been sold.  Ferrari F80 powered by 900hp V6 and three electric motors Claimed 0-100kph and 0-200kph times quicker than McLaren W1 Aero generates up to 1,000kg of downforce at 250kph Ferrari F80: powertrain The F80 gets a new version of Ferrari’s 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine.  It can rev to 9,200rpm and has been completely overhauled when compared to the unit that powers the 296 GTB. Parts from the 499P Le Mans car have been added to make it produce 900hp, making it the most powerful engine Maranello has yet produced. Ferrari claims the unit is no heavier than the 296’s engine. Working in combination with the V6 engine are three electric motors, two on the front axle and one on the rear. That these motors are made in-house is a first for Ferrari. The front motors make 142hp each, while the rear motor takes the form of an ‘MGU-K’ energy recovery unit. The latter is similar in design to what’s seen in Ferrari’s F1 cars and can recover as much as 95hp through braking to automatically fill power gaps. Another first for the F80 is that it is the first Ferrari to feature ‘E-turbos’, which uses F1 derived tech to to reduce lag and enhance throttle response.  Together, the hybrid system sends 1,200hp to all four wheels. The company claims 0-100kph and 0-200kph times of 2.15 seconds and 5.75 seconds, respectively, which makes the F80 quicker than the McLaren W1 and the Mercedes-AMG One. While different modes – Hybrid, Performance and Qualify – that are selectable via a switch on the steering wheel offer differing levels of power, there is no pure-electric mode. Like the 296, the F80 is not a plug-in hybrid and its 2.3kWh battery is used to boost power, run the car for short durations in low-speed settings. The Performance and Qualify modes provide access to a Boost Optimisation function, which records the track during a sighting lap and then delivers power boosts when needed on the next round.  Ferrari F80: aerodynamics Ferrari’s chief product development boss, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, explained to our sister publication  Autocar UK that the underbody of the new F80 is heavily inspired by the brand’s F1 car, with large barge boards used to channel air below. At the front, the aggressively styled nose is dominated by a huge ‘S-Duct’, which takes inspiration from the 499P and moves air over the cabin and towards the rear. The black fascia across the nose, which is similar to that of the new 12Cilindri, features a small lip at the top edge to channel air over the top of the cabin to the rear wing. The active rear wing adjusts not only its height, but also its angle to optimise downforce and minimise drag. With help from a huge rear diffuser, the rear of the car is able to create up to 590kg of downforce. In total, the F80 generates up to 1,000kg of downforce at 250kph, which puts it on par with the McLaren W1, and just short of an F1 car, which generates some 1,200kg at the same speed. Ferrari F80: chassis At 4,840mm long, 2,060mm wide and 1,130mm tall, the F80 is slightly larger than the W1. It is also 125kg heavier, weighing in at 1,525kg (dry). However, the mix of lightweight materials (carbon fibre, titanium and aluminium) used in its construction make it 60kg lighter than the LaFerrari and have a chassis that is 50 percent stiffer. The cell and roof are made from carbonfibre, with the front and rear subframes made from aluminium. Ferrari has also used the front subframe for heat management purposes, with the hollow structure used as cooling ducts for the brakes. The F80’s active suspension is powered by four 48V actuators. 3D printing is used to create parts of the double-wishbone setup.  Ferrari F80: interior, exterior design While the influence of Ferraris from the past is visible with nods to the F40, Enzo and classic 330 P3, designer Flavio Manzoni said that the design is “absolutely new” and avoids “anything nostalgic”. He cited spaceships and sci-fi as the inspiration for the car’s look. The cabin has an asymmetrical layout that gives the driver priority, though there were discussions about making the F80 a single-seater. Most controls and functions on the new ovoid steering wheel and the slim centre console are physical, which Ferrari says are easy to use while driving.
