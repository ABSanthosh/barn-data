    "description": "The Bajaj-made Triumph Scrambler 400 X has been around for a couple of years, and while its sibling – the Speed 400 range – has seen some updates as well as the addition of the new T4 model, there hasn’t been much for the Scrambler, until now. Bajaj’s solution to spice things up for 2025 is the new Scrambler XC. In the big Scrambler 1200, the XC moniker meant more off-road capability, but that isn’t the case here. The XC is very similiar to the X in most fundamental ways. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC design and features - 8/10  Excel cross-spoke wheels look cool, replace the 400 X's alloys. Instead, the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC gets a number of additional components, but none of it change the way it performs. The biggest upgrade, from both a visual and functional standpoint, would be the new cross-spoked wheels. Unlike the Akront wheels on the Himalayan 450, these are Excel rims, which is no bad thing considering that Excel is widely considered as one of the best in the business.  The 400 XC's tubeless cross-spoke wheels come from Excel. There is a significant change in the weight (it's up by five kilos to 190kg), which is because there are a number of other additions made to the bike. All of these are available as accessories on the Scrambler 400 X, which includes a colour-matched flyscreen, headlamp grille, a colour-matched tall front fender, a radiator guard, sump guard and lower engine crash guard. The collective effect is handsome and more purposeful looking, at least to my eyes. Weight and dimensionsKerb weight190kgGround clearance195mmSeat height 835mmFuel tank capacity13 litresWheelbase1418mm The lower engine guard is standard fitment on the 400 XC. Aside from these changes and a couple of unique colour schemes, the Scrambler 400 XC is pretty much the same when it comes to the riding experience. Theoretically, the lighter wheels should make some improvement in the agility, but it’s not a huge change; you’d have to ride both the X and XC back to back to tell if it’s really noticeable. The same goes for the extra 5kg the XC is carrying.  The 400 XC is the heaviest of all the Bajaj-made Triumph 400s. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC engine and performance - 8/10 Engine is smooth in the city but a little buzzy on the highway. As before, this bike’s liquid-cooled 40hp/37.5Nm 300cc engine feels smooth and punchy at lower revs, and a little buzzy post the triple-digit mark. Performance is strong and it’ll go past the indicated 160kph mark, but high-speed cruising isn’t what this bike is about. Short gearing means it’s smooth and tractable in the city but a little buzzy at fast highway speeds. Throttle response is smooth and predictable and the Scrambler is pleasant to ride within the city. Riding the Scrambler 400 XC is a pleasant affair in the city. EngineEngine399cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower40hp at 8,000rpmTorque37.5Nm at 6,500rpmGearbox6-speed This city-friendly character is boosted by its 835mm seat height, which isn’t great for short riders but provides a very nice view of the road ahead. It also gives the slim Scrambler more of a comprehensive feeling compared to the compact Speed 400, which is otherwise the same size body-wise. The higher seat and more forward-set footpeg holders also result in a more relaxed knee position than on the Speed 400, and comfort is definitely a strong point here. The Scrambler continues to cut a handsome silhouette. Triumph is giving you all of this for Rs 26,000 more than the standard Scrambler, which is great value when you consider that buying just the wheels alone will set you back by Rs 70,000 at a Triumph service centre. As for existing Scrambler owners, yes, you can equip your bike with these if you don’t mind the huge price, but unfortunately, Bajaj says that doing so will void the warranty. The cross-spoke wheels can be equipped on the 400 X for a hefty sum of Rs 70,000. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC price and verdict - 8/10 Scrambler 400 XC is good VFM, but some areas could still be improved. While the value here is without doubt, there are some other areas that could have improved. For starters, the suspension is decently good for normal riding, but feels a little harsh when you ask too much of it either off road or at high corner speeds. However, what we really missed are better tyres and brakes. The MRF tyres used here are average at best and this bike deserves better. The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life. PricePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 2.94 lakh The front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average. The reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the updated KTM 390 Adventure X is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability. Then again, the KTM can’t match the Triumph’s classy appeal and if you’ve been swayed by the Scrambler’s handsome looks and all-round competence, we’d say the XC is worth the extra money.

    "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.

    "description": "The R4 is back after a 30-year hiatus as a no-nonsense and practical electric crossover Renault’s daring decision to reinvent the famous 5 and bust one of car design’s fundamental rules – ‘never regurgitate your history’ – appears to have been a masterstroke. The new, all-electric Renault 5 oozes character inside and out, it handles smartly and it is ultra-competitive on cost. It’s now the clear leader in a congested class.The strategists at Renault’s HQ in Boulogne-Billancourt will be doubly delighted because they’ve had the chance to repeat the trick with another back-catalogue icon: the Renault 4, or simply 'R4'.You’ll know the source material. More than eight million 4s were sold between 1961 and 1994, with production in places ranging from Wexford in Ireland to Antananarivo in Madagascar where, brilliantly, the little French station wagon remains the taxi du jour.Where the original 5 was more about fun, the 4 was about practicality. It offered surprisingly good ride comfort on France’s war-torn country roads, as well as total utility. The need to maximise interior space is why the original 4 has a different wheelbase on each side; one of the semi-trailing arms on the rear suspension is mounted just ahead of the other, to prevent the mechanicals encroaching on cabin space. For the same reason, the gearbox is mounted directly ahead of the engine: no awkward transmission tunnel. The big boot opening also extends to the very base of the bumper.The reinvented 4 isn’t quite so extreme in its pursuit of utility, and doesn’t quite match the original’s 22cm or so of fairly unregulated suspension travel (neither, frankly, would we want it to). Nor, at £27k or more, does it quite have rock-bottom pricing. (If anything, the 4’s true modern counterpart is the Dacia Duster.) But it does recapture to a fair extent the philosophy of its progenitor and is meaningfully different from the new 5, with which it shares a platform and nearly everything else. Is it similarly lovable? Let’s find out.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/can-worlds-hottest-growth-market-supercharge-uk-automotive",
    "description": "A new trade deal has potentially unlocked India but barriers remain Facing a flat market in Europe, falling sales in China and a fragile situation in the US, UK car makers are looking hungrily at a huge market that is predicted by some to be on the cusp of explosive growth. India has always been a tough prospect, particularly for premium makers, because of extremely high tariff barriers for those wanting to export cars there. But an agreement reached between the UK government and India to reduce tariffs on ‘high-end’ cars from 100% to 10% suddenly brings the world’s most populous market into play. “There's a lot of wealth there, but the premium and luxury car market has been very suppressed,” Adrian Hallmark, CEO of Aston Martin, told the SMMT Summit in June. “A [tariff] reduction of that size for UK-based manufacturers is really quite significant. It would put all the luxury British brands in a position where we’re in almost the same price category as high-spec premium cars.” Last year India imported cars worth the equivalent of £55 million from the UK, with Indian-owned JLR accounting for the bulk of that. It sounds a lot but India didn’t even make the top 10 of countries the UK exported cars to last year. In fact, it accounted for less than 1% of the total. The trade deal, once signed, will improve that. The final deal will be subject to a quota, with a similar arrangement for cars exported from India to the UK. Exports will include the upcoming Suzuki e-Vitara and related Toyota Urban Cruiser small electric SUV. On paper, India is an extremely promising market. The country has the highest growth rate in the G20 countries and it is expected to remain above 6% over at least the next five years, according to UK government forecasts. The country recently became the fifth largest economy in the world, overtaking the UK, and is expected to grow to the third largest by 2028. Meanwhile, India-based Tata Motors forecasts that passenger car sales will rise to six million by 2030, up from 4.3 million in the last financial year ending March.  The country still has an incredibly low number of cars per capita at just 32 for every 1000 people in the country, according to Tata figures, compared with around 300 for China. Tata is sure where the growth will come from. “The key driver will be, of course, the high-consumption households,” Shailesh Chandra, managing director of Tata Motors passenger vehicles, told analysts at the company’s investor day in June. “You're going to see rich and super-rich – people who really buy the cars – grow two to three times in the next five to six years.” Tata-owned JLR already understands the luxury market in the country. On its own investor day in June, the UK-based company said it had sold all 12 of a £500,000 ‘Masara’ India-only special edition of the Range Rover, inspired by a blue rare sapphire from the Himalayas. “The first eight sold before we even showed the car at the Range Rover House,” said head of the Range Rover brand Martin Limpert. “We had customers lined up that said: ‘No matter how it looks, I want one.’” The Range Rover House is another targeted device to persuade India’s super-rich to join the owners’ club. It is built on the coastal resort of Alibaug and visitors can stay for a whole day for “a modern luxury experience at an exclusive luxury villa”, according to the website.  The dramatic drop in tariffs, once ratified, will unlock a broader market for UK luxury brands in India. Earlier in July, Bentley announced it would team up with parent Volkswagen Group’s official entity in India to create Bentley India, with three new dealers coming to three key cities. The company didn’t refer to tariffs but said the shake-up of its operations there represents “a new era of growth”. For the mass-market, however, the country remains a hard nut to crack for European car makers. For a start, Maruti-Suzuki has 40% of the passenger car market locked out, with almost 900,000 sold in the first six months of the year, according to figures posted by data aggregator bestsellingcarsblog.com. Behind the Indo-Japanese giant, local player Mahindra has made big strides to become the number-two maker, with 14% of the market this year, and Hyundai and Tata are close behind. Toyota and Kia are currently running at half their pace, at around 7% share apiece. Best of the rest is Skoda, at less than 2% of the market. Renault, meanwhile, has struggled to make a dent in almost 10 years of trying. Back in 2017, the brand was selling 132,000 vehicles with a goal of quarter of a million by 2022. In the first five months of this year, sales stood at just 16,031 of its three models sold there, a fall of 31%. “It’s a tough market,” said Bruno Vanel, head of product at Renault, during the reveal of the Boreal compact SUV for emerging markets (but not India).  India has been on pause for the brand. “For the last four years, we froze everything,” said Vanel.  India is now back in play for Renault after it bought partner Nissan out of its majority-owned Indian operations earlier this year, which include a plant in Chennai. Facelifted versions of the Triber SUV and smaller Kiger SUV will be available later in the summer. A new strategy plan will be unveiled next year, including a timeline of new models. “We've a big and flexible plant, a huge engineering centre. We’ve got connected services. We've got a very powerful tool in India,” said Vanel. Skoda is farther along the path to success after grinding away at the market for several years. The spark is the new Kylaq sub-4.0m small SUV, priced from the equivalent of just £7000, which is finding a ready customer base and boosting Skoda sales by 142% this year. The Czech brand leads the Volkswagen Group’s India push after several false starts and engineered the Kylaq from the group’s MQB A0-IN platform. A high proportion of locally sourced parts helps to keep the cost down for India’s very discerning but also incredibly value-conscious customer base. Big things might be predicted of the Indian car market, and while monthly records are being hit, wholesales (sales to dealers) were up only 1.3% in the first half. Unlocking the potential of India will need further hard slog.",

Ever since Yamaha pulled the wraps off the Ténéré 700, we’ve been waiting for them to create a bigger version of it… a Ténéré 900, if you will.

Walking the alleys of a motorcycle show recently, I’m pushing through what feels a bit homogenized. Sometimes it’s hard for the eye to make a connection to something new and fresh. After a few hours, I finally brake hard at a BMW custom. Surprised by what I’m looking at, my slow brain fires off a foolish thought: This must be the new BMW modern classic that I haven’t heard about yet (that no one is talking about).…",

    "description": "SUVs, big and small, are all the rage, but there’s another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year, and there’s record interest in the body style high up the price ladder, too. Kia’s Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnivalis sold out for the year, while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet, but it has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. As you’d imagine, there’s a lot to talk about.   MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 At 5.27 metres long, 2 metres wide and 1.8 metres tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire. The 3.2-metre-long wheelbase is huge in its own right and hints at the space inside. At 5.27 metres, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  In its basic shape, the M9 is boxy to allow maximum cabin space. It’s not a looker, but then again, MPVs are all about what they are like on the inside rather than visual appeal. The front end is home to slim daytime running lamps up top, main headlights lower down on the bumper and a large grille at the base, with generous use of chrome to add some flash. This being an EV means the bonnet lifts to reveal storage – a handy 55-litre frunk in the M9’s case. 19-inch wheels and a stylistic chrome finish at the window line help uplift the slab-like sides. At the back, if the size doesn’t do it, the lighting that drops down at the side will surely help identify an M9.    Under the bonnet is a 55-litre frunk. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. The MG M9’s 19-inch rims come wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What makes these tyres special is a viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm.  19-inch rims come wrapped in self-healing tyres.   MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened with a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin, but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin, and what gets you first are the middle-row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency: delivering a VIP experience for the boss seated at the back. M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right, and there’s a 16-way power adjust, too, to control everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and leg-rest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at maximum extension (made possible with the middle-row seat all the way back and the front passenger seat electrically slid forward). With the backrest at full recline and leg rest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating, too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good, too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk-in and is convenient enough as far as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable, and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold-down armrest for the third row. Also note that the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. What’s noteworthy is that front seat occupants have it nice, too. The seats are fully powered and also pack in heating, ventilation and massage functions. The driver environment does take some getting used to, partly because of the M9’s sheer size and partly because of the layout of the controls – the gear selector sits on the right stalk behind the steering, while the left stalk is for lights and wipers. Third row has space for three adults but no middle seat headrest. The M9’s dash is neatly done, but the flush finish to the climate control functions on the dash panel looks better than it is in practice.   MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those seated at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an on-board air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the cabin’s rear section and a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system. Plus, you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. The trouble is that the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also provided powered sun shades for middle-row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third-row windows, and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their faces at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. Up front, you also get dual-zone climate control and a single-pane sunroof. Taking pride of place on the dash is a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay and eSIM-based connected tech. The 7-inch digital dials, in comparison, look small and basic. What is nicely done is the digital mirror. It relays a feed from a rear camera and gives a crisp view of the world behind. Touchscreen measures 12.3 inches; it supports wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay. The MG M9 hasn’t been rated by Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP as yet, but it’s reassuring to know that the big MPV is a 5-star Euro NCAP car. As standard, the M9 gets seven airbags, ESC, all-around disc brakes, Isofix child seat mounts, a tyre pressure monitor and a 360-degree camera (the resolution is so-so). Camera- and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are included as well. Functions such as lane-departure assist worked well on the smooth and well-marked roads in Goa. Also part of the package is a driver attention system that monitors drowsiness and distractions like mobile use and even smoking!     MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Power delivery is strong and nicely measured out. The MG M9 has a front axle-mounted motor that puts out 245hp and 350Nm of torque. There are Normal, Eco and Sport drive modes also, but all that doesn’t transform this luxury cruiser into a rocket ship, and that’s a very good thing. All too often, all manner of EVs dump their power in one go for wild acceleration, just because an EV can. But not the M9. Make no mistake, though. It’s not slow; a sub-10-second 0 to 100kph time is what should be possible, and that’s quick enough. What’s nice, however, is that its power delivery is strong and nicely measured out, perfectly in sync with the vehicle’s character. Overtaking is, thus, easy, even in Eco mode; put your foot down and the M9 moves off smartly. Road, wind and suspension noises are very well-contained.  Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quietly. Road, wind and suspension noises are also well-contained, yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. The M9 has a certified WLTP range of 430km. Given the unreliable charging infrastructure on our highways, the M9 isn’t ideal for long cross-country trips. Delivering supreme comfort over intra-city commutes is the M9’s forte.   MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup, which means body movements are well-contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   It handles surprisingly well for its size and mass.  The MG M9 manages its bulk around corners fairly well; driven sensibly or even slightly quickly, body roll is well-contained, no doubt helped by the battery mass down below. The steering and brakes also have two drive settings – Normal and Sport, the latter of which firms up the steering and is generally nice to use. The Sport mode on the brakes, though, wasn’t to my liking, given that at lower speeds it comes off as grabby. Speaking of brakes, there are adjustable regen modes with three levels: L1 offers deceleration akin to a conventional ICE vehicle, while L2 and L3 provide stronger retardation; however, there is no single-pedal driving. MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The MG M9 is easy to drive for something so large, but let’s be honest, it’s not intended for the self-driven owner. It’s for the chauffeur-driven. And it’s this target clientele that will have much to like about the M9. Middle-row space and seat comfort are fantastic, refinement is really impressive, and MG has also packed in a whole lot of goodies. Ride comfort could have been better, but it’s not a dealbreaker.  The M9 delivers on the brief of a luxury MPV quite appropriately.  The promise, then, is for Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh ex-showroom). To help convince buyers to see the M9 as a vehicle worthy of the big bucks, MG will retail the MPV from its new, premium MG Select dealerships. The M9 might not be the first luxury vehicle that comes to mind for anyone shopping in this price bracket, but it sure deserves a look. It might just surprise you.  Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

    "description": "Aprilia has launched its SR 175 in India at a price of Rs 1.26 lakh. It replaces the earlier SR 160 in the brand’s portfolio. SR 175 gets new RS 457-inspired paint options Gets 14-inch wheels at both ends, shod with 120-section tyres New TFT display with Bluetooth connectivity added Aprilia SR 175 debuts a new engine: It borrows its TFT dash from the RS 457 and Tuono 457 We had earlier reported that the SR 175 has begun reaching dealership floors; however, its price wasn’t disclosed then. It is powered by a newly developed 174.7cc single-cylinder air-cooled engine with a 3-valve setup. According to dealer sources, the bump in displacement comes from a larger bore. This new motor produces 12.92hp at 7,200rpm and 14.14Nm at 6,000rpm – an improvement over the SR 160’s output of 11.27hp and 13.44Nm. Another key update on the SR 175 is the addition of a colour TFT display, which appears similar to the unit seen on the RS 457 and Tuono 457. However, the interface and animations are noticeably different, and dealer sources suggest that the SR 175’s screen offers multiple layout options. Like the 457s, the display features Bluetooth connectivity, allowing smartphone pairing via the Aprilia app for call alerts, notifications and music control. Mechanically, components like the frame, suspension, brakes and tyres appear unchanged from the SR 160. The scooter runs on 14-inch wheels at both ends, fitted with wide 120-section tyres. Braking duties are handled by a front disc with single-channel ABS, paired with a rear drum brake. Visually, the new Aprilia SR 175 is identical to the SR 160. However, its colour options appear to take inspiration from the RS 457. Shades like white with red and purple with red, both closely resembling the RS’s paint schemes.  Priced at Rs 1.26 lakh, this Aprilia competes with the likes of the Yamaha Aerox 155 and Hero Xoom 160.

    "description": "Ola Electric has reported higher revenue but deeper losses in the April-June quarter (Q1) of FY2026, as the EV maker battles slowing sales, rising competition and delays in its battery plant expansion. The company is now betting on rare-earth-free motors, cost optimisation and new products to revive growth amid shifting market dynamics. Ola Electric Q1 FY2026 revenue rose to Rs 828 crore Rare-earth-free motors to roll out from festive season onwards Cell plant scaled back; FY2026 outlook stays flat Ola Electric Q1 FY26: Revenue rises but losses widen Company to introduce rare-earth-free motors Ola Electric reported a 35 percent rise in revenue to Rs 828 crore in Q1 FY2026, but its net loss widened to Rs 428 crore. Total income stood at Rs 896 crore, while continued high operating costs and lower-than-expected sales led to negative cash flow of Rs 143 crore. The company’s EV business continues to drive the bulk of its revenue, with the automotive segment generating Rs 826 crore. The newer cell manufacturing vertical contributed Rs 3 crore in revenue.   Ola’s earnings per share dropped slightly, while its market share continues to slip. After accounting for over 34 percent of India’s electric two-wheeler market in FY2024, Ola’s share dropped to 29.9 percent in FY2025 and further in Q1 FY2026, as it slipped to third place behind TVS and Bajaj. The company sold over 68,000 vehicles in the quarter, nearly half of its volume from a year earlier. To counter growing competition and supply chain uncertainty, Ola says it will roll out rare-earth-free motors in its electric scooters starting from Q3 of this fiscal. The move comes amid China’s tighter restrictions on exports of rare-earth magnets, which are widely used in EV powertrains.  Meanwhile, the company has sharply scaled down its ambitious battery manufacturing targets. It now plans to limit its cell plant capacity to 5GWh till FY2029, down from the earlier 20GWh target by FY2026. This puts Ola at risk of a Rs 100 crore penalty under the government’s PLI scheme, although the company has begun manufacturing its own 4680-format cells, which will begin replacing supplier-sourced cells from this quarter.
