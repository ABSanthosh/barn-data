    "description": "The RV BlazeX is Revolt’s latest electric commuter, positioned as an alternative to 125cc motorcycles. Sitting between the RV 400 BRZ and RV 400 models, the RV BlazeX emphasizes practicality and daily usability. However, our test was confined to a go-kart track, limiting our overall riding experience. Revolt RV BlazeX design and features Sporting a minimalist aesthetic, the RV BlazeX adopts design elements from the RV1 and RV1+. Unlike the RV 400 and RV 400 BRZ, this model follows a traditional commuter style, featuring a round LED headlamp, LED indicators, and a long single-piece seat. While fit and finish are adequate for the segment, the wiring around the handlebar and the charging socket cover could benefit from better quality materials. The charging cover, in particular, feels flimsy and might not withstand much force. The switchgear quality also seems budget-oriented, with buttons feeling soft and less tactile. A new kill switch is now present, but the absence of a traditional start button may require new riders to be extra cautious when getting on the bike because it is ready to go when you turn the key on. While the overall design mirrors Revolt's lower-tier models, the most noticeable addition is the 6-inch LCD display. This unit allows riders to switch between three modes (Eco, City, and Sport), offers Bluetooth connectivity, and supports app-based features like geo-fencing and over-the-air updates. Two buttons beside the screen enable toggling through trip meters, but they require a firm press, making operation less seamless. Our test unit came with an accessory windscreen, wheel stickering, and a crash guard. While the pricing for these extras was not disclosed, Revolt states that more accessories are available in addition to these three. Revolt RV BlazeX charging and practicality Reinforcing its commuter focus, the RV BlazeX offers a well-cushioned seat and an accessible 790mm seat height. Revolt has also upgraded the suspension to support a higher payload of 250kg. Additional storage is available under the tank, which also acts as a cover for the removable battery. Riders have the flexibility to remove and charge the battery at home. However, the 3.24kWh battery weighs 20kg, which could be cumbersome for those living in buildings without an elevator. The standard charger replenishes the battery from 0-80% in 3 hours and 30 minutes, while an optional fast charger reduces this time to 1 hour and 20 minutes. If purchased separately, the fast charger costs Rs 14,500, but buying it with the bike allows for a trade-in against the standard charger, reducing the price to Rs 4,500. Revolt RV BlazeX performance and handling The RV BlazeX is powered by a new electric motor, delivering a peak output of 4.1kW and 45Nm (at the motor) and 180Nm (at the wheel). Revolt claims a top speed of 85kph, matching its flagship model. While these figures may seem modest, the BlazeX provides a surprising level of punch, especially in Sport mode, making it engaging on the tight go-kart track. However, the throttle response is inconsistent, sometimes feeling imprecise or sluggish. This raises concerns about real-world traffic performance, where smooth throttle control is essential. The suspension setup includes a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers. Though the track had minimal bumps, the few encountered were absorbed well, ensuring a comfortable ride. The softer suspension setup makes it better suited for city roads rather than track use. Braking performance is strong, with 240mm disc brakes at both ends working effectively, assisted by the CBS (Combined Braking System) for added stability. Revolt RV BlazeX verdict The Revolt RV BlazeX blends  performance, range, and modern features at a competitive price. Its commuter-friendly design and smart connectivity features make it an attractive choice for those transitioning to electric mobility.  However, certain aspects, such as the finish quality and throttle calibration, leave room for refinement in an otherwise practical package.

    "description": "The GP Tech V4 suit serves as a replacement for my Missile Ignition suit, which has served me very well for the past five years. The GP Tech V4 costs about half of what you’d pay for the top Racing Absolute suit used by the top racers, but it incorporates many of the learnings and top-tier materials that you will find there. The biggest improvement for me is the overall fit and comfort. The first time I wore this suit, I was in it from 8am to 4pm, with much of that time being spent hanging around the pit area. Normally, that would have been a rather uncomfortable experience, but the GP Tech was surprisingly pleasant. Much of this goes to all the work Alpinestars has put into incorporating stretch panels in strategic spots, but it’s also down to the materials. This suit uses kangaroo leather in certain panels on the chest, arms and legs, and this material has the benefit of being lighter than the usual bovine leather. I was surprised to see that the armour used is CE Level 1, but the reasoning is that it resides behind tough, hard shell protectors on the shoulders, elbows and knees, which amps up the safety but keeps weight and bulk down. The GP Tech V4 uses kangaroo leather in select areas. From a fit standpoint, the GP Tech V4 is superb once you squeeze into it, and the only thing that caught my attention was that it felt a bit tight behind the knees. However, this was only a problem when standing and not on the bike. My sole gripe is that the leather around the chest area bunches up slightly at the seams, which causes no functional issues, but it doesn’t look great. There are some innovative materials in use here, including Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. This helps reduce the heat buildup when leather drags on the tarmac at high speed, which can burn the skin. Then, there’s the MATRYX® material, which uses a combination of Kevlar and polyamide yarn and promises high levels of abrasion resistance as well as excellent breathability. The suit uses Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. Breathability is excellent, and there are even little intake ducts built into the hard armour on the shoulder and knees. One thing worth noting is that this suit is airbag-compatible but only with the newer systems. Older Astars airbag vests that need to be zipped into the suit don’t seem to be compatible with this one. Vents are built into the hard armour for better airflow. At around 2,000 dollars, the price for the GP Tech V4 hasn’t changed compared to its predecessor. You can get much more affordable suits for sure, even from Alpinestars, but if you’re a racetrack regular looking for the next step in comfort and protection, you’ll love the GP Tech V4.

    "description": "Traversing Mumbai’s congested streets is already harrowing enough, especially during rush hour. And in the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé, this experience is amplified manifold. Picture being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, with other vehicles precariously close to your oversized luxury SUV that costs more than some apartments.On several occasions, my heart raced as the SUV’s 360-degree camera system lit up, triggered by reckless bikers attempting to squeeze through non-existent gaps. I was on my way to meet my brother-in-law, but I had an ulterior motive. When he moved to Dubai in 2022, I suggested he purchase a GLE Coupé – not the AMG variant but the standard turbo-petrol version. It fit his budget and would have complemented Dubai’s opulent lifestyle. He didn’t heed my advice. Now, driving the 2025 AMG GLE through Mumbai’s Western suburbs, I was determined to prove a point. Feels huge when navigating through congested streets. The GLE’s substantial size, especially its 2.1-metre width, is particularly noticeable in city driving. Despite setting the GLE in Comfort mode (as it lacks an ‘Eco’ setting), the onboard computer never showed fuel efficiency exceeding 5kpl in traffic – unsurprising for an AMG-fettled 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine in a full-size SUV. The ride quality is also less than ideal. Even in Comfort mode, the suspension crashes through potholes, followed by a floaty, vertical movement that tosses passengers around. The front seats are comfortable, but their ventilation is ineffective, and at this price point, the absence of a massage function is disappointing. Moreover, the touch-sensitive steering controls are overly sensitive, often registering unintended inputs. Also, like in most Mercedes models, one must switch off the overly sensitive autonomous braking feature at the start of every journey. Besides sounding sweet, this 6-cyl unit is a strong performer. On the upside, the GLE’s touchscreen interface is one of the best in the business, and the sound quality from the Burmester audio system is equally impressive. Additionally, Mercedes’ integrated starter-generator delivers a seamless and non-intrusive auto stop/start function, making it easier to leave this feature enabled for fuel-saving while idling. After two hours and 20 kilometres, I finally arrived at my destination, relieved to have avoided any scratches on the vehicle. However, it’s worth noting a significant flaw – many modern Mercedes models, including this one, have a noticeable orange peel effect on their paint, giving the body panels an unfinished look that’s unacceptable at this price. When my brother-in-law saw the GLE, he was visibly impressed. The bold LEDs, imposing Panamericana grille and sleek, sloping roofline left him awestruck. The luxurious beige cabin, complemented by wood inlays, silver trims and dramatic ambient lighting, further elevated the experience. While I admired the impeccable fit and finish, I would have preferred a sportier interior with red seatbelts to enhance its AMG character. Also, though the rear seats are spacious, their cushioning is firm, and the upright backrest detracts from comfort. However, the AMG GLE’s highlight is its six-cylinder engine and exhaust note. With the exhaust flaps open, a few solid revs produced a thunderous roar and crackles that disrupted the serene neighbourhood. “I should have listened to you,” my brother-in-law admitted, promptly whipping out his phone to browse websites scouting for used examples in Dubai. Mission accomplished. Firm cushioning, upright backrest angle far from comfy. The following day, we drove the GLE to a popular eatery in Karjat. Traffic on the Western Express Highway was predictably slow, so I opted for the longer but less congested route via the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Coastal Road and AtalSetu before joining the old Mumbai-Pune highway. I’m really glad Mercedes didn’t downsize this six-cylinder turbo-petrol unit. The engine’s performance reserves make highway cruising effortless. It gets to three-digit speeds almost too quickly, and before you know it, you’re well past the speed limit. With the drive mode set to Sport, even the gearbox feels sharper and a touch quicker. The nine-speed automatic performed brilliantly, too, and I never found the need to use the paddle shifters to take manual control. Switching the suspension to Sport mode revealed a firmer yet more composed ride, with the car feeling flat and stable at higher speeds. The steering is sharp, and when driven with verve, the GLE feels surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable for its size. However, its bulk becomes evident during hard braking, with a noticeable nose-dive and a significant weight transfer. Ground clearance in its standard setting is plenty, but the GLE takes it a step ahead with a suspension-lift function to increase ride height further. Honestly, I don’t think this feature is needed for the typical on-road application the GLE AMG will be subjected to. Its bright interiors with wood and aluminium inserts feel luxurious. In conclusion, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé commands attention with its road presence, offers strong performance paired with an exhilarating exhaust note and is a pleasure to drive on open roads. However, its ride quality and rear-seat comfort could have been better, and certain features should have been added to justify its Rs 1.88 crore price tag.

    "description": "The V12 is dying: we’ve heard this year upon year for the last decade or so. And along comes a new high-strung V12 sports car from some exotic brand, and we rejoice, showering said brand with accolades and gratitude for being so brave in this ever-changing world. Yet, Rolls-Royce has exclusively been using this engine configuration for decades. In fact, three of the four models it currently sells are powered by a V12 – a mammoth twin-turbocharged 6.75-litre unit, no less – and in many ways, its most extravagant application is the Cullinan Black Badge. Yes, every Rolls-Royce is excessive, even a bit ostentatious, but the Cullinan somehow takes it a step further. It’s an SUV, for one, which in itself makes it the more conspicuous choice, and then there’s the Black Badge treatment. We’ll get to the engine’s extra exuberance later on, and the price that’ll set you back an additional Rs 1.6 crore, but the Black Badge also adds a certain menace to the SUV’s look that suits it oh so well. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II exterior design Dark chrome trim and optional 23-inch wheels The Black Badge looks a touch more menacing than the standard Cullinan. Rolls’ hallmark surfeit of chrome is replaced with dark chrome, and that includes the window surrounds, door handles, number plate garnish, exhaust surrounds, and most notably the pantheon grille and Spirit of Ecstasy emblem. The headlamp and tail-lamp internals are darkened as well and, yes, the badges themselves are black. You can now option 23-inch wheels on the Cullinan, a size that certainly doesn’t look out of place on this ‘high-sided vehicle’, as Rolls calls it, but here too, the Black Badge offers a more aggressive, two-tone design that bares the brake calipers for all to see. Colour customisation is near endless The facelift, to these eyes at least, injects some much-needed character into the imposing but uninteresting face of the original Cullinan, in the form of slimmer headlamps with vertical LED running lights that drop down into the bumper, which itself has fewer openings for a much cleaner look. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that, for a sum, Rolls-Royce will let you pick virtually any colour on the visible spectrum to paint your Cullinan with, with the possibility of further enhancement by way of crystal finish and hand-painted coach lines. But it encourages you to go bold, with bright colours that offset all that black well. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II interior and features Dashboard trim is limited to either piano black or dark metallic. It’s a similar story inside, where you could choose an uninspired all-black cabin, but you’re nudged towards yellows, blues and purples, which are in sharp contrast to the piano black or dark metallic dashboard trim – your only options in a Black Badge. Quality? Near faultless, of course; from the uniformity of the stitches to the flawlessness of the hide, to the micron-perfect fit of the trim pieces; the craftspeople really earn their commission. Mirroring its exterior, the Cullinan has a taller, bolder dashboard fascia than the rest of the model range, but the layout is familiar, and the Series II facelift has brought with it a wider array of personalisation options. Vast space, big windows, soft cushions; individual reclining seats also available. One option you won’t see in these pictures, but which we wholly recommend, is the ‘Sanctuary’ rear seat. This gets you two individual chairs – powered, heated, ventilated and massaging – as well as a drinks fridge and a glass separator for the luggage compartment. Either way, though, space is more than you’ve ever seen in an SUV, thanks to a limo-like 3.3-metre wheelbase, with a tall, stately seating position from which to survey your empire. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II engine and performance 600hp and 900Nm Remarkably easy to manoeuvre for something so large; great visibility helps. Now, back to the V12, which sits resolutely under that long bonnet, heralded by the lady atop the grille. The car may have been updated, but the engine remains largely the same, and while it ordinarily – if you can use such a word in a Rolls – deploys 571hp and 850Nm, in the Black Badge, that’s upped to 600hp and 900Nm. 'Low' mode sharpens throttle response These swollen outputs aren’t easy to perceive in everyday driving, but press the ‘Low’ button on the gear stalk, and you’ll notice a greater eagerness from the powertrain. A subdued burble pushes through several hundred kilograms of sound insulation into the cabin; enough to signal potency without being uncouth. Surprisingly easy to drive Mass management has always been part of Rolls’ dynamic remit. Once you’re done flexing, however, un-pressing the Low button reverts the Cullinan to the Rolls-Royce default spec, and really, this is what you’re actually paying for. The burble is now a whisper, the steering lightens up, the suspension relaxes, and the demeanour simmers from Hulk to Bruce Banner. It’s at this point you notice it’s not as intimidating to drive as a 5.3-metre SUV might seem, thanks to high seating, great visibility, rear-axle steering and easy-to-spot square edges. Composed around corners even at high speeds Every Rolls is unapologetically heavy, and the suspension is engineered requisitely robust to compensate. The 2.9-tonne Cullinan, however, has the added complication of a high centre of gravity, which it manages with aplomb. No, it isn’t a Porsche Cayenne around a bend, but its ability to deliver composure and comfort, whether at single or three-digit speeds, on any surface imaginable, has to be felt to be believed. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II price and verdict The Black Badge commands a Rs 1.59 crore premium over the regular Cullinan. Where every other Rolls-Royce is named after something ethereal – Ghost, Spectre, Phantom – the Cullinan is named after the world’s largest gem diamond. Big, bold, valuable and indestructible, it’s a name that fits. For an established, traditional brand to go down the SUV route to boost sales might irk the cynical amongst you. The simple fact is that it’s good business, and the Cullinan is by far the highest-selling model in the range. It’s even responsible for dropping the average Rolls owner’s age from 56 to 43, and the Black Badge version, with its almost rebellious attitude, has no doubt played a part. Rs 11.92 crore before options The Series II updates are subtle but effective, widening the personalisation possibilities and bringing a hike in price to an eye-watering Rs 10.33 crore for the standard version and Rs 11.92 crore for the Black Badge! The same cynics from earlier might scoff again, but the truth is, inside, outside and under the skin, it’s the same as a Phantom, albeit with a different form factor. An arguably more contemporary and desirable one, and certainly a more practical one. Titanic road presence, effortless performance and peerless luxury truly make this the monarch of SUVs.

    "description": "If you’re a fan of the totally bonkers King of the Banners race series, the Motor Co. has a bike for you. The brand-new Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR is a race-bred bagger (sounds weird, right?) with an eye-watering price tag. Other highlights from this week include a Kawasaki Z2 restomod by AC Sanctuary, a Panhead-Shovelhead hybrid from China, and a custom Zero FX from the USA. Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR When a governing body sets competition rules for motorcycle racing, road relevancy for manufacturers is a big deal. You see it in the World Superbike series, the World Endurance Championship, American Flat Track racing’s Hooligan Class, and the wily King of the Baggers series. The new Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR celebrates the Bar and Shield’s factory King of the Baggers race team in unapologetic style.…",

    "description": "Trends come and go, but tradition is everlasting, and you’d be surprised just how long scrambler motorcycles have been around. The term harkens back to the earliest days of motorcycle racing when competition was an A-to-B affair, and there were too few paved roads to limit competition to tarmac only—a scramble, as they’d come to be called. As such, racers crudely modified their machines to work on a mix of surfaces, adding more aggressive rubber, maximizing suspension travel and hiking up fenders to clear mud. The manufacturers eventually realized the marketability of a multi-purpose machine, and even after competition evolved, demand persisted for bikes that could (more or less) do it all. The popularity of the scrambler has ebbed and flowed through the years, but it’s safe to say demand is as strong as ever for these bikes.…",

    "description": "Designer Callum (left) and Riversimple boss Spowers cast a keen eye over every model Coventry Uni students competed to design a radical FCEV supercar that Riversimple will put into production by 2030 Pity the emerging generation of car designers. They grow up obsessed like the rest of us, but with the usual desire to drive and own cars overlaid by a burning need to create inspirational designs of their own. When these budding Giugiaros get to university, they put three or four years into learning how to create unique vehicles, yet many will graduate without ever working on a real, live project. For competitive reasons, car companies keep their plans secret, even from future employees. Which is one vital reason why a new cooperative project between Riversimple, the Wales-based builder of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell cars, and a 14-strong group of students at Coventry University’s Transport Design school – to propose a new production car – is so special. Riversimple, which already makes its unique Rasa lightweight urban two-seater for subscribers who will never own them, operates so far away from current motor industry norms that it doesn’t have formal competitors. Secrecy is less of a problem; publicity is oxygen. Soon, there’s going to be a brand-new Riversimple supercar, the flagship of a new generation of more mainstream hydrogen models from this progressive but idiosyncratic manufacturer. The mantra of its founder, former motorsport engineer and historic car restorer Hugo Spowers, is “to pursue, systematically, the elimination of the environmental impact of personal transport”, hence his concentration on hydrogen power, whose only by-product from driving is pure water. If things go right, the new Riversimple generation will be launched later this decade with a light, beautiful and ultra-low-volume supercar as its flagship. In a design competition set up by Spowers and the Coventry design school’s assistant professor, Aamer Mahmud, who is an accomplished former car designer, the university’s latest cohort of postgrad Transport Design students are taking the first steps to make this sophisticated and very special two-seat coupé a reality. For the students, this is a unique exercise: they’re creating a car that must conform with today’s laws on visibility, lighting and crash safety, with plausible cabin access and practical 17in wheel/tyre dimensions, not the huge hoops with ribbon-like rubber that adorn most design proposals. Spowers, who designed single-seat racing cars in his former career, strongly disapproves of the direction of current hypercar design, seeing it as an “arms race” driven by the mass and size of the huge engines or huge batteries needed to propel gargantuan cars with unfeasibly high performance. The resulting machines may be very fast, he says, but they’re “uncomfortable and unwieldy rather than fun”. Spowers envisages a Riversimple supercar similar in headline dimensions to Ferrari’s Dino 246 GT – which means around 4200mm long and about 1700mm wide. The new car’s wheelbase will be 2300mm, and its roof height will be a little lower than the Dino’s at 1100mm. Spowers’ supercar will have a mechanical layout like no other, with the powertrain distributed rather than being front- or rear-engined. It will be driven by four inboard electric motors (one per wheel). Electric power will come from a front-mounted hydrogen fuel cell and be stored in a rear-mounted 45kg array of supercapacitors (rather than a 500kg bank of heavyweight cells as used in a conventional battery-electric car). The hydrogen tank, enough for a 400-mile range, will be sited behind the seats. Because of the unique powertrain and the lightweight construction it allows, the car will weigh just 620kg at the kerb instead of the 1400-1800kg of a battery alternative, which is why Spowers has dubbed his new enterprise as ‘Project Chapman’, invoking the name of the legendary Lotus founder who loved lightness and compactness above all. The unique characteristics of fuel cell power give the car an extraordinary performance envelope – true supercar acceleration (0-100mph in just 6.4sec) but a top speed of just 100mph. “The top speed isn’t ‘capped’,” explains Spowers. “It’s simply what the car can achieve with the size of fuel cell we’ve chosen. We think it’s enough. \"To go faster, we could fit a bigger fuel cell, which would lead to a bigger fuel tank, a larger and heavier structure, bigger motors and brakes, more supercapacitors: a whole weight-gain cycle would begin and the dynamic attributes that really matter would be compromised. \"In the design we have, the fuel cell is sized for a constant 100mph top speed, but that’s all there is.” Spowers’ styling recipe is exacting. He wants his car to be modern and arrestingly beautiful in a timeless sense, avoiding the aggressive, “monsterish” look of current hypercars. Its sophistication needs to help justify a high cost, well into hundreds of thousands. It must be a low supercar rather than a fuller-bodied GT; he wants its “look” to advertise its efficiency and lightness. In October last year, Spowers laid down some design ‘hard points’ and Mahmud set the students to work. With these ‘customer requirements’ singing in their ears, they first set out to sketch their ideas freehand, developing them as CAD drawings and transferring that information to quarter-scale clay models, a task that even professional designers acknowledge as difficult. It’s one reason car makers’ design departments have specialist clay modellers.  The students were given eight weeks to take their designs from idea to presentation, in conjunction with other coursework. Just before Christmas, they presented their models to a judging panel consisting of Spowers and Mahmud plus Bentley head of interior design Darren Day (a Coventry alumnus), former Jaguar design chief Ian Callum and Riversimple consultant engineer Jim Router. The students presented their work in a big Coventry display studio. Screens behind each model showed initial sketches and CAD developments. In a procedure that seemed routine to Day and Callum but showed the rest of us the dispassionate assessments designers face in practice, each student was allowed just one minute to explain their design, whereupon the judges examined it and asked pertinent questions. The task was to select several finalists from 14 entries, then to choose a winner. Judging was brisk, to the point of ruthlessness. That’s how it goes in professional design life, apparently. Time was taken over those that impressed; clear non-winners were glossed over. This must have been an interesting lesson for the budding designers who weren’t given much time; an incentive to try harder next time. After all 14 were viewed, the students left the room while the judges selected finalists and a winner. The standard of work was generally agreed to be high, especially since this project was an addition to the students’ regular curriculum. Even for a pro, Callum and Day agreed, it can be a tough assignment to translate good-looking sketches to a clay sculpture about a metre long. Coventry regularly invites professional clay modellers in from nearby JLR to help teach its postgrad students but, despite it all, our professional designers often called for “more storytelling” in the designs. The functioning of a lightweight and efficient car with a revolutionary propulsion system should be described in its shape; and lines that work attractively at the front of a car should be echoed and resolved on the sides and rear. Spowers, especially, felt one common fault was the students’ tendency to propose shapes that were fuller, and “more GT-like” than he had in mind. And in some cases the best parts of the development sketches didn’t make it to the 3D model. According to Callum and Day, that’s a fault that plagues even the professionals. It’s a reason why car design takes care and time, and why all car designers must become used to listening carefully to the opinions of critics, both bosses and peers. In the event, we finished up with four commended students from which we selected one winner, Haoyuan Bai, already an intern of Nio in Shanghai, China, whose nicely proportioned design featuring eye-catching rear spats was the universal choice. Others commended were Zefan Shang and Yuyong Yin, also Chinese, and Bo Silkens from the Netherlands. Each of these was good enough to win, the judges felt, especially if they had made a better fist of the tough transition of turning attractive sketches into a 3D creation with the same visual appeal. The important thing was that the design professionals’ winner was also the choice of Riversimple managing director Spowers. He particularly felt winner Bai had produced a design of unique appeal, which had got the “volumes” right: it wasn’t too tall or full in its sections, like some of the others, and it qualified as a proper supercar.  Having put quite a lot of time and effort into it, Spowers pronounced the design competition “a thoroughly positive experience”, though he acknowledged, just as the students did, that these were very much first steps. He already builds functioning cars, knows how much more is involved in getting a new model on the road and is currently deciding what to do next. What this exercise proved, above all, is that if a special car is to succeed, its styling must not only be visually arresting and satisfying but also play a big part in describing the car’s capabilities and the intentions of its creators. And in this case, there is a particularly important story to be told. Haoyuan Bai Haoyuan Bai, 22, was attracted to car design when he first saw the 996-gen Porsche 911, and cites Pinky Lai (who led the car’s design) and Peter Schreyer (who transformed Kia into a ‘design’ brand) as his top influences. Bai, a Nio intern, did his first design degree in Shanghai. The judges rated his Riversimple design, notable for its rear spats and for different design alternatives on either side of his model, for its excellent, ideal proportions for a Riversimple supercar, and for his very classy sketches. Yuyong Yin Among the advantages of studying at Coventry for Yuyong Yin, 24, is the university’s long design tradition, not to mention its proximity to the “legendary” Aston Martin and JLR factories. A graduate in Environmental Design from China, he has already had internships at Geely and BYD, and says his ambition is “to design a car I could own forever”. The judges rated his design principally for its cohesiveness – the front and rear shapes were very well matched – and were especially impressed given that this was his first shot at clay modelling. Zefan Shang Twenty-two-year-old Zefan Shang loves reading sci-fi and especially appreciates the designs of BMW’s former design chief Chris Bangle. He did his first degree in Coventry, qualifying with first-class honours. When his postgrad study ends, he wants to be an exterior and concept designer, investigating “forward-looking” transport solutions for a big car manufacturer. His design has an eye-catching plane surrounding its front wheel arch that impressed the judges, several of whom noted that the car seemed more cab-forward in the model than the drawings, which were Zefan’s best work. Bo Silkens Bo Silkens is a 23-year-old exchange student from TU Delft in the Netherlands, where his famous countrymen Adrian van Hooydonk (BMW Group design chief) and Laurens van den Acker (head of design at the Renault Group) were educated. He came to Coventry to improve skills such as clay modelling and he describes the experience as “awesome”. The judges liked his design for its appropriate “volume” and for the way the side pods described the car, though they felt these could be further developed to enhance the story of the car’s purpose and its mechanicals.",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",

    "description": "Photos: Rosario Liberti Tuberculosis is a heck of a way to start an article about some ice racing history, and an even wilder way for a town to find its purpose, but here we are. Back in 1866, an Englishman named Arthur Edward Vansittart Strettell, while coughing his bloody lungs out, decided St. Moritz might just save his life. The pure alpine air (or luck) worked its magic, and he stuck around long enough for people to notice. Soon, more of Europe’s well-heeled started showing up,not just to breathe better, but to winter in style.   That might have been part of the beginning, but Johannes Badrutt, a Swiss hotelier, turned it into a destination. In 1864, he made a bold wager with his English summer guests: return in winter, and if you don’t love it, I’ll pay for your entire trip. They took the bet, expecting bitter cold and suffering. Instead, they found sunshine bouncing off snow-capped peaks, a winter unlike anything they had known. St. Moritz was no longer just a retreat, it is possibly the birthplace of luxury winter tourism. By the time it hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, St. Moritz was more than just ski chalets and cocktails. It was home to the Cresta Run, a skeleton track where men in tweed willingly hurled themselves face-first down a mile of ice. Horse racing? On ice. Polo? On ice. It was only a matter of time before we ended up with cars, on ice. If it could be done with risk and elegance, it happened at St. Moritz.  Fast forward to 2019, and The ICE St. Moritz started carrying that same spirit forward. But this time, instead of jockeys or sledders, it’s Ferrari 250 SWBs, Bugatti Type 35s, and Maserati 450Ss sliding across the frozen lake, their reflections blurry and fractal on the ice.  Part concours, part fever dream, spiked tires chew through ice while vintage race cars dance across a surface that was never meant for them. And then there’s the light, snow refracting golden-hour sunlight, exhaust vapor swirling in the cold. It’s a photographer’s paradise, a filmmaker’s storyboard, a dreamscape of speed and style. With a little history behind us, and that light in mind, we’re sharing a gallery of the finest photos from St. Moritz 2025. Enjoy the view.  Continue...",

    "description": "The 1967 Cadillac Eldorado was a styling revelation when it arrived, with front-wheel drive, covered headlamps, and sleek styling devoid of flim-flam. But the original look didn’t last long, as annual styling updates and regulatory changes made their marks immediately. While the 1968 was relatively the same as the ‘67 (with a larger engine), the 1969 version lost its covered headlamps, special ventilated wheel covers, received an ugly reversing lamp, and adopted the corporate dashboard used by the rest of the Cadillac lineup. And there were even more changes on the way for 1970 as the eighth generation prepared to fade away.",

    "description": "A prototype Mercedes EQS sedan is being tested with a solid-state battery that could deliver a range of more than 1,000km on a single charge. The first production car to use this new battery is scheduled to hit roads before the end of the decade. Preliminary trials are being conducted in the UK to evaluate the efficiency, durability and performance of the solid state pack, which Mercedes-Benz has co-developed with US-based Factorial Energy. Mercedes EQS prototype has been lightly modified New solid-state tech claimed to 25 percent increase in range Mercedes EQS sedan prototype with solid state battery details The battery housing has been reworked   The EQS sedan being used since early February to test the battery has been lightly modified to accommodate the new pack. Mercedes says work was mainly focused on reworking the battery housing. The solid state battery pack uses a floating cell carrier, which has pneumatic actuators developed by Mercedes-Benz’s Formula 1 engineers in Brixworth. This system manages the expansion and contraction of materials inside the battery cells during charging and discharging for improved stability and longevity. Range claimed to increase by 25 percent compared to Li-ion battery   While the company has yet to reveal the full specifications, it confirms that the EQS’s current 12-module battery compartment allows for flexible configurations and capacities. The brand also claims that the solid state tech offers around a 25 percent increase in range compared with a lithium-ion battery of equivalent size and weight. In fact, Mercedes-Benz expects its new solid-state unit to push the EQS prototype’s real-world range beyond 1,000km. For reference, the EQS 580 sedan on sale in India comes with a 107.8kWh lithium ion battery that has a WLTP range of 588km (857km on the Indian MIDC cycle). Factorial Energy had confirmed in June last year that the battery cells it had supplied Mercedes with battery cells featuring an energy density of up to 391Wh/kg and a charging capacity exceeding 106Ah. The pack also holds a patented lithium-metal anode and polymer separator. Mercedes solid state battery future   The technology being trialled in the EQS prototype marks an initial step towards a more advanced solid-state battery. Codenamed Solstice by Mercedes and Factorial, this next-generation unit replaces the polymer separator with a sulphide-based solid electrolyte. The target energy density is 450Wh/kg and an estimated 80 percent range increase over today’s lithium ion batteries. Together with the new battery technology, Mercedes is also developing a new-generation of silicon carbide inverters and power electronics. The AMG High Performance Powertrain division in Brixworth is developing them to bring higher power efficiency and improved performance to Mercedes’ future models.
