    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/rats-love-weekend-cruise-just-much-us-petrolheads",
    "description": "A recent lab test teaching rats to drive has us thinking For those who fear that general enthusiasm for driving is in decline, I have positive news: it’s actually so great that even rats enjoy it. Kelly Lambert, a professor of behavioural neuroscience at the University of Richmond in Virginia (who attaches far more academic and intellectual rigour to her research than I will to interpreting it – soz), found in 2019 that rats could learn to drive little cars to reach a treat (a Froot Loop, since you’re asking). Rats who were “housed in rich environments”, with toys and space and companions, more quickly learned to drive cars than those housed in regular cages. Having initially learned to drive forwards in simple cars made from plastic cereal containers by grasping a wire acting as an accelerator, the rats were put into more advanced cars and “before long they were steering with surprising precision to reach a Froot Loop treat”, Lambert wrote for the excellent news website The Conversation last week. Her research hasn’t stopped. When she walked into the lab during summer 2020, “the three driving-trained rats eagerly ran to the side of the cage, jumping up like my dog does when asked if he wants to take a walk”, she wrote. “Had the rats always done this and I just hadn’t noticed? Were they just eager for a Froot Loop, or anticipating the drive itself? Whatever the case, they appeared to be feeling something positive – perhaps excitement and anticipation.” I think I know this feeling when I return to long-stay parking at the airport. The study, I should say, wasn’t exactly about driving but about positive emotions in animals. In tests to measure rodent optimism, “preliminary results suggest that rats required to wait for rewards show signs of shifting from a pessimistic cognitive style to an optimistic one”. Such rats perform cognitive tasks better and solve problems more boldly. Lambert’s lab has linked this research with its studies into ‘behaviourceuticals’ – a term suggesting experiences can alter brain chemistry like drugs do. “Previous work with lab rats has shown that rats pressing a bar for cocaine – a stimulant that increases dopamine activation – already experience a surge of dopamine as they anticipate a dose of cocaine,” she explained. And if you think that lab rats are having all the fun, driving around for sweet treats and getting caned off their tits, maybe they deserve a break. “In a study that wouldn’t be permitted today, [neuroscientist Curt Richter] made rats swim in glass cylinders filled with water, eventually drowning from exhaustion if they weren’t rescued,” Lambert continued. “Lab rats frequently handled by humans swam for hours to days. Wild rats gave up after just a few minutes. If the wild rats were briefly rescued, however, their survival time extended dramatically, sometimes by days. It seemed that being rescued gave the rats hope and spurred them on.” Basically, positivity and sociability seems to propagate hope, which in turn is good for the brain. It’s possible that I might be overextending the lesson here, but it seems worth remembering by anyone who spends too many hours on X. Back to driving, though, and what rats think of the thrill of the open road. “While we can’t directly ask rats whether they like to drive, we devised a behavioural test to assess their motivation to drive,” Lambert reported. “This time, instead of only giving rats the option of driving to the Froot Loop Tree, they could also make a shorter journey on foot – or paw, in this case. \"Surprisingly, two of the three rats chose to take the less efficient path of turning away from the reward and running to the car to drive to their Froot Loop destination. \"This response suggests that the rats enjoy both the journey and the rewarding destination.” For every dismal journey in dawdling traffic, then, I shall try to remember to take a weekend jaunt to somewhere like Caffeine \u0026 Machine, which might be just the thing to rejuvenate the old noggin. “Rather than pushing buttons for instant rewards, [these rats] remind us that planning, anticipating and enjoying the ride may be key to a healthy brain,” concluded Lambert. “That’s a lesson my lab rats have taught me well.” Duly noted.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/nios-budget-ev-brand-firefly-launches-%C2%A316000-hatch-thats-bound-europe",
    "description": "Dubbed the “small smart, high end electric car”, it is positioned as a rival to the BYD Dolphin and Renault 5 Chinese car maker Nio has unveiled the first car from its new Europe-bound Firefly brand that will focus on small budget electric cars. Dubbed the “small smart, high end electric car”, the EV – currently only known as Firefly – is positioned as a rival to the BYD Dolphin and Renault 5 in the growing electric hatch segment. It will initially launch in the brand’s home market in April, with a European launch to follow soon after – although Nio has yet to officially confirm a date. Firefly could follow Nio’s Onvo L60 in being offered in the UK first because, unlike the EU, it doesn't apply import tariffs to Chinese-built EVs. Pricing in China starts from the equivalent of £16,000; while it will likely cost more in the UK and Europe, it could still be one of the cheapest EV's on the market. The car has been designed to stand out from rivals, said design director Kris Tomasson, with a “unique” tri-circular headlight and rear lamp design. “All good things come in threes,” said the American, formerly of BMW and Ford. Elsewhere, Firefly has, like rivals in the class, short overhangs and a slightly raked roofline to maximise range. Details on trim levels are still under wraps, but images show that the car offers a leatherette-clad interior (similar looking to the Smart #1) focussed around a central screen. Electrically adjustable seats will also be offered, images show. It also gets blind-spot cameras. Speaking about the design, Tomasson said: “We started with something that was simple yet iconic: a firefly. Firefly is small, electric and buzzing with energy and totally mesmerising. It became the foundation of our design DNA.” Elsewhere, Firefly has a huge split-level 92-litre frunk, one of the biggest offered by any car in any class; for comparison this is 5 litres more than Tesla offers in the Model 3. What’s more, it has a drainage function meaning, Nio chairman William Li jokingly proclaimed, fish can even be stored in it. Rear boot space has yet to be confirmed but can go up to 1250 litres with the rear seats folded. With seats up, expect it to be similar to the 5’s 277 litres. Further technical details, such as power, range and battery pack size have yet to be announced, but it is thought Firefly could feature swappable battery packs as Nio previously confirmed it was developing a new version of its battery swapping platform to be able to accept smaller batteries. But while that is a key feature of Nio models, the challenges of creating a network of swap stations has been a key reason for the brand's relatively slow rollout across Europe, and it is unknown if the technology will be as key to Firefly.  Nio did confirm the car has a 4.7m turning radius as a way of showcasing the car’s focus on agility and inner-city usability. Speaking at the annual Nio Day, Li said the Firefly brand “is a way for Nio to serve a wider audience” and bring new customers to the 10-year-old car maker. He envisioned the brand to “spark curiosity like fireflies”, adding: “You can see fireflies everywhere; we want to build the finest small cars for the global community.\"",

The Australian gear company’s catalog has grown steadily over the years, but one product has remained core to their brand—riding jeans that are both stylish and protective. Saint’s approach is to use high-tech fabrics with abrasion resistance baked in, producing single-layer garments rather than stacking regular denim over Kevlar. It makes their riding pants not only comfortable, but also stealthy enough to pass for casual wear. I’ve owned, worn, and ridden in several pairs of Saint motorcycle jeans, and they’ve all scored high. The new Saint Unbreakable Coretec jeans epitomize this approach. At $385 [US] or $549 [Australian], Saint’s new premium denim is their most expensive—but it’s also their most protective, achieving a AAA CE safety rating.…",

    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "Longer travel suspension, lower weight and more features – these three things were evident on spied test bikes ages ago, and they all promised that the new Bear 650 had the potential to be RE’s finest twin yet. Now that we’ve finally ridden the bike in India, we can confirm if that’s how things have panned out.  Royal Enfield Bear 650: Weight and dimensions   While it actually weighs just 2 kilos less than the Interceptor (216kg vs 218kg), the Bear feels more manageable as soon as you ride it out of the showroom. That’s thanks to the single exhaust pipe that hugs the motorcycle more closely than the wide dual pipes on the rest of the 650s, which need more careful management in heavy traffic. Beyond that, the Bear also manages to feel a little more agile and lighter on its feet.  Chassis-wise, it’s based on the Interceptor platform but with a strengthened headstock and a new rear subframe. Wheel sizes have gone from 18-inch at both ends to a 19/17 setup, and there’s now more suspension travel as well – climbing from 110mm/88mm to 130mm/115mm at the front and rear, respectively. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Ergonomics The riding position is not what I’d have expected, given that this is meant to be a scrambler. The footpeg placement is quite nice – a little lower and more forward set than the Interceptor. The new seat is much more comfortable than the Interceptor’s. However, the new wide handlebar puts the rider in a slightly forward-leaning position. It’s not uncomfortable by any means, but it’s definitely more roadster than scrambler. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Performance With the move to a two-into-one exhaust, RE was able to liberate a bit more torque, but the actual performance gains are higher than the spec sheet would suggest. The parallel engine is now more responsive, acceleration feels stronger, and the accompanying soundtrack is both louder and more exciting. Our test results show a significant improvement over the Interceptor and Continental GT as well, with this being the first RE to dip below the 6-second mark in our 0-100kph tests.  Royal Enfield Bear 650: Ride and handling Handling seems more sure-footed and grown-up-feeling. High-speed stability is much better with none of the mild steering weave you encounter on the INT. Thankfully, the brakes are better, too, with a sharper bite that demands less lever effort. However, the ABS can get triggered quite easily, and you will be very aware of the bike’s weight under heavy braking.  The rear shocks are a bit too firm for a bike like this. It’s a similar story in the corners – as long as you’re mindful of the Bear’s size and weight, you can have quite a lot of fun. There’s good cornering clearance, and the bike holds a line nicely once you get it pointed in the right direction. The new MRF Nylorex tyres do well on smooth, grippy tarmac, but they feel a bit vague and greasy on less-than-perfect surfaces. This is where the Bear 650 finds its main shortcoming. The suspension, particularly at the rear, is too firm for this bike’s own good. It’s not to the point of being an absolute dealbreaker, but you feel every imperfection on the road, and if you are looking forward to a plush and comfy bike, this is not it.  That said, it’s still fun if you throw some light off-roading at the bike, with decent ground clearance and plenty of torque to spin up the rear. You can also deactivate the rear ABS, but the overall weight and the front fork’s tendency to bottom out on big landings mean you shouldn’t take it too seriously. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The Bear 650 is equipped with the TFT display from the Himalayan 450, but you don’t have the choice of spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. With prices ranging between Rs 3.39 lakh and Rs 3.59 lakh ex-showroom, depending on which of the five colours you pick, I think the value proposition is fair. It is about Rs 40,000 more than the Interceptor but also more capable and better equipped. Most of all, I believe that this is the best 650 yet, but that suspension setup restricts the Bear to the point of being a good motorcycle – which is a pity because it had the potential to be a great one.

    "description": "Right-sized premium. That’s how I’d describe the Audi Q3, and for me, this is a brilliant formula for a city like Mumbai. You want a car that’s manageable through the narrow and crowded streets but also something that isolates you from the chaos in a nice premium ambience, and that’s what the Q3 does well.  Despite the sloping roofline, the Q3 Sportback can take in large cargo easily. The dimensions are just right, placing it between the Creta and Hector; the steering is light and easy, and the ride is comfortable. Perfect, then, for chaotic city streets with surfaces in various states of (dis)repair. And then there’s the insides, which I really like a lot. Some will find the interior lacking flash and dazzle, but I really like these straightforward, sensible and quality interiors. This may be the baby of the Q range in India, but there’s no skimping on quality. The insides are very well made with high-quality bits, and the switches and controls operate with a nice heft. But what I really like about the insides is that everything is so logical, and that, surprisingly, is a hard thing to find these days.  The centre console is so logically designed. Oddly, that’s a rarity these days. There’s the option of traditional dials on the digital IP, and the design is clear and easily legible. And then there’s the centre console, which has everything so well laid out. I think I posted on Instagram some time ago about this being the perfect centre console. The touchscreen is neatly integrated into the dash and very easy to reach with a natural drop-down of your hand from the steering wheel. Below that is an HVAC button bank; physical controls are always welcome, and these fall easily to hand as well. And the dials operate with a click, which is easily felt and audible, too. The leather/leatherette combo has no perforation, and the seats aren’t ventilated. Below that is the media controller, placed closer to the passenger; the driver, after all, has steering controls. Below that is another button bank for the drive-mode selection – again, far better than touch controls – and the buttons are large and easy to hit while on the move. USB ports are easy to access and right next to the phone storage cubby, which is deep enough for larger phones and has a recess to keep the phone in place. So yes, oddly specific as this may seem, the Q3 centre console is really well-designed – not something you can take for granted these days.   HVAC knobs feel great and operate with a quality feeling and sounding click. The seats are comfortable and supportive, though I would have liked them to be cooled, and the material isn’t perforated either; so you can get sweaty on a hot day. The rear is a comfy place to be, but my son, who is now taller than me, does find the headroom tight; that’s the trade-off you make with the Sportback.  It misses out on a 360-degree camera, and the rear view camera isn’t very sharp. Speaking of the Sportback, I had to transport a large wheelchair recently, which, in our long-term Creta, pretty much filled the boot. While Audi says the internal volume of the Sportback and the SUV-body-style Q3 is identical at 530 litres, I thought the tapering roofline might pose a problem for the large box. But it fit very easily inside the boot. So, the boot does take in a lot, and this is with a space-saver spare below. I’ve got a trip to Goa coming up soon, and as I write this, I’m beginning to think that the Q3 would make a good car for it. The 190hp, 2.0-litre TFSI engine is a delight. Sure, handling isn’t sharp; it’s more neutral, but that’s fine. With my daughter quite prone to motion sickness, I hardly carve up the corners, and even if I do indulge in some spirited driving, I think the Q3 will have tidy body control and thus reduce the chances of motion sickness. If I do end up taking this to Goa, I will include it in the next report.

    "description": "The Honda Elevate CVT entered our long-term fleet at a time when a number of its segment rivals were already present. But while the others were in demand – the Hyundai Creta IVT for its easy-going nature, the Toyota Hyryder for its frugal strong-hybrid and the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 TSI for its performance – the Elevate was, in a way, overlooked. When the time came for me to hand over the keys to the Creta and take the Honda, I was intrigued to see what it had to offer. Having spent over a month with it, here’s what my experience has been like. Responsive and peppy 1.5 engine is fun in traffic, allowing you to close gaps quickly. Starting from the exterior, I’m a big fan of the way this SUV looks. The tall, squared-off stance, the imposing grille and the minimalist yet stylish rear end all look cohesive and give it a really good road presence. You jump in, and things get even better. The dashboard has a neat, uncluttered layout, and there aren’t too many textures and colours, which I like. The wood panel on the dash is tasteful, and so is the tan colour for the upholstery. The slick touchscreen has been glitch-free. The seats are also supremely comfy and support you in all the right places. However, I find the lumbar a bit excessive, and I would have liked the seats to have ventilation and power adjustment. My parents also appreciated the easy access to the rear seat and the space offered here. Overall, I really grew to appreciate the Elevate’s mature demeanour. And that goes for the way it drives, too. Bonnet flares help you place the car in tight spots. The ride is well-judged, as the Elevate just takes road imperfections in its stride and feels composed doing so. The engine, though a bit noisy, is eager to respond, which helps in darting through the gaps in traffic. This, coupled with the elevated seating and easy-to-twirl steering, means it’s a breeze in traffic. What’s also really useful are the flares on either end of the bonnet, which help you place the car. These are particularly useful, as it doesn’t have a front camera or parking sensors that should have been there. It lacks plenty of features, such as cooled seats, pano sunroof, 360-degree camera, etc.. Fuel efficiency has also been respectable, hovering around the 10-11kpl mark in the city. In our time with this SUV, the efficiency rarely dipped to single digits, which is impressive because it has no mild-hybrid assist or fuel-saving auto start/stop tech. What’s also nice is that the on-board computer is quite accurate with its economy readings. In my short time, I wasn’t able to stretch the Elevate’s legs on a highway, but drives on Mumbai’s eastern freeway and the new coastal road point to a good road trip companion, especially considering it also has a class-leading 480-litre boot. Despite no hybrid or auto start/stop tech, its efficiency remained around 10-11kpl. However, there are things that I haven’t gelled well with. The audio system is not good, especially since I’m moving from the Creta, which has a great-sounding Bose system. The other irritant is that you have to turn off the ADAS functions every time you start the car, unlike the Creta, in which it stays off. And I have to do that given Mumbai’s chaotic roads. It’s also only a camera-based system and not the more sophisticated radar-based system offered by rivals. Then there’s the feed from the cameras, which is low-res and choppy. Speaking of which, the blind-view camera’s feed appears on the touchscreen, so you lose the navigation feed for a few seconds when you’re about to make a turn. Moving from the Creta also highlights the paucity of features. Even in top-spec ZX form, it misses out on kit, such as a 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, electric handbrake, drive modes and more. Even the roof liner is woven and not the more premium, knitted type. Seat cushioning is very well-judged; it will take the pain out of a long journey. But while I did miss these features, the little things I did appreciate were the tactile switches for the AC controls, which don’t require me to take my eyes off the road, and the neat, well-executed and customisable part-digital instrument cluster. So, on the whole, it’s a car that’s got the fundamentals right, and it grows on you in a jack-of-all-trades way. And while it’s a frill-free SUV, it’s a fuss-free one, too.

    "description": "Honda has launched an updated version of its Activa 125 scooter which is now compatible with the upcoming OBD2B norms and it also gets a new TFT display. 4.2-inch TFT display is new USB-C charging port now included Only top 2 variants launched for now The current Activa 125 uses a LCD display while the new one now offers a 4.2-inch TFT. This display is also compatible with Honda’s RoadSync app which enables functions like call alerts and navigation assists. The scooter also comes with a USB type C charging port. In addition to meeting the updated OBD2B specifications which come into effect in 2025, the Honda Activa 125 is otherwise mostly the same under the skin. This includes the 123.9cc fuel injected engine that produces 8.4hp and 10.5Nm of torque. The motor is equipped with a start-stop system. The 2025 Honda Activa is available in 6 colours and prices now start at Rs 94,442 for the DLX variant while the top H-Smart variant with the key fob and keyless ignition costs Rs 97,146. That is a steep climb from the Activa 125’s current starting price of Rs 80,256 and some of it will be down to the more expensive emissions monitoring tech. However, Honda has only launched two variants for now and more affordable versions with simpler features like a front drum brake may be launched in the future which will reduce the entry point.   The only other family-oriented 125cc scooter to get a TFT is the top SmartXonnect variant of the TVS Jupiter 125, which costs Rs 90,721.  All prices ex-showroom, Delhi Also See: Honda Activa 125 BS6 review, test ride",

    "description": "The Suzuki Swift Sport (based on the previous-generation ZC33S model) gets a swansong with a Final Edition, which will only be sold officially in the Japanese market. Suzuki is yet to confirm the arrival of the all-new Swift Sport based on the current-gen Swift, which means the ZX33S may well be the final iteration of the Swift Sport for now. The Swift Sport Final Edition will be available from March to November 2025 It gets unique cosmetic bits inside out There are no mechanical changes for the Final Edition Swift Sport Final Edition gets unique cosmetic upgrades As part of the Final Edition, the Swift Sport ZC33S gets a gloss black finish on the grille, unique 17-inch alloy wheels with a black finish, red brake calipers, a Swift Sport emblem with red and black lettering, and special decals on the C-pillars on each side. Apart from these, there are no other exterior changes to the car, which has been around internationally since 2017. It gets faux aluminium inserts on the dashboard and door pads. Additional ‘Sport’ lettering and a decal reading ‘ZC33S powered by Suzuki’ are positioned near the gear lever. The car retains the regular Swift Sport’s bucket seats, aluminium-finished pedals, and red stitching on the steering wheel and upholstery.  Customers who want their Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition to look more unique can opt for optional aero accessories that include more decals, light garnishes, and other add-ons to enhance the car’s visual appeal. Swift Sport Final Edition gets no mechanical changes The ZC33S Final Edition is identical to the regular Swift Sport in terms of mechanicals. It comes with the same 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, producing 138hp and 230Nm of torque. It gets a front-wheel-drive (FWD) layout and offers a choice of a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox. This powertrain in the Japanese-spec car does not get any electrification, while the Swift Sport sold in Europe has had mild-hybrid technology since 2020 due to stricter emission norms. Production of the Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition will begin in March 2025 and continue until November 2025. Swift Sport India launch details Maruti has shown the Swift Sport in India many times at various events. However, it has not gone on sale in India throughout its history. The standard Swift and its sedan sibling, the Dzire, entered their respective new generations in India this year.
