    "description": "Passenger version of the Jimny was pulled from sale in the UK in 2020 Electrification \"would ruin\" small 4x4 due to added weight, according to Toshihiro Suzuki Suzuki’s president has suggested the brand has no plans to build an electric or hybrid version of the Jimny, given that electrifying the 4x4 “would ruin\" it. The car has had a strong following in the UK since its launch in 1970, with its fourth generation – and mini reboot – in 2018 rubber stamping its cult classic status. Calls have been made to bring the Jimny back to the UK since it was pulled from sale in 2020, but strict emissions regulations has in reality meant only with an electrified powertrain would it be able to return. These regulations mean that, in Europe, the Jimny is only able to be offered as a LCV. Hopes were raised when official silhouette images of Suzuki’s next electric cars seemed to suggest the Jimny would gain a fully electric counterpart. A hybrid variant has also long been mooted. However, speaking to journalists at the launch of the eVitara, the brand’s first EV, Toshihiro Suzuki has appeared to dash any speculation. “If you talk about the Jimny EV, I think it would ruin the best part of the Jimny,” he said. “I think the core strength of the JImny is the right weight.” Instead, Toshihiro Suzuki wants to focus on continuing the Jimny line with “professionals”. “If we want to keep providing the Jimny to the market as tools for the professionals, maybe the e-fuel, or biofuel utilising the ICE technology would be the way to keep Jimmy supported in the future.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/suzuki-puts-future-evs-hold-it-monitors-electric-car-market",
    "description": "President Toshihiro Suzuki says decision down to slowdown in EV growth and popularity in cheap Chinese electric cars Suzuki has put its future electric cars on hold while it “monitors the market” amid a general slowdown in EV interest, president Toshihiro Suzuki has said. Four electric models were due before the turn of the decade as part of a $35 billion EV investment, starting with the eVitara which was launched today. These models have already been teased in silhouette form (below), and although Suzuki has yet to confirm which segments they will occupy, they are clear matches for the likes of the S-Cross and Ignis suggesting the brand will look to electrify some of its most popular models. However, at the launch of the eVitara – its first EV – Toshihiro Suzuki would not set a date for when the next electric car would arrive, nor if the target was still to launch five EVs by 2030. “We are in a very difficult situation at this moment as the sales of BEVs are slowing down,” he said, “and on the other hand affordable and cheap EVs from China are coming into the market, so it is a very difficult time to introduce [further] BEVs.” He added: “Looking at the current situations, the government incentives for BEVs are going out and [coupled] with Chinese EVs that have very strong [segment] competitiveness you have to think carefully about what type of BEV should be introduced to the market and in what time.” Speaking about the next EV, which will be “smaller than the eVitara”, Toshihiro Suzuki said: “All I can say is look forward to it, but again we have to keep watching how eVitara sales will go but also how the market trends goes [before setting a date].” Despite this, EVs are still a key part of the brand’s future. “Although I said we have to monitor the situation, that does mean we are leaving BEV development, so we are going to keep up the development,” said Toshihiro Suzuki. “But, we are not going to concentrate on just EVs,” he added, “and the other idea is to merge pathways such as with biogas fuel in India; we want to keep our development in parallel.” For Suzuki, some 48% of its annual car sales come from India, a market that while pushing towards carbon neutrality, is still heavily dependent on combustion engine vehicles. “From Suzuki point of view, EV is not the only solution,” said Toshihiro Suzuki. “Suzuki thinks [with a varied] pathway, which means hybrids of course and e-fuels and also projects such as biogas in India. So we are going for many options.\"",

    "description": "Based in Burghausen in Upper Bavaria, Krämer Motorcycles is a boutique marque with a singular focus—race bikes. Everything they create is 100 percent track-focused, jam-packed full of high-end engineering, and slathered in top-shelf components. Now they’ve applied that ethos to their first naked bike, the Krämer GP2-890 XX hypernaked. Unveiled today at EICMA, the Krämer GP2-890 XX has much in common with the company’s GP2-890 RR track racer, but it’s more than just a GP2-890 RR without a fairing. Sporting upright ergonomics and a host of other tweaks, the GP2-890 XX is, as Krämer puts it, “built for wheelies, not podiums.” “When we looked around the paddocks we were going to, we noticed that a little over 10 percent of the motorcycles on track were large-displacement naked models, which is an interesting trend developing in the industry,” says Jensen Beeler, who runs Krämer’s USA operation.…",

It just comes natural.” He recalls when he was two years old and his father was on the front porch cleaning his saw. Clermont jumped and in the process was nicked by the blade. The resulting scar is still visible today. “I like to say that that’s when I got bit by the chainsaw bug,” he says. “It’s been in my blood ever since.” The bug bit hard as he gives us a glimpse into the world of chainsaws.…",

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  Everest iconography shifted here from the spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular). But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "description": "It was one of those perfect drives, a rare window of relative emptiness on India’s busiest highway. A mid-morning dash to the BU Bhandari showroom for the launch of the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 was the easiest Mumbai-Pune trip I’ve done in a long time. Making the drive particularly relaxing was the new addition to Autocar India’s fleet, the all-electric Mercedes EQE SUV, which got its first highway outing. It took just two hours and six minutes in the ultra-smooth (and quick) EQE SUV to go from the Autocar HQ to the BU Bhandari Showroom on the Pune bypass. That’s less than what many office folks take to get home on a typical working day in Mumbai. It does help that the AtalSetu has brought our office closer to the edge of Mumbai, and a 10:15am departure was a sweet spot (or time). The early-morning highway rush was over, the toll plazas had no long queues, and even the Lonavala Ghat, which is choked most of the day (and night) on Google Maps, was surprisingly ‘blue’. Traffic flowed without holdups, even on the steepest sections where trucks otherwise block all lanes while trying to ‘overtake’ at a crawl. Strong and smooth powertrain effortlessly gobbles miles. The Atal Setu is always a great place to try out the ADAS system on any car. The wide and perfectly marked lanes and the gentle curves on this 21km sea bridge were perfect for checking out the EQE SUV’s ‘Level 2’ ADAS capability. That meant letting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which I have set at 99kph (just below the 100kph speed limit), and the Lane Keep Assist do the work while I sat back and relaxed with just a light hand on the wheel, enjoying the harbour’s breathtaking views. The Lane Keep Assist worked brilliantly, keeping the big Merc centred nicely in the fast lane. When changing lanes, I was impressed with how the ACC reacted smoothly. When you signal and shift into the overtaking lane, the ACC provides strong and linear acceleration without abrupt power surges to match the new lane’s speed. Active Brake Assist activates at the slightest hint of an obstacle. While the ADAS in the Mercedes EQE SUV is highly advanced, it has some limitations, especially when dealing with erratic drivers who slice across lanes like it’s a normal thing to do. If some idiot abruptly cuts into your lane from a sharp angle, the ADAS can struggle to react promptly. This is not the case with just the EQE SUV – no ADAS is fully capable of handling such unpredictable events, which is a reminder of why the tech can only assist and not replace the driver. Mercedes’ Active Brake Assist, while a great safety feature on paper, can become a nuisance – and even a potential hazard – in Mumbai’s chaotic traffic. Designed for controlled environments, it doesn’t quite account for the unpredictability of pedestrians darting across roads or scooters weaving through tight gaps. The system often triggers unnecessarily, slamming on the brakes at the slightest hint of an obstacle. In such congested conditions, this overly sensitive response can be more dangerous than helpful. These fierce and abrupt stops are hugely unnerving for the passengers and could catch a driver behind you off guard, increasing the risk of rear-end collisions. It’s best to switch the Brake Assist off, which you have to do every time you start the car. The monsoons have made mincemeat of the Nhava Sheva road, which connects the Atal Setu to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and on such surfaces, the EQE SUV is out of its comfort zone. To be honest, it doesn’t quite live up to its SUV credentials and isn’t comfortable dropping in and out of potholes like its IC engine brethren. That’s because the softly sprung EQE SUV uses up its suspension travel quite easily, and deep ruts and craters crash through. In fact, it’s best to use ‘Sport’ drive mode as the default setting. The suspension feels overtly soft in Comfort and Normal modes, which is fine when you are crawling in rush hour, but up the pace a bit on even a slightly smooth road, and you’ll find the EQE SUV tends to wallow and feel floaty. In Sport mode, the suspension tightens nicely to give a more settled ride, which is what you want on the highway. Wallows at speed because of soft suspension. Two areas where the EQE SUV stands out are performance and range, and both are interlinked because, with great range, you can enjoy the performance without keeping an eye on the SOC meter. Plant your foot down, and this big and heavy SUV lunges forward with an intensity that can take you aback but in a very pleasing way. The EQE SUV gathers with velvet smoothness, and before you know it, you’ve sailed past the speed limit. On the Mumbai-Pune expressway, which is now infested with speed cameras, it is hard not to get a speeding ticket. To stay out of trouble, I limit my indulgence to short jabs of the accelerator pedal just to enjoy all the 408hp and 858Nm of torque that puts most IC engine SUVs to shame. I averaged 66kph on the 140km drive to BU Bhandari, which is pretty good if you consider that this included slow, non-expressway sections. Not that the expressway raises your average speed dramatically because with so many cameras staring at you, I’m forced to show a lot of restraint! With 332km range left, I didn’t need to use the Pune Mercedes dealers’ on-site 180kW fast charger, but it’s good to know that it’s there and that the dealership is happy to let non-Merc owners plug in as well. Located just off the Pune bypass, it’s an incredibly convenient place for EVs on a long-distance trip to Mahabaleshwar or beyond to quickly top up their batteries. Phenomenal range eliminates range anxiety. The return journey was equally uneventful. Using the regen down the Lonavala Ghat, I could extend the range even further, which, on this round trip, I calculated to be 504km. That is a truly impressive figure, considering how hard I was driving the EQE SUV. In fact, there was enough charge left in the battery (36 percent) for me to make another trip to Pune! The other area where the EQE SUV shines is refinement. The EQE SUV is not just quiet; it’s like being inside a luxury vault on wheels. The adaptive air suspension noiselessly glides over any surface, and then there’s the acoustic insulation, which Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Road, tyre and wind noises, even the electric motor’s faint whir, are gone. The cabin is like a calm oasis, and that’s what makes the EQE SUV special. It is luxury in its most serene form.

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.

    "description": "Royal Enfield has finally entered the EV game and to do so, it has created a new subsidiary - Flying Flea. The first product from RE’s new EV subsidiary is called the C6. Frame made from forged aluminium C6 will go on sale in spring 2026 S6 scrambler also under development Also See: Royal Enfield Flying Flea C6 image gallery Royal Enfield’s Flying Flea C6: details  The C6 is Flying Flea’s maiden offering and while this is an all-new electric bike, the styling definitely has a whiff of old-school about it. The C6’s silhouette is like a low-slung bobber motorcycle, with its raked-out front end and solo saddle. One very unusual element of the Flying Flea C6 is that it employs a girder-style front fork to handle suspension duties, something not seen in today’s mainstream motorcycles.   The frame of the C6 is made from forged aluminium, certainly not common in the budget-friendly EV marketplace and another premium touch is the touchscreen TFT dashboard. All-new switchgear complements the new dash. The C6 gets all-LED lighting, with the headlight not being the same as the one seen across (almost) the entire Royal Enfield lineup now.    No details about powertrain, specs or the all-important question of range have been revealed yet but what can be seen is the presence of disc brakes front and rear. The C6 is meant to be an urban runabout and so the overall dimensions appear to be quite petite and it should be a friendly, welcoming machine for riders of all shapes and sizes. The C6 also gets rather skinny tyres, which should not only make it nimble and agile inside urban confines but also help it eke out more range with lower rolling resistance.   The bike you see here is a solo seater but Flying Flea will sell you provisions to carry a pillion as an optional extra. While the C6 was the only model showcased at this event, Flying Flea also teased a future model, the S6 electric scrambler. The S6 will have longer-travel suspension, spoked wheels shod with dual-purpose rubber and a flat, bench-style seat.    As for when you can buy a Flying Flea C6, Royal Enfield tells us that will be possible come ‘spring 2026’. Whether that will be through the Royal Enfield dealer network or via a separate Flying Flea dealership is one question (among many others) which we hope to bring you answers to soon.  Also See: KTM 390 Adventure R leaked fully ahead of debut",

    "description": "The Suzuki e Vitara has been revealed as the production version of the Maruti eVX concept in Milan, today. The ‘born-electric’ midsize SUV is the Japanese brand’s first EV for India and will enter a hotly contested segment that includes the Tata Curvv EV, MG ZS EV and the upcoming Hyundai Creta EV and Mahindra BE 05.   The e Vitara will be a global model for Suzuki, produced at the brand’s Gujarat plant, with 50 percent of production earmarked for export to Japan and Europe, which explains why the global debut was in Italy and not India. However, e-Vitara will first go on sale in India in March 2025 after its Indian debut at the Bharat Mobility Show in January 2025, in New Delhi. This will be followed by a European launch around June 2025.    Maruti e Vitara dimensions and design stay true to concept It’s surprising how similar the production-ready e Vitara looks to both versions of the eVX concept – the first shown at the Auto Expo in January 2023 and the second at the Japan Mobility Show in October 2023 – especially given Suzuki’s typically conservative approach to design.  Some of the sharper angles and cuts have been sanded down, but the muscular nature of the bodywork has been retained. A big part of this is the generous use of dark cladding around the base of the vehicle, imparting the requisite rugged look. It is that, unlike some BEVs, the e Vitara’s conventional two-box design doesn’t appear to have been defined by aerodynamics, and could work just as well on an ICE product.      Details that return from the concepts are the tri-slash LED daytime running lights at the front and rear, charging ports on the front flanks, and the prominent bulge over the rear wheel arch. The e Vitara wheel size goes up to a chunky 225/50 R19 on the AWD version, with lesser models getting 18-inch alloys, and interestingly, the rear door handle has moved up to the C-pillar, much like in the old Swift. The length, width and height of 4,275mm, 1,800mm and 1,635mm remain true to earlier reports, and put it right on par with something like the Hyundai Creta EV. More interesting, however, is its 2,700mm wheelbase, which is longer than the Creta’s, to accommodate a large battery pack and also points to a spacious interior for this born electric vehicle.  The e Vitara’s ground clearance stands at 180mm which is elevated enough for most Indian road conditions and the kerb weight is 1,702kg to 1,899kg across variants which, given its size and big battery pack, isn’t overtly heavy.  Also See: Maruti e Vitara image gallery Maruti e Vitara battery, range and platform The Maruti e Vitara (codename: YY8) is not based on any existing product and instead is built on an all-new skateboard platform dubbed Heartect-e, which the company claims combines “the advanced feel of a BEV and the robust nature of an SUV”. It incorporates what Suzuki calls eAxles, which combines the motor and inverter. This all-new ‘skateboard’ or dedicated EV platform (codename: 40PL) was jointly developed with Toyota, and will spawn a sister SUV from the allied Japanese brand, which could be revealed later in 2025.  The e Vitara will be available with two battery options – 49kWh and 61kWh, the larger of which will get an option dual-motor AWD, which Suzuki has dubbed AllGrip-e. The batteries use LFP (Lithium Iron-phosphate) ‘blade’ cells from Chinese battery giant BYD. However, unlike most domestic EV manufacturers that import just the battery cells for local pack assembly, Maruti-Suzuki will be importing the entire battery pack from BYD instead of assembling it in-house.    The AllGrip-e system on the AWD model includes a Trail mode, in which the e Vitara will apply the brakes on tyres that don’t have traction, while apportioning torque to the remaining tyres, essentially simulating a limited-slip differential. While there is no official word on the range, it was earlier revealed that the larger 61kWh battery is expected to deliver upwards of 500km on global test cycles. As for power, the 49kWh battery with its single motor on the front axle produces 144hp, while the larger 61kWh battery in single-motor guise ups that to 174hp. Both these versions produce 189Nm of torque, which is on the lower side for this size of the car; for reference, a Curvv EV has 215Nm.  However, moving up to the e-AllGrip AWD version adds a 65hp motor on the rear axle, for a total output of 184hp and 300Nm, which is far more substantial. Maruti e Vitara interior and features Where the e Vitara appears to really move the game forward for Maruti and Suzuki is in the interior, which looks like a big upgrade from existing models. The design is contemporary, with a floating dual-screen infotainment and instrumentation console, the shelf-like horizontally stacked dashboard and the floating centre console finished in gloss black, under which sits a storage area with USB ports. Interesting details are the twin-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel, the rectangular AC vents with their brushed silver surrounds, the rotary drive state selector and the part fabric, part leatherette upholstery. It’s also good to see big door pockets and physical AC controls.    Maruti e Vitara features that can be spotted include an electronic parking brake with auto hold, drive modes including ‘Trail’ for AWD versions, hill descent control, single-zone auto climate control, wireless phone charger, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, side and curtain airbags, heated mirrors, and some ADAS features like Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keep Assist. Let’s hope Maruti brings most of these to India. There also appears to be a new operating system or user interface for the dual screens, which not only features a simpler layout for the touchscreen, but also puts a lot more information in the digital dials than the current SmartPlay Pro+ system.  There’s little we can say about the rear seat at this time, other than that it gets a split-folding arrangement, adjustable headrests and three-point seatbelts for all passengers and ISOFIX child seat mounts. The high roof and long wheelbase point to generous headroom and legroom but it remains to be seen how well Suzuki engineers have balanced the e Vitara’s high ground clearance and the packaging of the underfloor battery pack to keep the cabin floor as low as possible for a comfortable seating position.  Maruti e Vitara price expectation and launch The e Vitara’s original launch date of October 2024 was pushed forward by six months due to technical delays in the development process. Sources say that Suzuki faced a steep learning curve, especially with software in the development of its first EV. In fact, Suzuki president Toshihiro Suzuki said in a statement, that the electric SUV was “developed through repeated trial and error to create an easy-to-use BEV for our customers.” Unlike EV market leader Tata Motors which of late has picked up a reputation for reliability issues and quality bugs, Maruti-Suzuki wants to get it first time right and offer the company’s same ideals of no-nonsense, reliable and easy motoring.  With the Maruti e Vitara India launch pushed to March 2025, apart from the already launched Tata Curvv EV, it will have two additional rivals, the Mahindra BE 05 and Hyundai Creta EV, both of which are expected to be launched in January.    The Maruti e Vitara price in India is expected to start at around Rs 20 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base 49 kWh model which is on par with the MG ZS EV (Rs 18.98 lakh, ex-showroom). The price for the 61kWh back version with the higher powered motor could climb to Rs 25 lakh with the e-Allgrip AWD version moving close to the Rs 30 lakh mark.  What also remains to be seen is if the e Vitara flies that other Maruti Suzuki flag – efficiency, though if its 500km+ range certification is on the MIDC (Modified Indian Driving Cycle), it’s a good sign. The Suzuki e Vitara is the first of a family of EVs built on the new Heartect-e, platform that will include an Innova sized all-electric MPV which again, will have a Toyota counterpart. With India’s No. 1 carmaker launching its first-ever EV, its game on, in the race for electric dominance.  Also see:  Maruti eVX based Toyota EV confirmed for 2025",
