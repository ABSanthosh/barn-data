    "title": "Ferrari at a Crossroads: Cavallino Classic '25",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Breakers really shouldn’t exist. Not in its current artful form anyway. Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.

    "title": "Evolution of an Icon: The MZR 240z",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ The Datsun 240Z was never the problem. It was the solution. The answer to a world where European sports cars carried steep price tags and Japanese cars were still thought of as nothing more than basic transportation. For years, Japanese cars in America were what students drove to class, what families bought when they were new, when money was tight, or what commuters relied on when fuel prices spiked. They were appliances, used for economy, and durability. It’s easy to look back on them now as more than products of their time. But they weren’t. They filled parking lots at office buildings and grocery stores, racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on city roads, and lived out their lives as forgettable hand-me-downs, passed from one generation to the next until they rusted into the ground. They were not the cars enthusiasts dreamed about, not the machines people pinned on their walls or took out on Sunday after church for a little exercise. Today we love the quirky, endearing nature of the classic Japanese econobox, but back then? It was a tool.  The Z was one of the cars that changed everything. It was Japan’s bold declaration, a machine shaped by the same relentless craftsmanship and discipline that defined the country’s post-war industrial rise. It embodied the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, continuous improvement.  The Z was beautiful, with the long nose of a Ferrari, and an inline-six that, despite its modest origins (and with some SU carburetors installed), could sing when you need it to. In 1970, it was fast enough, with a chassis that felt nimble, eager, and alive in a way most Americans had never experienced in something that did not wear a European badge. It was still affordable, but it was no longer just transportation. It was undeniably a sports car. But time does not stand still. Roads get wider. And for better or worse, cars get faster, stop better, turn sharper, and expectations shift. The Z’s magic is still there, but modern traffic, modern brakes, and modern speed put it in a different context. It still thrives on momentum and chassis respect. But, time marches on. The engineers at Nissan did not create the perfect Z, they created the best one they could for the money, theirs, and yours. So, as is often the case as we make engine noises in our garage over winter, pontificating on what we can modify, and how things could be better. The question is not whether the Z is still great as it was, it is how much better could it be? For Rahail Tariq, the Z had been lurking in his subconscious, a shape that had stuck with him from flipping through magazine pages. When he finally got his first 240Z, his first classic car, it was white, with black sills and a set of 260Z wheels that he did not even know were incorrect at the time. He bought it online in 2005, not as an expert but as someone drawn to its presence, and it’s silhouette. That car, with all its patina and imperfections, was the seed that eventually grew into MZR Roadsports.   Rahail’s connection to cars ran deeper than just his own discoveries. His father, a technician in the 1970s, was always bringing home interesting machinery, M5s, Mini Coopers, Daimlers, even an E-Type Jaguar. Growing up around those cars, seeing the way his father worked on them, improved them, and understood them, gave him an appreciation for cars as something alive, something that could always be made better. The Z was just the first car where Rahail realized that he was the one who would have to push it forward. In the UK, where classic Japanese sports cars did not have the same deep-rooted restoration culture as Porsches or E-Types, Rahail found himself frustrated. Nobody was building the Z the way he envisioned it. No one was taking it to its logical next step, not just restoring but refining, improving. That search led him to Martin Ryland, a Datsun expert who eventually became his collaborator and helped shape the vision of MZR. Restomods are sometimes frowned upon, seen as tampering with an icon, but consider this. Given the opportunity, is it possible Nissan would have never left the Z as it was? If the company had continued refining it with an unlimited budget, what would it have looked like? A lighter chassis, a more rigid structure, and an engine with sharper response and a little more urgency. That is exactly what MZR is doing, finishing what the original engineers, given enough time, could have done, maybe even would have done, but did not. Their Evolution models, built with bespoke carbon-fiber bodywork, are not just about chasing numbers. Yes, the RB 3.4L DOHC straight-six delivers over 300 horsepower, and yes, the six-speed manual brings precision to every shift, but the real magic is in how it all comes together. It is a 240Z honed and distilled, shaped by the same kaizen philosophy that defined its creation, an ongoing pursuit of refinement, balance, and purpose. The 240Z never needed saving, it was never the problem after all. But it deserved to be honored, not just looked at through the lens of nostalgia. It was built to be driven, and MZR has made sure that it still begs to be. Continue...",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/black-badge-spectre-most-powerful-rolls-royce-ever-made",
    "description": "Luxury model is first EV to get Black Badge treatment which boosts output to 650bhp The new Rolls-Royce Black Badge Spectre is the most powerful model in the West Sussex car maker’s history, packing up to 650bhp and 793lb ft.  Its arrival also takes the Black Badge moniker into the electric age for the first time. Launched in 2016, Black Badge branding is intended to denote powerful and more individualistic versions of its most luxurious cars and is targeted at younger buyers.  Arriving just over a year after the Spectre went on sale as the brand’s first electric car, the Black Badge model is pitched as a more aggressive proposition than the standard EV.  While the dual-motor Rolls-Royce Black Badge Spectre offers the same 577bhp as the standard car in normal running, a new Infinity mode unlocks a further 73bhp and quickens throttle response.  This performance-enhancing feature is said to be inspired by the Rolls Royce Merlin engine that powered aircraft such as the Supermarine Spitfire during the Second World War. It allowed pilots to call on an extra burst of power to escape dog fights. As well as the Infinity mode (the symbol of Black Badge), Rolls-Royce has added a launch control setting called Spirited mode, which boosts torque from 660lb ft to 793lb ft and primes the car for a 0-62mph time of 4.1sec.  In all, the potent new Spectre model surpasses the output of the 2016 Wraith Black Badge, which made 623bhp and 642lb ft from its twin-turbocharged V12.  In sync with the extra reserves of the Black Badge Spectre, engineers have fitted new dampers to reduce the effects of the three-tonne EV squatting under acceleration and diving under braking. They also increase the roll stabilisation for flatter cornering. The car gets heavier steering too.  Rolls-Royce has introduced new levels of customisation with the Black Badge Spectre. One option enables buyers to fit the illuminated grille with a backplate that lights up in one of five colours.  This theme continues inside, where the treadplate can also be illuminated, this time in 10 different colourways. The cabin houses the same luxuries as the standard car, which combines an array of high-end materials with digital screens and physical buttons.  The Black Badge is also available with a new colour: Vapour Violet. This is said to be inspired by the “neon ambience of 1980s and 1990s club culture”. The new colour can be paired with a white bonnet for a “bold contrast”. Special new 23in fi ve-spoke alloy wheels are fitted and shod with Rolls-Royce’s noise-cancelling run-flat tyres.  “Black Badge Spectre is one of the clearest statements of power and purpose we have ever made,” said Rolls-Royce CEO Chris Brownridge. “Our engineers crafted an intense and uncompromising character and the most powerful Rolls-Royce in history.”  The company has not disclosed pricing, but with the standard car costing from £332,055 before options, it is likely that transaction prices for the Black Badge Spectre will creep well beyond the £500,000 mark once cars are equipped to customers’ specifications.",

    "description": "New grille mirrors that fitted to the XC90 Brand’s best-selling SUV gets a further update ahead of the arrival of its electric sibling, the EX60 The Volvo XC60 has been updated with a new look and upgraded interior in a bid to maintain the appeal of the brand's best-selling model. Visual changes include a new grille similar to that fitted to the new XC90, as well as darker rear lights. There will also be new wheel designs, although UK specifications have yet to be confirmed. Inside, the car gets a larger, 11.2in infotainment touchscreen that is now elevated above the dashboard’s surface. It runs via a more powerful chip from American firm Qualcomm, which is said to make the system twice as quick to respond to inputs as before. It also brings crisper graphics, according to Volvo. The new XC60 is said to get more luxurious materials inside, with upholstery options including a combination of Nordico synthetic leather and herringbone-pattern fabric. Cabin refinement is said to be improved too. Powertrains are unchanged, meaning there is a choice of a 248bhp mild hybrid or two plug-in hybrids with outputs of 345bhp and 449bhp. Cars with coil-sprung suspension will receive new dampers intended to soften their ride, although the air suspension set-up remains unchanged. Prices are set to be confirmed next month but are expected to rise slightly compared with the outgoing version of the XC60, which is priced from £46,115. Deliveries will begin in the third quarter, between July and the end of September. That the petrol-powered XC60 has received an update so close to the release of its electric counterpart, the EX60 (due next year), suggests it will remain on sale for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Volvo boss Jim Rowan has previously suggested that the larger XC90 could remain on sale into the next decade, depending on demand for the model relative to its EX90 sibling. “We will be ready to go fully electric this decade, but if the market infrastructure and customer acceptance is not quite there, we can allow that to take a few more years,” he said. “The transition to electrification will not be linear. Customers and markets are moving at different speeds, and therefore we will continue to invest in our hybrids so that wherever you are in your journey to electric driving, you can have a Volvo to suit your needs and your situations.”",

    "description": "The American International Motorcycle Expo might not be the first place you’d expect to find us, as the event has a whole lot more to do with what’s on dealer floors than the custom scene. That’s not the whole story though, because besides rubbing elbows with industry partners and parts manufacturers, we also had a host of factory concept bikes and customs to hunt down. See, the big OEs are well aware that modified bikes bring big attention, and partnerships with reputable builders are one of the most effective ways to drum up excitement for their current offerings. And when you have the backing of corporate bucks, big things are possible. The AIMExpo isn’t open to the public, just industry members and press, so we flashed our credentials and got to hiking around the Las Vegas Convention Center.…",

If you’re one of those motorcyclists, CROIG and Yamaha have a treat for you. This wild Yamaha XSR900 is being given away to raise funds for Waves for Water, a nonprofit that provides clean water to communities that need it. This is the second time the two parties have teamed up for charity. The project, dubbed ‘Yard Built for Good,’ is the brainchild of David Chang—founder of the immensely popular CROIG (Café Racers of Instagram)—and is supported by Yamaha’s Yard Built custom initiative. The idea is simple; build a killer custom bike, and give it away to one lucky Waves for Water donor.

    "description": "The BMW CE 02 represents an innovative leap, targeting younger, eco-conscious riders who might overlook traditional BMW motorcycles. In India, it appeals to a niche audience with higher disposable incomes, valuing style and badge value over practicality. While its price may seem steep, the CE 02 offers a compelling case, particularly when compared to its more expensive sibling. Love it or hate it, the CE 02’s design is undeniably catchy. Neither a bike nor a scooter, BMW dubs it an “e-parkourer” meant for fun, short-distance commuting. Practicality, however, takes a backseat with no storage or additional seating space, making its heavy charger or a pillion inconvenient to carry. Upon first glance, the rider footpegs seem like an afterthought and feel out of place in the otherwise cohesive design. The rider footpegs look like a bit of an afterthought on the CE 02. With minimal bodywork, a low stance and a futuristic aesthetic, the CE 02 captures attention from a diverse range of onlookers. During my time with it, teenagers, adults, and even senior citizens frequently enquired about it.  A stylish single-piece seat that looks and feels like an ironing board. The bike’s low 745mm seat height and light 142kg weight make it approachable for beginners, but the bench-like seat limits comfort as it is best suited for solo riders. Additionally, the low-mounted tail-light is poorly positioned, making it less visible to tailgaters. A rather cute face and an LED headlamp with good illumination. On the features front, the CE 02 comes equipped with LED lighting, a 3.5-inch TFT display, keyless start, two riding modes, a reverse feature, adjustable levers, a Type-C charging socket and Bluetooth connectivity.  Extremely crisp micro TFT that is both easy to read and use. Our test unit included the Highline package, an optional upgrade costing Rs 50,000. This adds features like a fast charger, additional switchgear, a smartphone holder, an extra riding mode called “Flash”, a tri-coloured seat, heated grips, a gold-finished fork and some graphics.  The charger cover is rather simple-looking and feels basic to use. The Highline package is worth considering for a more enriched experience overall. Additionally, the accessory comfort seat, priced at Rs 12,000, is also recommended due to the limited cushioning of the standard seat. Besides this, if you buy the standard version and wish to add the fast charger, it will cost you Rs 70,000, which makes the Highline package a no-brainer.   The CE 02 offers three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. Flow combines high regenerative braking with a linear throttle response, Surf disables regen for a freer ride, and Flash delivers maximum regen with a sharp throttle response. There’s an additional Battery Saver mode that requires manual activation via the menu, while a Low Power mode automatically engages at alow charge. Surf mode proved ideal for my highway commutes to work, offering effortless coasting. Riding the CE 02 in Mumbai was a joy, thanks to its ample torque and quick acceleration. In our tests, the CE 02 accelerates quicker to 80kph than most 160cc motorcycles, aligning closer to a fast sub-160cc or a slower 200cc bike. Its lightweight build enhances its agility and pace, especially in city conditions, and the traction control ensures confidence on loose surfaces. The claimed 108km range holds up well for regular commutes, and the fast charger tops up the battery in about three and a half hours.   While the brakes offer excellent feedback, the lack of dual-channel ABS is a drawback since the rear wheel is prone to locking under aggressive braking. This is especially so when paired with the CE 02’s strong regenerative braking, which reduced how much I found myself using the brakes. The single-sided swingarm looks quite cool and gets a lot of attention. It is lightweight and has a low centre of gravity, which makes it highly manoeuvrable and enjoyable for city commutes. The suspension provides decent comfort at moderate speeds but struggles over potholes or bumps, often unsettling the rider. Ground clearance seems decent, but BMW would not share the exact figure with us. The fork is non-adjustable, and the rear shock is preload adjustable.  The low-mounted tail-light is hidden from tailgaters or tall SUVs. The Michelin City Grip 2 tyres deliver reliable traction overall despite varying riding styles. The CE 02 is an otherwise comfortable little commuter, but its thin and minimally padded seat becomes a pain after about an hour. The riding posture is upright, with wide bars allowing for better control.   This is by no means a practical purchase. Despite being made at TVS’ plant in Hosur, at Rs 4.99 lakh for the Highline package-equipped CE 02, it is an expensive proposition. Then again, it is the most affordable BMW EV and offers a blend of bold design, high-quality construction and engaging performance.  A rather charming little machine that tugs on your heartstrings and yanks on your wallet. Its quirky styling may not appeal to everyone, but it undeniably turns heads. For those well-heeled few who can afford this and are looking for an easy, stylish and completely left-field city-centric two-wheeler with superb badge value, the CE 02 promises a unique and fun experience.",

    "description": "In the build-up to the Rizta’s launch, Ather had released some very bold advertisements showcasing how big the scooter’s seat would be, featuring a prominent Indian professional wrestler. Naturally, I initially took all of that with a grain of salt, but now that I’ve actually used the Rizta extensively with a pillion aboard, I can confirm this is a really spacious and comfortable seat. Pillions of all shapes and sizes have sat behind me, and even the taller and heftier ones were comfortable. The backrest (standard on the Z variants) also goes some way in keeping the passenger comfortable. The well-padded seat is one of the most spacious units around, backrest keeps the pillion comfy. With just the rider aboard, the Rizta’s ride can feel a little stiff, although it’s never uncomfortable. However, when you’re carrying a passenger, this setup pays dividends and shields you from all but the worst bumps Mumbai has to offer. That said, the Rizta’s suspension is a bit of a double-edged sword, but we’ll come to the bad bits later on. As anyone who has ever ridden with a pillion will tell you, if your vehicle has a less-than-ideal throttle response, it’s going to be unpleasant, especially in stop-and-go traffic, where you need to give minute inputs almost constantly. What I absolutely love about the Rizta is its crisp and direct throttle response, which allows you to modulate the throttle very precisely in stop-and-go traffic without causing any unwanted herky-jerkiness. Accelerator response feels well-tuned in both modes, is precise and direct. What isn’t nice in our pothole-littered city, though, is the stiff front fork. It thuds over every single bump, and the big ones, especially, make their presence felt with a rather rude jolt to the rider’s hands. The 450X-derived front fork is too stiff, which hampers overall comfort over bumps. Another problem is that when you’re making a lock-to-lock U-turn, the Rizta’s handlebar fouls your knees. On a scooter with so much space in most other regards, the lack of it in this area stands out like a sore thumb. Ather has repurposed a lot of what was on the sporty 450 here, which is why these downsides have also transferred over to the Rizta. Lock-to-lock U-turns require taller riders to move their knees out of the way. But in the grand scheme of things, these are two issues I can look past, given how light the Rizta is on my pocket and, otherwise, how well it handles the daily grind in general. And since the Rizta and the 450 are quite closely related under their distinctly different skins, there are also some strong points – like the crisp handling – that I’m thoroughly enjoying.

    "description": "With the BYD Sealion 7, the Chinese brand has truly cemented its position as a high-end EV maker in the Indian marketplace.  Its first two offerings, the e6 (now evolved into the eMax 7) and the Atto 3, took a while to gain traction for various reasons, while the Seal sedan was the first sign that this was a brand intent on upsetting the established order. The Sealion 7 is the Seal’s crossover counterpart, and though the two share some similarities, there are tangible improvements in key areas that give the newer model a much broader appeal. BYD Sealion 7 exterior design 170mm ground clearance For one, it’s an SUV, and that fact in and of itself will endear it to many more buyers, but the more practical consideration is ground clearance, which is now up to 170mm from the Seal’s 145mm.  That aside, though, it’s not a traditional SUV in its proportions, which lean heavily towards the coupe SUV or crossover end of the spectrum.  2.9-metre wheelbase At 4.8 metres long with a 2.9-metre wheelbase, it’s not a small car, but its sloping roof and tightly skinned curves make it appear a lot more compact than it actually is. To these eyes, though it uses an evolved version of the Seal’s design language, dubbed ‘Ocean X’, the proportions aren’t quite as appealing as the sedan’s, particularly its taller nose, which carries a lot of visual bulk. 19- and 20-inch wheels This is offset somewhat by the generous use of contrast black trim, particularly around the large wheel arches that house 19-inch wheels (20-inchers on the AWD version) and a huge diffuser that’s cut into the rear bumper. BYD Sealion 7 interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior design is not as characterful as the Seal’s, with a conventional-looking rectangular central console and a horizontal and flat dashboard, which does at least integrate some interesting ambient lighting elements. 15.6-inch rotating touchscreen The digital driver’s display is incorporated into that flat panel, and making a return is the signature rotating touchscreen, which stretches the tape at 15.6 inches across.  What impresses the most, once again, is the cabin quality and fit and finish, which are truly on par with the best luxury brands and, in certain areas, surpass them. Quality as good as luxury cars There’s soft-touch material on even the lower half of the dashboard, and you have to scratch around the footwell to find a rough plastic bit. Panel fit is tight across the board, save for a few ill-fitting panels on the door, and though pretty straightforward in its design, the cabin is not without a few quirks, like the door ‘handles’, which are more like lift-up flaps.  Comfortable seats with generous cushioning The front seats are supremely comfortable (and ventilated), with a nice mix of firm and soft cushioning in just the right places. The rear seats feature similar cushioning and can be reclined quite significantly, but more significant is the amount of space on offer, particularly legroom, thanks to the long wheelbase. Big glass area gives a spacious feeling You’re seated quite low relative to the window line, but there’s a large glass area that gives a good sense of airiness; window blinds would have helped, though. BYD Sealion 7 features and safety Large fixed glass roof with sunshade Speaking of glass, a huge fixed glass panel stretches the length and width of the roof, but unlike in the Seal, you get a powered roller blind to block out the sun on really hot days. Another small but helpful change is that the AC vents are regular, manually controlled in the Sealion, and not electronically adjusted like in the Seal.   Driver's display is cluttered The screens, as before, are extremely slick with high-resolution graphics; however, the driver’s display features an extremely cluttered layout with far too much information thrown at you, which is distracting. There is a heads-up display, too, and while it’s high in resolution, it, too, places far too much data in your field of view. The touchscreen, thankfully, has an improved UI, but we wish BYD hadn’t stuffed so many basic functions into it. BYD Sealion 7 feature highlights  The Sealion 7 is very well-equipped, with the likes of wireless smartphone integration, a punchy 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered and ventilated front seats, automatic headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, dual-zone climate control, a ventilated wireless phone charger, and more. 11 airbags, Level 2 ADAS On the safety front, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters as well.  There’s also ADAS with Level 2 autonomous driving, one of the clearest 360-degree cameras around, and a driver attention monitor that’s way too sensitive, given the sheer number of distractions in the touchscreen alone. BYD Sealion 7 battery, range and charging Unlike the Seal, the Sealion 7 just gets a single battery option – the larger 82.56kWh pack that uses BYD’s standard-setting Blade Cell LFP technology. Up to 567km range  However, with two powertrain options, there are two sets of range figures as well – 567km (NEDC) for the single-motor version and 542km for the more powerful (and 100kg heavier) dual-motor variant. BYD cars, in our experience, come close to their claimed range figures, and though we weren’t able to do a full range test on this short drive, our mixed driving conditions still yielded an equivalent range of close to 500km on the single-motor version.   7kW wallbox charger provided On a DC fast charger, the battery can be charged at speeds up to an impressive 150kW, while on an AC fast charger, it can do 11kW. But disappointingly, the home wallbox charger BYD supplies maxes out at just 7kW, which is slow for such a large battery. The Sealion 7, like other BYD models, features a vehicle-to-load (VTL) function that lets you charge other devices, such as speakers, electric stoves, lamps and camping gear, off the car’s battery. BYD Sealion 7 driving impressions We were able to spend some time with both versions of the Sealion 7, and there are some clear distinctions in the driving experience.  Dual-motor version makes 530hp The AWD dual-motor version packs a substantial 530hp and 690Nm, allowing for a 0-100kph sprint in just 4.5 seconds, a figure we were able to achieve and verify on our VBOX testing gear. You can feel that performance advantage instantly and in any drive mode, but as you drive it longer, what you appreciate more is how tidily the AWD version puts down its power.  The RWD has ‘only’ 310hp and 380Nm, but in everyday driving, these outputs feel more than ample for a luxury car of this size. Smooth, progressive power delivery At low and medium speeds, both versions serve up a smooth and progressive power delivery, much unlike the flat or spiky shot of acceleration we are used to from most electric cars, which is welcome. However, once you get into triple-digit speeds, while the powertrain itself is silent (no artificially generated sound here), you start to hear more of the outside world, particularly at the rear, as while the front windows are double-glazed for better insulation, the rear ones are not. BYD Sealion 7: Acceleration from restSpeed (kph)Time (seconds)200.81401.60602.38803.291004.50 Not as sporty as the Seal sedan The Sealion 7 makes no pretence of being a sporty handler. Where the low-slung Seal sedan feels sharp and agile going around a corner at speed, the SUV rolls quite a bit, and you instantly feel the weight and higher centre of gravity. This is not a bad thing, of course, as it only serves to elucidate the Sealion’s positioning as a comfortable luxury car and not a sports model, although its ultra-responsive and quick steering is somewhat at odds with this philosophy.   Composed and comfortable ride The ride has a slight firmness to it, something we usually expect from a European car, but on balance, this is better suited to managing the 2.3-tonne mass than an outright soft suspension setup. A slight spoilsport is the wheels, which tend to register a ‘thump’ as they go over bumps – something that’s more pronounced with the 20-inch set that comes on the dual-motor version. 2025 BYD Sealion 7 price and verdict The BYD Sealion 7 is the perfect answer for those buyers who were intrigued by the prospect of the Seal but stayed away because of the ground clearance or sedan form factor.    Reasons to buy a BYD Sealion 7 It brings back what we loved – most notably the plush, well-put-together cabin, which genuinely feels right on par with a European luxury car. BYD’s powertrain expertise shows in the smoothness and sophistication of the power delivery and how keenly the Blade Cell LFP battery clings on to every electron, maximising the range. There’s a lot of tech in the Sealion 7, be it for infotainment, safety or everyday comfort and convenience, and while all of it is useful, we wish some of it was presented in a more user-friendly manner. BYD Sealion 7 price and rivals At a price of Rs 48.90 lakh to Rs 54.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the BYD Sealion 7 confidently wades into the crowded space of electric cars in India, armed with the latest tech and know-how.  Similarly priced crossovers include the BMW iX1 LWB, Kia EV6, Volvo C40 Recharge and Mercedes-Benz EQA, of which the Kia comes closest in size and specs.  BYD’s sales and service network is small compared to these established brands, but it is growing, as is the ready availability of cars. As for the product itself, on first impressions at least, it’s one of the best of its kind at the price, and a premium electric car buyer should definitely have it on their shortlist.

    "description": "The Mahindra XUV700 SUV crossed the 2,50,000 sales mark in January 2025 – within 3.5 years since its launch. Interestingly, diesel has been the preferred fuel choice among the buyers of this Mahindra SUV despite stricter emission norms and the government’s 10-year rule for diesel vehicles in the Delhi-NCR. So far in FY2025, 75 percent of the XUV700s sold had a diesel engine, with petrol accounting for the rest.  In first 10 months of FY2025, 59,073 units of diesel XUV700s were sold For the petrol versions, the tally stands at 19,690 units in the same period In fact, the last 50,000 units of the XUV700 were sold in the six months between August 2024 and January 2025. After the SUV’s August 2021 debut, it had taken a year to reach the 50,000 units mark due to limited production capacity. Currently, almost all XUV 700 variants command a one-month waiting period.

In the same period, the sale of petrol versions rose by 3.4 percent to 19,690 units.  Mahindra XUV700 seats and engine options Mahindra sells the XUV700 in 5- and 7-seat configurations, with several powertrain options. There are 46 variants in total: 22 petrol and 24 diesel. The 2-litre turbocharged petrol engine produces 200hp and a meaty 380Nm of torque. Further, the 2.2-litre diesel engine is available in two different states of tune: 155hp, 360Nm and 185hp, 420Nm. Transmission options, drive types   The engine is paired with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox. The base-spec MX trim is only available with a 6-speed manual, but for all other variants, buyers can choose between either of the two. Mahindra also offers the option of all-wheel drive for the AX7 and AX7L trims. Price, rivals The XUV700 diesel has a wide price range, starting from Rs 14.59 lakh for the base MX manual variant (5-seater) to Rs 25.74 lakh for the AX7 L AWD automatic (7-seater). Considering this, the XUV700 rivals both 5- and 7-seat SUVs, such as the Tata Harrier, Tata Safari, MG Hector Plus and Hyundai Alcazar.
