    "description": "This 1973 Jaguar E-Type Series III roadster is powered by a 5.3-liter V12 linked with a replacement five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. After being sold new in the US, it spent time in Germany before returning to the US in the late-1990s, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2002. The car is finished in Old English White over black leather and features a black soft top, a top boot, four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, 15” knock-off wire wheels, and a JVC stereo. The engine was rebuilt in 2011 and has been fitted with a later-style fuel injection system, and service in preparation for the sale included replacement of the trunk seal, exhaust mounts, tires, and rear radius arm bushings. This Series III E-Type was listed on BaT in June 2024 and is now offered again on dealer consignment with an Oregon title.",

While beauty is decidedly in the eye of the beholder, there’s no debating the Rickman brothers’ performance chops, and not a single item out-of-place on this exceptional 1974 Rickman Kawasaki CR900. In viewing Lot F171 of Mecum’s upcoming Las Vegas 2025 sale, the impact of the retina-searing safety yellow (or green?) paintwork is undeniable. It’s a bold color that feels like it’s just come back into fashion, but it’s correct for the bike and I’ll go out on my first limb of the new year by saying I fucking love it.…",

For Tony Prust at Analog Motorcycles, it’s the mid-2000s—specifically, the Ducati Monster S2R 1000. “I cut my teeth customizing my own 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000, back when I started getting into motorcycle customization,” Tony tells us. “I tailored bits and pieces like belt covers, lowered the dash and headlight, and actually sold some of those modifications to other Monster owners. That bike was also the first one I fully took apart to powder-coat loads of parts.” Tony’s love affair with the Ducati Monster S2R 1000 came full circle when a client asked him to build the ultimate air-cooled Monster.…",

    "description": "Electric cars may already be cheaper than you think – and they're set to get even cheaper. Here's the best of the crop Accessibility has never been associated with electric cars, especially when they first filtered into the mainstream market more than a decade ago.  This was particularly true of smaller electric cars, which were pricey, short on range and too heavy to offer anything for the keen driver. For the everyman, finding an electric supermini or hatchback that offered the same value for money as an ICE one was a challenge.  Fast-forward to 2025 and the small electric car market is far more promising, with a plethora of affordable and efficient EVs that are packed with usable technology and offer a decent range – and, crucially, ensure you’re getting plenty of bang for your buck.  Battery technology has come a long way, too, with more energy-dense packs enabling car makers to strap smaller units to the underside of an EV without compromising on range and efficiency. Where early electric superminis could barely manage 150 miles in the real world, there are plenty on sale today that will cover much longer distances – up to 250 miles in some cases.  The breadth of choice is also varied at the lower end of the EV market, with brands like Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën competing with upcoming rivals from China, the latter of which typically offered with a lower list price than their European counterparts.  And while most diminutive EVs are built to maximise range and comfort, there are a few that are tipped towards the keen drivers among us. But which small electric car should be buy? We’ve tested each and every one and here is our rundown of the very best.",

    "description": "Sixth-generation executive saloon and estate ramp up the luxury and tech The new car market is changing faster than ever, but that doesn't mean some things can't say the same - and the Mercedes E-Class is a case in point. Despite years of progress, the big German's underlying receipe of quality, comfort, space and refinement remains largely untouched. This then is new ‘W214’ E-Class, which is the latest iteration of one of the oldest model lines from one of the oldest car manufacturers. By Mercedes-Benz’s own count, it is the 10th generation of a largely unbroken lineage going back to 1947.Despite being very keen to refer to its heritage (and why wouldn’t it be?), Mercedes isn’t a particularly nostalgic company. It has come up with radical designs, such as the original A-Class and Smart City Coupé, while its electric cars are really exploiting the aerodynamics and design possibilities that an EV offers. Unlike with the BMW i5 and 5 Series, Mercedes is choosing to keep the electric Mercedes EQE and combustion-engined E-Class apart. According to the literature, the new E-Class needs to balance tradition with modernity and ‘build a bridge’ between traditional exec saloons and the tech-filled EVs of the future. Plenty of buyers are not ready for their car to be a smartphone on wheels, so that mission could well strike a chord. To find out whether the E-Class might succeed, we've road tested an E220d saloon, though we've also driven the E300e and both the E220d and E450d EstatesThe range at a glanceModelsPowerE200201bhpE220d194bhpE300e308bhpE300de308bhpE450d 4Matic362bhpMercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid 4Matic+577bhpThe E-Class offers a very wide range of powertrains, including a four-cylinder petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid, a six-cylinder diesel with four-wheel drive and uniquely for Mercedes, a diesel plug-in hybrid. Topping the range for the time being is the E53 AMG, with a plug-in hybrid six-cylinder. In other regions, there's an E450 petrol as well, but that is not offered in the UK for the time being - and is unlikely to make an appearance over here anytime soon.Apart from the top-rung Exclusive Edition, all trim levels are all AMG Line of some sort, with Advanced, Premium and Premium Plus packs tacked on for the more expensive versions.",

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.

    "description": "Honda 0 Series prototypes, an SUV and a sedan, were showcased at the 2025 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, United States. These models are the first of seven EVs built on an all-new platform. Both will be launched in North America next year before arriving in other markets such as Europe. A 0 Series compact sedan is also due by 2030 New Honda EVs will get Level 3 ADAS suite 0 Series platform uses a thin battery for more interior room Honda 0 Series SUV The SUV is based on the Space Hub concept that Honda showed at CES last year. The prototype SUV appears slightly shorter than the sedan, with an upright design for the windscreen aimed at maximising interior space. However, its squared-off rear section looks MPV-inspired. Honda has yet to disclose its technical specifications.  Honda 0 Series sedan The Japanese automaker previewed the 0 sedan as a concept during the 2024 CES event. The latest prototype looks identical to that concept in both exterior and interior designs. Honda claims these EVs’ platform houses an around 8mm thinner battery than rivals for improved interior room. The 0 Series sedan will source power from an 80-90kWh NMC battery with an estimated range of over 482km. A larger battery pack, likely to be 100kWh, will also be offered.  Honda 0 Series ASIMO OS, Level 3 ADAS The company also announced that it has developed ASIMO OS, which will be responsible for all the key vehicle systems in 0 Series models. ASIMO is a nod to the humanoid robot that Honda introduced in 2000. The OS will manage ECUs for vehicle systems, such as autonomous driving, driver aids and in-car infotainment, and support over-the-air (OTA) updates. The Japanese brand claims that the 0 Series EVs will be Level 3 ADAS-enabled, allowing the driver to take their hands off the wheel in certain situations. Overseas, Honda previously had a model called Legend, which featured a Level 3 ADAS suite. Honda 0 Series powertrain All 0 Series models will be offered with RWD and AWD powertrains, which will use new compact e-axle motors. Entry-level variants will get a 244hp motor on the rear axle. Initially, top-end versions will offer a combined power output of around 488hp. Also, see: Skoda Enyaq facelift revealed Mahindra BE 6 top variant priced at Rs 26.90 lakh",

I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.
