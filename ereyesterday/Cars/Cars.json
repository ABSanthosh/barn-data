    "description": "This 881 mo 2021 Ferrari SF90 Stradale was delivered new by Ferrari of Houston, Texas, and was previously sold on BaT in May 2024. It is finished in Grigio Ferro with a Nero roof as well as a Giallo Modena nose accent and Argento Nurburgring stripe, while the cockpit houses carbon-fiber racing seats trimmed in black leather with yellow accents. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and a trio of electric motors that drive all four wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The Assetto Fiorano package was specified from the factory and added motorsport-derived Multimatic shocks, titanium springs, a titanium exhaust system, and carbon-fiber door and underbody panels for a weight savings of approximately 66 pounds. The car rides on 20″ forged wheels and is further equipped with a Formula 1–inspired drag-reduction system as well as a regenerative braking system with yellow-finished calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. Additional details include a carbon-fiber front spoiler and rear diffuser, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and black ceramic exhaust pipes along with a 7.9-kWh lithium-ion battery, an adaptive front lighting system, and an advanced front driving camera. Acquired by the selling dealer in August 2024, this SF90 Stradale is now offered with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title in the seller’s name.",

Faster. Louder.” But there is a motorcycle that rebels against the seductive power of speed and the Botticellian curves of our two-wheeled Freudian steeds: the Rokon Trail-Breaker, the antithesis of all that we’ve decided the essence of a motorcycle should be. Rokon is the second-oldest continually operating motorcycle company in the U.S., and the bikes they produce today look remarkably like the prototype developed in 1958. For the uninitiated, the Trail-Breaker, Rokon’s original and best-selling model, is a two-wheel-drive mule of a bike.…",

Triumph Daytona 500 by Kott Motorcycles Dustin Kott is no stranger to these pages, with a long list of satisfied clients aboard his custom café racers. But when he received an invite to exhibit a bike at the 15th running of the Born Free show, he decided to build something a little different from his usual fare. After building a Triumph 500 café racer a while back, Dustin had some ideas churning around in his head. Using another air-cooled Triumph Daytona twin from 1969, Dustin settled on a hard-tailed, board-track-inspired bobber to showcase his long list of skills.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advertising-promotions-promoted-by-skoda/all-new-skoda-superb-why-its-great-company-car",
    "description": "Here’s how Skoda’s most iconic vehicle hits the mark for user-choosers, salary-sacrifice drivers and fleet managers A company car should offer the best of all worlds, but not many do. That’s where the all-new Skoda Superb lives up to its name.  It’s cost-effective to own and run. It’s spacious and adaptable for work and play – especially the estate. It looks stunning, and its stylish comfortable interior is packed with a host of advanced tech to make journeys easier and safer. But any discerning driver or fleet manager probably wants to know a bit more than that. So, here’s how the exceptional all-new Superb hits all the right notes.  Learn more about the all-new Skoda Superb Impressively low plug-in hybrid running costs The Superb’s plug-in hybrid powertrain has been significantly updated for 2024. It blends ultra-efficient petrol performance from its 150 PS 1.5 TSI engine with a state-of-the-art electric motor and a large-capacity 25.7kWh battery. The result? Up to 204 PS and up to 84 miles (WLTP) of cost-efficient electric-only range – easily enough for everyday local journeys.  Back to that battery briefly, because it really is worth a closer look. DC-charging ready, it can be recharged to 80% in as little as 25 minutes at a fast-charging station, unlocking greater practicality than many current plug-in hybrid powertrains. For drivers who prefer to charge at home – or fleet managers with an eye on the costs of public charging – that can translate to a 2.5-hour charge using an 11kW home charger. On the right tariff (9p/kWh), drivers could pay as little as £2.30 per full charge. What’s not to like about that?  On longer journeys, the electric motor works with the petrol engine to deliver impressive long-range fuel efficiency – with the ability to top-up the battery or the fuel tank when you need to go the extra mile. This leads to attractive benefit-in-kind (BiK) rates of just 5% for 2024/25. In layman’s terms, this means drivers pay less company car tax than they would for, say, a traditional petrol or diesel car.  Not only does that mean overheads can be kept to a minimum – it means it’s also even more compelling to spec a higher-level trim. Prefer traditional powertrains? Not to worry. The all-new Superb has petrol, mild-hybrid and diesel engine options, including a high-performance 2.0 TSI that delivers 265 PS and offers all-wheel drive. Sleek style, and loads of adaptable space Space is the ultimate luxury, and the Superb – available as a sleek but spacious hatchback, or an even more generously proportioned estate – is ideal for company car drivers.  “The Skoda Superb is cavernous inside,” Autocar said in its 4.5-star review. “A voluminous boot has always been front and centre of the Skoda Superb’s appeal. It’s no different this time.” Now 40mm longer than its predecessor, the Superb estate offers 690 litres of luggage space or 1,920 litres with the rear seats down. As Autocar said in its 4.5-star review, it’s incredibly easy to use and adaptable: “There’s a storage cubby to the left, latches to drop the rear seats, Velcro barriers to secure loads, and an electric load-bay cover. If you want the best estate boot in the business, there’s a strong chance this is it.” Equally, the Superb hatchback offers up to 645 litres of luggage space – an increase of 20 litres. “The Skoda Superb hatchback impresses for boot space, too,” Autocar said. “It’s significantly more than the Peugeot 405 hatch, which only offers 487 litres. There’s room for large suitcases and golf clubs, and you get the same storage compartments as the Skoda Superb Estate. The wide aperture makes lifting luggage inside a little easier.”  Passengers are just as well accommodated. “The Skoda Superb’s front seats are spacious and comfortable,” Autocar said. “There’s credibility to Skoda’s claims of more rear cabin space, too. Those rear seats offer large amounts of legroom and headroom.” There’s also a central rear armrest that incorporates a phone or tablet holder – helpful for any passengers who might need to finish off work on the go. Streamlined style made simple and sustainable Whether you choose the hatchback or estate, the all-new Superb is unmistakable thanks to its distinctive exterior detailing, including the octagonal grille and optional LED Matrix headlights. A new ‘Unique Dark Chrome’ finish adds extra premium style, while its sleek profile and steeply raked windscreen make it the most aerodynamic estate in Skoda’s history – by a whopping 15% – with a drag coefficient of just 0.25. The hatchback moves even more graciously, at 0.23. Inside, a Design Selections philosophy – brought over from the fully electric Skoda Enyaq – allows for coordinated colours and material themes. Many textiles contain recycled materials, while the cognac-coloured leather is tanned in a more environmentally friendly way – using water from olive oil production. There’s also the Laurin \u0026 Klement trim which, with all of its added styling touches and features, adds a real sense of VIP to every drive. Smart and intuitive connected tech  The all-new Superb also takes tech to new heights with a comprehensive suite of smart connectivity features. The large, free-standing 13” central touchscreen and 10” Virtual Cockpit feature a new, more intuitive user interface – that blends always-online Skoda Connect for live traffic and navigation with smartphone apps through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and AI-enhanced voice commands.  You can add a head-up display, while the MySkoda app allows for remote route planning and vehicle locking and unlocking. There are also USB sockets to power devices, and the optional Phone Box offers wireless fast charging for smartphones while preventing overheating.  The multi-functional Smart Dials in the centre console offer a smarter, more intuitive and reassuringly physical way to fine-tune vehicle controls. These customisable dials blend push functionality with digital displays and haptic feedback, alongside additional buttons for windscreen defogging and rear window heating. Driving aids that lend a helping hand Whether you’re a company car driver or a fleet manager, safety is paramount. Behind the wheel, you want to keep yourself and your passengers safe. If you’re a fleet manager, you’ve got a duty of care. It’s why the all-new Superb offers a wealth of advanced driving aids that lend a helping hand – and an extra pair of eyes – taking the stress out of driving while making journeys easier and safer. Powerful, state-of-the-art sensors mean Turn Assist can help you avoid accidents at junctions, and Crossroad Assist helps you exit roads with limited visibility more safely. Exit Warning alerts you to other road users when opening any doors, while Front Assist has been optimised to recognise cyclists, and the rear-facing, enhanced Side Assist looks further behind for passing traffic. Similarly, Travel Assist gives an even clearer view of nearby vehicles in the Virtual Cockpit, and the Assisted Drive package completes the safety offering with Adaptive Lane Assist, Predictive Adaptive Cruise Control, Traffic Sign Recognition, Intelligent Speed Assist, and Attention and Drowsiness Assist Finally, on reaching your destination, the all-new Superb’s Intelligent Park Assist function can automatically park your car in a suitably sized space, or Remote Parking allows you to park using the MySkoda App. The new Trained Parking will even remember and repeat previous parking manoeuvres at regular destinations, like your home or work. Perfect for fleet managers So, those are all the reasons why the all-new Superb could be the ideal company car for those behind the wheel. But what if you’re a fleet manager or business owner? Well, in addition to safe driving, you want low leasing costs, comprehensive warranty cover, and low servicing and maintenance costs.  The all-new Superb delivers in each and every area. Strong residual values help to keep down leasing costs, and the standard three-year warranty covers the length of most leasing agreements – and can be extended up to five years if needed.  With 131 retailers and service centres across the UK, you and your drivers are never far from help if you need it.  Learn more about the all-new Skoda Superb",

    "description": "Facelift includes new screens, upgraded centre console and a reworked front end Vauxhall has upgraded the interior of its Mokka as part of a light update to keep it competitive against a host of new rivals in the segment. The crossover – sold in ICE and EV forms – is the British brand’s second-best-seller behind the stalwart Corsa, but sales have dropped by nearly a third over the past year. As such, the Mokka gets a fresh interior, including a reworked centre console, a new 10in digital driver’s display and a 10in infotainment screen. The upgraded infotainment system features voice recognition, wireless smartphone mirroring and a 180deg rear-view camera. In pursuit of a cleaner cabin design, some physical buttons have been removed and are now integrated within the screen. These include touchscreen shortcuts (such as maps and audio), and driving and parking aids. In addition, Vauxhall has fitted the crossover with a new flat-bottom steering wheel that is similar in design to its Astra sibling.  Vauxhall has also slightly reworked the exterior design of the car. At the front, a new cut line below the blacked-out Vizor grille has been added – a design cue adopted from the new Frontera. It also gets a new LED signature at the front and back. As part of the facelift, Vauxhall now offers the Mokka in only three trims and two powertrains. The latter is either the 156bhp, 54kWh Mokka Electric or the 136bhp, 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol Mokka Hybrid. Pricing will be revealed next month.",

Especially if you’ve never driven, or navigated, on its epic route that spans over 8,500 miles – which crosses some of the world’s toughest terrain... Katarina Kyvalova is no ordinary racing driver.  It was fitting that someone who made their racing debut in a 24-hour event in a pre-war Bentley should get her first taste of the Prodrive Peking to Paris in a wild, first-of-its-kind restomod from British racing and rallying legends Prodrive, based – of all things – on a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback donor car. A regular in historic motorsports, usually seen racing a 4.5-liter Bentley, a Cooper Jaguar or a Jaguar E-Type, Katarina took a huge leap out of her comfort zone by signing up for one of the most gruelling and prestigious endurance rallies in the world before the global health pandemic of 2020. She finally got to compete in the 2024 edition of this quite unique event, that was first held way back in 1907. Continue...",

    "description": "The Pulsar 125, in its Classic guise, continues to be a massive seller for Bajaj, but the company needed something fresh and youthful to address the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R. After all, those two have carved out a new segment of about 50,000-60,000 sales per month. The N125 is Bajaj’s answer, and the interesting thing is that it has nothing to do with any other Pulsar before it. Bajaj Pulsar N125 design, colours, quality  Bajaj wanted to make a 125 that weighed 125 kilos (which is nearly 20kg less than the existing 125cc Pulsar models), and that necessitated an entirely new platform. The N125 also carries a new design language, and it’s great to see that this isn’t just another Pulsar wearing a familiar set of clothes. Plenty of floating panels all over and a rather un-Pulsar-like headlamp bring freshness to the design philosophy. But there’s also familiarity in elements like the shape of the tank extensions as well as the new take on the twin-slash brake lamps.  While so much aero-inspired bodywork on a tiny 125 is almost purely for aesthetics, the vents on the front mudguard shroud are actually functional. The story goes that the initial design did not have any vents, but the engine development team complained to the design department that their air-cooled engine wasn’t getting enough flow, which is why the vents were incorporated.  There are some unusual touches, like the body panel along the side of the subframe. We’re used to seeing this kind of bodywork at the tail section on most motorcycles, but it finds itself positioned between the rider and pillion seat on the N125. This has the effect of adding mass to the design but also keeps the tail quite slim. The fat fork shrouds do a good job of masking the skinny 30mm telescopic fork, but while they certainly give the bike more presence, some may find them to be excessively wide. Quality levels are decent, but some visible panel gaps on our bike do leave room for improvement. In all, the N125 has a striking design that will be a little polarising yet also easily identifiable, especially in the funky colour schemes Bajaj has gone with. It doesn’t have the same ‘big-bike’ look as the Hero Xtreme 125R, but it certainly stands out, and that’s a good thing. Bajaj Pulsar N125 ride and handling The seating position is more or less what you’d expect from a bike like this. At 795mm, the seat height isn’t the lowest in the class, but it’s still very manageable, and the seats are spacious and comfortable. The footpeg placement is a little sporty, which goes well with a bike like this. However, the narrow handlebar felt a bit too ‘commutery’, which slightly dilutes the special feeling a bike like this should have.  Happily, the new chassis makes up for this in its sheer lightness and behaviour. 125kg is nearly on par with the TVS Raider, and just like that bike, the N125 has a delightfully nimble, easy-going character without any nervousness. Bajaj let us experience this on a go-kart track, and the N125 was genuinely good fun, displaying an eagerness to change direction and lean over. The footpeg placement enabled plenty of cornering clearance without any scraping, and the bike never displayed any fidgety moments you might expect with a very light machine. The MRF tyres were nice and grippy in this situation as well, and the only thing I’d have liked was a bit more initial sharpness in the front brake. Bajaj Pulsar N125 engine refinement, mileage Nevertheless, the N125’s dynamics will translate into an enjoyable experience on densely packed city roads. Going nicely with this is a very light clutch effort, which they say is 50 percent less than the competition. With 12hp, the new engine is the most powerful in the segment alongside the NS125, but this bike has a much better power-to-weight ratio of nearly 100hp/tonne. More importantly, the engine is smooth and tractable, and it makes a nice sound as well. While the strong acceleration only arrives at quite high revs, the engine can also pull you along in third gear (out of 5) as low as 20kph, which is crucial in a city bike like this.  Refinement is excellent, but I noticed that the motor would stall if the revs got too low without any of the typical warning signs (like a juddering sound or feel) that come when an engine’s revs get too low. This isn’t really an issue on its own, but the problem arises in that the N125 doesn’t have a gear position indicator or even a rev counter. With its tractable nature, you will often find yourself riding around at rather low revs in heavy traffic, and that’s when these stalls can catch you out, so it’s something you’ll need to learn to work around. Bajaj claims a 0-60kph time of 6 seconds and a top speed of 97kph, although you’ll see over 110kph on the display. The bike hits about 80kph quickly, and overall performance feels up to the mark of the best in the segment. The company also claims an overall fuel efficiency of about 60kpl. Bajaj Pulsar N125 price, features and verdict One of the big success factors with bikes like the Raider and Xtreme 125R is that they offer the looks and feature set of bigger 150-200cc machines. When it comes to the latter, the Pulsar N125 isn’t quite up there with its rivals. On the one hand, it has a front disc brake and LED head/tail lamps as standard, while the top model gets Bluetooth connectivity and a silent start/start-stop system. But then it misses important things like a rev counter, gear position indicator or single-channel ABS – although Bajaj says it will introduce the latter if there’s demand. While the Pulsar N125 probably won’t sway buyers with segment-leading features, it has most of the essential fundamentals in place, the key among them being the price. At Rs 95,000 for the base model and 98,000 for the top model, it is more affordable than a similarly specced Raider and on par with the Hero Xtreme 125R. As of now, we can’t confirm whether it’s the best in its segment, but the new Pulsar N125 definitely has a fighting chance.  Also See: Bajaj Pulsar N125 video review",

    "description": "I’ve always had a soft spot for Mercedes-Benz. The sheer luxury they offer simply bowls me over. While hardcore performance cars are often what I usually find myself behind the wheel of, every now and then, it is nice to sink back into the lap of luxury. And that’s been the case with the Mercedes-Benz GLC 220d in our long-term fleet. It was my daily driver for a few weeks, and I must say it always put a smile on my face each time I walked up to it to start my long commute to the office. I really like the styling of the GLC, which is just right and not over-the-top; it looks smart and has a good road presence, too. What I like even more, though, are the interiors. The inside complements the exterior perfectly, beginning with a neat and smart dashboard. However, I have to mention that for an otherwise minimalist cabin during the day, I found the ambient lighting a bit overwhelming with all sorts of colours on the dashboard and around the cabin. Thankfully, it can be toned down to a single colour or the brightness can be reduced. While there have been mixed opinions about it among my colleagues, I personally like the pinstripe pattern, which goes well with the matte dark wood insert on the dash. Active brake-assist activates after every ignition cycle. I also like the large 11.9-inch touchscreen, which is conveniently placed with a slight tilt towards the driver, making it more driver-centric. I also like the fact that most controls are integrated into the central touchscreen, along with a single bar of buttons for quick access to driving modes, park-assist, hazard lights, and volume controls. It sure looks neat, but feels loose when used. Something that I am really particular about in cars is the seats, especially the driver’s, as that’s where I spend most of my time. I must say that the GLC’s front seats were perfect for me. The cushioning is on the firm side, but I really like the side bolstering, which offers great support. I also found the brown leather seats perfectly suited for everyday use, without having to worry about them getting stained or dirty easily. What I found very useful was the seat memory feature, which allowed me to store the seat position, steering reach/rake, and wing mirror position every time I had to swap cars with my colleagues. Another aspect I really appreciated was the Burmester audio system, which delivered top-notch, crisp audio quality. Also worth mentioning are the side footboards, which made it easier to get in and out of the GLC. Burmester audio system delivers crisp sound quality. Another feature that is very helpful is the 360-degree camera, which also offers a simulated under-bonnet view using the front camera. What’s even more interesting is the GPS-activated 360-degree camera, which begins to relay a feed as soon as the GLC arrives at a saved GPS location. This is convenient if your parking spot is in a tight space. One oddity I did notice is that Google Maps via Apple CarPlay is projected on the whole screen, while when using Android Auto, it shows up on only half the screen. The GLC proved to be a perfect mile-muncher as it offered an estimated range of over 800km on a tank of diesel. This made it a go-to choice for long road trips for me, and I enjoyed the way it drives. There’s a healthy dose of torque, and the tall gearing means the GLC 220d was happily stretching its legs on highways. The 9-speed torque converter gearbox worked seamlessly and was fun to toggle between gears via the paddle shifters every once in a while for some enthusiastic driving. I found the suspension to be on the firm side, but it was never uncomfortable. The chunky 55-profile tyres were a boon on bad roads, providing extra cushioning where needed. 55-section tyres add a layer of cushioning to the firm ride. The GLC is equipped with Level 1 ADAS, which includes lane-keep assist and active brake assist. While these features are good for safety on highways, I found the active brake assist too intrusive and sensitive for our cities. Annoyingly, every time I turned it off via the settings, it would come back on with each ignition cycle. But these grouses aside, the GLC is really a well-sorted package and I had a comfortable time using it as my daily driver to work and on some enjoyable drives out of town. It is headed back to Mercedes now, and while I am a bit sad to see it go, on a greener note, we’ve got the Mercedes EQE SUV in the long-term fleet. More on it soon!  Cluster of buttons is very handy but feels loose to touch.

    "description": "Contrary to the Mini in its name, the Countryman is a large, four-door, spacious crossover squarely aimed at family buyers. Now in its third generation, it has undergone some revolutionary changes, and for the first time ever, it’ll be sold with an electric heart, along with the ICE versions. For India, though, Mini has only introduced the Countryman EV as an import, which, due to its single-motor, front-wheel drive setup, is priced rather competitively at Rs 55 lakh.  But India’s entry-level luxury EV segment is quite populated, by electric car standards at least. It includes the BYD Seal and Hyundai Ioniq 5 at one end – priced sub-Rs 50 lakh – and the Mercedes-Benz EQA (Rs 66 lakh) and BMW iX1 (Rs 67 lakh) on the other end. So, how does the new Mini Countryman EV stack up? 2024 Mini Countryman: design With dimensions larger than a Jeep Compass, this new Countryman can be termed as anything but small. Think Mini, and you’d visualise a compact hatchback. However, with dimensions larger than a Jeep Compass, this new Countryman can be termed as anything but small. Despite its size, a curvy design language and smooth body lines devoid of cuts or creases make it appear chic and urbane rather than brawny and intimidating. Executed with undeniable panache is the matte champagne-coloured garnishing around its closed-off front grille and on the C-Pillar and the front, side and rear skid plates. Even the Mini logos and the Countryman badge are finished in this shade. Cool-looking 19-inch alloys are a part of the optional Favoured Pack. Our test car was fitted with optional 19-inch alloys sporting the champagne scheme, although 17-inch alloys come as standard. A wraparound glass area and a blackened roof mask the Countryman EV’s height well, lending it a wagon-like silhouette. Adding to its feel-good factor are the (optional) LED DRL eyebrows and matrix LED tail-lamps that have a customisable light show upon locking or unlocking. 2024 Mini Countryman: interior, features Like Minis of yore, its cabin is minimalistic with a circular theme. Like yesteryear Minis, the Countryman EV’s cabin has a minimalistic theme with circular elements. The centre of attraction is a 9.4-inch circular OLED touchscreen, which is exceptional in terms of its usability and responsiveness, and its clarity is second to none. Furthermore, fun themes, funky animations and musical notifications will most certainly make you smile while operating it. This screen also doubles up as the speedometer and driver display, which is inconvenient to read on the move. You could consider opting for the Favoured Pack, which gets you a head-up display (HUD) bundled with several other extras, for an additional Rs 4.60 lakh. And while the HUD does make it convenient to read the speed, the unit is simply too basic, especially when compared to the ones available in hatchbacks at a fraction of this Mini’s cost. Albeit basic, its useful HUD is an option worth considering. The dashboard is replete with fabric made out of recycled materials. However, its open-pore texture might not be ideal for our dusty conditions. It is finished in blue and neatly fades into a shade of brown towards the rear half of the car; the seats are also brown. The champagne-coloured theme is carried over on the inside and is the most prominent around the air vents and on the vertical door handles. Optional JCW driver’s seat is too sculpted and firm for comfort. The optional JCW Sport driver’s seat on our test car is too sculpted and firm for comfort; hence, it is an option we recommend you uncheck. It has a seat massaging function, though. Things are a bit better at the rear. Space is adequate, the backrest reclines, and even though the floor height is raised and you’re seated in a knees-up position, it is still quite comfortable. Also, accommodating a third passenger is possible due to a flat floor and a broad seat. Seating position is a bit knees-up at rear, but overall, seat is comfy. Being the more practical Mini, the Countryman has an abundance of storage areas; the central console shelf and door pockets are huge, and even its 460-litre boot is large. Sadly, it isn’t equipped with a spare tyre beneath the floor. Fantastic OLED touchscreen is among the best out there. As far as its equipment goes, the Mini gets the aforementioned OLED touchscreen, LED lights, 17-inch alloys, rear-view camera and panoramic sunroof, among others. Customisable LED lights, electrically operable boot and drive modes are some of the optional extras bundled in the Classic Trim, which costs Rs 2 lakh more. In addition, buyers who want a head-up display, JCW Sport seats, 19-inch alloys and a Harman Kardon sound system will need to opt for the earlier-mentioned Favoured Pack. However, this Mini still misses ventilated seats, a 360-degree camera, side and curtain airbags, and adjustable regen via steering-mounted paddle shifters. 2024 Mini Countryman: powertrain, performance The talking point of this EV is its 66.45kWh (gross capacity) battery, which it shares with its platform-mate, the BMW iX1. But unlike its BMW cousin, which uses a twin-motor setup, the Mini makes do with a single-motor, front-wheel-drive setup. And while its motor makes 204hp, its 250Nm torque output doesn’t impress, especially when compared to turbo-petrol cars available at half its price. There’s no storage area beneath its bonnet. But then factor in the instantaneous responsiveness of its motor, and you never yearn for more pep while ambling around town or when driving in a leisurely manner, which is how most owners would drive their Countryman EV. Demand more out of it, though, and its torque curve flattens quickly. The Countryman’s outright performance is lacklustre, and it doesn’t feel as effortless as its rivals. To put its acceleration into perspective, the Mini will sprint from 0-100kph in 8.6 seconds (claimed), slower than a similarly priced Volvo XC40 Recharge front-wheel drive’s 7.3 seconds or a Hyundai Ioniq 5’s 7.5 seconds. Although adequate, its performance feels muted compared to its rivals. Interestingly, the Mini features ‘Iconic Sounds’, which gives drivers the option to play synthesised motor sounds via the speakers. These sounds are loudest in the Go-Kart mode, wherein it’ll also emit its own version of ‘pops and bangs’ when you lift off the accelerator pedal. These certainly liven up the drive experience and add a degree of fun to the otherwise quiet and drama-free EV experience. 2024 Mini Countryman: ride, handling Its Mini-ness is evident when you find yourself on a winding section of a road. The Mini-ness of the Countryman EV becomes evident when you find yourself on a winding section of a road. Its sharp steering and pointy front end make it feel very agile, and despite its size, it still handles in a ‘go-kart-like’ manner. Ride quality isn’t harsh or jarring per se, but you hear each and every ‘thud’ and ‘thwack’ while driving on our less-than-perfect roads on account of a noisy suspension that’s further exacerbated by its upsized, optional 19-inch wheels. The suspension noise seriously hampers the driving experience, coaxing you to drive with more caution than what the Countryman EV can actually handle. 2024 Mini Countryman: verdict It’s hard not to be enamoured by the charming new Mini Countryman. Besides oozing character, it carries forward the traditional go-kart-like driving mannerisms associated with Minis, all while being spacious and practical. But the Countryman EV’s proposition isn’t complete – rivals are more comfortable, offer better performance and provide more equipment. So, like other Minis, even this ‘practical’ Countryman is purely an emotional purchase, and if you decide to take the plunge, be rest assured that it’s a car that’ll make you smile every time you’re behind the wheel.

    "description": "After sighting the bike on test, Bajaj has finally launched the Pulsar N125 at Rs 94,707 for the base variant and Rs 98,707 for the Bluetooth variant. Bluetooth variant gets more features 198mm ground clearance available Available in seven colours The Pulsar N125 is Bajaj’s fifth motorcycle in this displacement range and it's powered by an all-new air-cooled, 124.58cc, single-cylinder motor. This new mill is rated for 12hp at 8,500rpm and 11Nm of torque at 6,000rpm. As is par for the course, this engine is mated to a 5-speed gearbox. Underpinnings are also commensurate for this class with a simple, single-cradle frame that's suspended by a telescopic fork and monoshock. A 240mm front disc brake and a 130mm rear drum brake handle stopping duties, aided by CBS (Hero’s Xtreme 125R is the only one to offer ABS in this class).  Tyre sizes differ based on the variant you decide upon. The front hoop is sized 80/100-17 on both but at the rear, you get a thinner 100/90-17 tyre on the base, while on the Bluetooth variant you get a 110/80-17 tyre. Like the popular TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R, the Bajaj Pulsar N125 has a sharp and striking design language, and the bright paint options accentuate it. The base N125 variant can be had in four colours – white, black, red and blue – while the Bluetooth variant comes in three dual-tone options – black/red, black/yellow and black/purple. Just like the other two, the N125 also has a split seat configuration, although its setup is more like the Raider than the Xtreme; its pillion seat isn’t much higher than the rider’s perch.  Where Bajaj has gone down its own path with the Pulsar N125 compared to the Hero Xtreme 125R and the TVS Raider is by giving it plastic fork shrouds to beef up the front end. With its 9.5-litre tank fully fuelled, the Pulsar N125 weighs 125kg and has a seat height of 795mm. What stands out though is the ADV-esque 198mm of ground clearance, despite the underbelly exhaust. Coming to the features, there is a new LED headlight, flanked by colour-coded plastic pieces. Depending on the variant you choose, you get basic Bluetooth baked into the LCD display. The Bluetooth variant also has a larger dash, a silent starter as well as the aforementioned fatter rear tyre. With its N125, Bajaj is squarely aiming at the TVS Raider and the Hero Xtreme 125R, and we hope to bring you a comparison between these three sporty Indian commuters soon.

    "description": "The Karizma XMR came onto the scene not too long ago, but it seems Hero is readying an updated version of the bike with some design tweaks and a fundamental change to its underpinnings.  USD fork replaces the telescopic unit Small changes to fairing, fuel tank While the overall design of the Hero Karizma XMR will likely remain pretty much unchanged, there will be a few nuanced differences. The fairing has seen a few revisions, and the cutout at the bottom of the fairing near the engine’s sump has now been removed. There are also some changes to the tank’s design, with the main fairing now merging directly into the fuel tank now.  The plastic panel under the rider’s seat has also been restyled, and now less of the main frame is visible in that region. The mirror stalks, too, have been redesigned and now, the lenses stick out more, which should improve rear visibility on the Karizma.  The one mechanical change that can be observed is the presence of a USD fork, which replaces the conventional telescopic fork on the current bike. While the telescopic fork on the current Karizma XMR works perfectly fine, its arch-rival, the Yamaha R15 V4, is being offered with a snazzy-looking golden USD fork. For Indian buyers shopping in the small sportbike category, a USD fork equates to a more premium feeling, which is perhaps why Hero might be rolling out this change to its sportbike, either via a higher-spec variant or by only offering it with a USD fork.  Then there is also the possibility of Hero shoehorning its much-awaited 250cc liquid-cooled motor into the Karizma. Hero had showcased the XTunt 2.5R concept last year at EICMA, which previewed a 250cc naked bike and it could be this same engine at the heart of the updated Karizma.  With EICMA 2024 just round the corner, we won’t have to wait too long to find this out.  Also See: Hero Karizma XMR vs Yamaha R15 V4 comparison review: Dream catchers",

    "description": "Luxury imports from Germany have historically not been synonymous with affordability and there appears to be no danger of that changing. Audi has announced pricing for the RS6 Avant GT, with the model looking like it’ll become a bauble for the kind of people that probably already have something like it in the garage. The model is effectively the super-premium version of the RS6, which is already a sported-up version of the A6/S6, and carries an MSRP of $198,900 before you’ve factored in destination fees or dealer markups.",
