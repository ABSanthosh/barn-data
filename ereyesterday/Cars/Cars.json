    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/genesis-self-propelled-buses-and-vans",
    "description": "Petrol power might have quickly won over the market but it was steam that first powered buses and vans It would be reasonable to assume that motorised commercial vehicles came some time later than cars, considering how puny the very first cars were. Take the Benz Viktoria of 1893, for instance: its single cylinder put out just 3hp. But you would be dead wrong: that very car was used to create the first combustion-engined bus in 1895 – the year of this magazine’s foundation – and shortly afterwards the first combustion-engined van. And we can go back even further, all the way to the 1830s, when the first steam-powered buses were tried (at about 12mph) in London. “It is evident that steam and petroleum vans are coming into more and more extensive use, and a large number of orders for them are being given out,” commented Autocar no fewer than 129 years ago. “Tradespeople understand the value of these vehicles, not only for the speedy and economical delivery of goods, but also as an advertisement.” We were reporting the news that a big department store in Paris, Grands Magasins du Louvre, had taken a petrol-engined Peugeot parcel van on trial, to see whether such vehicles might be more economical to run than its 200 carts and 500 horses – which were extremely expensive. Just two months later, we relayed: “The vehicle weighs [610kg] in running order and will carry a load of [480kg] at a speed of 9mph. It is in continuous use from 8am to 7pm. Were it horsed, the teams would have to be changed every four hours.” It’s no surprise, then, that within  a year of these petrol vans being in operation, the price of a Louvre delivery had fallen from 70c to 7c. Another major advantage was that the removal of horses halved a vehicle’s length, in theory doubling a city’s traffic capacity. Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at the magazineshop.com “The streets in Paris are for the most part very narrow, and vans and buses take up so much space that the whole traffic is often at a standstill until these ungainly vehicles can extricate themselves. This would be certainly avoided if the traffic were much faster,” we noted. Boiler power had started the race in pole position but fallen at the first hurdle, we explained: “Serpollet’s steam vans, constructed for [Paris clothes shop] La Belle Jardinière, were among the first to be used for the delivery of goods. [However] the machinery occupied at least one-third of the vehicle, so that a great deal of valuable space had to be sacrificed – a matter of great importance to users who have to deliver enormous quantities of goods during the course of the day.” Electric vans were also being developed, but it was found with disappointment that they could do only around 40 miles per charge. Several steam buses were also operational in France. So novel and useful were they that Brits would book tours on them with travel agent Thomas Cook. But again, there was the limitation of the mechanicals taking up much of the available space – and attitudes towards them weren’t helped by one exploding, killing a passenger. Britain, meanwhile, continued with the development of electric buses. A large double-decker had been operational in London as far back as 1891, and in 1896 we reported on a new creation: “It has accommodation for 26 passengers and only weighs [2230kg]. \"The storage batteries are a new pattern and weigh but [760kg]. These are adapted to be very easily removed and recharged, the battery power being sufficient to drive the bus over any of the ordinary routes. \"It takes no longer to replace an exhausted set of batteries than it does to effect a change of horses at the end of a stage. The batteries are so well insulated from vibration by the system of springs on which the vehicle is hung that we are assured no acid has ever been spilled. \"And, of course, the running of the motor is absolutely regular, and quite different from the comparatively spasmodic jerks of horses as they drag a vehicle along.” Another benefit of a motorised bus was it being able to stop to pick up passengers. Horse-drawn ones made you board while still moving. Petrol power may have quickly won over the van market, but the immense strength of steam power meant that many buses continued to run on coke into the 1920s and large lorries well into the 1930s.",

    "description": "Nvidia's hardware is used buy several big-name car makers £2.7 trillion US tech giant Nvidia's new on-board computer could reshape the future of motoring If you pay any attention to the world of tech or the stock market, you’ve probably heard of Nvidia. And if you haven’t, you will definitely know car firms that use the American tech giant’s hardware or software in some capacity: Tesla, Volvo, JLR, Mercedes-Benz, BYD, Hyundai and more. Basically, in the coming era, when TOPS (tera operations per second, a measure of how fast a computer chip can process data) might be as key to a car as BHP or MPG, Nvidia is becoming a major player in the automotive industry and is the dominant force in an emerging field – so you absolutely should care about it. With huge processing power being required for autonomous vehicles, automotive is shaping up to be very big business for Nvidia: around $5 billion (£4.1bn) annually, if you include related services. But as its automotive vice-president and general manager, Ali Kani, tells me at the CES tech event in Las Vegas, “less than 10% of the market today” offers even level-two (so semi-autonomous) functions. It’s easy to do the maths. Nvidia was founded in 1993 to build graphics processing units (GPUs) – the chips that make it possible for PCs and games consoles to have fancy graphics. And because they need the power to process vast amounts of data for 3D effects, GPUs have also turned out to be incredibly well suited to the sort of advanced computing required for artificial intelligence (AI) – an area in which Nvidia has a real edge. That’s why its share price has skyrocketed in recent years, such that it is now worth $3.3 trillion (£2.7tn). Yes, trillion. Nvidia’s arrival in the automotive industry was almost an accident, with early clients such as Audi sourcing its chips to power their infotainment systems. “Car screens need a lot of graphics and car makers wanted them to look beautiful,” recalls Kani. “We were really good at graphics and we built chips you could use in a car. That was the beginning. But then we realised that self-driving cars were coming.” To operate naturally, self-driving cars need lots of AI computing, so you can see why Nvidia is interested in this area. Autonomous vehicle tech development requires “a tremendous amount of deep learning”, says Kani. “ You also need to train models in the cloud [meaning computing services performed elsewhere and sent to you] and create synthetic data [simulations], because you can’t test for every event that happens in the real world.” It was, as Kani notes, a “tremendous opportunity” for Nvidia, especially as the automotive industry moved towards ‘software-defined vehicles’ – cars designed around their digital systems, which can then be updated and refreshed over the course of their lives. Nvidia has three main automotive products: an in-car computer (Drive AGX), cloud computers that can be used to train AI models (DGX) and simulation computers that can work through driving models (Omniverse). It has been a learning experience. “It’s tough, because the [automotive] industry is so bureaucratic,” says Kani. “There’s a political infrastructure with so many people involved. There are negotiations with governments and unions, the board of this and the board of that. “That whole process of decision-making is new for a tech start-up. If we think something is right to do, we go and do it. But automotive companies say ‘let’s kick off a proof of concept’, and they will work with you for years and you think nothing is going anywhere.” Kani admits this was “a bit of a culture shock”, but there are signs that the automotive industry is slowly changing. Until recently, car makers would release a finished product, with any revisions coming in a future mid-life update. But now that cars are connected, they can be continually upgraded with new software. This has changed the way car makers think about computing – a change instigated by Tesla, believes Kani. “In the past, if firms were building a cheap car, they would use the cheapest chip they could. \"For medium cars they would use a medium-price chip, and for high-end cars they would use an expensive chip. Then Tesla put high-performance chips in all their cars and focused on software,” he explains. “With a software-defined vehicle, you put the highest-performance computer and richest software in the car and over the life of the car keep upgrading it.” It’s the same approach, notes Kani, that Apple takes with its iPhones. And while established car firms were slow to react to Tesla, Kani says the rise of Chinese newcomers “building really good self-driving software” has changed things: “There’s clearly a threat there. So now they’re thinking: ‘How do we make decisions faster?’” Many car makers talk about dramatically shortening their development cycles to try to match the Chinese – but Kani says “we haven’t seen that”. He adds: “In China, they make a new car every two years. Most [other] manufacturers are on a four- or five-year cadence. If your competition is upgrading every two years and you’re doing it once every four to five, they’re running circles around you.” Kani notes that the first European car makers to sign up to use Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin platform (essentially a ‘brain’ for autonomous vehicles) – Mercedes-Benz and Volvo – took several years to get the tech onto the road, whereas Chinese clients “had cars in production using it nine months later”. Those European cars on Orin such as the Volvo EX90 are just launching now, but Nvidia rolled out the more powerful Drive AGX Thor platform in 2022, and there are cars on the road in China using it already. “So you started at the same time, but by the time you launch your car, you’re behind on day one,” says Kani. “When we talk to Dell, HP and Apple, they’re asking when our next computer is available, and then the launch of their next product [an iPhone, for example] is aligned to it. \"What car firms need to start thinking is ‘when is the next platform available?’ and about how they can be ready [to start working with it] on that date.” The car industry’s shift to software-defined vehicles hasn’t been easy. Look at the challenges faced by the Volkswagen Group or delays that hit recent Volvo model launches, for example. Kani says that was partly due to car makers being slow to realise the type of software needed for the new generation of vehicles had changed, now putting a much greater focus on machine learning. Asked for his opinion on how car makers are managing the shift, Kani says: “Certainly they’re getting more informed. Their teams are more and more knowledgeable. \"The challenge in the short term is the shift in how to develop a software stack. In the past, the likes of Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes would take mobilised perception software, then do fusion software separately and then planning and control separately. \"That’s no longer how you develop software: you take that perception software you were outsourcing, and now it’s an end-to-end model that does perception, fusion and planning in one model.” To strip away the tech terminology there: car firms used to develop individual bits of software to do specific tasks on a car, but the latest super-powerful chips developed by the likes of Nvidia enable far more advanced AI systems to be run, which is what’s needed for digitally advanced and truly autonomous cars. “It’s doubling down on the know-how that they didn’t have,” continues Kani. “The problem is that car firms did actually learn a lot, but the type of software they have knowledge of is no longer something you want to be using in the future, so they need to hire a whole bunch of new people who can do machine learning. “It’s harder than everyone thought. But we will do our best to help them. That’s our job: ‘let us help you with these problems’.” On that note, Kani describes Nvidia’s relationships with car makers as partnerships, with Nvidia tailoring solutions to meet car makers’ needs using its various chips and services. While Nvidia’s in-car package is strong, Kani says that it’s in cloud computing and simulation systems where the firm is well ahead. Indeed, its biggest automotive partner, Tesla, is now largely using Nvidia hardware for its AI development (CEO Elon Musk said he expected to spend $3bn-$4bn on Nvidia AI hardware last year). The big business opportunity for Nvidia comes with self-driving cars: not just the level-two-plus cars on the road today (which can operate autonomously under supervision in certain situations) but the level-four (fully autonomous) ones the industry has dreamed about for years. Current semi-autonomous cars generally can operate only in fairly controlled environments. Kani says truly autonomous cars in chaotic urban areas require a “much more advanced software stack. There’s just so much noise and chaos, so the software needs to be richer in capability.” Kani says that in the past year autonomous vehicle development has advanced to using Multimodal Large Language Model AI – essentially software that can process and understand multiple types of input data.  Think ChatGPT but for cars. There’s also now the need for a lot more processing power to handle the raft of sensors required for autonomous functions – not least because of the demand for a complete fail-safe back-up. No wonder, then, that Kani admits the industry is “not close” to a true self-driving car. And if the prospect of self-driving cars is a turn-off, know that Nvidia’s systems will have other benefits. Those annoying emergency braking systems and lane departure warnings that go off erroneously on so many current cars? New tech should improve those. There are also things like improved natural-language voice control, smarter park assist and cars becoming able to self-identify faults and suggest solutions. So whether the cars are autonomous or not, expect Nvidia to emerge as an increasingly important player in the automotive industry as vehicles become ever more technical. “For us, this market is only just beginning,” says Kani. “And it’s already a $5bn market.”",

Just over a decade ago, industrial designer Chad Hodge designed and built a retro-inspired helmet as part of his final year thesis, with clear cues from vintage lids like the legendary 1960s Bell Star. Bell saw the concept, loved it, and brought Chad in-house to put it into production. The Bell Bullitt hit the market just as the alt-moto scene reached its zenith. It spread like wildfire—offering riders a premium lid with modern protection, vintage styling, and elegant finishes, and inspiring countless copycats along the way.

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Rubber-mounted footpegs are new here. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "description": "It’s one of those days when I’m glad I get to do what I do. The day starts off like any other, getting up at way-too-early o’clock, driving to the shoot location and reviewing a car. But what’s making it different is the car. Way before the sun comes up, I’m already at the location. I hear a deep grumble approaching, and I see the six LED light signatures, followed by a sleek silhouette cutting through the dark. Now, I had promised myself I wouldn’t make any James Bond references, but this really feels straight out of one of those legendary films. Aston Martin Vantage exterior design Borrows design cues from DB12, One-77 As the sun comes up, I get my first proper look at the Vantage, this one being finished in a beautiful shade called Ion Blue. The new Aston Martin Vantage commands your attention, irrespective of what you make of its looks. It borrows a lot of styling cues from bigger Astons, like the new DB12 and the One-77 supercar, and, in general, is a lot more aggressive-looking than the outgoing car. The biggest change is at the front, with larger LED Matrix headlamps, a larger grille, new air curtains on the outer edges of the bumper and a more sculpted bonnet. Full of gorgeous details, like these strakes. 21-inch wheels The rest of the car is largely unchanged; it still has a vent on the fenders, which helps remove turbulent air from the wheel wells, but it now features a side strake with the Aston Martin lettering. There’s new wheel options, with this one riding on 21 inchers with the optional black brake calipers. I also love the look of the mirrors, whose entire housing moves, rather than just the glass, and the large side skirts. The Vantage also has a ground clearance of 94mm, which may not sound like much, but with short overhangs and a small wheelbase, relatively speaking, it’s very capable at tackling speed breakers. In fact, getting to the shoot location involves going over around 10 speed breakers and some really rough patches of road, and surprisingly, the Vantage doesn’t scrape its belly even once. And that’s without a front axle lift system - commendable! It’s wider; has more aero and larger exhaust tips. 30mm wider from before Around the back, it still retains the now-iconic Vantage light signature, but it’s 30mm wider than before. Aston Martin says that the underbody aero, the diffuser and the ducktail spoiler have all been revised for more downforce, and the quad exhaust tips are now larger. It also has a properly usable boot and can easily swallow up your luggage for a weekend road trip. Getting into the cabin is an event. It’s got the swan doors, like you’d expect from an Aston that not only look cool sweeping slightly upwards but also help avoid contact with curbs and footpaths. Inside, I’m greeted by a completely new interior that looks and feels much more modern and driver-focused than the outgoing car’s. Aston Martin Vantage interior and features Digital cluster has nice graphics, but the data appears too small. 10.25-inch touchscreen and driver's display  There are two 10.25-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and another for the infotainment. The touchscreen is set low and at an angle in the centre console and features nice graphics, while the instrument panel is set in a sporty binnacle. However, some of the data appears too small to read on the go. The new interior is more driver-centric and gets more tech; seat controls fall easily to hand. ADAS added The angled centre console has a myriad of buttons and switches, all of which are finished beautifully, and they control various aspects of the car. Then there are the optional Sports Plus seats, which are comfy and supportive and are finished in a lovely soft leather. A shoutout also goes to the optional ‘Oxford Tan’ upholstery this car features, which really complements the exterior colour well. Practicality is also decent by supercar standards, as it does get a glovebox, some space behind the seats, slim door pockets and a wireless charger under the centre console. And yes, it packs in ADAS tech now. Endless customisation options This test car is also equipped with options such as carbon-fibre trim, blue contrasting stitching, a sports steering wheel and satin dark chrome ‘interior jewellery’ - all of which undoubtedly look pretty but cost a pretty penny. And the possibilities to customise your Vantage are endless. Overall, the interior feels special, and the quality and finish are top-notch, marking a step up from the outgoing car. Aston Martin engine and performance AMG’s 665hp V8 now puts out 30 percent more power. 0-100kph takes 3.5 seconds; 325kph top speed The engine is one of the stand out elements of the car. The Mercedes-AMG-sourced 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 has been tuned to put out supercar numbers – 665hp and 800Nm – which is 30 percent more than its predecessor. This propels it from 0-100kph in a claimed 3.5 seconds and on to a top speed of 325kph. And what stands out apart from the wild performance is the noise. This V8 burbles at idle, makes some great intake and turbo whooshing sounds on the move, and there’s delightful exhaust cracks and pops on downshifts. There is some turbo lag, and the meat of the power band is between 3,000rpm and 5,500rpm, but it pulls relentlessly till its 7,000rpm redline. A stiffer chassis and quicker steering make it feel much more agile than the older Vantage. Misses out on a GT mode There are three drive modes to choose from – Sport, Sport+ and Track – all of which alter throttle response, steering weight, damper stiffness and exhaust volume. However, there’s no GT mode, like on the bigger DB12 or the DBX SUV, so Sport is the mode to be in for everyday use. It’s in this mode where the Vantage feels its most relaxed and supple, but it isn’t as relaxed or pliant as some other supercars out there. Sport+ dials things up further with more response and noise, and it’ll even allow some playful action from the rear end without being dangerous. Track mode, however, is best saved for, well, the track. In this mode, the Vantage feels like a sportscar that the brand says it is, with a very firm suspension, sharp responses and twitchy handling out on a public road. You really have to have your wits about you to use this mode on tight public roads. And best reserved for a track, there’s nine settings for the traction control, so you can choose how much slip you want from the rear. Torque converter is smooth Paired to the V8 is an 8-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox that gets a shorter final drive ratio. It’s fairly quick, but it doesn’t have the lightning responses or that small but noticeable shunt you get from DCTs - something you’d expect from a sportscar. But the Vantage isn’t an all-out sportscar, and the torque converter’s smoothness actually complements its GT characteristics and makes it much nicer to drive at saner speeds. Having driven the Vantage through smaller village roads, too, I got a good idea about its ride and handling balance. The ride is firm and, though, not jarring, and given its touring abilities, a more pliant GT setting would have been welcome. The refinement could also have been better as you do get some road and tyre noise inside the cabin. In terms of handling, apart from being wider, the new Vantage is stiffer, thanks to additional cross bracing at both axles and in the floor. With the engine sat behind the front axle, it’s got a perfect 50:50 weight distribution; the quicker steering and more aero means it’s much more agile, planted and responsive around corners than the older Vantage. Aston Martin price and verdict Priced at Rs 4.20 crore (ex-showroom, before options), the new Vantage currently sits in a space of its own, between the Porsche 911 Turbo S at the lower end and the Ferrari Roma above it. And that goes for its positioning, too. It’s in a pretty unique spot; a front-engined, two-seat sportscar is rare. It’s got beautiful lines, aural drama, ferocious performance like a proper sports car, is usable over a wide variety of roads, can tackle speed breakers, and has the ability to carry your weekend luggage. Think of it as a sports car with some GT abilities or a GT with sports car capabilities – the latter is what I’m leaning towards. This is what makes it such good sense for India.

    "description": "Just three months after the second-gen Skoda Kodiaq made its India debut, the seven-seat full-size SUV is set to launch in India. Speaking to media at the Octavia RS drive, Skoda Auto India brand director Petr Janeba, confirmed that prices for the new Kodiaq will be announced in April, and that it will be offered in two trims. 2025 Skoda Kodiaq Sportline and L\u0026K prices to be revealed in April Second-gen Kodiaq gets the same 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine Kodiaq RS launch confirmed for end of 2025 2025 Skoda Kodiaq variants Kodiaq Sportline and Laurin \u0026 Klement trims to get cosmetic and feature differences The Sportline and L\u0026K on sale in international markets. Skoda will launch the 2025 Kodiaq in two trims – Sportline and Laurin \u0026 Klement (L\u0026K) – which will be differentiated on the outside and inside. Compared to the Kodiaq L\u0026K showcased at Auto Expo 2025, the Sportline trim is expected to feature blacked-out elements instead of chrome, such as around the grille, on the ORVMs, D-pillars and more, along with a different set of alloy wheels. The Kodiaq Sportline’s interior is also likely to mirror the exterior, with more blacked-out highlights and dark upholstery. Feature differences between the two trims are also likely, but we’ll have to wait for more details from Skoda for the specifics. 2025 Skoda Kodiaq engine details 190hp, 320Nm turbo-petrol engine, 7-speed DCT and AWD to continue 190hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine from its predecessor. The second-gen Kodiaq is powered by the same 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that powered its predecessor. Outputs were 190hp and 320Nm of peak torque, transmitted to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Skoda Kodiaq RS India launch details 265hp Kodiaq RS will be brought in as a CBU The Kodiaq range in India will expand with the range-topping RS-badged model before the end of 2025. Along with larger brakes and sportier design changes outside and in, the 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine has its outputs bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm of peak torque. Kodiaq Sportline and L\u0026K will be locally assembled Unlike the standard seven-seat SUV, which, as we had reported, is locally assembled, the Kodiaq RS will be brought in as a CBU and command a significant premium.

    "description": "To underline the Skoda Kylaq’s image of being a fun-to-drive and performance-oriented alternative to the bevy of compact SUVs, the Czech company is planning to put together a racing series in India. Speaking to Autocar india on the sidelines of the Octavia RS drive in Croatia, Skoda Auto India brand director Petr Janeba, said, \"We want the series to be competitive but still very reliable and accessible from costs, so that young drivers can train and get better.\" Skoda Kylaq Cup race car details The VW Group's 2.0-litre TSI engine will be used in the Kylaq Cup racer. The Kylaq is powered by the VW Group’s 1.0-litre TSI engine that makes 115hp and 178Nm, and is based on the MQB A0 IN platform. However, the plans that are being drawn up are to have a custom-built Kylaq Cup race car using the MQB 37 platform, and powered by the VW Group's 2.0 TSI engine, used on the Skoda Octavia, Superb, Kodiaq and Volkswagen Tiguan. Under the hood of the latest Octavia RS, this unit puts out 265hp, but the Kylaq Cup race car would see power bumped a little north of 300hp and 450Nm. Naturally, the Kylaq Cup racer would feature other competition hardware such as a roll cage, larger brakes, a race suspension and racing slicks.  Skoda India in motorsport Skoda isn’t new to motorsports in India as its rally-prepped Fabia R5 has been available to privateers who want to participate in rallies. However, this would be the first time the brand directly organises a motorsport event in India – joining the likes of Maruti Suzuki and Volkswagen – and enters the track-racing arena. Speaking of sister brand Volkswagen, it has been directly involved in motorsports in India since 2010. It held the Polo Cup that year, then held the Vento Cup in 2015, the Ameo Cup in 2017, and brought back the Polo Cup in 2020. However, Volkswagen Motorsport India operations were handed over to Rayo Racing in 2022, spelling the end of the German brand’s one-make racing series. Incidentally, Skoda is celebrating 125 years of its motorsport history, and Janeba says this is a nice time, along with the brand's 25th anniversary in India, to introduce the Kylaq race car and the racing series. The plans for the Kylaq Cup are in the nascent stages, and though no date has been set, Janeba said, \"I don't want to over promise that everything gets ready this year, but we would still strive to get some prototype cars done.\" Also see: Skoda Kylaq video review Skoda Kylaq waiting period extends up to 4 months F1 2025 car liveries revealed",

    "description": "The eighth generation Eldorado was a more than pleasant surprise to the public when it arrived in showrooms for the 1967 model year. As we covered previously, its fresh and angular exterior styling was quite unexpected from Cadillac. Especially so when one considered how staid and barge-like the Eldorado had become as it was reduced over generations into a trim rework of the DeVille (even if it was built by Fleetwood). Interior styling received a considerable update too, with minimal chrome, no wood paneling whatsoever, and a driver-focused cockpit which would become the hallmark of the personal luxury car. But as was de rigueur , General Motors set about messing with the Eldorado via various annual changes.",

    "link": "",
    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",

    "title": "Ferrari at a Crossroads: Cavallino Classic '25",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Breakers really shouldn’t exist. Not in its current artful form anyway. Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.
