    "description": "This 1936 Cord 810 phaeton is said to have passed through a series of documented owners dating back to the 1940s before being purchased in 1988 by a collector who initiated a refurbishment in the 1990s. The car subsequently earned AACA National Senior First Prize and CCCA Senior Premier honors before being sold to a Florida owner and again changing hands in 2008. An additional refurbishment performed over the ensuing several years included a repaint and a re-trim of the interior in red leather before the car was purchased by the selling dealer approximately five months ago. Power is provided by a 289ci Lycoming V8 that drives the front wheels via a vacuum-operated four-speed preselector transaxle. Additional features include independent front suspension, a Gener-Nator alternator, a Startix automatic starting system, mechanically operated pop-up headlights, a black convertible top, and a radio. This 810 is said to have participated in CCCA CARavans as well as the Glidden Tour and is now offered in Benson, North Carolina, with ACD Club certification, owner’s manuals, a brochure, awards, invoices dating back to 2009, and transferable New York registration.",

    "description": "Over three generations, the BMW X3 cemented its reputation as the most fun to drive among the midsize luxury SUVs. This fourth-generation model changes tack by putting the focus on comfort. More chill, slightly less thrill, if you will. That’s not a bad thing because the end result is the most rounded X3 yet and one that should be of great interest to buyers in India. 2025 BMW X3 exterior design Styling is not as polarising as past few BMWs Unlike the latest lot of Bimmers that seem styled to polarise, the new X3 will find readier acceptance from many quarters. There’s a link to older X3s in the long bonnet stance and upward sweep of the glasshouse, but the tight skinning devoid of too many cuts and creases is new-age BMW. The X3 looks well-defined and muscular without relying on overt cues to establish it as such. Illuminated grille is standard on new X3 Not to say that the X3 doesn’t have its shouty bits. The iconic kidney grille occupies significant real estate on the nose, and for added effect, it features diagonally arranged bars and glows, too. The LED outline for the grille might seem kitsch, but it does give BMWs an unmistakable light signature. The headlamps, which slickly sweep back with the bonnet line, are also home to cool blue detailing. Notably, India gets the X3 only in the M Sport guise. Edgy detailing for the flush set front bumper, sporty 19-inch rims and a diffuser-like panel at the back do their bit to up the show value. Illuminated surround for kidney grille: a distinctive light signature on new BMWs. The latest X3 positions the rear number plate down on the bumper, a treatment we had seen on the X3’s coupe cousin, the X4, which, interestingly, isn’t due for replacement. Chunky tail-lights that taper as they move inwards (no light bar business here) give the X3 its distinctive tail end, and what will also grab your attention are the roof spoiler and wind deflectors that line the rear windscreen. X3 is longer, wider and taller than Mercedes-Benz GLC and Audi Q5 The latest X3 might not look so, but it has grown a crucial few millimetres in every dimension. It’s now marginally longer, wider and taller than its German compatriots, though the Mercedes-Benz GLC has a slightly longer wheelbase. Under the skin, the X3 continues on BMW’s rear-biased CLAR platform, but the suspension and steering have been redone for enhanced comfort. Also new is the footwear. The latest X3 dumps run-flat tyres for standard tubeless ones. More on this in a bit. 2025 BMW X3 interior Lighting has been used to great effect in the X3. Cabin feels open and airy. The X3’s doors can be locked/unlocked with the standard key, a tap of an NFC card or a transferable ‘digital key’ on your mobile phone. In either case, your first points of contact are the concealed door handles that are good for aero but don’t feel quite as nice to hold as grab-type handles would. You will, however, appreciate how easy the X3 is to get into and the general ambience inside. Yes, there are familiar BMW aggregates, such as the sloping dash and the curved display, but the interior stylists have done well to give the X3’s cabin a flavour of its own. Ambient lighting used to great effect You’ll see the X3’s interior in its best light at night. The ambient lighting package comprises a light bar on the dash, an illuminated surround for the centre console and lit panels on the front doors. The effect is really cool, and what’s also nice is how the lighting is used to communicate warnings and alerts, such as a door opening. Adding distinction to the X3’s cabin is the material of choice for the dashtop and door panels. Made from recycled polyester, it’s a break from traditional materials, but its knitted texture could be a task to keep clean in our dusty conditions. Knitted material on dashboard made from recycled polyester. Interestingly, leather wrapping for the chunky M Sport steering wheel aside, the rest of the cabin is made from manmade materials. While the leather-like upholstery is convincing, many plastics lower down aren’t in line with the X3’s price. Even the island-like panels on the front doors with haptic controllers for side air vent flow and lock/unlock buttons look better than they are to use. Simply put, the cabin is not as opulent as the GLC’s. 2025 BMW X3 features Feature highlights includes largest in segment panoramic glass roof Panoramic glass roof gets full-length mesh cover. Where the X3 goes the distance is its equipment. Headlining the features list is the largest-in-class panoramic glass roof. The vibrant 12.3-inch digital dials come complemented by a nicely executed head-up display, while the 14.9-inch centre touchscreen is also your display for the crisp 360-degree cameras and augmented reality navigation (it only works with the on-board maps). However, as we’ve said before, the centre screen packs in too much content, and the need to rely on the screen for basic functions like blower speed settings is an unnecessary distraction. BMW’s latest OS 9 does allow greater customisation to put frequently used functions as widgets, but it only helps so much. Of the other items, the 750W Harman Kardon sound system is particularly nice. 2025 BMW X3 comfort and space Sporty front seats pack in ventilation and side bolster adjust Front-seat comfort gets a big thumbs up. The seats are well-cushioned and contoured and offer a good degree of fine-tuning with electric lumbar and side-bolstering adjust, as well as manual thigh-support extension.  There’s front-seat ventilation, too. Rear seat is comfy but best for two occupants There’s ample legroom at the back. Seat is comfy, but backrest angle is fixed. Rear-seat passengers, however, will have to contend with fixed seating. The backrest recline is missed, particularly since the seatback feels a touch upright. On the whole, though, the seating position is comfy, with ample thigh support and kneeroom. A fold-down armrest, a dedicated zone for climate control, manual sunblinds, and an iPad mount (available as an accessory) up the experience at the back. Tall occupants will find the headroom just adequate, while the high centre tunnel eats into middle passenger foot space. Spare tyre gets dedicated compartment below luggage area 570-litre boot is well-shaped. Spare tyre now sits in dedicated bay under floor. The X3 offers loads of storage for small items. The open bay at the base of the dash is home to a wireless charger and two cup holders; there’s a handy box between the front seats, and the door pockets are usefully large. You will have to stuff items into the small glove box, though. The space for larger items has seen a big upgrade with this generation of X3. What helps greatly is a dedicated area for the space-saver spare tyre under the boot floor (the last X3 carried its spare within the boot), so you get a well-shaped 570-litre luggage bay. The 40:20:40 split seats give the flexibility to transport oddly shaped items or open up more luggage capacity. 2025 BMW X3 engines and gearboxes Petrol and diesel engines assisted by 48V mild-hybrid systems The diesel engine beats the petrol unit in terms of output. Like the last X3, the new model can be had with a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine or a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel. The thing is, the petrol engine is no longer offered in high-strung 252hp and 350Nm ‘30i’ form but in a milder ‘20’ tune, which brings power and torque down to 190hp and 310Nm. The figures are well shy of what rival petrol models offer, which is a shame. Perhaps BMW is saving the hot X3 M50 with its sonorous straight-six for ardent petrolheads. The 20d diesel featured here is more convincing if you aren’t spooked by the government’s anti-diesel stance, that is. Its 197hp and 400Nm figures are par for the course for this class of SUV, and there’s also the helping hand of a 48V mild-hybrid system that chips in with 11hp and 25Nm under hard load. The other number of interest? 17.6kpl official fuel economy. X3 diesel’s official fuel economy figure is 17.6kpl It’s an engine that’s easy to warm up to. Refinement is particularly impressive, and at average city speeds, you’ll not hear much from the engine bay. Even when pushed, the engine doesn’t sound coarse or strained. Also likeable is the build of power. There’s ready power when you need it and a sustained pull should you find the road to really press down hard on the accelerator. What is missed is that spike in the mid-range, which made BMW’s older diesels particularly exciting. Sadly, that’s the case with all modern diesels calibrated to comply with stringent emission norms. X3 diesel does 0-100kph acceleration run in 7.4 seconds That said, the new X3 diesel’s 7.4 seconds 0-100kph time makes it quicker than the last-gen X3 diesel (8.65 seconds to 100kph) as well as the new Mercedes GLC 220d, which does the 0-100kph dash in 7.8 seconds. The BMW has a slight edge in kickdown acceleration, too. As always, the 8-speed automatic transmission plays its supporting role really well, effortlessly shuffling through the gears depending on your requirements. You really won’t find yourself reaching for the paddles to get the most out of the engine or gearbox. When you do want a quick burst of power, a long pull on the left paddle shifter will engage the Sport mode for 10 seconds. 2025 BMW X3 ride and handling Adaptive suspension is standard fit The diesel engine is very refined even when pushed hard. If there’s one area in which the X3 has taken the biggest stride, it’s ride comfort. The new X3 feels pliant at low speeds, whereas the last one felt jiggly, and while there is some body movement over undulations, ride comfort has improved to the extent it could just be class-best. Adaptive suspension that varies damping force depending on drive conditions is standard, and it also gives drivers the option to toggle between Comfort and Sport settings. Sport mode does tighten things up and helps keep body control in check at faster speeds. Suspension setup aside, a key ingredient in this change of character is the move away from hard sidewall run-flat tyres to more absorbent tubeless ones. The added ‘give’ allows the X3 to do a better job of filtering shocks from the surface below. New X3 switches from run-flats to regular tubeless tyres. The new X3 changes direction smoothly and effortlessly without feeling quite as pointy as its predecessor, 50:50 weight distribution and rear-biased all-wheel drive notwithstanding. There’s good connect at the steering at all times, and the planted feel means you can confidently carry high speeds. Braking power is good, too. Camera and radar-based ADAS features are included The X3 also packs in radar and camera-based ADAS functions. Adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and auto braking worked well enough on well-marked roads but are best thought of as an added safety net rather than features to rely completely on.    2025 BMW X3 price and verdict The new X3 range starts at Rs 75.8 lakh (ex-showroom, India) for the petrol, while this diesel comes in at Rs 77.8 lakh. Pricing is at par with the Mercedes GLC, which is currently the midsize luxury SUV to beat. The latest X3 does a lot of things right. It’s got the right look, it’s got the wow elements inside, and it’s rather nice to drive, too. However, it’s the upped comfort levels that really open it up to a wider buyer base. By retaining most of what we’ve liked about X3s thus far and addressing its biggest weaknesses, BMW has come up with an X3 that’s more complete than it ever was. The one to buy? We’ll have to bring the field of rivals to give the answer but the X3 sure is in the fight for the top spot.

    "description": "Following on from the Karizma XMR 210 and Mavrick 440, the new Xtreme 250R marks Hero’s latest venture into the premium space, and it’s an important one because this is the debut of a new quarter-litre engine – one that’s Hero’s most powerful to date. Hero Xtreme 250R engine refinement, performance New 250cc engine derived from Hero's existing 210cc mill Well, I say new engine, but in essence, this is a stroked-out version of the 210cc motor we’ve already seen in the Karizma. So capacity is up to 249cc, and you get 30hp and 25Nm. All these numbers, combined with other aspects of this motorcycle, make it pretty easy to see that it’s been benchmarked against the KTM 250 Duke – in other words, it’s aiming to be the sportiest 250cc bike out there. The engine has strong performance but is a little vibey. To that end, the engine pulls quite cleanly and strongly all across the rev range; it’s fairly tractable at the bottom end and there’s a good spread of torque all the way across the rev range, with performance to be found in revving the motor out almost all the way to the redline. So, the Xtreme feels quick and performance isn’t an issue, but that’s not to say that this engine is perfect. The Xtreme 250R has the most powerful Hero engine to date. This is the most powerful road engine Hero has ever built, so it’s venturing into new territory. That's noticeable in the refinement department, where the company hasn’t quite got it nailed yet. Across all the bikes present at the media ride, some were quite smooth, others were a little buzzy, and some were fairly gruff and vibe-y. The Xtreme we rode for most of the day was vibe-free at the handlebars, but there were quite a few vibrations felt through the seat, tank and footpegs; some of the bodywork near the front of the bike was also buzzy when revved. Hero Xtreme 250R ride and handling Xtreme 250R's ride has a hard edge to it, unlike its smaller siblings The smaller members of the Xtreme family – the Xtreme 125 and Xtreme 160 – feel more like sporty commuters. The Xtreme 250R comes across more as an out-and-out sport naked, and this is most evident in the suspension setup. The smaller Xtremes manage to offer a degree of plushness in the way they ride. On the 250R, at low speeds especially, the ride feels quite jarring and there’s definitely a hard edge to the setup – it feels firmly damped. The suspension has a firm edge to it. This does get better as speeds rise or with a heavier rider on board, but by and large this is not going to be the most comfortable bike to live with everyday – the ergonomics are quite neutral and comfortable, but the ride quality certainly doesn’t feel plush. Moreover, there are others in this segment that feel equally sporty but manage to offer superior ride comfort. The Xtreme 250R is an energetic handler. The flip-side of that firm setup is that it beautifully complements the trellis frame to create a fun handling package. The Xtreme 250R feels nimble and agile through the twisties, quite happily and predictably responding to rider inputs. It’s also got grippy MRF Nylogrip tyres to back it up (though the front isn’t a radial), and this sweet chassis package – combined with the fairly quick motor – make the Xtreme a reasonably fun bike to ride on the open road. Hero Xtreme 250R quality, fit and finish The design is striking but doesn't come together very well, quality could improve too Hero says it’s aiming the Xtreme at people who value grabbing attention just as much as the riding experience, so they’ve made an effort to make it look striking. There are definitely certain elements and details across the bike that grab your attention, but I’m not sure the overall design here comes together cohesively – it’s certainly got some muscle to it, which is nice, but some areas feel a little busy and overdone. It has a catchy design but quality could be better. The step up from the rider’s seat to the fuel tank looks disproportionately large, and the fuel tank region itself has a lot of layering going on, with many different colours, finishes and graphics all jostling for space. The radiator shrouds also seem a little overstyled, and when you dive in for a closer look, you can see certain areas where the Xtreme feels built to a cost.   Some unsightly welds are in your direct field of vision. Near the headstock you’ll find some quite unsightly welds, which is unfortunate because they’re right in your line of sight when looking at the instruments. Certain sections of the frame on our bike also had rough surface finish and untidy welds, but vital touchpoints like switchgear feel reasonably good. Hero Xtreme 250R price and verdict Xtreme 250R is a good value proposition in the 250cc space Priced at Rs 1.80 lakh, the Xtreme 250R undercuts the likes of the Suzuki Gixxer 250 (Rs 1.98 lakh-2.17 lakh), and is a great deal cheaper than a KTM 250 Duke (Rs 2.28 lakh). That said, it isn’t quite as well equipped either – it’s fairly simple with no TFT screen or quickshifter, you get a simple LCD dash, all-LED lighting and ABS with two modes. Speaking of instrumentation, it’s the same fairly basic monochrome LCD display that you see on the Karizma, and it would have been nice to see a TFT or at least a colour LCD unit on the top variant. LCD feels a little basic in this age of TFT displays. So, how does one sum up this bike? Well, if you are shopping in and around the Rs 2 lakh mark for a performance bike, you could go a few different ways. On the one hand, you’ve got something like the Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z, which takes a brute force approach to performance, giving you maximum displacement and horsepower for the price. At almost exactly the same price, you could also get something like a Yamaha R15, which is the polar opposite – it’s only a 155cc, but with a very sharp focus on handling and a sporty riding experience. Somewhere between those two is where the new Xtreme 250R sits – it’s definitely got more grunt than the R15, without being as heavy-feeling as the NS400Z. It strikes a nice middle ground as a sporty 250cc bike, and as always with Hero, the value proposition is quite strong. Also See: Hero Xtreme 250R video review",

    "description": "Smart #5 Summit gets a roof rack and side-mounted ladders Off-road-styled #5 electric SUV is by far Smart’s largest and most potent car yet UK deliveries of the Smart #5 – the brand's biggest car yet – will begin in October. An EV that will attempt to win over buyers of large SUVs with its hardy character, it will be underpinned by an 800V electrical architecture and major on in-car technology. It sits on the same Geely SEA2 platform as the smaller #1 and #3 crossovers. The #5 measures 4705mm long, 1920mm wide and 1705mm tall, which makes it a similar size to the new Peugeot 5008, although it’s not a seven-seater.  While retaining a lot of Smart’s modern design cues, such as concealed door handles and rounded edges, it differs from the rest of the line-up by swapping angular headlights and a singular light bar for a boxier, more rugged look.  One of the big changes comes inside, where dual 13in OLED infotainment touchscreens dominate the dashboard. It uses an evolved version of Smart's UX system and, like its siblings, it gets an animal avatar, this time a lion. Meanwhile, the driver has a 10.3in digital instrument cluster, an increase on the 9.2in equivalent in its sibling cars. Power figures haven’t been released yet, but details published by the Chinese government in June suggest that it will top out with a 637bhp dual-motor model using the Brabus nameplate. Five trim levels will be available: Pro, Pro+, Pulse, Summit Edition and Premium. Battery sizes, depending on trim level, range from 76kWh to 100kWh, with as many as 366 miles offered in its most efficient form. Top-end recharge speeds of 400kW yield a 10-80% fill in 18min. The Summit Edition is notable for bringing a variety of off-roading addenda inspired by the #5 concept, with four-wheel drive, a roof rack and a ladder mounted on the right-hand side of its body. It also gets five off-road driving modes, including settings for snow and mud. Prices are expected to start at around £40,000.",

    "description": "We often ruminate on the pros and cons of restoring vintage bikes rather than customizing them. Whichever path you choose, there’s another question worth considering; how do you treat patina? Must every last nut and bolt shine, or must the machine wear its history with pride? “I personally live on both sides of the restored versus patina conversation,” says Mike Watanabe, co-founder of Union Motorcycle Classics. “I have pristine bikes and patina bikes that I relate to regularly. I also have a nice Porsche 912 and a Patina 356. I find a place for both philosophies—on two wheels or four.” Mike runs Union Motorcycle Classics together with Luke Ransom, out of an old barn in Nampa, Idaho, USA. True to his word, the shop produces bikes on both sides of the equation—from polished restomods to classics that are dripping with patina.…",

But it’s when the brief calls for something more unique that shop boss Tom Gilroy truly comes alive, relishing the opportunity to push himself, and his crew, to new heights. “We have held fast to the idea that if we stop moving forward, we will cease to exist,” he states. And if you need any proof that this philosophy is core to what the Australian shop does, this staggeringly elegant Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 has it in spades. The commission for the build came directly from Royal Enfield, leaving Tom with something of a conundrum. “Our build ideas come from our relationship with the client,” he explains, “their personal tastes, the riding style they like, and the energy they put out in our meetings and consult on their bike.…",

    "description": "Several car brands, such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Hyundai, have confirmed upcoming price hikes for their entire model line-ups. Set to take effect starting April 2025, the price increases are claimed to be a result of rising input costs and operational expenses for the carmakers. Maruti Suzuki and Kia to undertake price hikes of up to 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively Tata Motors has yet to specify the maximum price hike for its models The rise in prices will vary depending on models and their variants Maruti Suzuki price increase in April 2025 Up to 4 percent higher prices Maruti Suzuki usually raises prices by varying degrees across its portfolio, so it remains to be seen which of its models will see the highest 4 percent rise from April, which will be the company’s third price hike this year. In previous instances, prices were increased by up to Rs 32,500 for the Celerio, Brezza, Alto K10, and other models in January and February. Maruti Suzuki hasn’t shared the exact reasons behind its increasing expenditure, but according to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, it may be driven by ballooning raw material costs and supply chain troubles that several automobile manufacturers are currently facing in India. Mahindra price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Mahindra has announced price hikes of up to 3 percent for its full model line-up, including the Thar, Scorpio N, Bolero, XUV700, and more. The carmaker's commercial vehicle offerings will also be impacted by the upcoming price adjustment, which Mahindra claims is a result of rising input costs and commodity prices. Tata price increase in April 2025 Starting next month, Tata will also undertake price hikes across its full range, depending on the model and variant. The company attributes the price hikes to “rising input costs” but has yet to confirm the extent of the markups. Hyundai price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Hyundai cars like the Creta, Verna, Venue and Tucson will become costlier by up to 3 percent from April onwards. Rising input costs, increased commodity prices and higher operational expenses were some of the reasons cited by the mass-market car brand for the same.  Kia price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Kia has confirmed a price hike of up to 3 percent for its entire model line-up in India, which comprises the Seltos, Sonet, Syros, EV6, EV9, Carens and Carnival. The carmaker cites “rising commodity prices” and “escalating supply chain-related costs” as the reasons. BMW price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent The prices of BMW and Mini cars will be increased by up to 3 percent effective next month. These include BMW 3 Series LWB, iX1 LWB, M5 and X7 models. The Mini Cooper S and Countryman Electric will also become costlier. Renault price increase in April 2025 Up to 2 percent higher prices All three Renault offerings in India - the Kwid, Kiger, and Triber - will undergo price hikes of up to 2 percent starting next month. According to Renault India CEO and MD Venkatram Mamillapalle, the company has been subsuming rising input costs for \"a considerable time,\" but the sustained increase has now necessitated a price hike for its model portfolio. Honda price increase in April 2025 Honda India's Kunal Behl said that effective April, all models, including the Amaze, City, City e:HEV and Elevate, will see a price increase. “Despite efforts to absorb [rising input costs and operational expenses], some price revision has become unavoidable and will be passed on to customers,” he added.

    "description": "If you replace every trim piece, every nut and bolt of a car, is it still the same car? This concept, (but swap car parts for nails, shiplap, and strakes) was first explored by the ancient Greek philosopher Plutarch, who opined on what became known as the Ship of Theseus paradox. In ancient writings he described how the Athenians preserved Theseus' ship by replacing its sacred wooden bits piece by piece, keeping it afloat perpetually. Theseus himself was a hero who valiantly and selflessly slew a Minotaur and navigated a twisting Labyrinth to save his people. His ship was not just a vessel, it was a symbol of triumph, endurance, and Athenian moxy. As its planks aged and were replaced, the Athenians were not merely maintaining a ship, they were keeping Theseus' legacy alive. And so the ages old debate began: if every part is replaced, does the identity remain? The question has lingered for centuries, not because it demands an answer, but because there isn’t one. The Athenians didn’t preserve Theseus’ ship because it was just a vibey cool looking boat. They preserved it because it meant something, because it was a vessel for a story too important to be lost. Theseus had moved beyond his life into folklore legend. For an automotive enthusiast, the Ferrari Daytona carries that same weight. It's one of our legends. For some, it is akin to an automotive sacred cow.  Either way, its fair to say that everyone can admit it is more than just another Ferrari. It is a machine born from victory and rebellion. It’s from an era of excess, flair, and audacity that would never come again. To erase imperfections, as we often do when things are over-restored beyond what they ever were, often means we erase the proof that the car had ever lived its own story. Machines, when used, aren’t just a sum of their parts. They carry history, wear, and the quiet fingerprints of every mile traveled. A Ferrari Daytona Spyder, already steeped in myth, should feel like a portal back to the moment it first rolled onto the streets. But what happens when every inch of it is refreshed, repainted, and reimagined?  That’s the battle at the heart of Camillo Mekacher-Vogel’s Ferrari Daytona Spyder. A Fly Yellow, one of one European spec Daytona, delivered new to a royal family in the Middle East before vanishing into obscurity. When it resurfaced decades later, its fate teetered on a knife’s edge. The easy path, the one so many owners take, would have been a flawless by the book restoration. Every imperfection erased, every part refreshed to be better than new. But Camillo saw something else. This car didn’t need to be perfect. It needed to be real. So began the fool’s errand against the inevitable, time, a fight not to restore but to preserve. \"We really wanted to maintain every possible original component,\" Camillo explained. \"Even the smallest details, like the original dashboard, are becoming increasingly rare in a world where everything gets over-restored.\" The safe option would have been just to replace any original component that was slightly blemished, but we wanted to keep the car as honest as possible. The judges at Cavallino understood that.\" The battle lines were clear. The engine bay, instead of being refinished into a glossy, factory fresh display, was carefully cleaned piece by piece. If someone in fifty years wants to know what an original Ferrari engine looked like, there will be very few left to show them. The dashboard, typically one of the first casualties in a restoration, remained intact, with every fragile, factory flaw left untouched. And where others would have swapped out components for pristine replacements, Camillo and team chose the harder road, keeping what was there, even if it wasn’t perfect. The car’s revival took months of careful work, bouncing between continents, its original wheels flying back and forth across the Atlantic to be properly restored in Italy, while Camillo flew between Milan and Wisconsin, where Motion Products carefully pieced the Daytona back together. Time was against them. The plan was to unveil the car at Cavallino Classic, the most prestigious Ferrari concours in the world. \"We immediately had this dream of presenting it at Cavallino,\" Camillo recalled, \"but at the same time, you have to respect an event like that and do your very best to present the car properly. We knew it was a risk, but we also knew it was the right thing to do.\" Would they understand the point? Would they see the car not as flawed, but as honest? \"\"People went wild over it,\" Camillo recalled. \"The fact that this car had been used, had been driven, had lived, it made it stand out even more among all the flawless restorations. It was a labor of love. We had the right people, the right vision, and the right car. Seeing it recognized that way, after all the effort we put into keeping it real, that was everything.\" Camillo Mekacher-Vogel’s Daytona didn’t just win. It dominated. Platinum Award, the concours equivalent of a heavyweight belt. The highest honor, certifying its authenticity and excellence. Best in Class for Ferrari Spiders. Beating flawless, fully restored examples. Gentlemen’s Choice, meaning some well dressed guys with no socks just really really liked it. A win not by technicality, but by sheer presence. The noble fight had been validated. It was never about winning outright. It was about taking a swing, about proving that some things are worth the fight even if you know time is waiting in the shadows. Every car, no matter how well kept, will need something replaced. Bolts tarnish. Leather cracks. Gas tanks rust from the inside out. But that is not death. That is maintenance. It's the cost of use. If we're passionate enough about something, as human beings we are in a unique position to be able see, and fight the entropic fade of everything we create.    But... maybe the real takeaway is that the Daytona, like any great car, isn't just valuable because of what it is, but because of what it represents. A defiance of time. Whether it is a multi million dollar Daytona or a beat up wagon on a road trip with your daughter, the real worth of a car is in the stories it collects, the people it carries, the roads it has seen, and the moments it endures. If you drink a bottle of great wine, you’ll enjoy it, but it fades into memory. (especially if you drink the whole bottle) A car, if kept alive, does more than just exist. It becomes a time machine, a vessel for memory, holding onto the stories, the people, and the moments that made it matter. Continue...",

    "description": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=7SaiVW3QfZc Photography: Rosario Liberti  In the early 1950s, a group of thrill-seekers in Zell am See, Austria, transformed their frozen lake into a playground of horsepower and daring. The inaugural Professor Ferdinand Porsche Memorial Race in 1952 saw skiers clinging to motorcycles, skijoring at breakneck speeds over the ice. This audacious blend of motorsport and winter sport marked the birth of a tradition that would see Porsche 356s and 550 Spyders sliding gracefully across the glistening surface, captivating thousands of spectators annually. The races continued until 1974, when a tragic accident halted the event, casting a shadow over the icy spectacle. Fast forward to 2019, and the frozen silence was broken by the roar of engines once more. Ferdi Porsche, great-grandson of the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, alongside his college friend Vinzenz Greger, resurrected the ice race, rebranding it under the F.A.T. International banner. This revival not only honored the legacy of the original races but also injected a modern flair, attracting a new generation of motorsport enthusiasts to the icy tracks of Zell am See. ​ To explore the history, evolution, and future of the F.A.T. Ice Race, as well as its impact on the automotive world, we sat down with Ferdi Porsche. In this conversation, he shares insights on reviving the event, Porsche’s enduring family spirit, the role of design in his vision, and his thoughts on the next generation of motorsport talent. Ferdi on F.A.T. and its Future Petrolicious:  Tell us a little bit about the FAT Ice race, and why its back? Ferdi Porsche: The ice race started in Selamsee in the 50s, and I honestly think it was an enthusiast event or race, basically. I think they saw that they had a frozen lake and decided to drive some cars around.  I found out about it because my dad bought a car that used to race on the frozen lake and it came with the spike tires and it still had the super long studs in there and I asked him what what it was because it was kind of forgotten already, the ice racing. I had the idea of bringing it back when I was in my architecture studies.  I was looking for something fun to do by the side and so this came at a perfect time. In 2019, we had the first ice race in Zell again. Then we did it twice before COVID. And when COVID hit, I was thinking, Okay, how do I, how do I take this to the next level? And how do I expand it from just one event? And that's when I found F.A.T. International and decided to revive the brand. Petrolicious: What does F.A.T. Stand for? F.A.T. used to stand for Francais Allemand Transit. It was a French German logistics company. And now it just stands for FAT It just literally describes the energy and the vibe of everything that we do basically. Funnily enough the first ice race kind of introduced that without the brand FAT being there. Petrolicious: What are the stars of this years F.A.T. Race? Ferdi: The stars of the show of the 25 Ice Race are probably the F.A.T. cars. Since F.A.T. was a sponsor in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s for all the great cars, Ferraris, Porsches, Mercedes, everything, they naturally take center stage. We brought this tradition back and are now sponsoring cars again. We have the 963 that raced at Le Mans last year here. Sadly, it is not driving because it is not high up enough, but we also have the Dakar cars, the ones that work better on the ice. We have a bunch of WRC cars, so we really have an amazing array of cars this year. That was always the idea of Ice Race, being open to any brand and any manufacturer. I think this year we have 22 different car brands in the race. Petrolicious: What is your favorite Porsche model on the ice this year? Ferdi: That's a difficult question. There's so many different, there's so many cool Porsches that I can't really decide for one. It changes over time. Sometimes I'm more towards the super old stuff, 550s obviously, also because of the history and the connection to ice racing. But obviously I love the Dakar, a sick car, and just the vibe also matches that somehow. It's hard to decide. Petrolicious: What are your long term plans for F.A.T. Ferdi: With F.A.T., we do a bunch of things. We're a young team, and the idea is to do stuff that we like, stuff that we enjoy, because we believe that when we like it, other people will like it too. Obviously, we have the event side of things. Last year, we brought it to Aspen, and I’m looking at where I can bring it next apart from Zell. But we're also looking into the summer. We have our \"Hot on Top\" at Großglockner with Mankei, where we do car meets every month during the summer. The idea is to do stuff that we think is fun. So you can expect F.A.T. to be all around the world many times. Petrolicious: So not just ice? Ferdi: I think F.A.T. works on every terrain. Basically, it got famous through Le Mans. Proper racing on tarmac is where it was kind of born, and it's still happening today with the 963 that we have in Le Mans, but also with the karting league for the kids. So F.A.T. works on every terrain, but its spirit is kind of born from ice racing because it's somewhat more about fun than speed. Petrolicious: As an Architect, how does your design sensibilities influence what you do? Ferdi: I think studying architecture kind of gives you a great opportunity to look at a blank piece of paper and then come up with stuff. So I think that obviously plays into F.A.T. I know what I can and what I can't do. I'm not a graphic designer, but I like paying attention to all of that stuff. And I think the devil and the beauty is in the detail. So that's why everything that we do with F.A.T. is always very detail focused. Obviously, it's sometimes festival and wild, and you can never fully plan an event that happens on a frozen airfield. Everything just is a bit wabi-sabi sometimes, but I think that's also kind of the beauty of it. Petrolicious: Where do you place yourself in within Porsche today? Are you involved with the brand at all in decision making? Ferdi: I think Porsche still has this kind of family business vibe, even though it's obviously a big company now. We build a lot of cars these days, and so many people work for Porsche, but it still has this energy of being a family brand. Obviously, I have a lot of love for the brand and want to see it thrive. Whenever I can give my two cents on something, I do, but I'm not involved in the day-to-day business. Petrolicious: What advice would you give to a young person with limited resources who wants to get into ice racing or racing in general? Ferdi: It depends on how young you are, but I think you should start in the F.A.T. Karting League. It’s the most meritocratic and a cheaper way to get into racing without losing any of the skill-building opportunities. I would advise any young person to start there and see if they have talent. From there, you can work your way through our completely meritocratic system and fight your way into F4 with us. And if you're looking to buy a car, I think what's cool about the car world is that it's very open. It doesn’t really matter if you buy a $20,000 car, a $10,000 car, if you have no car at all, or a $10 million car. In the end, everybody sits together, has a burger, and is the same because they all share the same passion for cars. Petrolicious: Please tell us more about the karting school. Ferdi: Coming from what we do with F.A.T. and the energy we wanted to bring, it was inspired by all the car events I went to as a kid, many of which felt somewhat stuck up and catered to an older crowd. I wanted to do something a bit more rebellious in that space. When I met [Renowned Formula 1 engineer] Rob Smedley and heard about the karting league and what he has done, building these karts that try to change the whole system by making it more approachable for everybody, it felt like the perfect match. That is why we teamed up and are now bringing it to the whole world. This year, we are bringing it to the U.S. for the first time. In the coming years, we are expanding to Asia and the Middle East. The goal is really to create a platform for everybody to start racing. Obviously, it still comes at a certain price, so it is not yet for everybody, but that is how democratization works. You start at some point and then you try to push it down and down. Petrolicious: So you're on the hunt for a Formula 1 driver then? Ferdi: Yes, we're looking for the first female F1 driver. Petrolicious: Mind if I give you a few rapid fire this or that questions? Ferdi: Lets do it. Petrolicious: Lewis at Ferrari or Mercedes?Ferdi: Lewis at Mercedes. Petrolicious: Stuttgart or Maranello?Ferdi: Stuttgart. Petrolicious: Racing in the desert or racing on the ice?Ferdi: Racing on the ice. Petrolicious: 962 or 917?Ferdi: 962. Petrolicious: Turbo or naturally aspirated?Ferdi: Naturally aspirated. Petrolicious: ST or GT3 Touring?Ferdi: ST. Petrolicious: Gravel or tarmac?Ferdi: Gravel. Many thanks to Ferdi Porsche for sitting down with us for a chat. We'll follow up soon on the noble efforts at F.A.T. Karting with a full story. Continue...",
