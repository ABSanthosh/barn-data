    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/private-ev-sales-finally-rise-thanks-cheap-deals-greater-choice",
    "description": "The rise has been put down to keener pricing at the lower end of the market Private customers are turning towards electric cars in greater numbers than ever before in a sign that growing choice at the cheaper end of the market is persuading customers of petrol and diesel models to make the switch. Figures seen by MG show that retail sales of electric cars were up 59% in the first two months of the year, compared with 40% for the EV market overall. With March included, EVs accounted for over a fifth of the new car market, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.  MG attributed the rise to keener pricing at the lower end of the market. “All retail customers want outstanding value for money and the lowest running costs they can possibly get,” Guy Pigounakis, commercial director of MG in the UK, told Autocar. “But the monthly payments outweigh anything else.” For the past couple of years, MG has largely had the budget end of the EV market to itself with the MG 4 EV compact hatchback costing from £27,000 with PCP monthly figures from £269. The electric ZS SUV, now replaced by the S5 EV, also came in below £30,000. But the availability of new models such as the Dacia Spring city car from £14,995 and the Kia EV3 SUV from £33,000 in a segment with pricing normally over £40,000 is helping to lure private sellers towards a market that has so far largely been driven by fleets. Last year, for example, fleets accounted for four out of every five EVs sold in the UK. Tax incentives, including the wildly popular salary sacrifice scheme, have made electric cars cheap enough for company car drivers to make the switch. So much so that Britain’s two million-strong fleet of leased cars is now 37% electric with a massive 53% of new orders being EVs, according to the latest data from the British Vehicle and Leasing Association calculated from 2024 third-quarter figures. Of that two million, just under a fifth are plug-in hybrid, but new orders are now below the total at 17%, demonstrating that electric is now becoming the drivetrain of choice to reduce company car tax bills. The other big driver of EV fleet sales has been Motability, the charity that supplies cars to disabled people in return for their weekly mobility allowance. Motability Operations had 70,000 EVs in its fleet up to the end of last year, with orders for 13,000 more. However, after running hot last year and accounting for around a fifth of all car sales, Motability has backed off in 2025 – for example, cutting its New Vehicle Payment bonus of £750 to new customers. MG reported that Motability orders were down 20% this year, with the company directing its energy back in retail sales to make up that shortfall. Private buyers have largely been locked out of EV incentives, but fierce discounting in the first three months paired with greater model choice has tipped the balance.  Car makers need to hit their ZEV mandate target of 28% EVs (adjusted to around 22% with flexibilities, according to market analyst NewAutomotive) and those furthest away from the target are cutting prices.  Discounts on EVs rose from 9.9% of the car’s total in the last three months of 2024 to 10.2% in the first quarter of this year, according to data from the What Car? Target Price team, translating to an average of £5999 per car. Mazda was the top EV discounter with a whopping 22% off per car, with Jeep at 18% and BMW at 14%, or £11,180 per car. However, as we enter the second quarter, the mood music has changed, with discounts on petrol cars actually moving ahead of those for EVs at 9% versus 8.8% of the list price, according to figures from Pat Hoy, owner of PHA Autodata and long-term provider of What Car?’s Target Price.  Falling discounts on EVs may look concerning for those private customers looking for a cheaper electric car, but figures also show a decline in monthly PCP payments, from £614 on average five months ago to £540 now.  Hoy reckons this is because the current range of EVs available are pulling in more punters. “I think OEMs are sharpening their pencils and getting on with innovating ways to make EVs desirable at the transaction price point,” he said. He also noted a fall in ‘FUD’ (fear, uncertainty and doubt) hit pieces on electric cars in certain sections of the media. Rising interest in retail buyers will gladden the hearts of the biggest leasing customers, who have been saddled with declining resale prices on electric cars that three years ago were forecast to be in hot demand.  For example, Motability posted a £564 million loss last year following a £748m profit the year before as residuals fell across the board.  More cheap EVs are coming into the market now or later this year, including the £15,995 Leapmotor T03, the Renault 5 from £22,995 and the delayed models on the Stellantis Smart Car platform, including the electric Fiat Grande Panda from £20,975 and the Citroën ë-C3 from £22,095. Those models will continue to further expand EV interest thanks to that key motivator, low monthly rates. Pigounakis said: “All retail customers want, and all dealers want, is the cheapest car.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-launches-ev-incentives-win-over-buyers-new-puma",
    "description": "Blue Oval to give all EV buyers free home chargers as it aims to remove concerns about EV switch Ford UK believes the launch of the new Puma Electric can prompt buyers of its existing vehicles to make the switch to electric, and is launching a new range of incentives to help buyers do so. The manufacturer has launched a new Power Promise, giving every buyer of one of its EVs a free home charger with home energy credit from Octopus Energy to cover up to 10,000 miles. That adds to a free five-year service plan including EV towing, and an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the battery and high-voltage components.  Ford currently offers the Mustang Mach-E, Explorer and Capri EVs, which are all bespoke electric cars. But the arrival of an EV version of the smaller Puma – Britain’s best-selling vehicle – is key for the brand’s ambition to grow its EV sales. Catherine Blee, Ford UK’s passenger vehicles sales boss, said: “The Puma has been the best-selling vehicle in the UK for several years, and we have customers who really love that car that have been waiting for an electrified version. There are also some of our Fiesta customers who have been waiting for this vehicle. “Our dealers are really excited: they think this is the game-changer for them in terms of EVs. For some buyers the upfront cost [of going electric] can be a deterrent, but when you can charge at home the total cost of ownership story is really compelling. So with this new scheme we think we can tap into a group of customers by providing a real benefit.” The Power Promise is similar to schemes offered by other manufacturers, and Blee said it was developed based on both customer feedback and a survey that showed 25% of people were put off by the complexity of switching to an EV. “From a customer perspective, having a really compelling offer will help overcome some of those perceived barriers to entry, such as the cost of a wallbox and how to get it installed,” she said. “There are so many anxieties and concerns driven by the myths that are out there, so we want to help people thinking about making the move, and hopefully win over some doubters.” Blee said that the new initiative would run in conjunction with recent efforts to work with dealers to better explain concepts of the total cost of EV ownership. “We know that the next wave of EV customers, the early majority that come after early adopters, are really data-driven individuals, so we can persuade them with a total cost of ownership story,” said Blee. “We’re talking to dealers to give them the tools to explain that to customers. We’re also working on dialling up test drive opportunities, because we know once people get in a test drive of an EV they’re really surprised by how well It drives and how easy it is to switch. “We’ve gone from having just the Mustang Mach-E to having four EVs in dealerships, so we’ve done a lot of work. We’ve been able to make sure we have the right training in place to support dealers with the knowledge that they need, which helps them assist customers in making the right decisions.” While the deal is largely focused around the free charger, people who don’t want one – or can’t have one installed – will instead receive £500 in credit. The firm is also ramping up efforts to promote its virtual Blue Oval Charging Network, which gives access to around 33,000 public chargers through Ford’s app.",

He does it so well, that most customers request ‘a Rough Crafts-style Harley’ and leave it at that. That was almost the story with this imposing, yet refined, Harley-Davidson Street Bob. “He requested the more bling side of Rough Crafts—if that makes sense,” Winston explains. “Some of our bikes are ‘black black,’ and some have some shiny bits and a more luxurious feel. That’s what he was looking for.” Rough Crafts started with a 2022-model Street Bob—a bike that Winston favors for its simple layout and minimalist build. Rough Crafts is based in Taiwan, where strict regulations rule out the possibility of altering a bike’s frame and keeping it street-legal.…",

Called the Mahindra India Design Studio (MIDS), it is located within the company’s Kandivali plant and is a major update to the earlier facility, which was set up in 2015. The company says the new studio has doubled in size and houses just over one hundred design employees.  New India studio employs over 100 designers MIDS will serve the new last-mile mobility and auto divisions It will work alongside Mahindra Advanced Design Europe in the UK Mahindra India Design Studio: what is it for? To serve both commercial and private auto divisions The upgrade has been designed to cater to Mahindra’s growing portfolio of its auto business as well as support its new businesses like its Last Mile Mobility (LME) division. MIDS has the capability to design its last mile commercial vehicles and small tractors to the brand’s trucks and buses, too. It also includes three modelling plates, one of which is large enough to handle truck cabins. A modelling plate is a work area upon which a 1:1 scale clay model can be built using a 5-axis modelling robot and skilled modellers. Speaking to Autocar India at the inauguration Ajay Saran Sharma, Sr. Vice President of Design and Head of MIDS said “the facility includes all design functions required today right from exterior, interior to quality realisation and tech HMI design too”. Has its own paint shop for clay models and body panels Mahindra says MIDS will work along with Mahindra’s global design centre – Mahindra Advanced Design Europe (MADE), situated in the UK. Speaking to Autocar India at the inauguration Pratap Bose, Mahindra’s Chief Design and Creative Officer said “both centres will exist and work together, but I’m happy that with this investment in design in India, we can attract and keep talented designers in an India automotive company”. The design centre also has a paint shop for the clay models and car panels which Bose says saves time for the design team as well as the management who can come in for quicker reviews.
