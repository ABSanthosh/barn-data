    "description": "This 1975 Maserati Bora is one of 564 examples manufactured during a seven-year production run and is one of approximately 275 built with power from a 4.9-liter DOHC V8. Chassis 916 was completed in April 1975 and was delivered new through Maserati Automobiles in Los Angeles. The car is said to have remained under ownership in California between the early 1990s and 2017 when it was moved to Florida and underwent a cosmetic refurbishment that included a repaint in Blu Ischia Metallizzato. A subsequent mechanical refurbishment included a rebuild and overbore of the engine and its four Weber carburetors. Additional features include a ZF five-speed manual transaxle, Bosch electronic ignition, a Citroën hydraulic system, four-wheel independent suspension, 15” Campagnolo alloy wheels, and blue and black leather interior upholstery. This Bora was purchased by the current owner on BaT in May 2022 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Illinois with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, records, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner's LLC.",

    "description": "The Reise name is quite nascent in the Indian biking community. Initially known for their tyres, particularly off-road-centric ones, the brand later forayed into the motorcycle gear space by retailing products from other manufacturers. Now, Reise has launched their own line, and when they offered to provide us with jackets for review, I was particularly pleased to get my hands on the Reise PineAir jacket. After using it for over three months, here’s what I’ve gathered. The front pockets are waterproof and keep items safe during unexpected showers. At a glance, it’s a smart-looking jacket, no doubt. The beige colour certainly has its own appeal in a world dominated by darker riding gear. It features Velcro adjustments on the arms and back to ensure a snug fit. The front pockets, mind you, are waterproof, and after being caught in a few unexpected showers, I can personally vouch for that claim. The PineAir comes with a comprehensive protection package, by which I mean it features CE Level 2-certified armour for the elbows, shoulders, back and chest. A low-speed fall on a broken concrete road gave me the chance to ‘test’ the elbow armour. I’m happy to report that the armour absorbed all the impact, leaving my hand injury-free, save for a minor bruise from the armour. Could’ve been worse. The jacket material did pick up a few abrasions in the accident, but it was a worthy sacrifice, and the jacket is still perfectly usable.  Frequently touched areas are prone to collecting dirt on this beige colour jacket.  Now, we’re based in Mumbai, and this year, temperatures consistently hovered around the 35-degC mark (felt more like 40 due to the humidity). I must say, at a standstill, the heat does build up significantly; traffic stops made me feel like a potato wrapped in aluminium foil roasting over an open fire. However, once I got moving, the airflow improved considerably. Of course, the Reise PineAir is primarily a touring jacket, and that shows on the highway, where the ventilation works best, something the swarming traffic of Mumbai isn’t quite representative of. On the topic of it being a touring jacket, there is a bit of heft to it, and its 2.2kg weight does become cumbersome during city runs.  Cordura enhances protection along with the CE Level 2-certified armour. Remember that beautiful sand colour I liked so much? Well, over time, I also learned that it’s quite prone to collecting dirt, especially on frequently touched areas like the pockets, wrist cuffs and collar. While a wash does clean it up, it’s something to keep in mind, as it can leave a visible mark without much effort, but fortunately, there is also a stealthy black colour available.   The PineAir offers solid protection, ample storage and stylish looks, and at a price of Rs 10,000, this is a good alternative to other Indian-made jackets at a similar price.

    "description": "Hero MotoCorp has recently faced turbulence in its sales numbers and market share. Part of the problem is that its overarching success lies in the 100-110cc commuter bike category, which has seen a declining trend in recent years. The other part is that none of its more recent, premium products – except for the Xtreme 125R – have set the sales charts on fire. The company is seeking to replicate that sort of success in the premium 125cc scooter segment as well, and the all-new Destini 125 is its first tool at chipping into that space. So, can this revamped Destini 125 help Hero on its journey towards a more premium identity? Hero Destini 125 design and features - 7/10 Has the basics covered but is lacking in some crucial areas The Destini 125 has a typical family scooter look (for the most part), with pleasing lines and a safe design. This holds true when you see the scooter from the front, but as your eyes snake their way to the back, you’ll notice that Hero has gone down an unconventional route when it comes to the tail-lamp and rear indicators. The tail-lamp is shaped like the letter H – an increasingly common signature across Hero products – and the turn signals are stacked on top of it. While there is no functional problem, this is a polarising design choice in a segment dominated by inoffensive designs.  Hero Destini 125 key specificationsHero Destini 125Kerb Weight115kgSeat Height770mmGround Clearance162mmFuel Tank capacity5.3 litresWheelbase1302mm A concealed fuel filler cap is an improvement, but the space to get your fingers around the cap is a little tight. Fit and finish is one area where Hero still has some ways to go. The indicator and horn buttons feel quite plasticky, the cover for the USB charging port feels flimsy, and the fuel filler lid’s panel doesn’t sit flush on the left side. Speaking of the fuel filler, the empty space around the lid is a little tight for those with larger hands, and tightening the cap once you’ve refuelled takes a little dexterity.  Lack of a brake lock clasp is a crucial miss on a gearless scooter; parking on a slope will necessitate some caution. It also misses out on a brake lock clasp, which is a must-have on a gearless scooter. The mirrors, while well-shaped, have rather short stalks, which means a quarter of your rear view is obstructed by your elbow. Another area where the Destini lags behind its rivals is storage capacity. While it has the basics covered, with a luggage hook on the front apron and a spacious cubby that can fit a 1-litre water bottle, its 19-litre underseat storage area is quite small. This is especially true in comparison to the TVS Jupiter models, which offer class-leading levels of boot space in the ICE scooter game.  A boot light is a nice feature to have, but the 19-litre underseat storage area is one of the smallest in this class. That’s not to say it’s devoid of features, and in addition to a side-stand cutoff, auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and a USB charger, you also have the option to pair your smartphone with the display. Once paired, you can receive turn-by-turn navigation prompts, as well as call and SMS alerts. While all of this is nice to have, the display has its oddities. For instance, the odometer and clock are hard to tell apart at a quick glance, and, on a sunny day, even at full brightness, the smaller digits on the screen are hard to make out. The digital LCD screen has some good features like turn-by-turn navigation, although it could be a little brighter. Hero Destini 125 ride and handling - 8/10 Overall comfort levels are quite high; it is a predictable handler One area where the Destini is a rather accomplished machine is in its ride comfort. The generously padded seat, spacious ergonomics, and plush suspension setup work together to make the Destini one of the most comfortable scooters around. We recently tested the newest Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter 110, so with that fresh in our minds, we can report back that the suspension and seat comfort on the Destini feel superior to those of the aforementioned scooters.   Hero Destini 125 underpinningsHero Destini 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc / DrumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12 The suspension absorbs most of what comes in the way very well and is among the best in this segment. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, the Destini is a sure-footed machine even at higher speeds, and the larger rear wheel also helps to some extent when going over bigger bumps. Being a family scooter, the Destini makes no pretences of being an energetic handler, and it prioritises stability over flickability.  Stopping performance is commensurate with rivals and the CBS works well, but the brakes are devoid of feel. As with other offerings in the class, the Destini gets combi-brakes, and while there is sufficient stopping power to be had, the brakes felt devoid of feel and always necessitated a firm pull when coming to a halt. Hero Destini 125 performance and fuel economy - 7/10 Fuel efficiency and performance are commendable, but refinement could improve At the first ride event last year, Hero told us that while the latest Destini uses the same engine block as the previous-gen model, the company had gone to great lengths to improve refinement, mileage, and reliability over a longer duration. While it has succeeded in some areas, there’s still some work to be done.  Hero Destini 125 performanceAcceleration0-40kph3.8s0-80kph16.07sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.97s30-70kph10.86s50-80kph10.62sBraking 60-0kph (in metres)18.53m We’ll begin with the positives. The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well.  The 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better. Fuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel.  With its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class. While the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds.  Mirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view. What was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark. We have reached out to Hero and will update the web version of this story once we discover what the issue was. Hero Destini 125 price and verdict - 7/10 It is now a better scooter, but still some distance away from the best in class In our time with it, we’ve discovered that the Destini 125 has strengths and weaknesses that are common across most Hero products. It is exceptionally comfortable, rather frugal, and backed by the company’s extensive retail sales network. At the same time, weaknesses such as fit and finish that leaves you wanting, and a lacklustre engine sour this package, especially now that the 125cc scooter class has some seriously impressive competitors.  The i3s start-stop system could be quicker in its operation. Ranging between Rs 81,850 and Rs 91,700 (ex-showroom, Delhi), it is priced on par with its rivals and doesn’t have the upper hand there either. Comfort and frugality are two big factors people look for in a scooter, and the Destini has those areas covered, but its shortcomings are enough to prevent it from rising to the top of the class.

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper.

The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Common features include LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, a wireless charger, a digital instrument cluster, a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, leatherette upholstery, auto climate control, six airbags, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful.

Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

I was hoping they might divert a little more radically from their signature cruiser look, but the Street 500 felt like a less inspired, smaller-displacement, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled vanilla version of an 883 to me. Then, as if Harley had tuned into my gripes, I learned of their plans to bring flat track racing to the masses with intentions of adding the event to the X Games and using the new Street 750 as the platform. At the same time, The Speed Merchant dropped us a line from California to say they were building a tracker-inspired Harley Street 500 to be unveiled at Born Free 6.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hyundai-reveal-new-electric-crossover-next-few-months",
    "description": "The Bayon arrived in 2021 New model is expected to sit between Inster and Kona Electric and be twinned with Kia's upcoming EV2 Hyundai will reveal a electric crossover, likely an electric alternative to the Bayon, in \"the next few months\" as it pushes to expand its EV offerings. Understood by Autocar to be twinned with sibling brand Kia’s incoming EV2, the crossover will plug the gap between the incoming Inster and the Kona Electric. This size, thought to be near to that of the combustion-powered Bayon, will position it as a rival to the likes of the Renault 4 and Volvo EX30. It will be revealed “in the next few months”, new European CEO Xavier Martinet said, with a launch currently confirmed by Hyundai for the third quarter of 2026, meaning deliveries could begin as soon as next July. It is understood Kia’s EV2, previewed by the EV2 concept, will arrive a few months before it. “We are very much involved with the electrification of our line-up and to increase our electrified mix in the coming years,” said Martinet. Like the EV2, the car will be based on the same scalable E-GMP platform that is used by nearly all Hyundai Motor Group – Hyundai, Kia, Genesis – EVs. It's therefore likely to get a similar set-up to the slightly larger Kia EV3, which is offered with either a 58.3kWh or 81.4kWh battery pack offering ranges 267 and 372 miles respectively. All versions of the EV3 are powered by a single electric motor that sends 201bhp and 209lb ft through the front wheels. Inside, the new electric car will bring a “step change” in usability for Hyundai which includes a new infotainment system that, Autocar has been told, will allow for elements, such as ambient lighting and noise, to alter depending on driving modes or style. Like the incoming EV2, it is also expected to get the same combined instrument and infotainment display set-up, which spans roughly half the width of the dashboard. As eith the closely related Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5, pricing for the new crossover will likely be close to the EV2, which has been pencilled to cost around €30,000 (£25,000). When it arrives next year, it will be the sixth electric car in Hyundai’s growing EV line-up, following the Ioniq 9 flagship that is due to hit UK roads in the coming months.",

    "description": "Priced from £54k, the new powertrain packs 242bhp and an electric-only range of up to 59 miles The Volkswagen Multivan and its camper van counterpart the California have gained the four-wheel drive with the introduction of a new plug-in-hybrid powertrain. Priced from £54,525 in the Multivan and £71,295 in the California, the new system comprises a turbocharged 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, a six-speed automatic gearbox and two electric motors (one per axle).  They combine to put out 242bhp, allowing the van to complete the 0-62mph sprint in 9.0sec. A 19.7kWh lithium ion battery gives an electric-only range of up to 59 miles, depending on the chosen model; the California is less energy-efficient, due to its extra weight. The battery can be charged at a rate of up to 50kW on a DC connection or at up to 11kW on AC. Volkswagen said it has devised the PHEV system to run on electric power as often as possible.  The front motor takes priority over its rear-mounted counterpart or the petrol engine. The engine is primarily used to generate electricity, driving the wheels only when the battery is flat or when the gearbox kickdown is activated.  The rear motor is also decoupled from the powertrain above 81mph (130kmh) to improve energy efficiency. The new four-wheel-drive powertrain replaces the Multivan’s previous 1.4-litre PHEV option.",

    "description": "The Renault Triber facelift has been spied testing with substantial styling changes on the front end. Renault India MD and CEO Venkatram Mamillapalle confirmed earlier this year that the Kiger and Triber would receive facelifts later in 2025, and a newly-spotted test mule of the updated sub-4-metre MPV suggests that it may sport a bevy of design tweaks. Renault Triber facelift gets new LED headlights, restyled front bumper Interior design likely to be retained from current Triber with new materials and features Facelifted Triber's engine options are expected to remain unchanged  2025 Renault Triber facelift exterior and interior design New LED headlights and revised front bumper Recent spy shots of a heavily camouflaged Triber test mule reveal that up front, the facelifted compact MPV will get reshaped headlights containing a sleek LED strip on the upper edge. This headlight design interestingly mirrors that of Nissan’s upcoming Triber-based MPV, which was teased a few months ago and is confirmed to launch early next year in India. Image credit: vshankar88 via YouTube The similarities to the Nissan MPV end there for now, though, as the Triber facelift’s front bumper has a much larger air dam, repositioned fog lamp units, and potentially a different grille design. Moving to the side, we expect new alloy wheels for the Triber facelift as well, but the rear end likely won’t be all that different from the current model, save for perhaps new LED signatures in the tail-lamps and an updated bumper. Interior changes for Triber facelift Current Renault Triber dashboard used for representation. Inside, the Triber facelift’s dashboard is expected to receive mild design tweaks, lighter shades, more soft-touch materials and an expanded features list, much like the refreshed Nissan Magnite that went on sale last year. 2025 Renault Triber facelift engine and gearbox No major mechanical changes anticipated On the powertrain front, we expect the Triber facelift to carry on with the current model’s 1.0-litre naturally aspirated three-cylinder petrol unit that generates 72hp and 96Nm. Gearbox options will most likely be the same as well, comprising a 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT.

    "description": "The Kia Carens Clavis EV will be launched on July 15, 2025. Not only will the Carens Clavis EV be Kia's first mass-market EV for India, it will also sit in a unique space as one of only two electric MPVs in the market for now. The other one is the BYD eMax 7, which happens to be the Carens Clavis EV's direct rival and is currently priced at Rs 26.90-29.90 lakh (ex-showroom). Kia Carens Clavis EV expected to come with 42kWh, 51.4kWh batteries Electric MPV will likely get new alloy wheels, redesigned bumpers, and more Carens Clavis EV interior and feature list expected to mirror ICE version Kia Carens Clavis EV battery and range 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery options. Kia Carens Clavis EV test mule The Carens Clavis EV is anticipated to offer the same powertrains as the Hyundai Creta Electric, namely 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery pack options mated to a sole electric motor mounted on the front axle. Output numbers for both powertrains may be identical to those of the Creta Electric, but given that the Carens Clavis is dimensionally larger than the Hyundai SUV, expect slightly lower claimed range and performance figures for the MPV's all-electric counterpart. Prior spy shots of the Carens Clavis EV also point to a different suspension setup than the ICE version, likely to support the added weight of the battery packs and motors. Kia Carens Clavis EV exterior design Similar styling to ICE Carens Clavis, but with smaller differentiators. Kia Carens Clavis rear end. Image used for representation only. The Carens Clavis EV will look mostly identical to the ICE Carens Clavis, sporting the LED ‘ice cube’ patterned headlights that extend into the front bumper and slimmer LED light bar at the rear. However, Kia will likely incorporate some notable EV-specific styling flourishes on the Carens Clavis EV, such as revised front and rear bumpers, aero-optimised alloy wheels, and more. Kia Carens Clavis EV interior and features Kia Carens Clavis dashboard. Image used for representation only. Much like the exterior, Kia isn't expected to change the ICE Carens Clavis' cabin layout for its EV counterpart. To that end, the Carens Clavis EV may offer a premium, neatly organised dual-tone dashboard with a dual-screen setup comprising a 12.3-inch infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display. Packed features list and safety suite. The overall list of creature comforts for the Carens Clavis EV will most likely mirror that of the ICE Carens Clavis, with features including ventilated front seats, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a panoramic sunroof, premium Bose sound system, 4-way electrically adjustable driver’s seat, cabin air purifier, wireless charger, and so on. As far as safety goes, the Carens Clavis EV is anticipated to offer 6 airbags, front and rear disc brakes, traction control, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill assist control, vehicle stability management, and more as standard. Level 2 ADAS could also be equipped in pricier trim levels. Also see: Kia Carens Clavis review: Carens goes upmarket Kia Seltos: your questions answered",
