    "description": "It’s hard not to get carried away when riding on mountain roads in Southern California. Maybe it's the crisp, cool high-altitude air that tricks you into feeling relaxed, even when the speeds are anything but. We certainly got carried away in the twisties during our first ride aboard the new Royal Enfield Bear 650, and it wasn’t entirely to do with that cool mountain air. Confused? Understandable. After all, why should a scrambler-ised version of the already hefty and not very sharp Interceptor be egging us on in the corners? Well, as it turns out, the Bear is much more than just a scrambler-ised Interceptor. Royal Enfield Bear 650: design, features Sure, many of the changes have been made with the intent of making the Bear better suited to off-roading. You’ve now got an upside-down fork (in place of the Interceptor’s conventional unit) offering more travel – up from 110mm to 130mm. It’s a similar story at the rear, too; the Bear sticks with a twin shock setup, but travel has grown from 88mm to 115mm. As a result, seat height and ground clearance have also increased, and now stand at 830mm and 184mm, respectively. But to accommodate the new suspension components and adapt the bike to its more off-road-focused role, Royal Enfield has had to strengthen the frame in multiple areas. It’s the same basic frame as the Interceptor, but it has now been braced in various areas to add strength and stiffness, and the sub-frame has been revised as well. The end result is a chassis that feels noticeably stiffer than the Interceptor’s. Attacking corners hard, the Bear does feels hinged in the middle, and the sort of mid-corner bumps that would have the Interceptor wobbling and wallowing all over the place are simply shrugged off. There’s great feedback and you really have the confidence to keep carrying more speed into a corner, and leaning further and further, despite the more off-road centric 19in/17in wheel on offer. This is also, in no small part, down to the excellent new tyres wrapped around those wheels – you’re unlikely to have heard of the MRF Nylorex tyres before and that’s because they’re a new dual-purpose model that have been developed specifically for this motorcycle. Despite the blocky pattern, the grip, profile and predictably on the road were superb, and there were no complaints when on tarmac. Part of the Bear’s playfulness in the twisties can also be attributed to the suspension setup. The front fork strikes a nice balance between comfort and performance, but the shocks feel rather firm and unforgiving. This was the case across riders of different weights, even at the minimum preload setting. On the largely excellent Californian tarmac, it wasn’t a deal-breaker, but the firm edge could be felt, and rough patches translated to my backside without sufficient mitigation. How this setup fares on the less than perfect roads back home is something we’ll have to find out in due course. Royal Enfield Bear 650: performance, ergonomics Many of the numbers are bigger with the new Bear, and while most of that is good, one big number that’s got some people a little apprehensive is the seat height. Yes, 830mm is definitely on the taller side – I’m not very tall, only 5’8”, which means I can’t flat-foot both feet. That said, it isn’t unmanageable either, and with a little bit of forward planning, you can comfortably pick either one side to flat-foot. It also helps that the footpegs are now a little further forward, so they don’t foul your shins as much. The other change to the riding position is the handlebar, which is wider and a little further away from you. The wider part is nice, it gives you more leverage over the bike, which I like. The further away part, I’m not such a fan of – it’s a bit more of a forward reach than I’d like, and if you’re short like me, then this could become a point of fatigue over long rides. On the upside, this is now a lighter motorcycle than the model it’s based on. Moving to this new 2-into-1 exhaust setup has helped shed a bunch of weight, though some of that has been added back through the suspension and the frame strengthening. Nevertheless, it is still 2kg lighter than the Interceptor. However, at 216kg, still a fairly hefty motorcycle. You only really feel this at low speeds and when paddling about, and once you’re on the move, the Bear masks its weight rather well. The new exhaust has done more than just trimming the weight – it’s also allowed RE to squeeze out some more torque from the motor; it now produces 56.5Nm vs the 52Nm we’ve seen from it so far. So the engine feels a little more punchy now, while still remaining the pleasant, fairly refined, characterful motor that we’ve fallen in love with over the last 6 years. The new exhaust has slightly changed the sound, though. It exits a little closer to you and doesn’t run quite as far back as the twin-pipe designs, which is one of the factors at play. Overall, it’s a little more braap-y and raspy, as opposed to the more sweet-sounding twin pipe 650s. I think this suits the character of the Bear rather well. Royal Enfield Bear 650: off-road performance Now, we come to the big question of off-road performance. We didn’t have a great deal of opportunity to ride the Bear off-road – we only got a short spin up and down a fairly simple gravel track. But the feeling is that this is definitely more of a soft-roader than a hardcore off-roader. The suspension can absorb some hits, up to a point, and these new tyres seem to work well off-road. The rear ABS can also be turned off. So yes, you can have some fun off-road. But the weight makes its presence felt, and the ergos are halfway between on-road and off-road, so this is not a bike you’d want to push very hard when the tarmac runs out. But you won’t have to turn around either. Turning off that rear ABS is done through a fully-digital TFT display –  this is the first Royal Enfield 650 to get one, and it’s the same unit you’ll find on the Himalayan. Which means, you also get features like Bluetooth connectivity and Google Maps integration. It’s also the first RE 650 to get full-LED lighting. The only other noteworthy feature is a USB charging port, but as is the case with all REs now, there is a comprehensive list of accessories that covers the usual suspects, like touring mirrors and a touring seat, as well as more scrambler-specific items like a sump guard and a headlight grille. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The final piece of the puzzle is the price – and starting at Rs 3.39 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and going up to Rs 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), the Bear sits between the Interceptor and GT on one end and the Shotgun and Super Meteor on the other. Having ridden it around California, it feels like the most versatile and competent RE 650 today. It can cruise, it can tour, it can commute, you can corner pretty hard – it’s a great road bike – and it’s got some off-road ability as well. But how much of a pain the firm suspension setup will be back home in India is something we’ll only be able to tell you a little further down the road. Test rides and deliveries begin on November 10, so it shouldn’t be too long before we find out. Also See: Royal Enfield Bear 650 video review",

    "description": "Entry-level Sealion 7 gets 308bhp, enough for a 0-62mph time of 6.7sec Electric family SUV is one of six new models the Chinese giant will introduce in Europe by 2025 BYD has released fresh details on its new Tesla Model Y rival, the Sealion 7. It's the brand’s first European model to use a new development of the architecture that underpins the existing Atto 3 crossover, Dolphin hatchback and Seal saloon, named e-Platform 3.0 Evo. It uses cell-to-body construction (in which battery cells are mounted directly to the chassis) with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery and can support a range of motor configurations. The entry-level Sealion 7 Comfort gets a single 308bhp, 280lb ft motor mounted on its rear axle, plus an 82.5kWh battery that gives a range of 300 miles between charges. The lightest variant, it weighs 2225kg and can dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in 6.7sec. The middle-rung Design adds a 215bhp motor to the front axle, giving four-wheel drive and outputs of 523bhp and 509lb ft. The extra motor increases the car’s mass to 2340kg and cuts its range to 283 miles but also slashes its 0-62mph time to 4.5sec. The range-topping Excellence uses the same 523bhp powertrain but gets a larger 91.3kWh battery, giving it a range of 312 miles. With this larger battery and extra interior kit (including nappa leather seats and a head-up display), the Sealion 7 weighs 2435kg. Nonetheless, it can hit 62mph in the same 4.5sec as the Design. Both the Comfort and Design cars can be charged at a rate of up to 150kW on a DC connection, taking 32 minutes to go from 10-80%. The Excellence is upgraded to a 230kW peak, cutting that time to 24 minutes. A heat pump (which more efficiently generates heat for the cabin than a conventional fan heater, boosting the car's range in cold conditions) is fitted to all versions as standard. Inside, the Sealion 7 gets a 15.6in infotainment touchscreen that is capable of rotating between portrait and landscape orientations and features a new voice control system. This is said to be capable of detecting which of the five occupants is speaking from four zones inside the car, allowing the system to make tweaks specific to where the person is sitting. Asking the car to reduce the temperature from the rear seats will tweak the rear climate zone, for instance. The Sealion 7 is also fitted with a 10.25in instrument display, four USB ports (two up front and two in the back) and a vehicle-to-load socket, allowing the car’s battery to power external devices up to 3.3kW. Boot space is claimed to measure 520 litres with the rear seats up and 1789 litres with them folded down. UK deliveries of the Sealion 7 are due to begin early next year. Prices have yet to be announced, but it’s expected to be positioned above the Seal saloon, which starts at £45,695.  It is one of six new models (three battery-electric cars and three plug-in hybrids) that the Chinese brand will be launching in Europe over the next 14 months.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/trip-down-memory-lane-jowett-javelin",
    "description": "Cropley's first memories of the motor car were developed in the back seat of this unusual 1950s classic The Jowett Javelin was one of the first cars in which I was driven as a very young kid – the third car, I think. It sticks in the memory because one of my parents’ friends had one and was very proud of it, to the point of bothering to explain its finer points to a seven-year-old. Unusually for the time, this woman loved cars and knew a lot about them: she was the person who first explained to me what was different about a flat-four engine (the Javelin had an aluminium 1.5-litre unit mounted ahead of the front wheels, driving the rears) compared with the inline fours and sixes contemporary cars had. She also talked about aerodynamics – this car, she reckoned, benefited very much from what we had learned about ‘streamlining’ from the wartime design of Spitfires and Hurricanes. She even explained torsion bar suspension (the Javelin had it at both ends) and how certain types of steel, made into bars, could act like springs if you twisted them. My best memory is of the way she drove the car. In its day the Javelin (made between 1947 and 1953) was a lively performer, although 0-50mph in 13-odd seconds may no longer set your trousers on fire. But this keen owner was aware that a Javelin had competed successfully in the Monte Carlo Rally, and she took that as licence to chuck it about a bit with us kids in the back. We’re talking late 1950s here, so my impressions can’t be relied on, but I definitely remember this Javelin as being faster and nimbler than my old man’s battered Ford Consul. Weirdly, my Javelin consciousness has stayed with me, although I’ve never driven one. What I still love is the optimism and ambition that emerged in British car and motorcycle design from the technological advances of the war years. The twin British systemic failures, as we know, were in series production and marketing: the UK started the post-war era with the world’s biggest car export market but soon lost it to the Americans and Japanese, who knew how to make cars profitably and have them hang together. The Jowett was killed off by cost, gearbox failures, crankshaft breakages and the company’s general inability to please the customer. Even my parents’ family friend finished up in a Holden like everyone else. But I still look at the Javelin’s sleek Gerald Palmer shape, admire its spacious cabin and remember how it responded to enthusiastic steering inputs. It was an era whose star cars are now largely forgotten or glossed over, but the Javelin deserves its little place in the ranks of ambitious cars, even if it never truly made it.",

The founder of Fuller Moto couldn’t get the big boxer out of his mind—so when he was finally approached to build a custom R18, you’d better believe he was on board. The original BMW R18 concept bike was heavily inspired by the BMW R5—a bike that Bryan has been lucky enough to study closely. But when the R18 finally hit the market, it had grown considerably in size. Once you get the mammoth power cruiser off the line, the weight magically disappears and it’s a total hoot to ride.

    "description": "Hyundai’s Creta iVT is a hot favourite of our long term fleet, and that’s down to how convenient and fuss-free a companion it is. Here to give a taste of another flavour of the Creta is the N Line. A 160hp turbo-petrol engine, dual-clutch transmission, and tweaked steering and suspension promise a more involving driving experience, something I, its custodian, have a good few months to make the most of. However, for me, this version of the Creta appeals first and foremost for the way it looks. Its larger 18-inch rims alone uplift the stance successfully, and then there’s the rest of the N Line trimmings. The sportier bumpers, side skirts, roof spoiler and red detailing add up to give the Creta N Line genuine visual distinction among the sea of ‘ordinary’ Cretas. The iVT looks plain vanilla when standing alongside. N Line-specific details add greatly to the look. I like what Hyundai has done with the interior, too. The all-black treatment with red highlights works to bring in some sportiness to the ambience. The N Line-specific steering is also great to hold, and even the metal finish to the pedals is a detail not lost on me. For the full effect, I’ve made the Sport screen (carbon-fibre look) the default layout for the digital instruments. I’m not entirely satisfied with my seating position though. The digital screen and centre touchscreen are positioned a touch low for my liking. Oh, and the absence of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto was an irritant during my initial days with the Creta. A Rs 99 wire did help get past the issue, but I’d rather not have my phone plugged in for more time than required. Crisp cameras and multiple views are a boon. Our N Line is in top-spec N10 form and the goodies on board are being put to, well, good use. Front seat ventilation is a hit with everyone who experiences it, and I like the sound from the Bose sound system. I’m no audiophile but there is enough depth to the sound to satisfy my ears. What I really appreciate are the cameras. The front view camera is very handy in judging parking space, and the blind view monitors are a boon, too. Camera resolution and performance are impressive and better than what you get in many pricier cars. Exhaust note should have been jazzed up for the N Line. We’re in the thick of the festive season as I file this report, which means traffic is at its yearly worst. Forget about letting the 160 horses under the hood loose, getting into fourth gear is an achievement on my daily commute these days. The stop/start driving means the dual-clutch gearbox has to work overtime, and it’s not particularly a fan of frequent shifts at low speeds. There’s the occasional delay and the odd jerky shift at other times. The Creta iVT offers a far smoother experience in the same environment. The N Line can be had with a 6-speed manual, too, but it’d be too committed a choice for my kind of driving. The other thing? The N Line’s larger 18-inch wheels also manifest in a busier ride. You feel more of the surface below, and it’s not quite as pliant as other Cretas on 17-inch rims. There’s more weight at the steering, too – great when you’re on a twisty road, not so much when you have a tight parking to work your car into. Low-speed city driving has taken its toll on economy. What’s also pinching a bit is fuel economy. I’ve been averaging all of 7.9kpl but my 10km round trip through choc-a-block traffic doesn’t let the engine have it easy at any point. The real-time figure improves dramatically (upwards of 10kpl) over late night drives on emptier roads. I would have liked more background music on said drives from the exhaust. The twin tip exhaust is just for show and sound levels are no higher than a regular Creta, which is a shame. I intend to end the year with a few weekend getaways, and the plan is to select routes with some good driving roads as well. I’ll keep you posted on my learnings on those. Initial impressions are of being with the best looking Creta, but not necessarily the best Creta per se.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.

    "description": "Kia has begun testing the second-generation Seltos internationally. The Seltos has been around since 2019, and its next-gen model will debut sometime next year. New Seltos could be similar in dimensions to the current one Will likely get an all-new design language, with heavily revised front and rear   Multiple powertrains expected; petrol-hybrid may come later Next-gen Kia Seltos: what do the spy shots reveal? The spy shots of the next-gen Seltos reveal that the overall size and silhouette remain similar to the current model, save for the front and rear styling, which seem to have undergone major changes. While the prototype is heavily covered, one can make out redesigned front and rear fascia with new headlamps and tail-lamps. While the rear styling seems very similar to the Kia EV5 SUV, the front styling appears quite unique and unlike any Kia model in the market. The heavily covered nose seems rather upright and shows two squarish headlamp units with LED daytime running lamps on the outline. The front grille appears to be rectangular with vertical slats. While these design cues may not be final, they point at a new design direction for the Seltos. Next-gen Kia Seltos: powertrain details Not much is known about the powertrain, but we expect Kia to offer multiple fuel options, starting with a turbo petrol and a turbo diesel and introducing a petrol-hybrid version at some point. Kia has earlier hinted that it is evaluating petrol-hybrid powertrains for its models in India.   Next-gen Kia Seltos: India launch timeline Sources tell us that the all-new Seltos’ could debut globally sometime in the second quarter of 2025. We expect the all-new Creta rival to come to India sometime in late next year or early 2026. Before the all-new Seltos, Kia will introduce as many as three models in India next year, the first being an all-new compact SUV (codenamed AY), followed by the Carens facelift and the Carens EV by mid-2025.

    "description": "Mercedes-AMG has confirmed the development of an all-electric super SUV, which will be underpinned by its own AMG.EA platform. The new model will rival the Lotus Eletre, the upcoming Porsche Cayenne electric and the BMW XM hybrid. Will be the second model to sit on AMG.EA architecture Will be a spritiual successor to the AMG GLE 63  Super SUV to be wholly developed by AMG Just as the XM was developed from the ground up by BMW's M division, the new Mercedes is being developed wholly by AMG, rather than being based on an existing model like the EQS SUV. It is expected to arrive in 2026, following the launch of the second-generation Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door coupe – the first car that will use the AMG.EA architecture. The AMG.EA is a development of Mercedes' mainstream MB.EA platform that's been modified to use advanced electric motors from Yasa, an Oxfordshire (UK)-based firm. Its axial-flux units put out up to 480hp, yet weigh just 24kg. The AMG.EA architecture can support a pair of motors on each of its axles, suggesting that the most extreme cars to use this platform could comfortably offer over 1,000hp. The structure will also feature 800V electricals and an AMG-specific battery pack using a silicon anode. The new super SUV will be positioned as a successor to the existing Mercedes-AMG GLE 63. The new Mercedes-AMG super SUV will be a larger and more luxurious proposition. AMG insiders have previously told our sister publication Autocar UK that it's size is similar to the low-slung Vision AMG concept shown in 2022, at around 5.1m long, with a wheelbase of more than 3.0m.
