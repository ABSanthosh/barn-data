    "description": "This Fiat 508CS Balilla Spider Sport is noted to have been initially delivered to Fiat's French subsidiary SAFAF as a rolling chassis in 1935 and subsequently outfitted by Carrosserie Kelsch with \"Coppa d'Oro\" bodywork featuring full-flowing fenders. Chassis 13442 underwent a refurbishment at some point prior to 2008, when it was acquired by the previous owner. Further work was later carried out in the early 2020s by D.L. George Historic Motorcars of Cochranville, Pennsylvania, after which the car was purchased by the seller in 2021. The red-over-red spider is powered by an 1,100cc overhead-valve inline-four that breathes through a single Solex carburetor, while shifting is via a four-speed manual transmission. It rides on 17\" wire wheels and is further equipped with hydraulic drum brakes and Houdaille lever-arm shock absorbers at all four corners. Further details include staggered seating for two, Jaeger instrumentation, a tan soft top, and Marchal headlamps with amber bulbs. This 508CS Spider Sport is now offered with a New Hampshire title in the seller's name that lists the vehicle as a 1933 model.",

    "description": "The Bajaj-made Triumph Scrambler 400 X has been around for a couple of years, and while its sibling – the Speed 400 range – has seen some updates as well as the addition of the new T4 model, there hasn’t been much for the Scrambler, until now. Bajaj’s solution to spice things up for 2025 is the new Scrambler XC. In the big Scrambler 1200, the XC moniker meant more off-road capability, but that isn’t the case here. The XC is very similiar to the X in most fundamental ways. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC design and features - 8/10  Excel cross-spoke wheels look cool, replace the 400 X's alloys. Instead, the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC gets a number of additional components, but none of it change the way it performs. The biggest upgrade, from both a visual and functional standpoint, would be the new cross-spoked wheels. Unlike the Akront wheels on the Himalayan 450, these are Excel rims, which is no bad thing considering that Excel is widely considered as one of the best in the business.  The 400 XC's tubeless cross-spoke wheels come from Excel. There is a significant change in the weight (it's up by five kilos to 190kg), which is because there are a number of other additions made to the bike. All of these are available as accessories on the Scrambler 400 X, which includes a colour-matched flyscreen, headlamp grille, a colour-matched tall front fender, a radiator guard, sump guard and lower engine crash guard. The collective effect is handsome and more purposeful looking, at least to my eyes. Weight and dimensionsKerb weight190kgGround clearance195mmSeat height 835mmFuel tank capacity13 litresWheelbase1418mm The lower engine guard is standard fitment on the 400 XC. Aside from these changes and a couple of unique colour schemes, the Scrambler 400 XC is pretty much the same when it comes to the riding experience. Theoretically, the lighter wheels should make some improvement in the agility, but it’s not a huge change; you’d have to ride both the X and XC back to back to tell if it’s really noticeable. The same goes for the extra 5kg the XC is carrying.  The 400 XC is the heaviest of all the Bajaj-made Triumph 400s. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC engine and performance - 8/10 Engine is smooth in the city but a little buzzy on the highway. As before, this bike’s liquid-cooled 40hp/37.5Nm 300cc engine feels smooth and punchy at lower revs, and a little buzzy post the triple-digit mark. Performance is strong and it’ll go past the indicated 160kph mark, but high-speed cruising isn’t what this bike is about. Short gearing means it’s smooth and tractable in the city but a little buzzy at fast highway speeds. Throttle response is smooth and predictable and the Scrambler is pleasant to ride within the city. Riding the Scrambler 400 XC is a pleasant affair in the city. EngineEngine399cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower40hp at 8,000rpmTorque37.5Nm at 6,500rpmGearbox6-speed This city-friendly character is boosted by its 835mm seat height, which isn’t great for short riders but provides a very nice view of the road ahead. It also gives the slim Scrambler more of a comprehensive feeling compared to the compact Speed 400, which is otherwise the same size body-wise. The higher seat and more forward-set footpeg holders also result in a more relaxed knee position than on the Speed 400, and comfort is definitely a strong point here. The Scrambler continues to cut a handsome silhouette. Triumph is giving you all of this for Rs 26,000 more than the standard Scrambler, which is great value when you consider that buying just the wheels alone will set you back by Rs 70,000 at a Triumph service centre. As for existing Scrambler owners, yes, you can equip your bike with these if you don’t mind the huge price, but unfortunately, Bajaj says that doing so will void the warranty. The cross-spoke wheels can be equipped on the 400 X for a hefty sum of Rs 70,000. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC price and verdict - 8/10 Scrambler 400 XC is good VFM, but some areas could still be improved. While the value here is without doubt, there are some other areas that could have improved. For starters, the suspension is decently good for normal riding, but feels a little harsh when you ask too much of it either off road or at high corner speeds. However, what we really missed are better tyres and brakes. The MRF tyres used here are average at best and this bike deserves better. The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life. PricePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 2.94 lakh The front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average. The reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the updated KTM 390 Adventure X is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability. Then again, the KTM can’t match the Triumph’s classy appeal and if you’ve been swayed by the Scrambler’s handsome looks and all-round competence, we’d say the XC is worth the extra money.

    "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.

    "description": "In its second round of teaser campaigns leading up to the Independence Day event, Mahindra has now given us a new look at the upcoming Vision X concept. Four new Mahindra concept SUVs, along with a new platform vision, will be showcased on August 15, and this one is expected to add to the XUV family. Mahindra Vision X has headlamps mounted on the bumper Could be a traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV Mahindra Vision X new design details The previous Mahindra Vision X teaser gave us a top-angle view of the bonnet, showing some very stylish and athletic lines on it. This one shows us a side-profile view, hinting at a layered design for the fascia, with the headlamps mounted on the bumper. The Vision X also gets wheel-arch cladding and what looks like aero-optimised alloy wheels. We expect this concept to preview a new model in the XUV family. In fact, this could be the long-awaited XEV 7e, which will be a more traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV. The XEV 7e has even been spied on testing on several occasions, with the top hat of an XUV700 and EV-specific updates and interior bits from the XEV 9e. The Vision X certainly seems to have a premium and urban positioning as opposed to the more rugged appeal of the Vision S and Vision SXT that have come before. Not many details are available about the Vision X at the moment. We’ll know more about the SUV once it debuts on August 15 alongside three other concepts. Stay tuned.
