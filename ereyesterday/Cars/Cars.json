Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

Reviews The Skoda Elroq, the Czech brand’s new entry level EV, is put through its paces. It is the second bespoke electric car to come from Skoda after the hugely successful Enyaq; does it keep its big sibling’s appeal in a smaller package? We’ve also got behind the wheel of the Ford Capri in the UK for the first time. Forget the name’s history, the Capri is now a Volkswagen ID5-twinned electric crossover – and we find that this is not a bad thing. This week’s Road Test is the Kia EV3, with a special Road Test Extra coming in the form of the updated BMW 1 Series.  Features Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it a pick-up? Does it actually work? We head to the ‘States to finally drive Tesla’s divisive Cybertruck. Editor Mark Trishaw is the lucky member of the Autocar team to get behind the wheel of the uniquely styled EV, something he considers a true automotive alien in just how different it is to everything else on the road. What did we think? You may come away surprised. This week’s Autocar also looks at the 25 things that are going to happen in 2025, including JLR finally launching the Range Rover electric, while we also detail while Dacia has decided to have a crack at the infamous Dakar Rally. Used Can you name the family SUV that set a new dynamic benhrk for the class? That would be the Seat Ateca, and Sam Phillips writes about why a used example for as little as £6000 is a great choice.  Also in the used section: My Car and I, Our Cars, Caught in the Classifieds and Head to Head.",

    "description": "Hot laps of MIRA's test track form part of the road test We go behind-the-scenes look at how the Autocar road test happens, including performance testing a Maserati It’s often said that death and taxes are the only certainties in life, but I’d like to propose an addition to that list: the Autocar road test. Over the past 104 years, we’ve published a weekly in-depth analysis of the latest and greatest new cars, unearthing the kind of data that you won’t find anywhere else. And yet some key elements of it are shrouded in mystery: what’s it like to be a road tester and how does it all come together? I’ve been tasked with joining deputy road test editor Richard Lane at the Horiba Mira proving ground, home of the Autocar road test, to find out. But not all is well. Our job is to run the numbers on Maserati’s stunning-looking new flagship, the MC20 Cielo. Except sod’s law dictates that borrowing a roadster with a 621bhp V6 mounted amidships means the heavens must open, and for the past few weeks, they’ve been wide open. The weather has certainly taken its toll on the entrance to the Horiba MIRA proving ground. We roll past a row of trees that’s been given a buzzcut by the high winds, with sodden leaves strewn along the verge of the road. A great many car, lorry and motorcycle manufacturers carry out work at MIRA. Polestar, JLR and Aston Martin are among the most prominent, but I’m afraid I can’t tell you much more. Interrupting my mumbling about the prototype that’s just rolled past, Lane urges caution. It’s a great privilege for us to be allowed to use MIRA and we absolutely must respect the privacy of the manufacturers here. If I spill any secrets, I’ll be in trouble. We’re headed for the main control tower, a glassy complex that stands proudly among its steel-roofed neighbours. It’s three very steep flights of stairs up to the nerve centre, where Lane and I must register ourselves with the cheery track controller. We explain we’re here to test the big red Maserati and we request access to the mile straight and the Dunlop dry handling circuit. The controller asks: “What kind of speeds do you think you’ll be hitting today?” Lane replies that we’re looking to go 150mph-plus, but it’s met with the immediate sucking of air through teeth. “Lots of standing water today, so make sure you recce properly,” says the controller. It’s not ideal, but our only choice is to press on. This really is the best weather we’ve had since the car arrived at Autocar Towers a good week earlier and Maserati wants the car back at its Slough HQ before the day comes to an end. With everything signed off and radio checked, the day’s testing can begin. First up is fuel economy testing – a case of setting a speed and doing endless circuits of the track’s bowl. We follow this with the ‘everyday’ economy test, whose 20mph and 30mph segments feel utterly excruciating when you’ve got clear Tarmac stretching into the distance. But sunshine begins to slice through the cloud cover and pockets of the road have started to dry out. A quick check of the BBC Weather app suggests we’ll have dry patches for only an hour, so we make a beeline for the Dunlop circuit. Lane jumps out, rifles through his backpack, pulls out a roll of the world’s skinniest gaffer tape and then attaches our VBox timing gear to the MC20’s windscreen. It feels a little incongruous to me, but it does the job. I writhe into Lane’s spare crash helmet – I’ve got an absolute whopper of a forehead and this Arai’s a size or two too small – and we head out onto the track. He immediately hits a rhythm: throttle, brake, lift, turn, throttle. Before I can brace myself, the rear end has snapped straight and we’re off for another round. I may feel like I’m in a tumble dryer, but it’s all key to understanding the car: progressively pushing it harder and asking “awkward questions” of the chassis to see how it responds in an environment you simply couldn’t replicate on the road. A good half an hour of sickening rounds later, we pull into a quiet lay-by off MIRA’s mile straight so that snapper Jack Harrison can grab all the detail photographs. We’d normally do this out in the wild, but today’s schedule leaves little room for manoeuvre. I’m impressed by the tricks of the trade, such as angling the side mirrors as far down and wide as they’ll go so that you can’t see the camera in any of the cabin shots. “Interiors can be a bit of a pain,” says Harrison grunting, as he contorts himself over the MC20’s buttresses. His camera snaps a couple of times and he continues: “Bright colours are so uncommon and privacy glass is so commonplace, so balancing the light coming in with the interior itself is tough.” Next, Lane heads out onto the straights solo to test brake fade. Then we’re off to the fabled MIRA canteen for a look at the data. Enter the designated road testing laptop, a great hunk of grey plastic running an ancient version of Windows. Lane taps away for a moment, swears because it’s frozen, and then we’re finally presented with an acceleration table. He glances at the seemingly baffling matrix of numbers and says: “Second gear, 20mph to 40mph: 1.9 [seconds]. That’s not bad, but that definitely hints at something spinning. There’s wheelspin there because a Porsche 911 Turbo with four-wheel drive and a bigger contact patch, on a dry surface, is closer to one second. Something like an Aventador SVJ is more like 1.6. “By 40mph, the traction’s coming in a bit more and all we can do is floor it on days like this. As soon as you start trying to feather the throttle, you don’t know what you’re getting – and with a boosty engine like the MC20’s, you’re very unlikely to do better than the car’s hard-working ECU.” And that, there, is the je ne sais quoi in an Autocar road tester. They’ve driven almost every car launched over the past decade. Whereas I’m sat with my mind boggled, Lane’s immediately got an idea of where the Maserati fits into the pecking order. He continues: “Third gear, I snagged it at under 20mph, so 20-40 is 2.24 seconds, and now you start to see the consistency of a turbo engine: 30 to 50, 1.6; 40 to 60, 1.3; 50 to 70, 1.2; 60 to 80, 1.6. The acceleration chart would look like Table Mountain. “These are respectable numbers in the damp. The car’s clearly hooked up – but sometimes you might just have a look at something else to sense-check it. You get a good feel for these things after long enough, but if we just look at the new Aston Vantage, in fourth gear from 50 to 70 was 1.8 seconds, and the Maserati’s 2.2. That checks out because the two cars actually have a similar power-to-weight ratio, but the Vantage has shorter gearing.” While Harrison and I finish our lunches – the hoisin pork chops are delectable, by the way – Lane heads out onto the track one final time. He takes figures for wet emergency braking on a strip of asphalt that’s been soaked by sprinklers to an almost glass-like finish. Then it’s off to do noise tests at a range of speeds, before brimming the car with fuel and seeing what it tips the scales at on an engineering-grade weighbridge. It’s finally time to wrap up – for me, at least. Lane will now get on the blower with road test editor Matt Saunders and road tester Illya Verpraet, with each providing their view on the Cielo and the week’s other test subject, the Hyundai Santa Fe. A couple of days later, I ask managing editor Sami Shah if the words have landed yet, so that I can have a peep and check if it tallies with my memory of the car. Lo and behold, the test’s pretty much complete: the pictures and copy are on the page, and it fits right down to the final word. All that’s left is for our artists to create the graphics for dimensions, economy, acceleration, and braking. Then it’s onto the next production week.  It takes an immense effort to turn it all around so quickly, so thank you for reading – and for placing your faith in our road tests. We think there’s nothing else like them, and we hope that you agree.",

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

    "description": "Beating a Porsche on the legendary Nürburgring is no mean feat, especially when the Porsche in question is the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupé. But the 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance did just that. A full-size SUV with 640hp and enough tech for an Engineering Explained video, the RS Q8 Performance might look like a standard Q8 with some blacked-out bits, but that’s the kind of thought that will have you gasping at its performance. We had it for a whole day on a race track and in the Spanish countryside to see what all is new and how much of a difference it has made. 2024 Audi RS Q8 exterior design  On the face of it, the RS Q8 Performance continues with stern expressions and almost no emotion. There is no smiling grille or angry air vents; it’s sleek, sharp and means business. What’s new over the older version are the LED Matrix headlamps with multiple daytime running lights (DRLs) options and a re-profiled grille finished in gloss black with a 3D honeycomb pattern. Wrapped around the grille is a massive carbon-fibre frame, and there’s more carbon fibre on the front lip and air vents. LED Matrix headlamps are standard. The bumpers are sportier and more aggressive than before, and what’s really nice to see is that there isn’t an ounce of chrome to be seen anywhere on the car. Over to the side, the optional 23-inch wheels look stunning (22-inch come as standard), and these help shave 20kg off the total SUV’s weight. Hidden behind these large rims are massive 420mm carbon-ceramic brake discs (standard on the Performance version) with red brake calipers. Carbon fibre on the outside rearview mirrors finishes off the changes at the side. OLED tail-lamps get customisable DRL designs. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance gets OLED tail-lamps conjoined by an LED light bar, some more honeycomb pattern on the bumper, and a gloss-black diffuser with carbon-fibre surrounds for the oval exhaust tips. Dramatic is not something you’d call the RS Q8 Performance, despite its many oversized bits and plenty of carbon-fibre trimmings (courtesy of the optional Carbon Pack). It’s the perfect look for the introverted car guy, especially in the subtle Satellite Silver paint shade. 2024 Audi RS Q8 interior and features  On the inside, the introversion is even more pronounced as there is little that will ‘wow’ you. As standard, the Performance version gets the Sport Seats Plus; these seats offer lots of bolstering and are also very comfy for long drives. And there is the same honeycomb pattern with Race-Tex and all-black upholstery. But barring all that, it’s all very simple – very high-quality, but nothing that will make it look fast while stationary. Even the steering, which was a chunky flat-bottom one on the previous car, is now a simple round unit. The racy one has been tucked away in the options list. However, you can choose between red, blue or grey for the upholstery contrast stitching. For anything more, like maybe a panoramic sunroof, you’d have to start ticking the options list. Its interior oozes quality but lacks the drama you’d expect from a 640hp super SUV. The centre console features the all-too-familiar dual-screen layout, and apart from the RS modes and drive settings, it’s all very simple and straightforward. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance has enough space for three adults, and there’s four-zone climate control with electric sun blinds for added comfort. But would you want to be chauffeured in a 640hp super SUV? I think not. 2024 Audi RS Q8 performance  Performance is literally this RS Q8’s name, and it is truly mind-boggling. Sure, it has beaten the Cayenne around the Nürburgring, but what does that mean? Is it fun? Or is it a weapon to be wielded only in the hands of a professional test driver? To find out, we did a few laps around the Parcmotor Castelloli in Spain, and a few laps is all it took to showcase why and how this is the fastest SUV around the Nürburgring. Powering the RS Q8 Performance is a 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, as before, but it now makes 40hp more, bringing it to 640, while max torque is 850Nm. The 0-100kph sprint takes an astounding 3.6 seconds, and the SUV can haul all the way to the good side of 305kph. The increase in power is the result of the catalytic converter’s repositioning, which, in turn, has reduced exhaust back pressure. The turbo boost pressures are also higher now, and the end result is an engine with virtually no lag. To add to this instant boost is a 48V mild-hybrid system that lends a hand during acceleration, which means no matter how tight the corner, you can exit it with all the brute force available. The real star is the nimble chassis. The 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox is rapid, too, but select Dynamic Plus or any of the RS modes, and it shifts with lightning-fast speeds. The paddle shifters are also quite responsive, and in manual mode, you can have total control of the shifts. On straightways, the acceleration is a blur, and given the SUV’s driving position, it’s hard to believe that you can be seated this high up and travel this fast. The sense of speed is immense, and the engine sounds terrific at full pitch. Audi has a reputation for making silent cars, but in this, it actually removed some of the sound insulation so you can hear even more of the engine noise on the inside! After all those e-trons, this sure comes as a welcome change. Out on the public roads, however, the engine changes character in a flash. Swap from the Dynamic or RS mode to Comfort mode, and it puts the leash and muzzle on the engine instantly. You can amble through town without being noticed and in comfort. The engine has a soft burble, which only amplifies post 4,000rpm and, of course, through tunnels. The ease of driving it as a daily driver takes you by surprise, especially if you’ve been hooning it around a racetrack an hour ago. 2024 Audi RS Q8 ride and handling  Speaking of hooning around a racetrack, pin-point handling is not something you expect from an SUV the size of the RS Q8 Performance. Yet, thanks to all the wizardry under the skin, it corners like it has an identity crisis. It refuses to acknowledge it is an SUV; instead, it identifies as a hot hatch. Many things are at play here – active roll stabilisation, all-wheel steering, Adaptive Air Suspension Sport and the new Quattro Sport differential – words you’d find in engineering textbooks but with the effect you’d find in comic books. The RS Q8 Performance holds the lap record on the Nürburgring for the fastest production SUV. The RS Q8 Performance corners with absolutely no body roll or understeer, and despite the power and torque available on tap, it always has the grip to save you. A lap record definitely needs precision, which the RS Q8 has, but even for mortals with not even a fraction of the pro talent, it is very hard to look bad on the track. The power split is 40-60 as standard, but in case of slippage, it can send up to 70 percent power up ahead and 85 percent to the rear wheels. Then, there is the electromechanical active stabilisation, which is basically a motor between two halves of the anti-roll bar. On long, straight highways, the two halves are disconnected, which reduces pitching and vertical movements, but as soon as you get to the corners, they link up and twist the bar in the opposite direction to the turn, thereby reducing roll and keeping the car as level as possible. It sounds complicated, but when you notice the steering is on full lock and you haven’t keeled over in your seat, it makes sense. Ride comfort with large 23-inch wheels is surprisingly good. Ride comfort is also surprisingly good, given the weight and, more importantly, the large 23-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The adaptive air suspension is compliant in Comfort mode and tries its best on broken patches, but for Indian conditions, the 22-inch ones will undoubtedly be more comfortable. 2024 Audi RS Q8 verdict and India launch details  Audi has not confirmed the RS Q8 Performance for India as of now, but given the strong response to the older version, it is likely to make it back to home soil in 2025. Prices would be slightly higher than the outgoing version, but you can expect it to be extremely competitive against its arch-rivals, the Lamborghini Urus S and Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. As a performance SUV, the RS Q8 ticks all the boxes. It is large, mighty fast and loud enough to shake up the mountains, and best of all, incredible to handle, too. It does not have the flash of a supercar or super SUV, but not everyone wants that kind of attention all the time. For those who love the concept of a ‘sleeper’ or discreet performance, this is what you should get your hands on – enough space and comfort to drop the kids off to school or do an airport run and enough power to never be late.

Given that it’s 54 years old and 250 cc, expecting it to do much more than maintain 55 mph is asking a lot, and it did that without complaint. Ultimately, my experience of the bike is more reverence than critique.

    "description": "Triumph Motorcycles has introduced two exclusive limited-edition models of its Rocket 3 R and GT motorcycles, commemorating the legendary stuntman Evel Knievel.  Pays tribute to the partnership between Triumph and Evel Knievel Only 500 units for the entire world Triumph Rocket 3 Evel Knievel edition details The partnership between Triumph and Evel Knievel dates back to the 1960s, when Knievel first performed stunts on Triumph bikes, including his famous jump over the fountains at Caesars Palace. The bike adorns a design inspired by Knievel’s iconic white jumpsuit, adorned with stars and stripes. Although the Rocket would not have been the bike of choice for Knievel owing to its heavy weight.  The Rocket 3 R and GT Evel Knievel Limited Editions feature full chrome fuel tanks, reflecting the stuntman’s signature aesthetic. The bold design includes contrasting matte Sapphire Black panels and matching rear bodywork, while the leather seats are embossed with Knievel’s gold-embroidered signature logo. Triumph has also added a custom start-up screen animation for the instrument cluster. Both models also include unique black and gold cam cover plates, each individually numbered. In addition, every purchaser will receive a specially commissioned collector’s edition hardback book that chronicles Knievel's legendary stunts and his connection with Triumph. Each book is individually numbered to match the bike it accompanies and is signed by Triumph CEO Nick Bloor. The mechanical specifications of the Rocket 3 R and GT Limited Editions are identical to those of the standard models. The Rocket 3 R offers a roadster design and a more committed rider’s triangle, while the GT leans more toward a cruiser style, featuring a taller flyscreen, a pillion grab rail, and footpegs positioned slightly further forward than those on the R. A standout feature of the Rocket 3 has always been its massive 2,500cc three-cylinder engine, the largest ever installed in a production motorcycle. This engine generates 182hp and an impressive 221Nm of peak torque. The Standard Rocket 3 is available in the ‘Storm’ variant in India which features a complete black-out look with a matte black paint job coupled with a black powder coating to the exhaust and engine. It cost Rs. 21.9 lakh (Ex-showroom, India). Also see: Triumph Bobber TFC limited edition unveiled Triumph Speed T4 review: Less is more",

    "description": "The year 2025 will see leading car manufacturers enter the EV space, while some are going to expand their lineup. With the Bharat Mobility Global Expo (BMGE) taking place in January, car buyers will get a taste of how the year will pan out for EVs. Below are listed upcoming 12 SUVs and an MPV that should be on your radar. Hyundai Creta EV The Hyundai Creta EV will be based on its ICE sibling and will rival the Maruti e Vitara. Being based on the regular Creta, it will have a familiar silhouette save for the aerodynamic design elements typical in electric cars. Inside, it will borrow a lot of features from the Alcazar facelift. As for range, expect a maximum of 400 kilometres from a 45kWh battery. Notably, the same cell pack will power the Kia Carens EV. Hyundai will launch the Creta EV on January 17, with prices expected to go from Rs 25 to 35 lakh. Maruti Suzuki e Vitara Maruti’s first EV is the production-spec version of the eVX concept. The e Vitara retains most of the concept’s upright yet angular design and is quite similar on the inside as well. Naturally, some design details, outside and in, have been toned down for the production model.  Expected to launch in March 2025, the Maruti e Vitara will come with two battery pack options. The entry-level version will get a 144hp motor on the front axle, while the battery with the larger variant will have a 174hp motor. The AWD version will get a 65hp rear axle-mounted motor as well, bringing the combined output to 184hp and 300Nm. Maruti is targeting an MIDC range of over 500km for the Hyundai Creta EV, Tata Curvv EV and Mahindra BE 6e rival.  Toyota Urban Cruiser EV Toyota’s version of the Suzuki e Vitara has already been showcased in concept form as the Urban SUV. It will be launched in India towards the end of the year. Styling tweaks and interior themes will help differentiate the two models, though under the skin, the Toyota and Suzuki will be identical. Options will include an AWD version, too. Considering the compact e SUV segment into consideration, a Rs 20 to Rs 30 lakh price bracket is radical. Tata Sierra EV Tata will bring back the Sierra nameplate with the new EV, while petrol and diesel versions will follow soon after; the company used the same format for the launch of the Curvv EV and its petrol and diesel counterparts. The Sierra EV will use the same Acti.EV architecture – essentially Tata’s Gen2 EV platform – used by the Punch EV, Curvv EV and Harrier EV, though the battery and motor specifications are yet to be confirmed. The Sierra EV may also get an AWD setup as an option, with a motor on each axle. Styling will be close to the concept and will feature a large rear glass area that is a visual link to the original Sierra of the 1990s. Tata can launch the electric Sierra either in 2025 or 2026. Tata Harrier EV Having been showcased in near-production form last year, the Harrier EV is expected to go on sale around March 2025. Likely to sport a 60kWh battery, the Harrier EV will offer 500km of range on the MIDC cycle. What will make the Harrier EV unique is that it’ll be Tata’s first all-electric model to sport an AWD setup, with an electric motor on each axle. In fact, it’ll be the first Tata – in five years – with power going to all four wheels. Distinguishing the Harrier EV from its ICE counterpart is a closed-off grille, new front and rear bumpers, and new alloy wheels.  The interior has yet to be seen officially, but we expect loads to be shared with the Harrier diesel, and some elements from the Curvv EV. Tata has confirmed that like the other models based on the Acti.EV platform, the Harrier EV will have vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging capacities, and we expect it to get a flat floor as well. Mahindra XUV 3XO EV Essentially the XUV400 EV with a 200mm shorter rear overhang, the all-electric version of the XUV 3XO is likely to share the same styling as the compact SUV, besides EV-specific changes. Sources tell us that it’ll come with a smaller 35kWh battery pack than the XUV400 to better position it against the Tata Nexon EV. Mahindra will launch the electric vehicle at a premium over the standard 3XO mostly by July 2025. Mahindra BE 6e (prices of all variants) We have reported extensively on the Mahindra BE 6e SUV launched in November. The car has a concept-inspired design which may look radical. As for output figures, they are 281hp and 380Nm with a 0-100kph time of 6.7 seconds. Two batteries of 59kWh and 79kWh will be on offer and the ARAI range ranges between 556km and 682km. Mahindra has revealed only the range-starting BE 6e’s price - Rs 18.90 lakh - and is set to release the entire price list next month. Deliveries are to commence from February-end. Mahindra XEV 7e The standard SUV version of the XEV 9e, without the raked roofline and with a third row of seats, is expected to arrive later in the year. The 7e will likely share all of its features, safety kit, tech, battery and powertrain options – among other bits – with the 9e. Expect similar range and performance figures, too. The all-electric three-row SUV will rival the Tata Harrier EV. We expect the car to arrive by late 2025. Mahindra XEV 9e (prices of all variants) The larger Mahindra XEV 9e coupé-SUV shares its platform, battery and powertrain options with the BE 6e, and is correspondingly marginally slower and less frugal on a single charge. On the other hand, cabin and luggage space is greater than the smaller BE, and it gets more tech like a passenger-side infotainment screen. Prices start at Rs 21.90 lakh, while the complete rate list will be revealed at the BMGE 2025, and deliveries will begin at the end of February. Considering its price point and size, the BYD Atto 3 is currently the XEV 9e’s closest rival.  Kia Carens EV The all-electric MPV will share its design with the upcoming Carens facelift, albeit with EV-specific changes like aero-optimised wheels and a closed-off grille area. Its powertrain and battery setup are expected to be shared with the Creta EV seeing as they share the same platform, among other mechanical components, as stated before. India debut of the electric Carens may happen towards the end of 2025 Kia Syros EV  Not much is known yet about the all-electric version of the Syros other than the fact that it will only be available in front-wheel drive format. It’s expected to go on sale about six months after the ICE versions that will be showcased at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January. As for rates, Kia could price it from 15 lakh onwards. BYD midsize e SUV While not much is known, BYD is planning to launch a new SUV that will rival the Tata Curvv EV, Hyundai Creta EV, Mahindra BE 6e and the Maruti e Vitara. BYD recently filed patents for two SUVs - Bao 3 and Denza N9 - both of which are a segment above and not to be confused with the aforementioned. The Chinese brand may showcase the SUV at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Launch may happen in the second half of 2025, around when its specifications will become clear. Citroen Aircross EV The French brand’s next EV is likely to be the electric version of the Aircross. Considering the 5+2 seat SUV shares its platform with the C3 hatchback, which has an all-electric derivative, an electric version of the Aircross is only logical. However, the eC3 uses a 29.2kWh battery and a 57hp electric motor, and Citroën may opt for a bigger battery and motor here. Expected pricing and launch timeline are Rs 18 lakh and H2 2025, respectively. Citroen Basalt EV With the Basalt-based EV, Citroen will enter the soon-to-be crowded all-electric midsize SUV space, taking on the Curvv EV, BE 6e, and the bevy of new models. It’ll likely share its powertrain and battery pack with the Aircross EV, seeing as it is also built on the same platform, which can accommodate both internal combustion and electric powertrains. Additionally, the Basalt EV’s pricing will hover around the Aircross EV’s and the two may launch together.
