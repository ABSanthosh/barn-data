    "description": "This 1956 Austin-Healey 100 BN2 roadster was refurbished in the early 2000s, and it was purchased by the current owner on BaT in August 2022. Finished in red and black over red leather upholstery with white piping, the car is powered by a 2,660cc inline-four mated to a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Equipment includes 15″ wire wheels, a black removable soft top, a tilting windscreen, a louvered hood, dual SU H6 carburetors, a Denis Welch Motorsport aluminum cylinder head, a Moto-Lita steering wheel, and lap belts. The cylinder head was resurfaced in May 2025, and other work involved replacing the head gasket, starter solenoid, fuel pump, battery, a tie-rod-end boot, and a rear-axle seal as well as rewiring the voltage regulator and installing a heater valve. This BN2 is now offered on dealer consignment with recent service records, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean Oregon title in the owner's name.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ian-callum-turns-original-mini-110bhp-hot-hatch",
    "description": "Former Jaguar design chief's firm reimagines classic Mini as £75k hot hatch with modern tech Ian Callum’s eponymous design house has partnered with renowned Mini coachbuilder Wood \u0026 Pickett to reimagine the city car as a hot hatch fitted with modern technology. It is based on the bodyshell of the Mk5 Mini Sportspack – the wide-arched version built from 1997-2001, at the end of the model’s production run – but is overhauled with a rally-spec engine, a new suspension set-up and uprated brakes. The A-Series engine has been upsized from 1275cc to 1310cc and fitted with a new cylinder head, two-point fuel injection and a custom twin-pipe exhaust. This boosts its output from the original 63bhp to 110bhp. The gearbox has also been strengthened to cope with the additional reserves. The new suspension is said to be tuned for road use and is matched with a set of grooved and ventilated 8.4in disc brakes. The original car’s Minilite wheels have been replaced by a four-spoke set of Callum’s design, measuring the same 13in in diameter. Styling tweaks include the fitment of Wood \u0026 Pickett’s wide arches, sportier front and rear bumpers and LED lights. Inside, it gets a wooden dashboard fascia inspired by the walnut panels fitted to Wood \u0026 Pickett’s Margrave Mini in the 1960s, metal foglight and heater switches, and a small touchscreen with Apple CarPlay smartphone mirroring. Each of the Callum and Wood \u0026 Pickett Minis will be hand-built to their owner’s exacting specifications, Ian Callum said. Prices start at £75,000. The new restomod marks the return of Wood \u0026 Pickett to the fore of Mini customisation. The company was founded by Bill Wood and Les Pickett in 1947 and established itself as a leading coachbuilder with its Mini conversions in the 1960s.  These were especially popular among celebrities, with commissions from the likes of Mick Jagger, Elton John and Paul and Linda McCartney. Indeed, Callum has tapped the same market for the new Mini: the first owner is model and creative David Gandy. Wood \u0026 Pickett exchanged hands as a company several times over the decades. Notably, it spent 1986 to 1989 under British Leyland dealer the Henlys Group, when it primarily focused on high-value conversions of the original Range Rover. Today, it is owned by Motaclan, the firm that owns the former MG Rover parts division. Motaclan said it will soon offer a range of Wood \u0026 Pickett parts designed by Callum, enabling classic Mini owners to perform their own conversions.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/autocar-awards/kia-global-ceo-wins-top-issigonis-trophy-autocar-awards-2025",
    "description": "Ho Sung Song recognised in Autocar Awards 2025 - see the full list of industry leaders and cars below Kia CEO Ho Sung Song has been awarded with Autocar’s most prestigious honour, the Issigonis Trophy, in recognition of his hugely successful efforts to transform the Korean firm’s strategy, brand identity and model line-up. The trophy, named for Mini inventor Sir Alec Issigonis, is presented annually at the Autocar Awards to an individual who has made a historically significant contribution to the industry. When Song was named Kia’s CEO in 2020 the brand was already on the rise, but he still implemented a significant transformation of Kia, encompassing everything from its internal culture to its product line-up, As a result, Kia has achieved double-digit sales growth in key regions in the last five years, with an operating profit that is the envy of many mainstream rivals. For full coverage of the 2025 Autocar Awards read this week’s magazine, which is available on newsstands, as a digital edition and on Apple News+. Autocar has also recognised the pioneering achievements of British engineer Peter Rawlinson with the Sturmey Award, presented to resourceful, high-achieving innovators. During his long career Rawlinson worked at Tesla to develop the transformative Model S, and more recently has been CEO of Lucid Motors, whose ultra-efficient EVs have helped set new industry benchmarks. The Outstanding Leader award went to Lawrence Stroll, after the main investor in Aston Martin had invested heavily in and transformed the fortunes of both the road car business and its associated Formula 1 team. The Mundy Award for Engineering went to Philippe Krief for his achievements in his dual role as Renault Group’s chief technology officer and CEO of the fast-growing Alpine brand. The former Ferrari engineer is helping to pioneer the French firm’s new line-up of fun, agile and impressive machines, including both combustion and electric models. McLaren Racing were named the winners of our Motorsport award, celebrating how the Woking-based squad ended a 26-year drought by winning last year’s Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship. The Editors’ Award was given to Diane Miller, who led the transformation of Stellantis’s Ellesmere Port plant into an state-of-the-art electric van production facility, and is now running the firm’s huge new national parts distribution centre. Fiat’s Francois Leboine won our Design Hero award for his team’s work on the cheerful, upbeat new Grande Panda, and in his previous job for the development of the Renault 5 concept. The Innovation Award went to British firm Protean Electric, for its pioneering work in the field of in-wheel motors. The McLaren Artura has come of age after some well-placed improvements, and proved its worth with a convincing victory in our contest to crown Britain’s Best Driver’s Car. The Artura shone because it was a true mid-engined supercar that offered incredible versatility, making for a machine that would be as comfortable on a commute to the office as blasting round a test track. The Alpine A290 is our Best Fun EV for showcasing that an electric car can offer fun, involved hot hatch handling at a reasonable cost, and without merely relying on ridiculous amounts of power and torque. Three cars secured trophies for achieving an ultra-rate five-star verdict in the Autocar Road Test, which remains the most comprehensive and in-depth assessment in the industry. The Porsche 911 S/T, Skoda Superb Estate and Hyundai Ioniq 5 N were all celebrated for hitting the rarified air of ‘exceptional, unsurpassed, all but flawless’. MG was named Best Manufacturer for its remarkable sales growth in recent years, and an ability to mix competitively priced mainstream models with ambitious statements of intent such as the new Cyberster. Other cars recognised at the awards include the Dacia Duster (Best Value Car), Lamborghini Revuelto (Best Dream Car), Volkswagen Golf e-Hybrid (Best Hybrid), Fiat Grande Panda (Best Small Car), Kia EV3 (Best Electric Car) and the Land Rover Defender Octa (Best 4x4).

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/1972-porsche-911-str",
    "description": "In downtown Los Angeles, just blocks from where photographer Sean Klingelhoefer is standing, resides the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Renowned architect Frank Gehry designed the megalith of curvaceous and angular raw steel to create an expanse described as “near acoustic perfection”. Down the street it stands, permanent and complacent, a viewing curiosity for passersby, waiting to be filled with sound. Today’s subject for Klingelhoefer, however, is a moving one – one he had doubts of ever seeing finished. Tearing through lower Grand Avenue, it is alive, exuding acoustic bliss to its sidewalk audience; an equally visual experience for those spry enough to catch a glimpse. It is Magnus Walker’s 1972 Porsche 911 ‘STR,’ a masterpiece of sound and design. By 1972, Porsche had long cemented a place for themselves within the automotive world, largely due to the success of the first Porsche 356 (built in the late ’40s), and in the ‘50s with their race-proven 550 Spyder.…",

    "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

    "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

    "description": "Dear reader, I’m overjoyed to announce I’ve recently become a dad. Life has changed in so many ways (I’ve never valued a power nap as much as I do now!), and to an extent, so has the way I look at cars. I have become ever more mindful of the smallest of things that could make my little one’s car rides comfier. ISOFIX child seat anchors are a bit tough to find underneath the seat cushioning. Of course, step one was to get the child seat in order. The Hyundai Creta N Line I’ve been using gets ISOFIX child seat anchors to lock the seat firmly in place, but they’re tucked behind the cushioning and need a bit of poking around to locate. This is not a biggie for an average user who’d keep the seat in place for months at a stretch, but I have to keep removing and re-attaching the seat whenever there’s a new car I have to test. Thankfully, my daughter has taken well to the car seat and, as my wife reports from the back seat, enjoys her drives. Option to pre-cool the Creta using the phone app put to full use over the summer. We’ve had a baking summer in Mumbai, and my kiddo, understandably, hates being strapped onto her seat in a hot car. The solution has come in the form of remote pre-cooling. To be honest, I’d never used connected car features beyond a review evaluation, but today, setting up the car in advance with the tap of a few buttons on my phone screen is part of my SOP. The option to remotely start the vehicle and have the air conditioning run has been an absolute boon. Hyundai’s BlueLink app is easy to use, and I’ve not had challenges with the network, which is known to be an issue with many eSIM-based connected services. Our kiddo loves looking through the panoramic sunroof. Of course, we’ve had our share of crying spells on the go. Bumper-to-bumper traffic with an irate baby is not fun, I can tell you that. On one such drive, retracting the cover for the panoramic sunroof proved to be an Eureka moment. The newfound view of the world above immediately distracted my daughter, making the remainder of the journey a lot, well, calmer. Something tells me kids will love the Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e’s trippy, colour-changing roof lighting. The Creta N Line, in general, has proved to be good transport for the family, but I do wish there was more luggage room. I never realised a stroller occupied so much space! Fuel economy figure firmly in the single digits in chock-a-block city driving. More efficiency would be welcome, too. Fuel economy has been in the 7-8kpl range, but to be fair, my bumper-to-bumper slog never gives cars a chance to breathe free. Of the other things, there’s an irritating plasticky creak from the centre console every time a driver’s leg presses against it. This is something we experienced on our Creta IVT, too. Centre console lets out creaks whenever the driver’s leg rests on it. I have ambitious plans for a road trip over the monsoons. It’ll be a full house with my wife, baby, doggo and myself in the car. Time to dig deeper into the Creta’s box of tricks!

    "description": "The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which is currently on sale in international markets, has been updated with a 48V mild-hybrid system. Toyota claims that due to the mild-hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) system, the Prado’s diesel powertrain benefits from smoother performance. All Land Cruiser models in Europe will adopt the MHEV system, the Japanese carmaker confirmed. The Land Cruiser Prado is run by a 204hp, 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine Its mild-hybrid system’s 48V battery is charged via engine braking  Toyota Land Cruiser Prado mild hybrid powertrain Same diesel engine as the Fortuner SUV The Prado SUV’s existing 204hp/ 500Nm, 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox now gets assistance from the 48V mild hybrid system. This 7.6kg hybrid setup comprises an electric motor-generator (instead of the conventional alternator), a 48V 4.3Ah lithium-ion battery and a DC-DC power converter. All of these work together to enable auto start-stop for enhanced fuel efficiency and provide an additional 16hp and 65Nm at start-off. To charge the small battery, the motor recuperates energy under engine braking. The Toyota Fortuner in India, which is powered by the same diesel engine, recently got Toyota’s mild-hybrid system as well. Toyota Land Cruiser Prado mild hybrid off-road performance 700mm wading depth unaffected by MHEV system \"The system in no way compromises the Land Cruiser [Prado’s] ability to operate in extreme conditions and rough terrain,\" Toyota said. It also ensured that the Land Cruiser Prado’s 700mm wading capacity is unaffected by the new motor-generator, which is mounted high on the engine block and is waterproofed. \"On rougher, off-road surfaces, the motor-generator adds to its ability to tackle obstacles...The operating status is indicated in the driver’s multi-information display with a read-out showing CHG (energy regeneration), ECO or PWR (providing assist in both cases),\" the Japanese carmaker stated further. An earlier report from us had revealed that Toyota would launch the Prado (or LC 250) in India later this year. However, a specific timeline is still unclear. If introduced here, it will slot below the Land Cruiser (or LC 300). Also see: Toyota Land Cruiser Prado spied in India 457hp Toyota Land Cruiser 300 hybrid is most powerful LC ever",

    "description": "Indian racer Akshay Gupta scored a podium finishing at the 2025 edition of the iconic 24 Hours of Nurburgring. Sharing the privateer #808 Cupra TCR DSG with teammates Junichi Umemoto, Lutz Obermann and Dennis Leissing, Gupta finished third in the class after overcoming early gearbox issues. FK Performance Motorsport took class victory with a BMW M2 Racing, while Bulldog Racing was second with the Mini John Cooper Works Pro. Gupta’s #808 Cupra completed 101 laps #310 FK Performance BMW M2 won in the class Nurburgring 24H: Gupta P3 in SP3T class Privateer Cupra overcomes early gearbox trouble The #808 Cupra was struck with a gearbox issue on the formation lap itself, and tumbled from P5 to P7 at the start. Nevertheless, Obermann then carved through the pack and made 15 passes within seven laps, taking the Cupra up to third place before handing it over to teammate Leissing. During Gupta’s first stint, the Indian driver hustled the car up to second place, but the gearbox issue turned up again. This triggered an unscheduled pit stop that dropped the #808 Cupra to fourth place. The privateer did benefit from some retirements throughout the gruelling 24 hour race, though, and was eventually elevated to a comfortable third-place spot behind the factory BMW and Mini entries. Just after midnight, the #303 Hyundai Elantra N Cup car suffered a huge crash, promoting the Cupra to second place. But the race was far from over. At around 6am, Umemoto was involved in an incident with a Porsche Cayman and marshals had to tow the damaged Cupra 5km to the pits where mechanics rebuilt the front-end and replaced the rear suspension within just 1 hour 45 mins. With the gearbox finally behaving, Gupta and Leissing nursed the car across the chequered flag in third place, completing a total of 101 laps. \"They really say this race chooses its winners. I now know what it really means. We had the pace to win, and the top win cars were almost 30 seconds off the pace and yet they are there. It's disheartening. But I'm not complaining too much. Podium is still a lot given how intense the competition was and how crazy this race is,” Gupta said after the race. Also see: 2025 Le Mans: Kubica seals Ferrari’s third straight win",
