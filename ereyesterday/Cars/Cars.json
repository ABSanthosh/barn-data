    "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GT is said to have been raced and used for track day events in Europe before being brought to the US in 2018 and subsequently underwent a multi-year build process commissioned by the selling dealer, 1600Veloce, from 2021 through 2024. Work involved a repaint in Giallo Fly and an interior re-trim in dark blue Poltrona Frau leather and gray Alcantara along with installation of a 2.0L Twin Spark inline-four and rebuilt five-speed manual transmission sourced from Alfaholics in the UK. The car rides on 15\" GTA-style wheels and features a stepped hood and wrap-around bumpers, while the cockpit is fitted with low-back Recaro seats accompanied by an OMP roll cage, a Hellebore steering wheel, and Veglia instrumentation. The engine is equipped with dual Weber 45 DCOE carburetors paired with Pipercross ram pipes, and further Alfaholics additions include a 3D-mapped ignition setup and stainless-steel exhaust along with their Fast Road Stage 3 suspension package, a big-brake kit with Superleggera calipers, and a race-spec limited-slip differential. This Stepnose is the 1,600th auction from our local partner, 1600veloce, and it is now offered with build records and a Wisconsin title.",

    "description": "EV introduces a new platform and a new design language for Audi There are going to be more than a few references to PPE in this road test, but not because we’re about to tell you about face masks. PPE in this case doesn’t stand for personal protective equipment but for Premium Platform Electric, the all-new architecture that underpins the equally new Audi Q6 E-tron.It’s an important one for Audi, this, because the Q6 is the first completely new model from Ingolstadt since the Audi Q4 E-tron in 2021, and the first car to use this new platform that was developed together with Porsche and will form the basis for a slew of new models, including the Porsche Macan, the Audi A6 E-Tron and other cars that haven’t even been announced yet.The Q6, as the name suggests, sits right in the middle of the Audi range. Going forward, electric cars get even numbers and piston cars (including hybrids) get odd numbers, so the Q6 is effectively the electric equivalent of Audi’s medium SUV, the Q5. Under the road test microscope this week, in other words, is not just one new car but a whole range of upcoming models from multiple manufacturers. No pressure, then.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/porsche-911-gt3-made-more-exhilarating-25th-birthday",
    "description": "Redesigned front end improves downforce and air flow Sharper look, updated engine and more options for hardcore 911 Porsche is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 911 GT3 with a round of updates for its track-honed halo model, to bring a new look, extra options and a “more exhilarating” drive. The updated version of the most extreme 911 arrives, priced from £157,300, a quarter of a century after Porsche first used the GT3 name for the race-homologated, range-topping version of the 996-generation 911. Chief among the upgrades are a series of subtle mechanical tweaks, including revised cylinder heads, sharper camshafts from the GT3 RS, improved oil coolers and new throttle valves with enhanced flow. To comply with the latest emissions rules, the GT3 is fitted with two particulate filters and four catalytic converters - but Porsche says it has worked to ensure it still delivers “a gripping soundscape”. The 911 GT3 still produces 503bhp and 347lb ft, still revs to 9000rpm and still sends its reserves through either six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearboxes, with 0-62mph times of 3.9sec and 3.4sec respectively. However, both gearboxes have had their final drive ratio shortened by 8%. Meanwhile, the dampers have been tuned to improve control over bumps and kerbs, and the anti-dive system has been revised to further reduce forward pitch while braking. Also new for next year is the option of a back seat in the more road-focused 911 GT3 Touring. This necessitates the fitment of new carbon-fibre front seats with a folding backrest in order to access the rear.  Two-seater Touring models can still be specified with plusher 18-way adjustable sports seats. The updated GT3 is marked out by subtly redesigned front and rear ends, which incorporate new downforce-boosting elements as well as new-look Matrix LED headlights and a larger front air intake. Andreas Preuninger, head of Porsche’s GT division, hailed the new GT3 as “more exhilarating and individual” than before. “We dug into a wealth of details and gave it many features that our customers wanted,” he added. “This allows the GT3 to be adapted even more specifically to the purpose or preferences of the driver.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-comparison-reviews/bsa-gold-star-650-vs-royal-enfield-interceptor-650-comparison-review-433196#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Here are two modern retro motorcycles that carry a British badge and a sizeable chunk of motorcycling history behind their names. At first glance, these two bikes seem relatively identical since they have similar designs, performance, engine capacity, weight and price. However, the difference is more apparent when these two are ridden back to back. BSA’s Gold Star is the new kid on the block and has no direct rival apart from Royal Enfield’s Interceptor 650. Both these motorcycles approach the same goal in a different manner, which delivers a very different riding experience overall. We’re here to tell you what those differences are and how these two stack up in the real world. Flamboyance \u0026 Flair Given their retro credentials, both motorcycles take a rather minimalist approach to their throwback aesthetics. There is abundant use of chrome, and while looks are subjective, I found myself gravitating a little more towards the Gold Star. Both motorcycles get a round headlamp, flat seats and a well-shaped fuel tank. They are available in multiple colours, depending on which the price can vary. Classy retro dials fit the aesthetic, but the tiny screens are hard to read. The feature list, too, is relatively minimal, and while the Interceptor 650 now gets an LED headlamp that outperforms the simple halogen setup on the Gold Star, BSA’s approach seems a tad more authentic, given the overall aesthetic. On the flip side, both motorcycles get analogue-styled dials, but I quite like the amber backlight on the Gold Star. However, there is no denying that the Interceptor 650’s dials are more readable and that the LCD screen has better visibility. The Gold Star is equipped with a Type-A and Type-C charging socket, while the Interceptor 650 gets a USB port that’s hidden away. Royal Enfield has also equipped the Interceptor with a set of adjustable levers – a welcome addition. While the 650 has more expensive-feeling switchgear with aluminium housings, the Gold Star’s conventional switches are more straightforward to use. In terms of build quality, both motorcycles lack the premium touch and feel like they’re built on a budget. That said, the Gold Star is by far the best offering to come out of Classic Legends’ stable despite having areas that could use improvement. Early signs of rust and  a loose-fitting side panel did seem concerning, but the brand says it is working on improving its overall quality. The Interceptor 650, too, has some signs of rust, but overall, it feels like the better-built machine in this comparison. Interceptor’s clocks are simpler, but the larger digital display is more legible. It is worth mentioning that the Gold Star does not come with a main stand as standard, and BSA – for now – doesn’t offer one as an accessory either. RE’s footpeg placement is a well-known issue. The Interceptor 650 is not only equipped with a main stand but also has a higher ground clearance. My issue with this RE is with its footpegs, which tend to jut out and come in the way while you ‘walk’ the motorcycle in traffic. While this issue is less bothersome for taller riders, shorter ones will find it more tedious. In the saddle The Gold Star’s riding position feels more natural and less aggressive in comparison. You get a slightly more upright seating posture and a more relaxed footpeg position. Coupled with a soft seat and a 780mm seat height, this is more approachable for shorter riders, but someone over 6 feet may find the leg space to be a bit cramped. Rishaad did wish for a slightly firmer seat, which is an easy fix in comparison to the Interceptor 650’s shortcomings. Gold Star has a wider seat with softer padding. Royal Enfield has built the Interceptor 650 with slightly more sportier ergonomics. It’s noticeable from the moment you swing your leg over its taller and narrower seat, and you’ll notice a more forward lean as you reach for the handlebar. Its footpegs, too, are slightly higher, and the narrow seat does rob it of some comfort as it puts more pressure on your tail bones and causes saddle soreness sooner than you’d expect. Royal Enfield does sell a more comfortable accessory, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem – only makes it slightly more bearable. Seat is well cushioned but uncomfortably narrow. Take aim, fire! The BSA Gold Star’s single-cylinder engine is one of the largest in its class and traces its roots back to the Rotax engine used in the BMW Funduro F650. This motor packs a healthy low- to mid-range performance, builds power from as low as 2,500rpm, and does so linearly. Despite the single-cylinder unit, BSA has done a commendable job of keeping the vibrations in check. Though it is short on one gear, the Gold Star’s engine and gearbox combination work well in tandem and will rarely ever leave you wanting that extra gear. That said, I have a few gripes with this motor, starting with its low-speed throttle response, which can sometimes feel too snatchy. We faced low-speed stalling issues with both motorcycles, but the Gold Star stalled more frequently. Underdamped rear shocks are the main complaint. The Interceptor 650, on the other hand, felt a lot smoother thanks to its extra cylinder and had a more pleasant sound to its exhaust. RE’s 650cc motor will happily cruise in higher gears at lower speeds, and the tractable motor will even reward you with a soothing note each time you downshift, but it is no match for the BSA’s mid-range punch. It felt like the more engaging motor, regardless of the speed or riding style I took up. Our numbers reveal that the Gold Star is the quicker motorcycle of the two. Not only did the Gold Star have better acceleration figures, but it also showcased quicker in-gear acceleration. It is also worth noting that we tested the BSA in the wet, which means we could expect even better numbers with dry tarmac. Interceptor’s suspension setup does a better job. Fuel economy is where the Interceptor 650 shines with a larger fuel tank, longer range and better city and highway efficiency. Its engine also handles high-speed touring better, with a calmer demeanour at higher RPMs. However, in city traffic, the BSA is more accessible to ride due to its more relaxed riding position and lighter clutch. Neither engine had a heating issue in bumper-to-bumper traffic and kept their cool in tight jams.  It’s about to get bumpy   In terms of weight, both motorcycles have a mere 5kg variance, but the difference feels higher, and the Interceptor comes across as a heavier, more cumbersome machine. The Gold Star is nimble at low speeds and showcases capable handling around flat, well-paved corners. However, its underdamped rear suspension is its biggest flaw and renders the ride and handling a bit too wallowy around most bumpy roads. It can take getting used to, but it does hamper the overall day-to-day experience with this motorcycle. On the flip side, the Gold Star’s Pirelli tyres and Brembo brakes do a fantastic job of providing stopping power, and the lever packs a decent amount of feedback. All in all, the bike rides well, but it deserves better rear suspension.  RE’s brakes and tyres aren’t as good as the BSA’s. While not exceptional, the Interceptor 650’s suspension has been improved over time and feels more balanced than the BSA’s. However, its brakes and tyres could use some improvement. Regarding handling, the Interceptor feels more capable with higher lean angles, but it takes more work to manage at low speeds in heavy traffic. BSA’s fit and finish can be improved. Old but gold Price isn’t likely to be the deciding factor, as both bikes are similarly priced. The actual choice comes down to the experience you’re looking for. The BSA Gold Star offers a more authentic retro experience with a delightful torque-driven engine. It’s more comfortable, easier to manage in the city, and can be fun around well-paved corners. Although it falls short on one cylinder and the lower refinement that comes with it, it makes up for it with its engaging power delivery and solid braking performance. It is our choice when it comes to a modern, classic riding experience. However, Classic Legends must prove its long-term reliability. And while the quality levels on its bikes have improved over time, there is still some way to go. BSA’s brake and tyre combo works surprisingly well. The Royal Enfield has a gem of an engine, and if you want a twin-cylinder experience, it has to be the RE. What also works in its favour is RE’s extensive service network and its vast accessory list. So, while we enjoyed riding the BSA more, the Interceptor 650 might be the safer bet for some people. Also See: BSA Gold Star 650 vs Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 comparison video",

    "description": "It’s been nearly a year since I got my hands on RS Taichi’s waterproof backpack, which is available in five colours and a unique Resident Evil edition. I’ve gone for the plain black shade due to its stealthy look and was quite eager to see just how usable this bag would be during monsoon. The WP backpack’s construction mainly comprises polyester and thermoplastic polyurethane. The bag consists of a primary 25-litre waterproof compartment, a smaller compartment located near the primary compartment’s opening and an external quick-access pocket that isn’t waterproof. Main compartment holds 25L. The bag uses a roll-up top system to seal the main compartment and can be adjusted based on how full it gets. It’s easy to use and even includes a Velcro strap to keep it tightly sealed. Its 25-litre storage is a boon for when I’m travelling, and over time, I’ve fit huge items in this compartment, including Rishaad’s fully packed Kriega R25 backpack! Secondary compartment is handy storage for small items The secondary compartment is only water-resistant, even though it uses the same opening as the main compartment. It can be used for smaller items, such as a pair of gloves, balaclavas and cleaning cloths. The third external pocket is mainly designed for items you’d like to keep handy that aren’t fazed by the rain, like a set of keys. Outer pocket is not waterproof. This bag gets a chest harness and a waist belt; both of these can be further adjusted to your size and do a good job of preventing the straps from slipping off the shoulders and distributing luggage weight evenly, especially when on the bike. Chest harness divides the load and provides a better fit. The overall fit, finish and feel of this bag are premium, and it feels built to last. However, after all this time, I did lose the rubberised end on the zipper pull tab located on the external pocket. Honestly, this is quite a minor issue and can be easily replaced. I’ve had absolutely no complaints with this bag otherwise. It’s been quite handy and dependable through my daily commute during peak Mumbai monsoon. Waist harness helps keep the bag secure while riding. Given that this bag is waterproof, you are prone to wearing it outside your protective rain gear, which can make it susceptible to dirt and grime being flung on it by the rear wheel. In such cases, a quick wipe-down with a wet cloth helps, and fortunately, the bag doesn’t stain permanently. This bag is currently available on special order at 6kiom.com and will cost approximately Rs 15,000. Velcro strap help seat the two main compartments well. I managed to buy it for far less overseas, and you may also have to wait anywhere from one to four months for it to be delivered. Just like most imported products, the RS Taichi WP backpack comes at a price, but it gives you good quality and performance in return. Also see: Ixon Dirt Air gloves review",

They’ve just added the Malle Canyon to their repertoire—a four-day romp in and around the White Sand Mountains, a stone’s throw from Lisbon, Portugal. Surrounded by the limestone walls of the canyon, scores of motorcycle enthusiasts pitched up for Malle’s first event outside of the UK. Choosing Portugal as the destination for their first out-of-country festival was a calculated move by Malle. Jonny’s been living in Lisbon for the past five years, and was brimming with excitement for the Canyon when we ran into him at the Lisbon Motorcycle Film Festival.…",

    "description": "The best custom motorcycles aren’t always the ones that scream the loudest. Some captivate with simplicity, inviting a closer look that reveals a visually enticing, perfectly proportioned, and tastefully upgraded machine. Mastering all of these elements takes years. This frosty BMW R80 scrambler ticks all of those boxes. Remarkably, it’s Tomas Janicek’s first custom motorcycle—but it took him a decade to create, giving him time to hone every detail. “I’ve always been more of a car guy, and was never really interested in motorcycles,” Tomas tells us. “But back in 2014, while studying at the Art Academy in the Netherlands, I felt a strong urge to create something with my hands.” “Since I couldn’t find a car shop that excited me, I decided to take a chance.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/nissan-magnite-facelift-review-small-changes-big-effect-433259#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "It’s been nearly four years since Nissan brought the Magnite to India, and the compact SUV has shouldered the responsibility of establishing the Japanese brand's presence in the country. The X-Trail is a recent addition, serving more as a brand statement than a bread-and-butter model. Over the past six months, Nissan has despatched more than 12,000 units of the Magnite to its dealers (over 2,000 units every month) and has exported over 30,000 made-in-India models to international markets in the past four years.That the compact SUV will have to soldier on here, combined with the company's aim to export nearly 1 lakh units to 65 left-hand and right-hand-drive markets by 2026, underscores that a lot is riding on this facelift. Nissan Magnite facelift: exterior, design While the changes to the Magnite facelift’s design may seem insignificant when seen individually, together they add a dose of ruggedness to the compact SUV. The addition of a piano black appliqué that connects the grille and headlights makes the former look larger. The front bumper gets contrasting silver bits that protrude slightly, adding to the muscular appearance and also serving as fog light housings. Facelift gets a more muscular-looking facia. The new, smart-looking dual-tone 16-inch alloys add some freshness to the sides of the Magnite. The tail-lights get new 3D LED signatures that are quite attractive. Also, the Sunrise Copper Orange exterior colour is new and suits the Magnite well, especially with the contrasting black roof. Nissan Magnite facelift: interior It’s a similar story on the inside – there are small changes, but the effect is notable. The Magnite facelift’s cabin looks and feels far more premium, thanks to the copper-coloured leatherette finish on the dashboard and door panels, especially compared to the outgoing model’s nearly all-black plastic finish. The steering now gets an all-black finish that contrasts well with the dash, and the seats in the top-spec Tekna+ variant come in dual-tone copper-black leatherette covers that help keep one’s back and bottom cool, especially in conjunction with the strong automatic climate control system. Leatherette on the dash and doors uplifts cabin tremendously compared to outgoing model. However, not everything is perfect. The new ambient lights do add to the ambience, but the execution could have been a bit more seamless. In addition, the steering column is visible in the footwell, and the accelerator and brake pedals are placed a little too close together. In terms of practicality and comfort, the Magnite facelift retains its ability to carry four passengers with ease – though three seated abreast in the back will find shoulder room lacking – and comes with a 336-litre boot, which is good enough for a couple of large suitcases, and expands to 690 litres with the rear seats folded. Multi-colour ambient lighting feels a bit like an afterthought.   Nissan Magnite facelift: features The faceliftcomes with a slightly expanded feature list. The Magnite has always been a well-equipped compact SUV, and it now adds goodies like engine remote start, auto headlights, an auto-dimming IRVM (the frameless unit picks up fingerprints and smudges too easily), a cooled glove box, and a USB C-Type port for rear passengers. The updated 7-inch digital instrument cluster is less gimmicky than that of the outgoing model, yet it displays the same amount of information, making it a welcome upgrade. Updated 7-inch digital instrument cluster is less cartoon-ish, a welcome change. The standard safety kit on every Magnite variant includes six airbags, three-point seat belts for all passengers, ISOFIX anchors, ABS, traction control, a tyre pressure monitor, and a hill-start assist. The higher Techna and Techna+ variants also get a 360-degree camera, which doesn’t have the best resolution but works effectively. Nissan Magnite facelift: performance, ride and handling The Magnite is still offered with either a 72hp, 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine or a 100hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol unit; we’ve driven the latter, and it’s just as enjoyable as before. This three-cylinder unit has a strong mid-range punch and works well with the smooth CVT to mask any lag at lower revs. Speaking of the CVT, at low and medium engine speeds, there’s barely any of that typical ‘rubber band’ effect, but if you drive with a heavy right foot, it will set in. Cabin insulation has improved marginally, but the three-pot engine’s clatter is still audible, and it gets boomier as the revs rise. Punchy turbo-petrol and relatively light weight make the Magnite quicker than you'd expect. At slower speeds, there is an underlying firmness to the Magnite’s suspension setup, but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable at any point. On the highway, the suspension does a much better job of filtering out road undulations, making it an able cruiser. What also helps is the steering that weighs up as the speeds rise, and the 195/60 tyres offer a decent amount of grip, instilling confidence when going through twisty ghat sections. On the other hand, despite doing a good job, the brakes don’t lend as much confidence as they should as the pedal feel is mushy, and there’s some slack before the brakes bite. Nissan Magnite facelift: price, verdict On the face of it, it may seem like not much has changed with the Magnite facelift, but that’s not true. It retains all the qualities of its predecessor –brilliant design, comfort, a sporty feel, and a well-equipped interior, all with an attractive price tag– while showing marked improvements in areas such as interior ambience and feel-good features.   Other than the visible cost-cutting and the lack of a sunroof at this price point (models such as the Venue, Nexon, and XUV 3XO offer one at the Rs 11.50 lakh that this top-spec Tekna + variant retails for), the Magnite is a more than competent package, especially when one considers that you pay just Rs 23,000 more for it compared to the outgoing model’s top-spec trim. The Magnite model should help Nissan maintain a foothold in India, at least for the near future.

    "description": "The car you see in these pictures needs no introduction. An icon of the Mr Bean series and The Italian Job movies, the Mini Cooper is perhaps more famous than the characters behind its wheel. It has been the benchmark for fun, fast, small hatchbacks, and this new Cooper S is the last to be petrol-powered, as from here on, it will be an EV-only model. So, let’s see if it lives up to its legacy. 2024 Mini Cooper S: design The new triangular tail-lamps get individual configurable LED elements. The easiest way to tell that this is the latest Cooper S is to look at the rear end. The Mini Cooper now gets triangular tail-lamps with individual LED elements that can be configured to display three different animations, including the famed Union Jack pattern. Similarly, the iconic round headlights are bezel-less, and they, too, have custom animations. The octagonal front grille is larger and features a blanked-off trim in the centre. In keeping with its sporty theme, there are no chrome elements on the outside; instead, you get a generous dose of gloss black surrounding the grille, the mirrors, the roof and the tailgate. There’s also some cladding around the wheel arches and stylish 17-inch alloys. 17-inch alloy wheels with run-flat tyres are standard. A special mention must go to this Sunny Side Yellow paint on our test car, which grabs many eyeballs. Notably, this new Cooper S forgoes the air intakes in the bumpers and, more controversially, visible exhaust tips. 2024 Mini Cooper S: interior, features In the pursuit of minimalism, Mini has forgone the instrument cluster, giving the dashboard a clean look. The 9.4-inch OLED centre touchscreen doubles up as the instrument cluster, showing relevant driving information, depending on which mode you’re in. This Android-based screen is the cabin’s highlight, and it controls most functions, too. The crisp 9.4-inch OLED touchscreen doubles up as an instrument panel. The screen is high in resolution, and the touch is slick. However, the multiple menus and sub-menus mean that you need time to get accustomed to it. Mini has used sustainable materials on the dashboard, door cards and seats, which look nice and rather unconventional but will be challenging to keep clean. The steering is nice to look at, with its two-spoke design, and the tensioned fabric piece that acts like the third spoke is a cool touch. However, the steering’s rim is too thick, much like those of several M Sport BMWs. The front seats are accommodating; they hold you well in place around corners and offer good adjustability, but electrical adjustment is part of an optional pack. Entry to the rear seat is tight, and it isn’t particularly spacious, but adults can fit here for shorter journeys. What does help matters is the dual-pane sunroof, which opens up the feeling of space in the cabin. The rear seat is comfy enough for adults on short trips. As for features, the Cooper S packs in quite a bit of standard equipment, and our test car was also fitted with an optional Classic pack worth Rs 5.85 lakh, which brought in a couple of feel-good bits. Chief among them are the superb-sounding Harman Kardon sound system and the head-up display, which shows you the necessary information, such as speed, gear and tachometer. Uniquely, it also brings in an inside camera for taking photos or videos while you’re out on a drive. Standard features include auto climate control, LED lights, a rear camera, a large wireless charging pad in the centre console, ambient lighting and cruise control.  HUD (optional) replaces the traditional instrument cluster. 2024 Mini Cooper S: powertrain, performance Underpinning the new Mini Cooper S is a heavily updated version of the outgoing Mini’s platform. The engine is also the same 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol but uprated for this latest version. Output stands at 204hp and 300Nm, up from the older car’s 178hp and 280Nm, and it continues to send power to the front wheels. The 2.0L 4-pot unit has been uprated to 204hp. Twist the toggle switch in the centre console, and the four-pot burbles to life. This simple twist switch makes you feel like you’re operating an aircraft and adds to the cool factor. The exhaust, while not particularly loud, does have a nice raspy tone to it. And like most modern, sporty cars, the Cooper S also pipes an artificial exhaust sound into the cabin through the speakers. While some might say this is sacrilege, I actually think it enhances the experience. The BMW-sourced motor is a highlight of this car as power is plentiful, and its rev-happy nature just eggs you on to drive harder. It leaps off the line, and the instant power delivery never leaves you wanting more. Cooper S leaps off the line, and the instant power delivery never leaves you wanting more. The engine is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox that is quick and responsive, and depending on which drive mode you’re in, it’ll either upshift at the earliest to conserve fuel or hold on to lower gears longer for maximum performance. One of the biggest misses with this new Cooper S, though, is that it lacks any form of manual control for the gearbox: no paddles, no Tiptronic function and not even a proper gear lever, with only a toggle switch to select drive direction. The only way to get it to downshift is by pressing the accelerator hard and then waiting for the gearbox to kick down. For a hot hatch like the Mini Cooper S, this is a big letdown. Another miss is a handbrake lever, so there’s no scope for fun manoeuvres such as handbrake turns and J-turns.  The Cooper S is sprightliest in the Go-Kart mode, where it feels quite literally like a go-kart. On the move, the Cooper S feels energetic and quick despite its 1,360kg kerb weight. And that’s backed up by the performance figures. Mini claims a 0-100kph time of 6.6 seconds, but we managed to time it a shade quicker at 6.48 seconds in Go-Kart mode. And despite having no manual control, the gearbox is quick enough to kick down, which enables you to dart in between the gaps in slow-moving traffic. In-gear acceleration, then, is strong, too, taking 3.62 seconds for the 20-80kph sprint and 4.56 seconds for 40-100kph. Ambient light colour and pattern depend on the drive mode. The new Cooper S offers seven modes, each with unique ambient lighting and screen graphics, with the Classic pack. However, only three of them – Core, Go-Kart and Efficient – actually alter the driving experience. Core is the standard mode, offering the best balance between performance and efficiency. Efficient, as the name suggests, is the eco mode, which dulls throttle response in the interest of efficiency.  The Cooper S is sprightliest in the Go-Kart mode, where it feels quite literally like a go-kart. It’s in this mode where the engine, gearbox and throttle are the most responsive, and the car feels like it shrinks around you. The other four modes only alter the ambient lighting and graphics and play an audio track. 2024 Mini Cooper S: ride, handling The brakes are sharp, with a strong initial bite followed by progressive stopping power. In our test, it took 25.76 metres to come to a halt from 80kph. On Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring. There’s no scope for adjustability, as it doesn’t get adaptive dampers. The run-flat tyres don’t help either. The optional 18-inch alloys will have even slimmer side walls, which will further hamper the ride quality. But drive it on a perfectly paved road like the new coastal road in Mumbai, and it is just super. On Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring. The stiff ride means that it feels tight and agile around the bends, with absolutely no body roll. The steering is also sharp, and the Cooper S is quick to turn into corners, making it feel like it shrinks around you. There’s barely any slack at the centre position, and you’ll like the fact that it is communicative, too. You’ll also notice torque steer when driving flat-out, but it’s nothing that’s not manageable; here, it is actually fun and adds to the drama. Like Coopers of the past, this new one remains a hoot to drive. Then, there’s also the fact that Mini is saving its best for the full-blown John Cooper Works (JCW) version, which is expected to arrive at a later date, and that should dial things up further. 2024 Mini Cooper S: price, verdict The Mini Cooper S is a car you clearly buy with your heart rather than your head, especially considering it costs Rs 44.90 lakh (ex-showroom), before options. Then, there’s the lack of manual control for the gearbox, and it’s a stiff ride to contend with. Beyond that, though, it is simply a hoot and remains as charming as ever. It’s packed with more tech than before and has a superb engine. Moreover, you won’t be able to buy this petrol-powered hot hatch after a couple of years. That might be reason enough to get the Mini now.  Also see: 2024 Mini Cooper S video review New Mini Convertible revealed Electric Mini Cooper JCW gets 258hp",

    "description": "BMW has given a mid-life update to the current-generation 2 Series Gran Coupe. The German brand’s smallest sedan is a direct rival to the Mercedes A-Class sedan, which is also sold in India. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe gets 1 Series like design cues Gets refreshed interior with curved infotainment screen Current powertrain options likely to continue for India BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe facelift: what all is new? While BMW has released official details and pictures of the 2-series Grand Coupe facelift in standard wheelbase form, its LWB iteration was leaked in China a few months ago. The updated 2 Series Gran Coupe has a completely different front compared to the outgoing model. The new face now resembles the recently updated 1 Series line-up, and the update brings the four-year-old 2 Series Gran Coupe more in line with BMW's fresh design theme. The refreshed look includes a lowered front with angular cuts, upward-swept headlamps, and a wider, more prominent dual kidney grille. The front bumper has a broad chin with a large air dam split into three parts, with two placed at the extreme corners. With the design revamp, the 2 Series Gran Coupe has been stretched by 20mm to 4,546mm, while its width and height have increased by 15mm each, now measuring 1,800mm and 1,435mm, respectively. According to BMW, these changes were made in part to maximise interior space. The M Sport models will get more blacked-out treatment, while the standard iterations incorporate ample chrome bits. There aren’t many changes on the sides and the doors also look the same as those on the pre-facelift car. At the back, it gets a more angular boot design with new BMW X1-like tail-lamps. The license plate location has been moved from the rear bumper to between the tail-lamps. The interior has also been updated with design changes from the 1 Series, including a curved touchscreen that runs the latest BMW OS9 software, resulting in a reduction in the number of physical buttons.   BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe facelift: powertrain and India launch details The entry-level BMW 220 uses BMW’s 167hp, 1.5-litre, three-cylinder turbo petrol engine, paired with a 48V mild-hybrid setup. The sport-oriented M235 xDrive uses a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, turbo petrol engine that delivers 296hp and does a 0-100kph sprint in 4.9 seconds. Both the 220 and the M235 xDrive come with a seven-speed automatic gearbox. Some markets, such as India, will likely continue with the existing petrol and diesel engine options. We expect BMW to introduce the updated 2-series line-up in India sometime early next year.

    "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar N125 has been revealed fully ahead of its looming India launch but without any details regarding its technical specifications or pricing. N125’s styling is typical Pulsar but distinctive enough Some of its parts are shared with Pulsar N150 and Freedom 125 Expected price is Rs 90,000-Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom)  The new Pulsar N125 has typical aggressive Pulsar styling, but it still has its own identity, which differentiates it from the other models. For starters, the LED headlight seems to be a brand-new unit, and the N125 has a lot of plastic cladding at the front. The fork shrouds and the panel around the headlight are covered in plastic to give it a beefy look. The plastic panel around the headlight will be finished in different colours depending on the shade you choose.  The N125 shares its wheels with the bigger Pulsar N150 and its display and indicators with the Freedom 125. This means that the N125 could have basic Bluetooth functionality built in. In keeping with its youthful positioning, the Pulsar N125 also has some new graphics on the side panels and tail section. Just like its primary rivals, the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R, the Pulsar N125 also has a split seating arrangement. The Pulsar N125 will be Bajaj’s fifth offering in the 125cc class after the Pulsar 125, Pulsar NS125, Freedom 125 and CT 125X, and it remains to be seen if it shares any of its fundamentals with the other models in this list.  We expect that the N125 will be priced in the same ballpark as its rivals from Hero and TVS, so expect it to sit around the Rs 90,000-Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) bracket.  Also See: Bajaj readying TVS Raider, Hero Xtreme 125R rival",

    "link": "",
    "description": "When choosing a car for one of the world’s most arduous automobile events, the Prodrive Peking to Paris Motor Challenge, what would you pick? Especially if you’ve never driven, or navigated, on its epic route that spans over 8,500 miles – which crosses some of the world’s toughest terrain... Katarina Kyvalova is no ordinary racing driver.  It was fitting that someone who made their racing debut in a 24-hour event in a pre-war Bentley should get her first taste of the Prodrive Peking to Paris in a wild, first-of-its-kind restomod from British racing and rallying legends Prodrive, based – of all things – on a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback donor car. A regular in historic motorsports, usually seen racing a 4.5-liter Bentley, a Cooper Jaguar or a Jaguar E-Type, Katarina took a huge leap out of her comfort zone by signing up for one of the most gruelling and prestigious endurance rallies in the world before the global health pandemic of 2020. She finally got to compete in the 2024 edition of this quite unique event, that was first held way back in 1907. Continue...",

    "description": "In our last Eldorado episode, we reviewed the interior changes made to Cadillac’s flagship convertible as it was refreshed for 1963. In its move upmarket, the Eldorado joined the Fleetwood assembly line with the Sixty Special and Seventy-Five. It received wood trim for the first time in 1963, alongside a modernized and more cockpit-style dashboard. Outside, it adopted the subtle de-chromed look present on other contemporary Fleetwood models. In 1964 for the sixth generation’s second and final year, Eldorado was refreshed yet again.",

However, for those not interested in media references hand picked to appeal to the brand’s key demographic, there is likewise a generic theme that you can pair with whatever Halloween decorations you happen to have on hand. Starting October 18th, Rivian is introducing “Car Costumes” as part of its annual spooky seasonal update. Owners will be able to customize both the interior and exterior of their vehicles. However, the brunt of these features are for display purposes only — as the vehicles must remain in park if they are to function properly.",
