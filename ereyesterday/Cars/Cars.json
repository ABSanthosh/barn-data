    "description": "This 1969 Ferrari Dino 206 GT is one of approximately 154 examples built during a year and a half of production and is one of two 206 GTs originally finished in Azzurro Metallizzato. Chassis 00310 was ordered new via Garage La Rotonda in Florence, Italy, in March 1968, and was completed on January 3, 1969, before being delivered to its first owner 25 days later. The car spent its first 47 years based in Lucca, Italy, the first 29 of which were with its original owner, who passed it on to the stewardship of his daughter in 1998. After being sold to its next owner in Rome, Italy, in 2016, the car underwent a refurbishment that was completed in early 2018 and included a repaint of the aluminum body in its original shade. It was then purchased by the seller in December 2023 and imported to the US. Power is provided by a mid-mounted 2.0L quad-cam V6 that breathes through triple Weber 40 DCN carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include center-lock Cromodora magnesium-alloy wheels, servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, an external fuel-filler cap, black vinyl interior upholstery with blue cloth seat inserts, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 206 GT is now offered in Carpinteria, California, with original order documents, correspondence between Ferrari and the original owner, its original Italian registration booklet, a Matthias Bartz report, a Marcel Massini report, refurbishment photos, owner’s manuals, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2026-citroen-c5-aircross-design-95-ready-production",
    "description": "Concept is 150mm longer and 39mm lower than the current C5 Aircross Forward-looking SUV concept prioritises interior space and aerodynamic efficiency The boldly styled concept for the next Citroën C5 Aircross is \"95% ready\" for showrooms and will usher in a raft of distinctive new design cues for the French brand's electric era. Citroën's largest model will enter its second generation next year, retaining its traditional two-box silhouette but being heavily redesigned as it moves onto Stellantis's new STLA Medium platform and gains an EV option. At the Brussels motor show, Citroën designer Pierre Leclercq said that while the show car – shown for the first time last year – is a more outlandish version of what will come to showrooms, it's nonetheless \"95% what we will have in production\". \"This is what we call a teaser,\" he told Autocar. \"We take a production car, we beef it up and that's it.\" That means the next C5 Aircross will retain the concept's distinctive LED headlight signatures and new ultra-slim, horizontal brake-light designs. It will have a more heavily raked roofline than the current car, too, and is likely to feature flush door handles, a vent motif on the C-pillar and squared-off wheel arches. Features that are likely to remain on the show stand include the intricate kaleidoscopic wheel designs and the chunky black body cladding. Leclerq said one of the primary aims of the concept was to show how Citroën's mid-sized SUV will be differentiated from the Peugeot, Vauxhall and DS models with which it will share its platform. \"Because we developed this on the same platform, we try to be clever with synergies, but we tried to have a vehicle which is really working with our values: family room, functionality and comfort. \"You will also see this in the interior, which goes completely in that direction.\" Citroën has yet to reveal the interior, because it wants to \"keep a little bit of meat for the launch\", Leclerq said, but it's expected to take its lead from the new C3 and C4, introducing new-generation infotainment and functionality but maintaining a focus on utility with plenty of physical controls. Meanwhile, the car's upright silhouette is emblematic of Citroën's brand positioning and ambition, Leclerq said. \"This is a family vehicle. The [related] Peugeot 3008 is a sporty coupé. We have a car that is very vertical in the rear, which shows a lot of interior space.\" \"We're going up for the second row,\" he added, referencing the fact that the highest point of the roofline is over the back seats. \"That says: 'hey, this is a car that is also made for the second row.' This is very much a family vehicle.\" While the smaller C3 Aircross – based on Stellantis's cost-saving Smart Car platform – has seven seats, the C5 Aircross is described as a five-seater. However, Leclerq said \"we will talk more about that when the car comes out\", suggesting that there is potential for a third row.  Notably, the related Peugeot 5008 is sold as a seven-seater.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-will-not-force-twingo-uk-dealers-boost-ev-sales-mix",
    "description": "New Twingo uses same platform as the reborn 5 but is 170mm shorter French firm says there must be an organic business case for importing new electric city car Renault is gauging the viability of launching the new Twingo in the UK but will not \"force\" the retro city car into the market just to boost its EV sales mix.  The fourth-generation, electric-only Twingo is due on sale next year with a starting price in Europe of sub-€20,000 (£16,700), but there is a chance that, like its 1990s namesake, it won't be exported to the UK. Speaking to journalists at the Brussels motor show, where a \"90%-ready\" prototype was unveiled (complete with running gear and a full interior), Renault bosses confirmed that internal discussions are under way on the viability of selling the Twingo here. Product performance boss Bruno Vanel said: \"There is a decision to be made. We remain on this one: a decision is still to be made, depending on the interest and the business case.\" Asked whether the Twingo could be an important addition to Renault’s ranks in the context of the UK's zero-emission vehicle mandate, under which manufacturers must achieve a 33% EV sales mix in 2026, Renault CEO Fabrice Cambolive said: \"Sure, but the main point is whether there is a customer attractiveness, demand value and whether there is a business case.  “It's not only because of the ZEV mandate that we're forcing a new car onto the market just to push it. We are very much focused on the value and attractiveness.\" Asked if he would push to find a way to make the Twingo work in the UK, Cambolive said: \"We need to find the right balance. I love extending the line-up, I love this product and I think there can be a story in the UK; it's just that we have to find the right figures.\" While Renault never brought the Mk1 Twingo to the UK, later iterations were sold here from 2007 to 2019, when the rear-engined Mk3 – twinned with the Smart Forfour – was taken off sale, having sold fewer than 1000 units in its final full year. The electric Twingo ZE, which went out of production in 2024, was never offered in the UK. Renault aims to take the Mk4 from conception to the road in less than two years and has partnered with an unnamed Chinese consultancy in a bid to make the engineering and production processes as efficient as possible. In spite of its low projected list price (which puts it in the realm of the petrol-engined Kia Picanto and Hyundai i10) the four-seat city car features a host of “upper-segment technology” inside and is described as a “joyful, trendy” proposition. The newly revealed interior is clearly related to that of Renault’s larger EVs, dominated as it is by a 7.0in digital instrument cluster and a 10.1in infotainment touchscreen, but makes obvious nods  to the cabin of the original Twingo from 1992. Renault describes the cockpit as \"airy, cylindrical and suspended\", with ovoid air vents and surfaces an obvious homage to the era-defining 1990s supermini. Notably, the seats of this new Twingo prototype are coloured to match the exterior paint, taking inspiration from the lurid upholstery options that were available on the old car. A more subtle nostalgic design cue is the prototype's prominent red hazard light button, a reference to the similarly conspicuous dome-shaped button on top of the old Twingo's dash. In another urban-flavoured 1990s throwback, the front seatbacks are adjusted using skateboard wheels. Beyond its retro-modern design, Renault says every aspect of the Twingo's interior is \"designed to make life easier\", highlighting a range of features that boost storage capacity and utility. There are bag storage cubbies under the dashboard, for example, plus a flat, full-width shelf for books or sunglasses. There's also a split-folding rear bench to increase boot space, plus magnetic phone-mounts on the back of the front headrests and an elasticated bottle holder. Beyond the interior’s retro-modern design, Renault said every aspect had been “designed to make life easier”, highlighted by a range of features that boost storage capacity and utility.  The floor of the prototype is finished in cork, chosen for its durability and resistance, but Renault noted that “show cars are an opportunity to explore and test new ideas”, so this material seems unlikely to make it into customer cars. Externally, little has been changed from the 2023 concept, but there’s now a concealed air intake in the front bumper, the rear arches have shrunk slightly and the protective corner cladding at each end now has a honeycomb design. In a concession to production viability, the door handles no longer light up and the semi-circular brake lights have been joined at the bottom by another LED strip. Renault said the latest evolution of the Twingo is driveable, and while it has offered no further details on the powertrain, it’s understood to be closely related to that used in the closely related Renault 5. The company has also yet to confirm plans to sell the Twingo in the UK, after CEO Luca de Meo told Autocar last month that developing a right-hand drive variant would be “a challenge”. He said Renault “needed to find a business case” but acknowledged that it could be helped by its tie-up with Nissan, which will sell its next-generation Micra, another Ampr Small-based EV, with RHD in its home market of Japan. “When they want the wheel on the other side too, it becomes less complicated,” de Meo said.",

    "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "The Maruti Swift has been a part of our fleet for a couple of months now, during which it’s been a ‘fill it and forget it’ type of car. While its fuel efficiency may be its biggest draw for most in the office, I’ve discovered a few more virtues of the Swift in the time I’ve spent with it. The seat comfort and the driving position are absolutely spot on. First, it’s just so easy to drive and live with. The compact dimensions and light controls mean it’s effortless to operate, and its relatively affordable price tag (compared to the BMWs, Mercs and Audis in our fleet currently) means I don’t have to be stressed out about where I take it and where I park it. Then, of course, there’s the fuel efficiency. It’s actually down from Jay’s 14.2kpl to 13kpl – pardon my enthusiastic driving for that. But that’s still very good, given the traffic on my route to the office. Presence of a centre armrest would’ve added to the comfort. The reason for the enthusiastic driving is the gearbox and the steering. Sure, the engine lacks punch, but the smooth shifts and light clutch mean you don’t mind rowing through the gears. The steering is precise and feelsome. Living in Mumbai, I prefer the automatic version of a car, but it’s the complete opposite with the Swift. Smooth shifts, light clutch mean you don’t mind driving in traffic. What adds to the driving experience is the driver’s seat – there’s the right amount of support and plenty of adjustability, which makes it easy to find your ideal driving position. I also like that the driver’s seat goes really low, as that’s how I prefer to sit. Speaking of some things I’ve missed in the Swift, the presence of a centre armrest would’ve really added to the comfort factor. I’m sure there are some aftermarket solutions for that, but it would’ve been nice to see it from the factory. There’s also no tyre pressure monitor, and I recently found out why it’s an important bit of kit. On a shoot, one of my colleagues noticed that the rear right tyre was looking under inflated unbeknownst to me. A screw turned out to be the culprit and, thankfully, there was a repair shop close by to fix it. No TPMS means it takes time to realise that there’s a puncture. Other than that, the Swift is a hard car to fault – it’s no wonder, then, that it’s as successful as it is. Being the master of efficiency, it has been tough keeping a hold of the Swift’s keys for long, and it now has a new custodian. Hopefully, I can get it back soon to see what it’s like on a long road trip and tell you more about its highway efficiency, boot space, and rear-seat comfort.

    "description": "Union minister Nitin Gadkari has announced that the government will increase the reward for “Good Samaritans” helping accident victims by five times to Rs 25,000. This change will apply to national and state highways, as well as district, city, and Gram Panchayat roads. Government to provide cashless benefit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh as well Delhi recorded the highest number of city accidents in 2022 in India Speeding, drunk driving, road rage and poor road conditions are a few factors behind these crashes. “For those taking these victims to a hospital or trauma centre within the first hour, the current Rs 5,000 reward is inadequate and should be increased,” Gadkari said during a road safety program, which was also attended by actor Anupam Kher.  Good Samaritan law A Good Samaritan (a term first used in the Bible) is someone who, “without expectation of payment or reward and any duty of care or special relationship, voluntarily comes forward to administer immediate assistance or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, crash, or emergency medical condition”, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways website. The law also protects ‘Good Samaritans’ from harassment for their help. “Once an FIR is filed and recorded online, the victim can avail cashless treatment for a maximum of seven days from the date of the accident, of up to Rs 1.5 lakh...The entire system is being made transparent, time-bound, and computerised to ensure that help is given as quickly as possible,” Gadkari added. Road accidents in India Metro cities like Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai have seen an alarming increase in road accidents in the past few years. In 2022, Delhi alone recorded 1,412 fatalities, the highest number of accidents in India. That explains the chaotic driving conditions that exist in these places.  A 2023 Autocar Professional report stated that fatalities caused by a 'hit from back' accounted for 19.5 percent of all accident-related deaths. This was closely followed by 'hit-and-run' accidents, which accounted for 18.1 percent of the total, and 'head-on collisions', which accounted for 15.7 percent.

    "description": "Hyundai India is gearing up to launch its first mass-market EV, the new Creta Electric, later this week. This will be the beginning of an EV onslaught as the Korean carmaker has three more EVs lined up for India. Speaking to Autocar India, Hyundai Motor India COO, Tarun Garg, said, “Three more models will come in after the Creta Electric and that will also drive up the volumes.” He, however, did not comment on the timeline or order in which these EVs would arrive. Both born electrics and ICE-derived EVs on the cards Focus will be on the high-volume segments Like the Creta Electric, future EVs will also be locally assembled Garg also did not divulge further details on what exactly these models could be, but he did hint that these will be focused at the more affordable spectrum of the market. “I would not like to say exactly which segment, but we are looking at all the high-volume segments with a lot of interest,” he added. Notably, the upcoming EVs will be locally produced. Hyundai has already localised the battery for the Creta Electric, so the future EVs can take advantage of that. Going forward, the brand even plans to localise cell manufacturing, powertrain and power electronics as well. While Garg refrained from sharing model-specific details, he did hint that the brand is looking at multiple body styles, and not just SUVs. “We are looking at different body types. Some will be dedicated EVs and some will be derived EVs. So, I think it will be a good combination of both.” Upcoming Hyundai EVs: what could they be? We expect one of these models to be based on the Inster EV sold overseas. Internally codenamed the HE1i, this compact EV could be positioned as a rival to the Punch EV. It will be based on the born-electric E-GMP (K) platform, and could arrive in India by the second half of 2026. Overseas, the Inster gets two battery pack options – 42kWh and 49kWh – with WLTP range of up to 355km. The other two EVs are likely to be electric versions of the Venue and the Grand i10 Nios. Both models are due a generation change by 2027, and it is likely that they will feature an electric powertrain as well. With Garg specifying their focus on volume segments, an electric Venue and Grand i10 Nios also fit the bill appropriately. These aside, Hyundai is also expected to introduce a facelift for the Ioniq 5 sometime this year.

If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect.
