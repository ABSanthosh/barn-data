    "description": "Spring Fever. I’m not sure how it hits in less desolate parts of the world, but around here it gets our brains churning with ideas. After six months of snow and rain, the itch sets in for all the ill-advised marketplace transactions, wild pet projects and trips we’d like to take. With summer and hope on the horizon, we scoured the shop for something entertaining to do after hours—something just for fun—and the perfect project was in the corner gathering dust. Sipping and Swiping I can trace the genesis of this idea back to a particular Whiskey Wednesday in June of 2023. Somehow, Jeff had stumbled upon a small air-cooled diesel engine on Amazon selling for a measly $179.99. Essentially the redneck cousin of Harbor Freight’s Predator 212, the Amazon diesel displaces 196 cc and is rated at 3 hp and (wait for it) 35 Nm [26 lb-ft].…",

Last year we were treated to a heavily revised Aston Martin Vantage, and now there's an open-air version: the Roadster.This car has the potential to be really quite special. When we say the Vantage was heavily revised, we mean it. Compared to the previous model, power skyrocketed. The chassis also gained complex new electronics and suspension hardware, not to mention a far more serious contact patch. All this has now been translated to the Roadster – and with minimal dynamic compromise, according to the Aston. What we'll now discover is whether that's really the case, and whether the Roadster justifies its £180,000-plus asking price.",

    "description": "Mercedes’ van-based MPV offers economical diesel engines and up to eight seats, but it commands a hefty premium compared with rivals One can make a case that it’s vans such as the Mercedes V-Class – and not the SUVs we’re plied with – that today come closest to mastering the art of the lifestyle vehicle.It’s why you find so many MPV owners, never to return to the SUV fold, eulogising the utility and surprising opulence of their boxy (and sometimes quite expensive) wheels.Playing into this is the fact that the ‘van with windows’ market has recently become more desirable and competitive than ever. Volkswagen has its understatedly charming Multivan; Ford’s Tourneo Custom has a panoramic roof; and the new Lexus LM, with its Mark Levinson sound system, is pitched as something to go up against the BMW 7 Series.As an established player in this area (one in which its compatriots Audi and BMW still have never so much as dabbled), Mercedes-Benz needs to keep up, and so it has updated the V-Class for 2024, with a sharper exterior design and an overhaul of the infotainment system.",

    "description": "Before the hotly anticipated Golf GTI makes it to India, Volkswagen has launched the Tiguan R-Line. In the past, we have had it with the diesel engine, then came the three-row Tiguan Allspace and finally was reverted back to being a five-seater with a petrol engine. The new model comes in as a CBU (Completely Built Unit), gets a 2.0-litre, 204hp TSI engine, a five-seat layout and a Rs 50 lakh price tag. It is a unique offering, but is it worth the money? VW Tiguan R-Line exterior design and engineering (8/10) Longer and wider than the outgoing Tiguan SUV Where the previous Tiguans were all angular, the new one embraces curves and bold lines. Dimensionally, it is longer and wider but gets the same wheelbase as before and has shortened in terms of height now. The front gets a simple and clean look with Matrix LED headlamps up top along with a DRL strip that stretches the width of the car. The bumper low down features blacked out treatment for fake mesh and large air dams to channel air around the car. Also a chunky chrome strip at the bottom adds some bling to an otherwise sporty look. Matrix LED headlights are bridged by a closed grille, which also features an ‘R’ badge. The side features dual-tone 19-inch wheels that look sporty along with gloss black wheel arches. There are two sharp creases on the shoulder line and a chrome strip surrounding the windows. It gets 176mm of ground clearance and roof rails to add some height to the look. However, it does miss out on keyless entry. At the rear, the IQ LED taillamps stretch from end to end and the upright design gives it that typical SUV look. No exhaust tips here seems to be a missed opportunity for the R-Line but it does get some more chrome. Overall, it is a design typical to VWs. Restrained but widely acceptable. Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line tech specsSuspension (f/r)Independent, MacPherson Strut, coil springs/ independent, multi-linkBrakes (f/r)DiscsTyres (f/r)255/ 45 R19Kerb weight1,758kgBoot space652 litresFuel tank60 litres VW Tiguan R-Line interior space and comfort (7/10) Buttonless dashboard, 15-inch touchscreen The Tiguan R-Line features a completely new interior apart from the steering wheel which shares a lot with the India 2.0 cars with the only difference being an ‘R’ on the steering base. The layout is simple and minimalistic and as a result the dashboard is completely buttonless. The only physical buttons are low down on the centre console where you have the electronic parking brake, the engine start stop and you have a knob which when you touch and press can change the settings from volume to drive modes. Minimalistic interior with most functions in the touchscreen. The rest of the features have been incorporated by the massive 15-inch touchscreen. Good news is the UX UI which is very simple and uncluttered. The menus and functions are intuitive and despite having the climate controls on the screen, it isn’t complicated. What it does miss out on is a 360-degree camera, which is a feature available on cars in much lower segments. Also, the resolution for the reversing camera is poor and in the dark it struggles for clarity. The screen otherwise is smooth, gets wireless connectivity and even ambient lighting with multiple themes. In terms of overall quality, it is a bit of a mix. While the build is good and on the top half of the dash and the doors you have soft touch material with exposed stitching, the lower half gets hard scratchy plastic that takes away some of that premium quotient. Amenities include a flip open cubby hole that reveals two wireless charging pads along with two type-C ports. There is more space lower down and then it also gets a large big cubby hole again with two cup holders.  Manual controls for adjusting front seat; lumbar adjustment is electric. In terms of comfort, the sport seats are very comfortable and get plenty of support with broad bolsters and even multiple massaging functions. Cooled seats are missing and instead it features seat heating, which for buyers in the north will come in handy once every year. The big miss though, is the absence of electric controls for the seat adjustment. In 2025, manually adjusting the seats on a Rs 50 lakh SUV is simply unacceptable. The lumbar adjustment is electric, but everything else requires arm twisting. Space is good, but no recline for the backrest robs some comfort. Since the wheelbase is similar to the previous version, space in the rear is good for two adults. However, the high transmission tunnel with the protruding AC vents means the middle passenger will have to suffer. What also robs away some comfort is the upright backrest that cannot be reclined. The seat can move further ahead to open up more luggage room, and the centre back rest flips open for easy access to the boot. Headroom, however, is impressive despite featuring a panoramic sunroof. 652-litre boot; seats can be flipped down and slid ahead for more room. Practicality wise the Tiguan R-Line features a huge 652 litre boot along with a space saver spare wheel under the boot floor. There are seat flip switches too but an electric tailgate is missing. VW Tiguan R-Line performance and refinement (7/10) 204hp-2.0-litre TSI engine; 0-100kph takes 7.1 seconds Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line powertrain specsEngine4 cyls, 1984cc, turbo-petrolPower204hp at 4,500-6,000rpmTorque320Nm at 1,500-4,400rpmGearbox7-speed dual-clutch autoDrive layoutFront engine, AWD0-100kph7.1 seconds Powering the Tiguan R-Line is a 2.0-litre TSI engine putting out 204hp and 320Nm and mated to a 7-speed DSG gearbox. Performance, however, is nothing to boast about.The power delivery is linear and it lacks punch, especially in the bottom-end of the rev range. 0-100kph is a respectable 7.1 secs but the overall drive won’t excite you. It gets drive modes and ‘Sport’ does offer some more eagerness, but apart from that there isn’t much to look forward to. It prefers being driven sedately on the highways. 204hp engine is refined but lacks bottom-end punch. What is nice, however, is the response from the paddle shifters. Even though the gearbox does not hold the gears till the 7,000rpm redline and upshifts around 6,000rpm, you can control a fair amount of the shifts, especially during downshifts. And while on the topic of redline, there isn’t a sweet exhaust note to speak of. The engine instead sounds coarse at high rpms so its best to upshift a bit early. Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line acceleration figures from a standstillFrom rest (in kph)Time (in seconds)201.12402.03603.26805.011007.101209.8914013.83 Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line in-gear acceleration figures (in kickdown)In-gear acceleration (in kph)Time (in seconds)20-804.1540-1005.32 VW Tiguan R-Line mileage (7/10) 12.58kpl (claimed by Volkswagen) VW claims 12.58kpl according to European approval methods and there isn’t an ARAI figure yet. However, it does get cylinder deactivation which means two of the four cylinders can automatically shut off to save fuel. Once we get the car for a longer duration we will put it through a proper fuel efficiency run according to Autocar Test Standards. VW Tiguan R-Line ride comfort and handling (8.5/10) New DCC Pro system adjusts damping in real time While the powertrain is relaxed and unassuming, what is very impressive is the ride and handling. The major contributing factor here being the DCC Pro (Dynamic Chassis Control), which can adjust the damping based on various factors. It works seamlessly and you can notice the difference between the stiffer Sport mode and the softer Comfort mode. On a winding section with smooth asphalt, the suspension takes into account the road surface, steering angle, and even throttle position to alter the damping. It stays flat and composed through corners and once the road gets bumpy, the firmness is exchanged with more absorption. Driving it in the twisties is fun, mainly thanks to adaptive dampers. What also changes character according to the modes is the steering heft. It is light and breezy in Comfort and weighs up in Sport. Add to that the well-bolstered seats, and the overall experience from behind the wheel is better on a ghaat section. Grip levels are good too courtesy the 4MOTION AWD system. VW Tiguan R-Line features and safety (7/10) Panoramic sunroof, Level 2 ADAS There is plenty of kit on the Tiguan R-Line since it is a CBU. It gets Matrix LED headlamps, 19-inch wheels, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a panoramic sunroof, massaging front seats, three-zone climate control, heated seats, 9 airbags, and Level 2 ADAS among others. What it misses out on, are ventilated seats, an electric tailgate and an electric adjust for front seats.

The engine isn’t too exciting, some features are missing and the rivals like the Skoda Kodiaq and even the Audi Q3 offer better value and brand strength respectively. What the Tiguan has in its favour is the ride and handling and a bit of exclusivity as it is a CBU and you won’t be seeing many out on the road. For the small pocket of buyers that don’t have the need for an extra row of seats and don't care for the badge, the Tiguan R-Line is an SUV worth checking out.

    "description": "Going from the small, zippy and city-friendly Maruti Suzuki Swift to the big, heavy and highway-friendly Jeep Meridian is quite the shift, but a dhaba dinner plan with a group of friends meant the Meridian was just what the doctor ordered. Or so I thought. As soon as I drove into the meeting point, I realised a problem. There were seven of us, and while the Meridian looks huge on the outside, once you start packing in people, it’s quite the squeeze. The second row flip-folded down with ease, but immediately after seeing the third row, the happy smiles on my friends’ faces turned upside down. We narrowed down the most slender and athletic of the group and pleaded and apologised profusely as they crammed themselves in the back. There was more apologising once they asked me to move the middle row ahead since the Meridian does not have that option. Yes, the second row is fixed. The 9-speaker Alpine system with surround sound is excellent. Three abreast in the middle row were relatively happier, though, and with all AC vents adjusted, we were ready to roll. To uplift the glum mood, I opened up the panoramic sunroof, where the middle row thanked their stars, and the last row prayed we would reach our destination fast. Powering the Meridian is the same 2.0-litre diesel engine from the Compass, mated to a 9-speed automatic gearbox. I hoped the Meridian, being a diesel, was easy on the wallet for the 200km round trip. What was immediately apparent was how adept it felt with a full load. A friend who drives a Fortuner daily could not believe how well the suspension fared. Sure, a Fortuner is no benchmark for ride, but the monocoque chassis of the Meridian really shines on flat roads. Also impressive is the steering that is light and breezy for such a large SUV. In the city, you feel almost no stress on the arms. Auto braking needs to be switched off each time you start the car. As we got out on open roads, the engine, which was growling every time I put my foot down, settled into a constant drone. It is disappointingly loud. The only way to mute the mill is by upping the Alpine audio system, which, by the way, is excellent. The bass and surround sound ensure a good listening experience, and calls are crisp and clear. The Meridian also gets ADAS, which, at least on the well-marked highway we were on, worked well. Thankfully, for the erratic city traffic, you can turn it off. Unfortunately, it cannot be set to default, which means each time you turn the car off and back on, you need to disable the system first, or it may surprise you by braking abruptly every time someone cuts you off. The 360-degree camera is lag-free and has great clarity even at night. Once we reached the dhaba, the third-row passengers scuffled out of the back and cracked their bones for some relief. “This is not a 7-seater” was the most repeated line I heard that night. On my way back, the late-night drive was calming, with the Meridian absolutely steamrolling every bump and bad section on the road, the AC working tremendously well, and the Alpine system helping passengers nod off to some soothing music. I realised the Meridian is a very good highway car, but as a 7-seater, it’s a hard sell. With kids, it would be better, but the best use case would be to fold down the rear seats and pack a whole lot of luggage in there. Because as a highway cruiser, it gets the basics right – a tried and tested diesel engine (though it’s loud), a very good audio system, exceptional ride over bad roads and plenty of features to make the drive easier and safer. Will I regret it once I get back to the city that has construction on already narrow roads? Or will I be unfazed and use the low-range gearbox while coming out of Bandra? I’d soon know. Tough door beading means that you need to shut doors with force.

    "description": "TVS entered the electric scooter game with its popular iQube back in 2020 and since then it has regularly finished in the top 3 in terms of monthly EV sales. Now we have learned that the company is working on a new budget-friendly EV model which will likely sit below the iQube and is slated to launch before the festive season.  TVS iQube is one of the bestselling EVs in India Expected to be priced around or below base iQube 2.2 ballpark Jupiter CNG also being readied for market launch soon TVS entry-level EV in the works Launch slated before festive season, expected price around base iQube ballpark  The TVS iQube has one of the most widespread lineups in the electric scooter game with five different variants available across three battery capacities. Pricing for the iQube starts at the Rs 1 lakh mark for the smallest 2.2kWh variant and goes up to nearly Rs 2 lakh for the range-topping 5.1kWh model. We have been led to believe that this new TVS electric scooter will be positioned below the iQube and given its intended positioning, it is reasonable to expect a small battery, simpler parts and fewer features.  With an ever-diminishing government subsidy and increasing inflation, the onus is on manufacturers to bring out newer products at competitive price points and TVS seems to be doing that very thing with its new entry-level electric scooter. While specific details are scarce at the moment, it is likely that just like the iQube which uses a hub-mounted motor (sourced from Bosch), this new TVS EV could also follow in its footsteps and it will likely will be a simple, no-frills offering to ensure costs are in check.   According to people in the know, TVS is aiming to bring its entry-level electric scooter to the market before the festive season to capitalise on market demand and hit the ground running with its new offering. Where exactly it finds itself in the market is a bit of a question mark currently, but we expect it to be positioned around the Rs 90,000-1 lakh ballpark (ex-showroom). The company will probably achieve this by offering simpler features compared with the iQube and either the same 2.2kWh battery pack or a slightly smaller one.  As of now, the name of the entry-level TVS e-scooter hasn’t come to light, but given the widespread popularity of the Jupiter brand, that could be a definite possibility. TVS is also working on bringing the Jupiter CNG scooter to market this year and if it does, the Jupiter will be the first two-wheeler brand to be available in petrol, CNG and electric versions.  There's also the outside possibility of this model being the electric version of the XL moped. TVS has filed patents for the names XL EV and E-XL and this could be the name that the electric moped could carry upon launch. Traditionally, the value proposition of the TVS moped has been strong and the XL 100 is the most affordable ICE two-wheeler one can buy in India today. It remains to be seen whether the upcoming TVS EV slots into the Jupiter, XL or iQube lineups or creates an altogether new brand.

    "description": "The Kia Carens range has received a major rejig following the debut of the Carens Clavis earlier this week. Every Carens variant barring the Premium(O) trim has been discontinued, which also brings significant changes to the MPV’s powertrain offerings. Kia Carens is now available in only one variant at Rs 11.41 lakh Carens does not get sunroof, Level 2 ADAS, 6-seat layout, ventilated seats, etc anymore Automatic gearbox options axed from Carens range as well Kia Carens variants discontinued Carens range now starts from Rs 11.41 lakh The Carens can only be had in the one-above-base Premium(O) trim going forward. Prior to this overhaul, the Carens was available in nine variants: Premium, Premium (O), Gravity, Prestige, Prestige (O), Prestige Plus, Prestige Plus (O), Luxury Plus, and X-Line. Kia has now pulled eight of these trims from sale, leaving only the one-above-base Carens Premium(O) variant available for purchase, which starts at Rs 11.41 lakh (ex-showroom). The Premium(O) trim misses out on features like ventilated seats, automatic climate control, alloy wheels, Level 2 ADAS, leatherette upholstery, ambient lighting, push button start/stop, cruise control, a sunroof, and a 6-seat layout, which are now absent from the wider Carens range. Automatic gearbox options discontinued entirely Additionally, while the Carens Premium(O) variant can be had with all three engine options - a 115hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine, a 116hp, 1.5-litre turbo-diesel unit, and a 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol motor - it does not offer the choice of an automatic gearbox. The petrol and diesel engines can only be configured with a 6-speed manual, while the turbo-petrol unit comes with a 6-speed iMT, which means that the 7-speed dual-clutch and 6-speed torque converter automatic transmissions are no longer available for the Carens.
