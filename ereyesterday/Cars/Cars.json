    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "UK-based photographer Del Hickey has a talent for uncovering unique machines, built by highly skilled individuals that would otherwise fly under the radar. This time, he’s dug up a real zinger—a modified Ariel Leader from a small village in Gloucestershire, England. It’s the work of Ivan Counsell—a retired engineer and designer with little internet presence beyond his personal Facebook profile. Asked what he’s up to these days, he simply replies that he spends his time “making things different.” And this custom Ariel Leader sure is different. The project was born when Ivan acquired the donor bike from a friend of his at a price that was too good to refuse. “It was in totally standard form and covered in dust,” he tells us.…",

    "description": "I flew to L.A. this past spring to talk about a new project between actor Orlando Bloom, Deus Ex Machina’s Michael “Woolie” Woolaway, and BMW Motorrad. I’m not much for Hollywood, but I was wide-eyed about their idea. They’d take an already naked S 1000 R (a bike I’ve spent a summer on and for which I have an affinity) and make it more naked: a high-performance inline-four turned cooler, lighter, and more nimble. Talks on the new project began when Deus founder Dare Jennings, Woolie, and Orlando met with BMW Motorrad designer Ola Stenegärd and the design crew at the Munich factory in Germany last year. While the rest of the world had caught fire to the stripped-down lines of the R nineT as a starting point, Woolie drew upon his racing background and desire to do something different with the race-inspired S 1000 R.…",

    "description": "The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has levied a hike in toll charges by 4-5 percent for commuters using national highways and expressways. These increased toll rates came into effect on April 1 as part of an annual review process based on wholesale price index (WPI) inflation. Toll tax for national highways and expressways hiked by 4-5 percent as of April 1 Approximately 855 toll plazas impacted nationwide Increased toll charge revenue to be allocated to highway development National highway toll tax increase in April 2025 explained Roughly 855 toll plazas affected around India Toll rates are adjusted every year by the NHAI under the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008. The latest toll charge hike impacts around 855 toll plazas nationwide, comprised of 675 public-funded ones and 180 operated by private contractors. Major routes impacted by the toll charge increase include the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-9, Eastern Peripheral Expressway, Delhi-Jaipur Highway, and several others. Curiously, this marks the second toll charge increase within a one-year time span, with the previous hike having been implemented in June 2024. Revenue from toll tax hikes to support highway infrastructure Officials have confirmed that the hike is in line with standard annual revisions and applies to each highway section in varying degrees. The NHAI has also assured that the additional revenue from the increased toll charges will go towards highway infrastructure maintenance and ongoing expansion projects.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/full-reveal-honda-prelude-sports-coupe-land-year",
    "description": "Exterior styling from concept (pictured) isn't set to change dramatically for production car Revived sports coupé will be launched in 2026 with new S+ Shift system and hybrid powertrain The new Honda Prelude hybrid sports coupé has now been shown in full, following the unveiling of its interior. It draws heavily on the Civic hatchback on which it's based, borrowing that car's 9.0in infotainment touchscreen, digital instrument display and climate control switchgear. However, several key changes reflect its sportier positioning. The steering wheel has a rally-style line stitched into the straightahead and there are bucket seats up front – more thickly bolstered for the driver than the passenger. There's also an S+ button on the centre console that activates the car's simulated gearbox – a key part of Honda's effort to ensure the Prelude offers driving thrills using the same 181bhp 2.0-litre e:HEV hybrid system as the Civic. The new system is claimed to \"simulate the sound and feel of quick automatic gearchanges\". Honda Europe's senior vice-president, Hans De Jaeger, said this will \"not only deliver exceptional efficiency but also the fun-to-drive performance for which this model is known\". The e:HEV system primarily uses an electric motor to propel the wheels, and while the petrol engine can drive the wheels directly at higher speeds, it serves largely as a generator to charge the battery. This removes the need for traditional gearing. The new S+ Shift system builds on the Linear Shift Control system applied to Honda's current e:HEV hybrid models. The firm said it will have the ability to maintain the \"optimal engine RPM for the particular driving conditions\" and fully utilise power generated by the engine as driving force, rather than to charge the motor. That in turn will improve the response time of the motor. With the S+ Shift activated, drivers can then shift gears using paddles, which will offer a \"sharp upshift feeling, providing feedback that resonates with all of the driver's senses\". Quick gearshifts will be enabled by the coordination between the engine and electric motor. The system will also work with Honda's Active Sound Control system to \"enhance engine sound quality\" by playing engine sound in sync with the engine's RPM through the speakers, which Honda claimed will \"stimulate all of the driver's senses\".  The S+ Shift name references the \"sports spirit\" of Honda models including the S600, S2000 and Type S. The system is likely to serve in a similar fashion to the one on the electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Last year, Prelude project leader Tomoyuki Yamagami told Autocar: \"When you're in charge of developing the Prelude, you understand everyone has a lot of expectations of a coupé.\" Honda has previously offered a traditional manual gearbox on the Civic and Insight hybrids, although it was connected to an earlier, more conventional hybrid powertrain.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ied-vision-rapida-unveiled-sleek-22-inspired-1990s-legends",
    "description": "Vision Rapida is around the same size as '90s icons such as the Mk4 Toyota Supra Turinese university students collaborate with Italdesign to create affordable sports car for Generation Z Italdesign and the Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) of Turin have revealed the Vision Rapida concept, a sports car conceived to appeal to Generation Z. A fastback measuring 4.51m long, 1.86m wide and 1.28m high, the concept car draws on the legendary Japanese sports cars of the 1990s held in high regard by the youth of today. Indeed, its dimensions make it a close match for the Mk4 Toyota Supra and R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R. According to IED, it was shaped to improve aerodynamic performance and remove “stylistic excesses” while also ensuring it was usable as a main car. For example, the fastback rear section was chosen to improve boot space. Inside, it adopts a 2+2 layout with a centre console and a fighter jet-style dashboard that wraps around the driver, as was en vogue during the 1990s. Unlike the cars from which it takes inspiration, however, it has a minimalist control set-up that appears to rely primarily on a large infotainment touchscreen, rather than physical switchgear. It also majors on sustainable materials, taking inspiration from streetwear and manga (Japanese graphic novels). IED added that the car has been designed to suit a number of different brands, with “a clear identity but no constraints”, as well as the ability to host internal-combustion, hybrid and battery-electric powertrains. “The students of IED's master course in transportation design wanted a car that reflected their values and dreams,” said Dario Lauriola, Italdesign exterior designer and IED tutor. \"With [the] Rapida, they wanted to respond to the lack of those small sports cars that offered young people fun and affordable driving experiences in the 1990s.”",
