    "description": "It has been a few months since you last read a Himalayan report, and I must take some of the blame. Between a prolonged period of illness and some intense travel, the bike hasn’t received the attention it should have. On top of this, it ended up being with RE for a couple of months when I sent it in to address some issues, and I didn’t push for it to be returned sooner. TFT is easy to read and legible even under harsh sunlight. The first of those issues was that the usually fiddly toggle switch for the display stopped working entirely and had to be replaced. I also wanted the company to permanently address the problem with the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released – something I’ve written about in the previous report. As I understand it, the second issue had something to do with rectifying various torque settings on bolts that connect the engine to the frame. The bike returned with working switchgear and the right-leaning problem almost entirely sorted out – it’s still marginally noticeable but no longer to a troubling extent. Switching modes on the Himalayan can be a task, given how often it’s denied. As soon as the Himalayan was back, I realised why I enjoyed it so much in the first place. Its big size, incredible suspension, and fantastic overall comfort are a class apart. But since this bike deserved some good running after such a long downtime, I gave it to Gavin for his ride down to IBW, and what you’ll read from hereon is his account. Our Himalayan is equipped with the optional touring seat, which was a boon on my nearly 1,200km ride to Goa and back. It was firm yet supportive and kept saddle soreness at bay for the majority of my journey. Thanks to its abundant mounting points, strapping a tail bag on is a piece of cake. A little more wind protection would have been nice, though. The carrier and grab rail make for perfect mounting points for all your luggage. My issues with the Himalayan are mostly nothing new. Despite being replaced, the switchgear is sometimes unresponsive. While this motor performs well, the high-speed vibrations can render your palms numb on long rides. The one quality issue is that the right mirror keeps coming loose, and its threads have now been damaged, meaning a new one will have to be purchased. Finally, the headlight offers adequate illumination, but most owners are better off getting auxiliary lights. The right mirror keeps coming loose, and the threading is now damaged.   Despite these shortcomings, the Himalayan is an excellent motorcycle with a handful of minor gripes. While I was fortunate not to have any punctures, the fear of one always looms over me. Thankfully, we will soon be getting a set of tubeless wheels installed. Before we end, our bike has developed the typical Himalayan loose steering cone set, and that’s something we’ll address in the next report.

    "title": "Polestar 2 to get direct successor later this decade",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/polestar-2-get-direct-successor-later-decade",
    "description": "It had previously been suggested the 7 SUV would replace the 2 liftback; that's no longer the case Recently announced Polestar 7 SUV won't replace popular model, new CEO of Swedish EV brand says The Polestar 2 will not be succeeded by the recently confirmed Polestar 7 SUV and instead get its own direct replacement towards the end of the decade. The news, confirmed by new CEO Michael Lohscheller to Autocar today, dispels previous suggestions that the new Range Rover Evoque-sized 7 would slot into the line-up in place of the popular liftback. Instead, Lohscheller – on his first official visit to London today – made it clear that Polestar was building and would maintain a five-tier model line-up for the future: the 2 (hatch), 3 (large SUV), 4 (large saloon), 5 (four-door performance coupé), 6 (ultra-low-volume sports car) and 7 (mid-sized SUV).   Lohscheller revealed that the 2's replacement would be the second model after the 7 (the marque’s first European model) to adopt the single platform that Polestar plans to use for every new model in future. Its identity is still to be officially revealed, as is the location of the marque’s first European plant, although Geely’s new plant in Slovakia looks a strong contender. Polestar won’t yet put a date on the new 7’s arrival, let alone on replacing the 2, which Lohscheller reckons has “years to go”. Lohscheller, who replaced Thomas Ingenlath last August, cites the 2 as his personal favourite model, because he believes it has a timeless quality that embodies Polestar’s core design values and has done so much to establish the company (170,000 sold, 35,000 in the UK) since it was launched in 2020. He claims last year’s changes to the 2 improved it so much that other manufacturers would have called it a new model.  Lohscheller is promising Polestar’s backers a sales volume improvement of 30% to 35% a year over the next three years. “This is an ambitious target” he said, “but we are not dreaming. We now have three good cars in our showrooms and orders for the first quarter are up 37%. Even better, 55% of those orders are for our two newest cars, Polestar 3 and 4.”   The biggest sales driver, he believes, will be Polestar’s adoption of a network of retailers well versed in selling cars, demonstrating and financing them, explaining their sometimes unfamiliar equipment. Polestar’s number of UK sales outlets will grow from nine to 17 over the next 18 months and cars will be sold from dedicated spaces in Volvo dealerships.   Lohscheller believes there will be very little sales cannibalisation; he is surprised and impressed by buyers’ clear perception of Polestar as a distinct brand. The company will “transition away” from its former network of 'Spaces' in large shopping centres.   Commenting on the UK government’s mandate for the sale of EVs, Lohscheller said Polestar strongly supports recent SMMT proposals to stimulate private sales: a halving of VAT to 10% for three years, an increase in the punitive ECS (expensive car supplement) threshold to £60,000 and a reduction from 20% to 5% on energy delivered through a public charger.   However, he doesn't seek a change to the UK's 2030 cut-off date for the end of sales of pure -ICE cars - and would prefer to see plug-in hybrid sales end then too, rather than in 2035. “The politicians should hold the course they have set,” said Lohscheller. “It is the correct course if they are really serious about net-zero. If they are not, they should tell us.”  The UK is Polestar’s biggest market, believes Loscheller, partly because it is more agile and adaptable to change than others in Europe. “You can get close the customers here,” he said, “and if you need to change the way things are done, you can do it quickly.” The changes seem to be bearing fruit: in the fourth quarter of last year, UK Polestar orders doubled.   Another UK advantage, Lohscheller believes, is the presence of Polestar's Coventry R\u0026D centre, where the advanced, high-performance 5 is undergoing final development prior to a launch later this year. “I tell Coventry people that I hope they’re really proud of this car,” he said, “with its advanced bonded-aluminium technology, its 900bhp and it’s 800V technology. It’s a halo car, and will probably be the most expensive model we offer. But it will be one of the most advanced cars in the world.”   Lohscheller also revealed that Polestar’s future design direction will take a modest change of course, following the arrival of its new, ex-Audi design boss, Philipp Römers.  “What we’ve achieved so far is really good,” he said, “but I’m asking Philipp to highlight the performance of our cars a little more. I don’t believe they look quite as capable as they actually are. They should look a little more confident; they are maybe bit too modest. But I don’t expect radical changes, and how the designers actually achieve these subtle changes will be up to them.”   Opinion: Polestar boss finds freedom Michael Lohscheller was very much a 'suit' in his previous big car-company jobs. At Opel, for example, he was constrained by the company’s many difficulties: a long string of loss making years, an odd relationship with Vauxhall (which contributed less and less to the physical cars) and the constant need to please a bunch of big bosses who saw very little but the red ink.   As a result, his management style was competent but conservative and his utterances in interviews were short and careful. Which made the amusing, wise-cracking person I’ve just encountered in a Polestar guise seem like a different person.   The new-edition Lohscheller seems to have an impressive freedom to operate. He also seems to love Polestar not only for the way its cars drive (although he can talk enthusiastically about EV performance) but also for the importance of the company’s objective of offering genuinely zero-carbon transport and leading the automotive world in sustainability.   He’s a natural great-outdoors man (lean and athletic, because his lifelong hobby is running), and when we met in London, he had just put away a good few miles along the Thames Path. He knows London well, having studied and worked here in the past, and enjoys coming back.   Talking about the Polestar job, Lohscheller readily acknowledges its great appeal. “I have a fantastic team,” he said. “The cars are very, very good, and I’m convinced people want them and need them. \"In the past, I’ve worked in places with systems that were in place for many years and weren’t going to change. Here, everything we do helps to shape something very important. I’m super optimistic.”",

    "description": "New entry-level Pure model is £7000 cheaper than the Pure+ that it replaces; offers one mile less range Chinese brand revises hatchback’s line-up, gaining lower prices and a GT range-topper The GWM Ora 03 has been revised with new trim levels that bring significantly lower prices and sporty new GT range-topper. The new Pure variant replaces the Pure+ and is £7000 cheaper, at £24,995. It packs the same 48kWh battery as the Pure+, giving it a 192-mile range, and much of the same kit inside. This includes a 10.25in infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 360deg camera and a facial recognition system. Compared with the Pure+, it swaps leatherette seats for cloth items, loses the rear seat armrest and the memory auto-folding side mirrors. Sitting above the Pure is the Pro, which replaces the Pro+. This is priced £6000 cheaper, at £28,995, and gets a 63kWh battery, boosting range to 261 miles. It also gets heated front seats, front parking sensors and an automatic parking system. However, it loses the panoramic roof and massaging-and-ventilated front seats from the Pro+. Sitting at the top of the new Ora 03 line-up is the GT, which gains more aggressive styling inside and out, a launch-control system and an efficiency-boosting heat pump. It’s priced from £32,995. The revision of the Ora 03 range effectively brings major discounts for the Chinese electric supermini. It’s likely that the decision was made in order to help it compete with new arrivals from Europe such as the Renault 5 (£22,995) and Citroën ë-C3 (£21,990).",

    "description": "Few cars boast brand equity as strong as the Hyundai Creta. This formidable midsize SUV has long dominated its segment, thanks to its well-rounded packaging, feature-rich appeal and diverse powertrain options. Now, Hyundai has taken the winning Creta formula and electrified it, giving rise to the Creta Electric. The big question is if this battery-powered version can replicate the success of its internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart. The Creta Electric is built on the ICE platform, but it has undergone significant reworking to accommodate its electric powertrain. The cabin floor sits slightly higher to make room for the battery pack, the suspension has been stiffened to handle the additional weight, and the front wheels are powered by an electric motor. Despite these changes, the Creta Electric retains the dimensions of its ICE sibling, including an impressive 200mm (unladen) ground clearance. An \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the bumper set this version apart from its ICE counterpart.   Hyundai Creta Electric exterior In terms of design, the Creta Electric takes inspiration from the Creta N Line, particularly at the front. The enclosed grille, featuring a pixelated theme reminiscent of the Ioniq 5, incorporates a centrally placed charging port. This pixelated motif extends to the closed front air dam, which includes active flaps to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The 17-inch aero-style alloy wheels further emphasise its EV identity, and they come wrapped in lowrolling resistance, EV-specific tyres. Adding to its aesthetic appeal are silver highlights on the lower edges of the black plastic cladding, creating a striking contrast. Our dual-tone test unit featured black pillars, a black roof, and a black rear spoiler for added flair. Unique identifiers, such as an \"electric\" badge on the bootlid and pixelated accents on the rear bumper, set this version apart from its ICE counterpart. The sight of its battery pack beneath its body looks a bit ungainly, especially when viewed from the sides. Flaps on the front air dam automatically open and close to improve aerodynamic efficiency.   Hyundai Creta Electric interior Step into the Creta Electric’s cabin, and you’ll immediately notice its resemblance to the ICE version. However, several EV-specific upgrades make it distinct. A notable addition is the all-new three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss, adorned with four dots symbolising the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. Interestingly, the steering buttons have been rearranged – the infotainment and phone controls are now on the right, while ADAS functions are on the left. New three-spoke steering wheel with a circular horn boss; four dots symbolise the letter ‘H’ in Morse code. The familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster now features an additional cube-like theme, akin to the Ioniq 5. The air conditioning console – borrowed from the updated Alcazar – combines infotainment shortcuts with touch-sensitive keys, although practical physical toggles for temperature and a volume knob remain. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, reminiscent of the Ioniq 5. This design frees up the centre console, which now adopts a floating style. It houses a drive mode button, an electric parking brake, an auto-hold button, ventilated front seat controls, and dual cupholders. Impressively, there’s a lower deck area beneath it which houses a fair bit of storage space. Even the armrest console is huge, and like the glovebox, it features a cooling vent to keep beverages cool. Lower deck area beneath the centre console houses a fair bit of storage space. In line with Hyundai’s sustainable focus, the seats are upholstered in eco-friendly materials derived from corn extracts and recycled plastic bottles. Surprisingly, the texture is smooth and closely resembles the leatherette used in the ICE model. The slightly higher floor impacts the driving position, which feels elevated even at its lowest setting. While rear seat space remains unchanged and is comfortable, the seating postureis slightly knees-up. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom. Utility trays on the front seatbacks include grooves for mobile devices and integrated pop-open cupholders for added convenience. You're seated in a slightly knees-up position, although it isn't uncomfortable. Additionally, the Creta Electric features a V2L (Vehicle-to-Load) system with a 3-pin power socket, enabling users to power devices like laptops or small appliances. Storage capacity remains practical with the unchanged 433-litre boot, complete with a spare tire under the boot floor. A 22-litre frunk provides extra loading space beneath the bonnet. 433-litre boot remains just as practical as the ICE version; gets a spare tyre beneath the floor, too.   Hyundai Creta Electric features Besides carrying forward the ICE version’s feature-set, the Electric gets some new equipment too, like rain-sensing wipers, electric front seats with driver’s seat memory, a cooling central console, boss seat function as well as front seatback-mounted utility trays. It carries forward the Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suite, which, like in the standard Creta, adds a safety net without feeling too intrusive in its function. Familiar 10.25-inch instrument cluster gets new cube-like display theme. Hyundai has invested heavily in developing an in-car payments option, which, with a mere touch, facilitates a wallet-based payment for vehicle charging, as well as future subscription-based features. In addition, the company has developed a first-of-its-kind mobile application through which users can not only identify and navigate to over 10,000 EV chargers across different brands but also make payments via the app to certain service providers. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and registering on multiple brand-specific applications. We’re still sore that like the standard Creta, it misses out on things like wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, adjustable front armrest, a headrest for the middle rear passenger, and the volume of its 8-speaker Bose setup is much lower at the rear than in the front. Also, compared to the large screens of its competitors, the Creta Electric’s 10.25-inch touchscreen comes across as a bit small. A new boss-function allows rear passengers to electronically slide the front passenger seat forward, enhancing legroom.   Hyundai Creta Electric performance The Creta Electric is offered with two battery options: a 42kWh pack and a 51.4kWh Long Range pack. Both utilise Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry, similar to the Ioniq 5. This type of battery is more compact and energy-dense than Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP) batteries, although LFP batteries are known for their longer lifespan. For added peace of mind, Hyundai offers an 8-year/1,60,000km warranty on the battery, alongside the standard 3-year warranty on the car. The sight of its battery pack from the side looks a bit ungainly. Powering the Creta Electric is a single motor on the front axle that drives the front wheels. In the Long Range variant, this motor produces 171hp and 255Nm. Interestingly, its torque matches the diesel variant's 250Nm and is close to the turbo-petrol's 260Nm. However, being an EV, the power delivery is strong yet exceptionally linear. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, even in its most efficient ‘Eco’ mode. The three drive modes – Eco, Normal and Sports – deliver noticeably different responses to part-throttle inputs, while flooring the accelerator unleashes the motor’s full potential. A synthesised bassy hum under hard acceleration adds a touch of drama to the otherwise silent drive. In our tests, the Creta Electric managed a 0-100kph time of 8.2 seconds, slightly behind the claimed 7.9 seconds. Flat out, it can achieve a top speed of 180kph. Acceleration feels brisk and effortless, but real-world range of over 400km impresses. The Creta gets a total of five regenerative braking options, with Level 1, 2 and 3 adjusting deceleration and bringing the car to a crawl.While these modes are mild, Levels 4 and 5 are strong. Drivers can also disable regenerative braking entirely for a free-rolling experience or opt for the ‘i-Pedal’ mode, which allows one-pedal driving by bringing the car to a complete stop without using the brake pedal. Each mode feels distinct and natural, making them intuitive to use. Adaptive cruise control integrates seamlessly with the regen system, adjusting braking automatically based on the situation, though drivers can override this using steering-mounted paddle shifters. Hyundai Creta Electric range and charging The 42kWh battery variant has an ARAI-certified range of 390km, while the 51.4kWh Long Range version offers 473km. In a mixed driving cycle of city and highway conditions, our preliminary test of the Long Range variant returned an impressive real-world range of approximately 426km. For reference, our 289.6km drive at an average speed of 41kph toggling through different drive and regenerative braking settings, utilised 68 percent of the charge. Charging port behind the enclosed front grille gets an LED indicator. Hyundai claims the battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in just 58 minutes using a 50kW DC fast charger. With a 11kW AC charger, the larger battery charges fully (10 to 100 percent) in 4 hours and 50 minutes, while the smaller battery completes this in 4 hours. Hyundai Creta Electric ride and handling To support the additional weight of the battery and motor, the Creta Electric’s suspension is stiffer than the ICE version’s. Remarkably, it doesn’t translate into a crashy or uncomfortable ride experience. Yes, you can feel its firmness at low speeds, and you’ll also hear its suspension ‘thwack’ over sharp bumps (particularly due to an otherwise silent cabin), but road shocks are still well in check. What’s nice is that the stiffness has eliminated unnecessary (secondary) body movements, and even at highway speeds, the Creta Electric doesn’t lose its poise. The steering, too, is noticeably heavier than the ICE version’s, and as a result, it warrants more effort at slow and parking speeds. But at no point does it feel excessive or cumbersome. And while it hasn’t resulted in more feel or feedback per se, the added weight only adds to the driver’s confidence, especially at high speeds or around a series of bends. Also nice is that the Creta Electric changes directions well, and with its weight being concentrated lower down, body roll seems to be far better controlled than the petrol-version. Notably, the Electric’s braking is so good, the transition from regenerative to frictional brakes feels extremely smooth and superbly calibrated, thus lending to a very natural brake pedal feel. Hyundai Creta Electric verdict The Creta Electric has its flaws – the ride is stiffer than the ICE version’s; the steering is a bit weighty; and finally, its floor is a bit raised, which results in a slightly knees-up position. But none of these are a dealbreaker. A standout addition is the steering column-mounted drive selector, akin to the Ioniq 5. The Electric version still retains the ICE’s brilliant packaging like its spacious cabin, ample practicality, and a decently sized boot – it gets a frontal loading area (frunk), too. Performance is smooth, linear and reasonably quick. But what’s even more impressive is its real-world range of over 400km, with reasonable charging times. And even though its suspension is firmer than the ICE Creta’s, it gets a newfound confidence in the ride and handling department. Typical to the Creta’s proposition, this electric iteration is feature-rich, too. At a price ranging between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 23.50 lakh, the Creta Electric comes across as a fantastic EV. Will it replicate the ICE's success? If first impressions are anything to go by, the Creta Electric seems to have what it takes to dominate the EV space.

    "description": "Harley-Davidson may have dropped the Evo Sportster from its range, but that doesn’t mean it’s going away any time soon. The ‘old’ Sporty remains one of the most versatile platforms that the Motor Co. has ever built—as evidenced by the myriad ways in which it’s been customized over the years. This custom Sportster from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom proves our point stylishly. It started life as a 2013-model Harley Sportster Seventy-Two—a mild take on classic Frisco-style choppers that came from the factory with a peanut tank and mini-ape bars. But 2LOUD’s Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng has skillfully transformed it into a laid-back street tracker. The commission came from a client who had inherited the Sportster after his father passed away. As a professional car customizer, he wanted the Seventy-Two transformed into a custom machine that he could hold onto forever.…",

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz India has launched the new Maybach GLS 600 Night Series at a starting price of Rs 3.71 crore. Positioned at the top of the Maybach GLS range, the new variant adds purely cosmetic upgrades for around Rs 25 lakh over the current model. Mercedes also launched a Night Series variant of the Maybach EQS 680 SUV at the Auto Expo 2025. The Maybach GLS 600 Night Series gets bespoke dual-tone paint and all-black flourishes The equipment list remains the same as the Maybach GLS 600 top-spec variant The Maybach GLS Night Series features no mechanical changes Maybach GLS 600 Night Series exterior The Maybach GLS 600 Night Series sports the hallmark dual-tone paint scheme of Maybach cars, with a Mojave Silver finish on the upper portion of the SUV and Onyx Black on the lower portion. Much of the exterior fitments are blacked-out to fit the theme, and the front grille panel and headlights feature rose gold inserts. Additionally, the SUV gets all-black Maybach-spec 22-inch wheels that look virtually identical to the ones found on the Maybach EQS 680 SUV Night Series. Maybach GLS 600 Night Series interior The interior of the Maybach GLS 600 Night Series carries forward the blacked-out exterior theme. The seats are wrapped in bespoke Nappa leather with wood and aluminium accents, and the all-digital instrument cluster also gets an exclusive Night Series animation. The SUV’s equipment list and overall cabin layout are otherwise retained from the Maybach GLS 600 top-spec variant, with features like a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment unit, 27-speaker sound system, 64-colour ambient lighting, and more. Maybach GLS 600 Night Series powertrain The Maybach GLS 600 Night Series sees no mechanical changes and is, therefore, equipped with the same 550hp, 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine, which does duty in the standard Maybach GLS 600. The motor is assisted by a 48V mild-hybrid setup, which provides a 250Nm boost for a total output of 770Nm of torque. Coupled with a 9-speed automatic transmission sending power to all four wheels, the SUV can despatch the 0-100kph run in 4.9 seconds.

    "description": "The recently launched Creta Electric is the first Hyundai model to feature a locally assembled battery pack. The Creta Electric is available in two battery capacities: 42kWh and 51.4kWh. Hyundai and Mobis India Limited are assembling the batteries inside a new facility at the automaker’s Chennai plant.  Hyundai Motor India has attained 92 percent localisation in manufacturing The automaker plans to localise drivetrain and electronics, too The plant can assemble a diverse range of battery packs, including NMC (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide) and LFP (Lithium-Iron-Phosphate) batteries and has an annual capacity of 75,000 units in phase 1. Localisation so far Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s whole-time director and chief manufacturing officer Gopalakrishnan Chathapuram Sivaramakrishnan (left) with managing director Unsoo Kim. Hyundai says the level of localisation in manufacturing is 92 percent. Key components like alloy wheels, disc brakes, catalytic converter, clutch assembly, alternator, shark fin antenna and reverse parking sensors have also been localised. Other parts include panoramic sunroof, TPMS, oil cooler and NOX sensors. Hyundai did so by sourcing 1,238 parts from over 194 vendors. Hyundai Creta Electric battery specs, charging, range The ARAI claimed range is 390km with the smaller 42kWh unit and 473km with the 51.4kWh battery pack; the motor output is 136hp and 171hp, respectively. With a 50kW DC fast charger, the 10-80 percent charge comes in 58 minutes (for both cells), and with an 11kW unit, it takes 4 hours for the smaller battery and 4.5 hours for the larger one. For a detailed review of the Hyundai Creta Electric, click here. Hyundai EV market share expectations, pricing strategy “For production volumes, we have developed an interchangeable production system, which lets us adapt to the market demand extremely fast. The Creta has always done well for us. Since Hyundai’s share in the overall ICE segment is 14-15 percent, we are targeting a similar market share with our EVs,” said Hyundai Motor India chief operating officer Tarun Garg. By 2030, the EV market’s cumulative 2.5 percent share can reach 17 percent, and the Creta may play a big role in that, he added. The Creta Electric’s introductory prices start at Rs 17.99 lakh, ex-showroom. Garg explained that the model benefits from Hyundai’s access to technology and volumes. “Plus, the battery localisation that we have been able to do also helps. We are looking to localise the drivetrain, electronics and battery manufacturing,” he noted.  Also, see: Hyundai India MD: Underestimated EV market, but not worried about catching up Hyundai Creta Electric to be followed by 3 made-in-India EVs",

    "description": "But I don’t say that with any negativity. Curating an event like this involves much more than meets the eye. Tokyo car culture is undeniably one of the best in the world, yet ironically, showing it off in its purest form is now near impossible. Gone are the days of central city car parks filled […] The post 200 Cars, 2,500 Spectators: The 2025 Underground Tokyo Meet appeared first on Speedhunters.",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one.

    "description": "In a world where the Porsche 911 reigns supreme, Patrick took a different path. His 968 isn’t just a car—it’s a statement of balance, practicality, and love for the transaxle Porsche community. As a collector and enthusiast, Patrick shows us that there’s more to Porsche than the 911. Continue...",
