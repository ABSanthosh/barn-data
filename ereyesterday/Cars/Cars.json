    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "title": "Triumph Speed T4 road test, review",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "Beating a Porsche on the legendary Nürburgring is no mean feat, especially when the Porsche in question is the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupé. But the 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance did just that. A full-size SUV with 640hp and enough tech for an Engineering Explained video, the RS Q8 Performance might look like a standard Q8 with some blacked-out bits, but that’s the kind of thought that will have you gasping at its performance. We had it for a whole day on a race track and in the Spanish countryside to see what all is new and how much of a difference it has made. 2024 Audi RS Q8 exterior design  On the face of it, the RS Q8 Performance continues with stern expressions and almost no emotion. There is no smiling grille or angry air vents; it’s sleek, sharp and means business. What’s new over the older version are the LED Matrix headlamps with multiple daytime running lights (DRLs) options and a re-profiled grille finished in gloss black with a 3D honeycomb pattern. Wrapped around the grille is a massive carbon-fibre frame, and there’s more carbon fibre on the front lip and air vents. LED Matrix headlamps are standard. The bumpers are sportier and more aggressive than before, and what’s really nice to see is that there isn’t an ounce of chrome to be seen anywhere on the car. Over to the side, the optional 23-inch wheels look stunning (22-inch come as standard), and these help shave 20kg off the total SUV’s weight. Hidden behind these large rims are massive 420mm carbon-ceramic brake discs (standard on the Performance version) with red brake calipers. Carbon fibre on the outside rearview mirrors finishes off the changes at the side. OLED tail-lamps get customisable DRL designs. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance gets OLED tail-lamps conjoined by an LED light bar, some more honeycomb pattern on the bumper, and a gloss-black diffuser with carbon-fibre surrounds for the oval exhaust tips. Dramatic is not something you’d call the RS Q8 Performance, despite its many oversized bits and plenty of carbon-fibre trimmings (courtesy of the optional Carbon Pack). It’s the perfect look for the introverted car guy, especially in the subtle Satellite Silver paint shade. 2024 Audi RS Q8 interior and features  On the inside, the introversion is even more pronounced as there is little that will ‘wow’ you. As standard, the Performance version gets the Sport Seats Plus; these seats offer lots of bolstering and are also very comfy for long drives. And there is the same honeycomb pattern with Race-Tex and all-black upholstery. But barring all that, it’s all very simple – very high-quality, but nothing that will make it look fast while stationary. Even the steering, which was a chunky flat-bottom one on the previous car, is now a simple round unit. The racy one has been tucked away in the options list. However, you can choose between red, blue or grey for the upholstery contrast stitching. For anything more, like maybe a panoramic sunroof, you’d have to start ticking the options list. Its interior oozes quality but lacks the drama you’d expect from a 640hp super SUV. The centre console features the all-too-familiar dual-screen layout, and apart from the RS modes and drive settings, it’s all very simple and straightforward. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance has enough space for three adults, and there’s four-zone climate control with electric sun blinds for added comfort. But would you want to be chauffeured in a 640hp super SUV? I think not. 2024 Audi RS Q8 performance  Performance is literally this RS Q8’s name, and it is truly mind-boggling. Sure, it has beaten the Cayenne around the Nürburgring, but what does that mean? Is it fun? Or is it a weapon to be wielded only in the hands of a professional test driver? To find out, we did a few laps around the Parcmotor Castelloli in Spain, and a few laps is all it took to showcase why and how this is the fastest SUV around the Nürburgring. Powering the RS Q8 Performance is a 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, as before, but it now makes 40hp more, bringing it to 640, while max torque is 850Nm. The 0-100kph sprint takes an astounding 3.6 seconds, and the SUV can haul all the way to the good side of 305kph. The increase in power is the result of the catalytic converter’s repositioning, which, in turn, has reduced exhaust back pressure. The turbo boost pressures are also higher now, and the end result is an engine with virtually no lag. To add to this instant boost is a 48V mild-hybrid system that lends a hand during acceleration, which means no matter how tight the corner, you can exit it with all the brute force available. The real star is the nimble chassis. The 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox is rapid, too, but select Dynamic Plus or any of the RS modes, and it shifts with lightning-fast speeds. The paddle shifters are also quite responsive, and in manual mode, you can have total control of the shifts. On straightways, the acceleration is a blur, and given the SUV’s driving position, it’s hard to believe that you can be seated this high up and travel this fast. The sense of speed is immense, and the engine sounds terrific at full pitch. Audi has a reputation for making silent cars, but in this, it actually removed some of the sound insulation so you can hear even more of the engine noise on the inside! After all those e-trons, this sure comes as a welcome change. Out on the public roads, however, the engine changes character in a flash. Swap from the Dynamic or RS mode to Comfort mode, and it puts the leash and muzzle on the engine instantly. You can amble through town without being noticed and in comfort. The engine has a soft burble, which only amplifies post 4,000rpm and, of course, through tunnels. The ease of driving it as a daily driver takes you by surprise, especially if you’ve been hooning it around a racetrack an hour ago. 2024 Audi RS Q8 ride and handling  Speaking of hooning around a racetrack, pin-point handling is not something you expect from an SUV the size of the RS Q8 Performance. Yet, thanks to all the wizardry under the skin, it corners like it has an identity crisis. It refuses to acknowledge it is an SUV; instead, it identifies as a hot hatch. Many things are at play here – active roll stabilisation, all-wheel steering, Adaptive Air Suspension Sport and the new Quattro Sport differential – words you’d find in engineering textbooks but with the effect you’d find in comic books. The RS Q8 Performance holds the lap record on the Nürburgring for the fastest production SUV. The RS Q8 Performance corners with absolutely no body roll or understeer, and despite the power and torque available on tap, it always has the grip to save you. A lap record definitely needs precision, which the RS Q8 has, but even for mortals with not even a fraction of the pro talent, it is very hard to look bad on the track. The power split is 40-60 as standard, but in case of slippage, it can send up to 70 percent power up ahead and 85 percent to the rear wheels. Then, there is the electromechanical active stabilisation, which is basically a motor between two halves of the anti-roll bar. On long, straight highways, the two halves are disconnected, which reduces pitching and vertical movements, but as soon as you get to the corners, they link up and twist the bar in the opposite direction to the turn, thereby reducing roll and keeping the car as level as possible. It sounds complicated, but when you notice the steering is on full lock and you haven’t keeled over in your seat, it makes sense. Ride comfort with large 23-inch wheels is surprisingly good. Ride comfort is also surprisingly good, given the weight and, more importantly, the large 23-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The adaptive air suspension is compliant in Comfort mode and tries its best on broken patches, but for Indian conditions, the 22-inch ones will undoubtedly be more comfortable. 2024 Audi RS Q8 verdict and India launch details  Audi has not confirmed the RS Q8 Performance for India as of now, but given the strong response to the older version, it is likely to make it back to home soil in 2025. Prices would be slightly higher than the outgoing version, but you can expect it to be extremely competitive against its arch-rivals, the Lamborghini Urus S and Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. As a performance SUV, the RS Q8 ticks all the boxes. It is large, mighty fast and loud enough to shake up the mountains, and best of all, incredible to handle, too. It does not have the flash of a supercar or super SUV, but not everyone wants that kind of attention all the time. For those who love the concept of a ‘sleeper’ or discreet performance, this is what you should get your hands on – enough space and comfort to drop the kids off to school or do an airport run and enough power to never be late.

    "description": "From “The Perfect SUV” to “Undisputed. Ultimate.” The Creta’s positioning statements might seem pompous, but based on its stellar sales performance, Hyundai has every right to boast. Competitors have come and gone, yet the Creta continues to stand tall with demand growing from strength to strength. A lot has been documented in our reviews and comparisons on the good and not-so-good bits of the Creta 1.5 Petrol IVT. So, in this long-term report, I’ll keep the focus on my Mumbai-Goa-Mumbai drive experience, a round trip of about 1,200km. I started my journey at the break of dawn, and the fastest route suggested by the Creta’s on-board maps was NH66, commonly known as the “old Mumbai-Goa highway”. I had forgotten to carry my phone charger, and because the Creta lacked wireless smartphone integration, I had to rely on its in-built navigation throughout. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with its accuracy and the detailed guidance it provided. I particularly appreciated it when it clearly suggested whether I had to climb onto a flyover or go from below. How did I manage to charge my phone? Well, its wireless charger had me covered.  On-board maps are surprisingly accurate and even get detailed guidance. With light traffic and some newly laid roads, I managed to keep the average speed high. However, the default ‘City’ mode felt a bit inadequate, especially on the winding uphill sections. Sport mode added more pep, with a sharper throttle response and the IVT gearbox keeping the engine spinning in a higher rev band. I must add that the engine doesn’t enjoy being driven hard, as it feels out of its comfort zone and sounds strained, though it does the job asked of it. What I didn’t like was that in Sport, even the steering weight increases, which didn’t add any more feel but only added to the effort required. Also, keeping the transmission in ‘S’ mode wasn’t ideal, as it spun the engine closer to its redline, thus making it sound very boomy. Hence, my ideal setting on a highway drive is to keep the gearbox in ‘D’ and drive mode in ‘Sport’, heavy steering notwithstanding. The SUV’s high-speed stability is good, and handling is predictable, but it rolls a fair bit; hence, sporty it isn’t. And over wavy surfaces, you can experience vertical movements more than in its Volkswagen or Skoda rivals. While the ride quality is generally good at low speeds, it hits sharp potholes in a rather jarring manner. Sharp potholes come through in a rather jarring manner. What’s the fuel efficiency it achieved? With empty roads, Sport mode and an enthusiastic style of driving, the Creta returned a little over 9kpl. On the positive side, I reached Goa in just 9.5 hours, which included an hour’s worth of stops to refuel the car and myself. However, for my return, I left closer to noon – a bad, bad decision. The journey on the NH66 felt starkly different in terms of traffic, and all the diversions I had sailed past on my way to Goa were suddenly clogged and seemed never-ending. As a result, average speeds were much lower. Over the course of this journey, I got a chance to experience some other bits in more detail. For example, the Bose sound system is good, but I think Mahindra’s Sony, MG’s Infinity and Tata’s Harman speakers are noticeably better. Also, its rear speakers are noticeably softer, so the audio experience at the back is quite poor. A sliding armrest is missing in an otherwise well-equipped car. The Creta’s lane assist works in an unobtrusive manner, giving you gentle feedback to stick to the centre of clearly marked lanes. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) works the smoothest when the distance between your vehicle and the one in front is set to maximum. However, once the vehicle ahead slows down and picks up speed, the Creta accelerates automatically to its preset speed very slowly. The auto high beam assist worked like a charm, dipping the high beam upon detecting vehicles ahead. I wish the throw of its LED headlamps (in low beam) was better. Finally, for a car that’s ergonomically spot on, the non-adjustable armrest felt like a glaring oversight on Hyundai’s part. I would have preferred a sliding unit. The journey to Mumbai was nearly 2.5 hours slower, but with a mix of City and Sport drive modes and much lower average speeds (52kph), the Creta’s fuel efficiency was around 12.5kpl.  Powered, ventilated driver’s seat is comfy for long drives. My highway drive reiterates that the Creta petrol IVT isn’t an enthusiast’s choice but is perfect for a majority of buyers who value its refinement, relaxed nature, interior comfort, and the sheer amount of features it packs in. This is reflected in its sales, too. The share of petrol variants in the Creta’s sales is around 60 percent, of which merely 10-15 percentare turbo-petrol (including N Line). And quite honestly, for its sheer well-roundedness, the petrol IVT is the one I’d recommend. Is it “The Perfect SUV”? Well, not quite, but it certainly comes very close.

Given that it’s 54 years old and 250 cc, expecting it to do much more than maintain 55 mph is asking a lot, and it did that without complaint. Ultimately, my experience of the bike is more reverence than critique. What it lacks in power and all-around performance, it makes up for with character and charm, which shone through in unexpected ways. Over time, I began to actually appreciate its overtaxed 18 hp single.…",

    "description": "We tested more than 20 cars over long periods - and now it's time to hand out some awards... Over the past twelve months, the Autocar team has spent considerable time in over 20 different cars. Our long-term test fleet included cruisers, flagship sports cars, and load luggers, which ran from the depths of winter to the blaming sun of summer.  But which served most capably, and which cars were we sad to see go? In our annual long-term test awards, we've listed the best of the best. Winner: Maserati MC20 Maserati threw a party and we were all invited - but only a few of us managed to get in the door. The MC20 was never in our car park for more than 10 minutes before someone came up with a ‘legitimate reason’ for needing it that evening. “I’ve got urgent business on the other side of the Brecon Beacons,” they would say, or “I left my wallet at the end of the Stelvio Pass.” Nonetheless, some unlucky hangers-on were left out in the cold. Rachel Burgess would have put the Italian supercar through its paces but for the lack of Isofix mounts: “The legal implications of my three-year-old sitting in his child seat attached with a seatbelt meant it was a no-go.” Jack Warrick had no such moral qualms, but the keys just always seemed to elude him: “Having a twin-turbo-V6-powered supercar in our fleet is a rare occurrence, a fact reflected in how it was always occupied when I wanted a go!” Matt Prior proved himself the world’s unluckiest man in missing not only the MC20 but also its closest rival, the McLaren Artura, which he reckons he still hasn’t driven at all, “although I couldn’t say for sure, worryingly”. Hopefully being the only one of us to have driven the Ferrari 12Cilindri is some consolation. While we all bickered like schoolkids for a go in a thoroughbred supercar, though, James Attwood was frustrated at not being able to do some actual work and find out whether the updated Polestar 2 was truly improved over its predecessor. “I drove the pre-facelift version so was keen to see how determined improvement made one of the best daily EVs better,” he sobbed as the rest of us fawned over photos of our time with two mid-engined, 200mph beasts. Pfft, teacher’s pet. ​ Winner: BMW M2, Volvo V90 Keeping a car for a few months gives us time to uncover hidden buttons, cubbies and attributes that aren't immediately obvious on a first drive. You know, the sorts of things a YouTuber would label \"the features you'll never BELIEVE made it to production\" with a few of those shocked-face emojis. Burgess, for example, was pleased to find a 'reduced alarm mode' function in the Volvo V90, which makes the cabin sensors less sensitive to movement and stops the car screaming its head off when on a ferry. We found a couple of secret strengths in the BMW M2, too: Jonathan Bryce said its drift mode \"is a quirk the car doesn't need and will quite likely never be used\" but nevertheless \"I'm glad that it's there\". And Attwood sheepishly nominated its optional eight-speed automatic gearbox, saying: \"It was just really good. Revoke my staff pass if you must.\" Prior wanted us to give a shoutout to the Land Rover Defender 130 for having \"a very nice way of turning off all the bongs\" - a highly coveted attribute in 2024 - and Will Rimell was agog at the Skoda Kamiq's frugality: \"That non-electrified 1.5-litre petrol can, incredibly, return 60mpg on long motorway hauls. It's a real money-saver.\" Cool trick, Rimell, but maybe don't bang on about it at parties. Winner: Volkswagen ID Buzz Could it have been anything else? If Volkswagen needed reassurance that it had done justice to the legacy of the legendary Type 2 bus, indisputably among the cheeriest and most bohemian vehicles ever created, the ID Buzz's victory here must surely suffice. \"We've long heard electric cars and skateboard architectures will make for more creative car designs, and the ID Buzz is the first car to really show what can be done, reasoned Mark Tisshaw. Charlie Martin agreed, even if \"you could accuse it of many flaws\", explaining: \"It's one of few cars we've run this year that comes from a place of joy, and we desperately need more happy stuff like it.\" And Jack Warrick was pleased to discover that \"its massive grin was matched by everyone who saw it driving past\". Despite my partner protesting at having \"an RAC van\" outside our house for a few months, I'm inclined to agree. With a real-world range north of 200 miles, genuine car-like driving manners and a properly cavernous interior, the ID Buzz convinced me that we can live with - and truly love - EVs. We must also credit the Abarth 500e, said Prior, because \"it's really badly flawed but at least it shows people are trying to make EVs enjoyable\", and the Cupra Born, a 2024 Autocar Award winner, which showed Illya Verpraet \"that a normal EV can be fun when it came out - and still does\". Winner: Volkswagen Touareg No nominations needed for this one, really: it’s all about which keys spent the least time in the locker at the end of the Autocar desk. And to the surprise of precisely nobody, it was the hulking diesel Volkswagen Touareg that was most often pressed into service to attend far-flung new car launches, visit family in distant, unheard-of locations like ‘Belgium’ and ‘Glasgow’ and haul rowdy, sprawling families around the UK’s motorway network. I asked Verpraet why this would be the best car to drive to Mongolia and he said: “Because I did it. Well, not to Mongolia exactly, but I did drive it over 2000 miles around Europe. I had my gripes with the VW, but it did it reliably, comfortably and reasonably economically.” Murray Scullion was similarly complimentary, although with the caveat that it’s at its best when “someone else is paying for fuel”. A surprise nomination for the Renault Clio E-Tech hybrid came from Bryce, who said its blend of big-car refinement and frugality “proves superminis are more than biscuit tins with headlights”. Kris Culmer was similarly floored by the touring potential of the Land Rover Defender 130, saying: “I still can’t get over how much this serious off-roader actually feels like a luxury saloon.” Clearly he didn’t take it into any multi-storeys. The Maserati MC20 received a shock nomination here, too, from Rimell, who noted that while the surprisingly comfy supercar only has a small fuel tank, “my bladder’s probably smaller still”... Winner: Alfa Romeo Giulia QV Objectivity be damned: it's almost always a sad occasion when a low-loader arrives to snatch away your wheels. A few months at the helm is long enough to build a real rapport with a car, and we've had to begrudgingly hand back the keys to some real corkers this year. Alfa Romeo's Giulia Quadrifoglio hasn't even left out fleet yet but, such is the impression it's made on the team, we're already dreading saying goodbye.  \"It feels like a car I could drive forever,\" said Matt Prior, before putting his headphones back on to continue listening to a recording of its rasping V6 on loop. For keeper Scullion, it's \"the fluency of the ride and the potency of its engine\" he'll miss most, although the fact \"it looks like the dog's wotsits\" doesn't make the prospect of parting with it any easier.  Attwood, meanwhile, lamented that 'his' Porsche electric estate was Taycan away by its maker (sorry) but acknowledged that \"it's probably for the best they did because, with every mile that I put on adding to its devaluation, I became more convinced I should buy it. even though I still absolutely could not afford it. Why did I get my bathroom done this year again?\"  Winner: Abarth 500e Smart clearly had designs on victory in this category with the name of its quirky electric crossover, and indeed Tisshaw found the #1 a hot topic of conversation: \"Specifically, what's that little fox thing doing dancing around in the corner of the touchscreen the whole time?\" But it was the Abarth 500e that really set the Neighbourhood Watch group chats ablaze, with its bilious paint and synthesised exhaust sounds. Over to Culmer: \"Literally everybody looked and pointed or commented about the lurid colour, and they all laughed when I turned on the fake engine noise.\" After a few days behind the wheel of the retro pocket rocket, Attwood concurred: \"It was very yellow, was brilliant in many ways and would then do something utterly daft.\" As its keeper, I can wholeheartedly vouch for all the above, to the extent that when an old classmate texted me to ask if I'd be up for a school reunion, I immediately opened our test car booking spreadsheet to see what else I could turn up in...  Just as embarrassing were the nostrils of our BMW M2, although Bryce was having too much fun a few feet behind them to really care: \"It took over many conversations in the office. Many hate it, but I love it.\" And Prior came into close proximity with the ugly face of SUV antipathy when he offered a friend a lift in the Defender 130: \"I did know someone who said he would refuse to go in it - which suited me fine.\" Winner: Jeep Avenger Electric The Abarth 500e landed a few votes here, too, but we're running low on Acid Green confetti, so we will quickly summarise its nominations: \"Enjoy it too much and you'll find yourself on the forecourt for longer than you're on the Tarmac; said Warrick, who quickly tired of its 37.3kWh battery and 80kW maximum charging rate. Bryce was similarly conflicted: \"Its regenerative braking stops you from driving it smoothly. But it's like a tennis ball: small, fast and agile. And Prior overlooked its pitfalls to nominate it for this award, \"but 'loved' might be overstating it\" It's the Jeep Avenger Electric that we're instead asking to join us on stage now. Things seemed rosy for the tiny Polish-American SUV: it looked great, was priced attractively and was named Car of the Year - but our long-termer's misbehaviour cut the honeymoon period well short. \"Basic, glitchy software made me lose trust in the car,\" said Tisshaw. \"Fix that, though, and Jeep has a small car that's a triumph in design for successfully shrinking the styling of the larger models. Verpraet was less forgiving: \"It started as Car of the Year, then it got a 3.5-star road test verdict and then the editor lost all faith in it after its screens shut down on the motorway. I ran the Jeep for a while, and it has the same rubbish driving position as every car on this platform. 'Cheep Avenger' indeed.\" Meanwhile, Rimell loved the Peugeot e-208 but just couldn't get on with its i-Cockpit- \"so flawed that I'm still surprised it was signed off\" - and Scullion quietly admitted that the Giulia QV might not be perfect, after all: \"It's broadly brilliant but it loves throwing up warning lights and draining its battery. It seems Stellantis has a big stack of ironing to do across the board. Consolation awards  We've gone as far as to invent our own awards so no car goes home empty-handed.  Honda e:NY1  I wanted to love the e:NY1, because I loved the E, but it was about as unremarkable as cars get to drive. Shame. Still, I enjoyed a surprisingly large amount of space in the back when catching a lift from a colleague, so it lands the Beat's Walking Award. - MT Nissan Aryia  This electric SUV wins the Check the Spec Award for being very options-sensitve, but among the better cars in its class with the right boxes ticked. Finesse the configurator and you can combine a lovely interior with a sensible design and decent range. - MSc Subaru Crosstrek Subaru's infotainment system can be programmed to remind you of birthdays and anniversaries - a function that my mate checkily used to present me with a highly questionable message when I left for the office the next morning, earning it HR's Not Safe For Work Award. - KC Dacia Sandero Stepway  Most days, I spend eight hours staring at mag pages on a screen, so this all-you-need-and nothing-you-don't hatch wins the Digital Detox Award for giving my poor eyes and brain a rest. - KC Skoda Kamiq Like the inoffensive shade of off-white you paint your walls, Skoda's smallest crossover lands this year's Dulux Magnolia Award for being so solidly decent that it just fades into the background. - JA Citroen C4 X I'm handing 2024's Comfort Food Award to an under-appreciated machine that can be comfortably integrated into your life - and I do mean comfortably. It soaks up bumps as well as you would expect a Citroën to and makes for a relaxing companion after a long day. - JB Polestar 2  It's handsome, has a beautifully minimal yet practical interior, has a great driving position, is well priced and is great to drive. Plus, the range is huge. So the 2 is a shoo-in for the Incidentally, It's Electric Award. - WR",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport-f1/motorsport-moments-made-2024-racing-watershed",
    "description": "F1 was back to its best, but there was also drama aplenty across the motorsport spectrum Formula 1 How Max Verstappen joined Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel as a four-time Formula 1 world champion only underlined what we already knew about the Dutchman: that at 27 his place is assured among the few, as one of the greatest racing drivers we’ve yet seen – and, much like Michael Schumacher, he will probably always stoke anger over his hard-edged character and approach to wheel-to-wheel racing. For a while we feared 2024 would be more of the same following his near-whitewash last year. Verstappen won seven of this season’s first 10 races to open up a gaping lead – which was just as well given how the season would then turn. The toxicity of Christian Horner’s allegedly inappropriate behaviour to a female employee at Red Bull tarnished the opening weeks. Horner was cleared of misconduct and brazenly rode out the storm, but the cost was heavy. The loss of Adrian Newey, eventually to Aston Martin, will surely have a profound knock-on effect, if it hasn’t already. Newey’s bombshell coincided with Red Bull’s sharp decline, as Verstappen struggled with the tricky RB20. At the same time, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes pulled their acts together, to varying degrees, with all of their drivers winning races in what turned out to be a superbly competitive and entertaining season. Suddenly, Verstappen was on the back foot and that inevitably triggered his petulant streak. But, impressively, he never cracked. This was a flawless campaign as he kept his score ticking over despite Red Bull’s downturn in form, and when he finally ended a four-month losing streak with a sensational wet-weather comeback from 17th on the grid in Brazil, Verstappen had fully earned his fourth Formula 1 crown. Lando Norris emerged as his only threat for the title, although the points gap would have required a record-breaking effort to overcome it. As the 25-year-old freely admitted, there were too many mistakes as he suddenly found himself in a genuinely pace-setting McLaren for the first time. He’ll learn so much from the experiences of this year.  Meanwhile, McLaren’s revival under measured team principal Andrea Stella is proof that in this era Mercedes customer status is enough of a basis to fight for world titles, and with fellow first-time GP winner Oscar Piastr i in the other papaya car, the team boasts arguably the most potent driver line-up. Season highlights? Lewis Hamilton’s ninth British GP win was special, ending a 945-day victory drought. His move to Ferrari for 2025 was the year’s biggest story, announced before the season began. The seven-time champ will be 40 in January but remains an inspirational F1 force – even if Mercedes team-mate George Russell comprehensively out-qualified him this year. After two years of Red Bull domination, F1 was back to its best in 2024 – to the relief of anyone not connected to Verstappen. It ’s never been tighter: in Norris, Piastri, Hamilton, Russell, Charles Leclerc and more, it has a stellar cast of winners – and any one of them will believe they can dethrone Verstappen in 2025. Bring it on. British Touring Car Championship Britain’s premier four-wheeled motorsport series crowned a new champion in 2024. Jake Hill followed in the footsteps of Frank Sytner, Will Hoy, Tim Harvey, Joachim Winkelhock and his WSR team-mate Colin Turkington by winning a BTCC title in a BMW. The 30 -year-old from Kent scored eight wins on his way to his first championship in anything, beating Excelr8 Hyundai’s Tom Ingram in a nail-biting finale at Brands Hatch. Ingram’s hard luck in race one, when he was caught up in a collision between Josh Cook and outgoing champion Ash Sutton, opened the door for Hill, who had come into the final weekend equal on points with the 2022 champion. Four-time champion Turkington, out of the reckoning this year, did his team-mate a favour and allowed him through for victory. But Ingram hit back in race two, slicing past both BMWs for a stirring victory. Hill’s championship lead was a single point as they headed into the finale, in mixed conditions – and the change in weather played to the strengths of the BMW 330e. With another helping hand from Turkington, he finished second to Sutton in the race to seal an emotional BTCC title. “Almost every time it has rained we’ve won or been on the podium,” said Hill. “So for it to rain in that last race and to pass Tom for the championship around the outside at Surtees pleased me most. Funnily enough, when Tom won the title in 2022 he pulled the exact same move on me. So it was a perfect way to get it done, especially at home on the Brands GP circuit.” Formula E Jaguar’s works squad claimed team honours in the electric-powered series, but as usual it’s the drivers’ title that takes precedence for the public – and somehow the Kiwi pair of Nick Cassidy and Mitch Evans bungled that one. Or at least their team did. Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein won the Saturday race in London, but Cassidy took pole position for the Sunday finale to leave the top three separated by just four points with one to play. Then team strategy on when Cassidy should take his Attack Mode power boost, and how Evans should back up Wehrlein for his team-mate’s benefit, left the pair with glum faces as Jaguar celebrated its first world championship since the Group C sports car days. An odd scene. But what did for Evans in the end was the Formula E equivalent of an own goal: he fa i led to trigger the activation point when attempting to pick up his final dose of Attack Mode, which meant he had to try again – and that allowed Wehrlein to get past. It made the difference as the ex-F1 driver claimed his first world championship. World Endurance Championship Honours were shared three ways at the pinnacle of sports car racing in 2024. Porsche’s drivers became world champions, Toyota claimed the manufacturers’ crown and Ferrari won the Le Mans 24 Hours. From a bigger-picture perspective, Le Mans always trumps the world titles as the defining factor in how an endurance racing season is judged. But the rich influx of manufacturers – eight in the top Hypercar class, nine in the new LMGT3 category – has shifted the dial. Winning the WEC is now much more than a consolation, at least to those in the paddock and pit lane. Ferrari even circled a WEC crown as its target for 2024, following the 499P’s historic debut win at Le Mans’ 100th-anniversary edition last year. Nevertheless, the Prancing Horse will take a second consecutive victory at the Big One and the 11th in its long history at the race. A troublesome open door on the 499P driven by Nicklas Nielsen caused a flutter in the closing stages, but the Dane kept his head to deliver another narrow defeat of Toyota for Ferrari and a first Le Mans victory for himself, Antonio Fuoco and Miguel Molina. The trio eventually finished a distant second in the WEC points to Porsche crew Kévin Estre, Laurens Vanthoor and André Lotterer – the last-named a WEC champion for a second time at 42.  The Penske-run Porsche team put a surprisingly troubled first season with the 963 behind it to uncover both pace and reliability in the car ’s sophomore campaign. Estre and co won twice, at the Qatar season opener and the penultimate round at Fuji, and scored consistently in between to earn their crown. British team Jota added a historic first privateer win in this Hypercar era, as Will Stevens and Callum Ilot t steered their Hertz-backed 963 to victory at Spa. Toyota at least stole the limelight at the season closer in Bahrain. Sébastien Buemi’s charge from 10th to victory allowed the GR010 Hybrid to beat the Penske Porsches to manufacturer honours by just two points. Meanwhile, Porsche’s Manthey-run 911 GT3-R proved the class of LMGT3 in the hands of Alex Malykhin, Joel Sturm and Klaus Bachler to cap a great season for sports car racing’s most successful manufacturer. Parallel to WEC glory, Penske Porsche’s 963s also won the Daytona 24 Hours and IMSA title in the US. World Rally Championship Tricky times for the pinnacle of rallying. The cars remain spectacularly fast, but hybrid powertrains have failed to inspire fresh interest from the world’s car manufacturers beyond current entrants Toyota, Hyundai and Ford (through M-Sport) – and when the reigning double champion decides he can afford to take a semi-sabbatical at the age of just 24, it ’s hardly a sign of a sport in the rudest of health. Kalle Rovanperä turned out for seven of the 13 rounds for Toyota and won four of them. Meanwhile, Sébastien Ogier also continued to rally part-time, only to find himself pulled into the race more than originally planned when his three wins made him a title contender. But their absences meant this was Thierry Neuville’s year. No one will begrudge Hyundai’s champion his first title, especially as the 36-year old has previously finished runner-up five times. He won the Monte Carlo opener and was never headed in the points, even if it took him until September to add a second win, in Greece. Neuville was made to sweat by Ott Tänak, the 2019 champion returning to Hyundai after a year at M-Sport, and he pushed their internal battle all the way to the final round.  But the Estonian’s crash in Japan allowed Elfyn Evans to record a win in 2024, and it lifted him to a distant second in the points – for a fourth time. The Welshman knew he had wasted a golden chance to win a WRC crown. Evans did at least contribute to Toyota pipping Hyundai to the manufacturers’ title, by just three points. Indycar Álex Palou is the shining star in America’s premier single-seater championship right now. At 27, the Spaniard strode to his third Indycar title in four years on the Nashville oval back in September – to the surprise of no one. Palou has stoked controversy in recent years, first by trying to switch to Arrow McLaren from the Chip Ganassi Racing team that gave him his big chance, then by going back on an apparent agreement to join McLaren for this year having decided to stay put with Ganassi after all. Now, apparently content with life where he is (we think) and without any obvious route to F1, which would have been the case even if he had joined McLaren’s US arm, the glaring hole in his career is the absence of a win at the race that counts for more than any other. 200th lap only for the American to slingshot back ahead moments later. The win followed a tawdry cheating scandal over Newgarden’s illegal use of Indycar’s ‘push to pass’ boost at the St Petersburg season opener. For team chief Roger Penske, who also owns the series and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, it was all a little awkward.",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki India has registered total despatches of 16,25,308 units in January-November 2024, which marks marginal 1 percent year-on-year growth (January-November 2023: 16,02,890 units). The surging demand for the company’s utility vehicles compared to the flagging sales of its passenger cars and sedans is now reflected in its specific model-wise performance at the top. A deep dive into the company’s sales statistics for the first 11 months of CY2024 reveals that the Ertiga MPV, with 1,74,035 units, has outsold the longstanding Maruti Suzuki best-seller, the Wagon R (1,73,552 units), by 483 units. Whether the Ertiga holds onto the lead in December to be the company’s new No. 1 model for a calendar year remains to be seen, albeit given the trend of the last month of the year, it should. Maruti Ertiga sales up 49 percent year on year Maruti Wagon R sales decline 10 percent year on year Maruti’s SUV and MPV sales contribution increases to 40 percent In CY2023, the Wagon R had sold 2,01,301 units, while the Ertiga had sold 1,29,968 units – a difference of 71,333 units, which puts the two models’ performance this year in a different perspective, and representative of the trends in their respective segments. While the Ertiga’s UV segment continues to thrive, the Wagon R’s hatchback market has seen a marked decline. Maruti Ertiga sales: 1,74,035 units, up 49 percent YoY The Ertiga has been on a roll this year. Its wholesales of 1,74,035 units in the first 11 months constitute handsome 49 percent YoY growth (January-November 2023: 1,16,993 units). The MPV’s best sales month in this year to date has been the festival-laden October (18,785 units). Strong and sustained demand, particularly for the CNG variant, means that this model has already sold 44,067 units more than its entire CY2023 sales of 1,29,968 units (when it was UV No. 5), with December sales still to be counted. Between January and November 2024, the Ertiga has outsold the Wagon R in five months – May and from August through to November (see 11-month wholesales data table below). The Ertiga sold 69,956 units in August-November compared to the Wagon R’s 57,693 units. This makes for a sizeable difference of 12,263 units, which has helped the Ertiga bridge the sales gap of the preceding seven months. Maruti Wagon R sales: 1,73,552 units, down 10 percent YoY The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, which recently completed 25 years in the Indian market and is one of the longest-surviving nameplates, has been India’s bestselling car for the past three fiscal years in a row – FY2022 (1,88,827 units), FY2023 (2,12,340 units / up 12 percent), and FY2024 (2,00,177 units / down 5.73 percent YoY). However, in the January to November 2024 period, sales of the tall-boy hatchback are down 10 percent compared to last year’s 1,92,723 units in the same duration. The decline in the Wagon R’s sales can also be attributed to strong consumer shift from passenger cars towards SUVs and MPVs. This is amply reflected in Maruti Suzuki’s segment-wise sales performance for the first 11 months of CY2024. Maruti SUVs, MPV share increases by 8 percent to 40 percent As the segment-wise split of Maruti Suzuki India’s total passenger vehicle sales (11-month data table below) shows, UV sales have helped buffer the sharp decline in the company’s hatchback and sedan sales. Combined sales of hatchbacks (Alto, S-Presso, Baleno, Swift, Wagon R, Celerio, Ignis) and sedans (Dzire and Ciaz) at 843,261 units are down 12 percent YoY (January-November 2023: 956,326 units). This has also impacted their share of total PV sales – currently at 52 percent from the 60 percent they had in the first 11 months of CY2023. And the Wagon R is part of that story. Meanwhile, in sharp contrast and in line with the overall industry trend, demand for Maruti Suzuki’s UV model range has grown stronger with every passing year. Between January and November 2024, a total of 6,55,020 UVs were dispatched to dealers across India, making for robust 26 percent YoY growth (January-November 2023: 5,20,588 units). This performance has seen the UV share of Maruti Suzuki’s overall PV sales jump to 40 percent from 32 percent a year ago – making up the same 8 percent decline in car sales. Maruti model-wise sales in January-November 2024 Of the 6,55,020 UVs sold in the January-November 2024 period, four models with six-figure sales stand out. The Ertiga leads with 1,74,035 units, just 3,212 units ahead of the Brezza (1,70,823 units), and Fronx (1,45,484 units) compact SUVs, and the Grand Vitara (1,15,564 units). The fifth model in Maruti Suzuki’s UV pecking order is the XL6 MPV (38,199 units), followed by the Jimny (7,634 units) and the premium Invicto MPV (3,191 units). Meanwhile, the Wagon R (1,73,552 units) leads the rest of the 10-model Maruti Suzuki portfolio. At No. 2 is the premium Baleno (1,62,982 units) just 595 units ahead of sibling Swift. The Dzire sedan (1,51,415 units) is the No. 4 passenger car model, followed by the Eeco van (1,27,027 units). The Alto (98,512 units), Celerio (35,299 units), S-Presso (26,172 units), Ignis (26,111 units) and the Ciaz (6,831 units) make up the rest.

    "description": "The Kia Sonet facelift has crossed the 1,00,000 sales milestone in 11 months since its launch in January, and variants with a sunroof accounted for 79 percent of it, the South Korean car brand noted. Eighteen variants (petrol and diesel combined) of the Sonet come equipped with a single-pane sunroof, excluding the entry-level HTE and HTK trims.  Diesel variants make up for about 24 percent of total Sonet sales About 66 percent of the demand for the Sonet is for manual versions While Sonet’s line-up starts at Rs 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India), prices for its sunroof models range between Rs 8.31 (HTE (O)) and 14.91 lakh (X-Line). Notably, the compact SUV was also featured among the 10 bestselling UVs of 2024. Kia further stated that 76 percent of Sonet sales came from variants with petrol engines – 1.0-litre turbo and 1.2-litre naturally aspirated. “The 1.2-litre petrol engine brings the most buyers for the Sonet,” Kia India MD and CEO Gwanggu Lee told Autocar India during an interview earlier. The rest came from the 1.5-litre diesel motor, which also powers the larger Kia Seltos and, most recently, the Syros. As for the transmission, automatic (including iMT) variants make up about 34 percent of the sales, and the remaining demand is for manual versions. From March 2021 to August 2025, the compact SUV had a 37 percent share in Kia’s overall sales, second only to the Seltos’ 48 percent share. The pre-facelift Sonet also crossed the 1,00,000 sales figure within a year of its debut. The sales goal of 1,50,000 units was achieved in 2022, followed by 2,50,000 units in 2023. The run from 2,50,000 to 3,50,000 units took about 15 months. The Sonet rivals the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO and Hyundai Venue. Kia India has completed almost 1.6 million vehicle dispatches from its Anantapur plant, including over 1.2 million domestic sales and over 3.67 lakh exports.  Also, see: Kia Sonet sales hit 4.5 lakh mark in four years Kia Sonet gets more features in lower variants; prices start from Rs 8.19 lakh",

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.
