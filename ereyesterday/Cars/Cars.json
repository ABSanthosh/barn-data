There are storied ones like the Ford Capri and Renault 5, but the more niche ones are fair game as well.We’ve seen the odd Nissan Motorsport-branded Nissan Juke and GT-R in Europe, but Nissan never developed Nismo into a fully fledged sub-brand like it has done in Japan. Now it’s back to add some spice to the Nissan Ariya electric SUV and turn it into the Nissan Ariya Nismo.",

    "description": "Supermini-sized ‘utility’ EV offers retro cheeriness at a very low price Given the Fiat Panda was taken off sale in the UK last year, you would be forgiven for thinking the Fiat Grande Panda Electric is its replacement.But no, it’s an all-new model, filling the space in the Fiat range for a 4m-long (so supermini-sized) car that has existed since the Fiat Punto's departure in 2018. The car known just as Fiat Panda lives on elsewhere, just not in the UK.As the Punto disappeared without anyone really noticing, the fact that no replacement was forthcoming slipped under the radar, too. The Grande Panda is packed full of clever touches and original thinking that suggests Fiat has used the time wisely to create something far more interesting than a standard replacement might have been.Fiat has chosen to launch a ’utility vehicle’ (think slightly raised hatchback; a Dacia Sandero Stepway to a standard Dacia Sandero) rather than a supermini in the space vacated by the Punto because it offers more global appeal.Perhaps surprisingly, Fiat is Stellantis’s biggest brand globally, and the Grande Panda will appeal to and can be built in the markets in which it has a large presence (Brazil, Turkey and Algeria, for example) and with different powertrains.But the Grande Panda isn't one of those 'global cars' that's built to appeal to everyone but ends up appearing to nobody, with all the joy sucked out of it. Instead, it has a habit of making you smile outside and in.",

    "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.

    "description": "But the performance from the engine, especially in the meaty midrange, is deeply satisfying, and often, with this car, I tended to plan intracity excursions just to be able to enjoy its performance to the fullest. It truly is an absolute delight on fast-flowing empty roads and is in sharp contrast to most other vehicles at this price point. That said, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed using the bright, clear and responsive touchscreen. Wireless Apple CarPlay gels perfectly with the unit; I find myself switching to Google Maps often nowadays to decide which route to take, and having the app one touch away really helps. And I love the clarity of the speakerphone on the move. It’s great to know that I can hear the person at the other end of the line clearly, and equally important is that I can be heard over the line perfectly. This is certainly not the case in many rival cars. Manual upshifts and downshifts hit the spot when you have the pedal down hard. Skoda’s Slavia has been in our long-term fleet ever since it went on sale in India. Initially, we had it in manual form, with that delicious six-speed elevating the driving experience considerably; we now have the twin-clutch automatic-equipped version in this slate grey shade – both powered by the 150hp 1.5 TSI engine. This Slavia, like the previous one, first and foremost does a convincing job of showcasing just how good a well-configured and engineered sedan can be, even in this age of the SUV. Add to that the luscious matte paint contrasted by those bright red LED tail-lights, and you have a car that draws more attention than any SUV I’ve driven recently. Sure, the matte paint needs extra care, and you have to instruct the person who washes your car to be extra careful not to scratch the surface when removing dried dirt and bird excrement. But the ice-cool look of the car more than makes up. Electrically adjustable front seats add comfort and convenience. Then, there’s the added practicality of the massive 521-litre boot, which can swallow enough luggage for five easily, and an SUV-like 179mm of ground clearance. You have to be careful when opening the boot and push the lid all the way back, or else it has a tendency to drop back down and knock you on the head. The convenience of the twin-clutch automatic did help as well, especially in traffic. I thoroughly enjoyed using the paddles on good driving roads, the quick shifts of the twin-clutch DSG massively contrasting other not-as-fun automatics, delivering a driving experience that can otherwise be had only on more expensive cars. However, the plastic paddles behind the wheel don’t feel well-built. In start-stop traffic, the gearbox tends to pause momentarily, which coincides with the zone where the turbo isn’t fully awake yet, making it worse. While the 1.5 TSI does deliver power, punch, performance and smoothness, it isn’t the most responsive engine and sounds a bit strained when wrung out. It certainly isn’t as rev-happy or as responsive at higher engine speeds as the smaller 1.0 TSI unit. The aircon isn't the most effective, especially on very hot summer days.  On the inside, powered seats prove to be a good upgrade. They make it so much easier to make small adjustments to my driving position, especially on long drives, where a slight change in seat angle or distance from the pedals can help take the pressure off your back. And cooled seats make quite a contribution, too. This is especially true in the summer months when getting into a hot car. Wish the aircon were more powerful. I had to lower the temperature setting and increase the fan speed when it got really hot outside, with the air-conditioning not coping as effortlessly in the summer heat due to a less powerful fixed-volume compressor. And then, despite some typically solidly built bits like the door pads and the glovebox, some parts on the dash, such as the vents and the screen’s shroud, seem to work themselves loose. What also helps is that the speakers go nice and loud; the audio system seems to be well-specified, and the subwoofer in the spare wheel adds some well-timed punch. Something that continues to infuriate is the digital instrument panel. The tachometer is shrouded once you are past 80kph, the odometer disappears if you are in cruise control mode, and the reset button for the trip is on the touchscreen. However, Skoda has made amends, with the instrument panel on recent cars showing the tachometer when the 80kph speed warning comes up. The boot lid needs to be pushed all the way, or else it closes again, often painfully. With the twin-clutch automatic not having a torque converter, which saps both power and efficiency at low speeds, the car delivered 15-17kpl on the highway and between 10kpl and 12kpl on a regular basis in the city. Summing up,the Slavia 1.5 automatic is a car that gets a double thumbs up because it does both practical transport and fun-to-drive all at once. Apart from not having ADAS, it is reasonably well-equipped, has a comfortable rear seat, gives you a good sense of security and has a 5-star safety rating. So, if you are looking for an SUV in the Rs 15-25 lakh space, make sure you also take a look at the Slavia.

While he sought to honor the life his project bike had already lived, the barn-find Beemer proved to be the perfect canvas for a few of his racier ideas as well.

    "description": "The motorcycle world was in the midst of an arms race in the early 1970s. Performance was king, and manufacturers were locked in a battle to build the fastest, most exhilarating machines for petrol-crazed riders. Honda had just dropped the CB750, a smooth, sophisticated four-cylinder revolution that brought superbike power to the masses. Yamaha was refining its two-stroke RD series and Suzuki had its triple-cylinder weapon in the form of the GT750—AKA the ‘Water Buffalo.’ Kawasaki wasn’t as interested in refinement. Beat to the punch on the four-cylinder, Kawasaki bet everything on two-stroke performance and set out to build the fastest bike the world had ever seen—something that would leave the competition coughing in a haze of blue smoke. The pinnacle of this effort was the 1972 Kawasaki H2 Mach IV, a 750 cc, three-cylinder two-stroke that redefined what speed meant on two wheels and permanently altered the course of the superbike segment.…",

    "description": "Ultraviolette has launched a more ergonomic version of the Mach 2. It is called the F77 Super Street and is available in two variants at ex-showroom prices of Rs 2.99 lakh and Rs 3.99 lakh. Here is everything you need to know about this new model. The Super Street’s price is the same as that of the F77 Mach 2 It has improved ergonomics, including a wider and taller handlebar Ultraviolette F77 Super Street: what is it? Under the skin, the Super Street is effectively an F77 Mach 2 with improvements to the overall ergonomics. The Super Street has an all-new handlebar that’s wider and taller than the Mach 2. However, the footpeg position is unchanged. Ultraviolette has also tweaked the headlight design, giving it a new cowl. The company claims this new design is 15 percent more aerodynamic than the F77 Mach 2 and that the redesigning has led to a change in the angle for the 5-inch TFT, which now improves overall visibility.  Otherwise, the overall design is the same as the Mach 2. At 207kg, the weight is mostly unchanged, and the company says the new handlebar has increased the overall weight by roughly 0.5kg.  The F77 Super Street is equipped with three riding modes, three levels of traction control, 10 levels of regen, hill-hold assist, three ABS modes and an optional tyre pressure monitoring system. The model is available in two variants, and the range-topping F77 Super Street Recon has a 10.3kWh battery and produces 40.2hp and 100Nm. The company claims that the range is similar to the Mach 2: the IDC range is 211km for the base variant and 323km for the Recon.  Bookings for the F77 Super Street open on February 1, and deliveries will commence by March 1.

    "description": "Alongside the bigger 390s, we have also gotten our hands on the specifications of the upcoming KTM 250 Adventure. This bike sits on the same new platform as the 2025 390 Adventure and 390 Adventure X. The engine makes a little more peak output than before It gets off-road ABS and bidirectional quickshifter Gets all-new design and bodywork for 2025  The 2025 250 Adventure will be powered by the same engine seen on the latest 250 Duke, which makes 31hp and 25Nm of torque. There is also a repositioned under-belly exhaust in place of earlier stubby upswept unit.  This updated engine is now nestled in a two-piece steel trellis frame and lacks an aluminium sub-frame, which is present on the updated 390s. It rides on a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear setup. The suspension setup has also been changed, and it now gets 200mm of travel up front and 205mm at the rear, which is the same as the new 390 Adventure models. Braking duties are handled by a 320mm disc and a 240mm disc (F/R) with dual-channel ABS. In typical KTM fashion, it gives riders the option to switch off the rear ABS via the Off-road mode. Compared to the previous model, the bike’s kerb weight remains unchanged at 177kg. The 2025 bike has also seen a marginal drop (0.5 litres) in fuel capacity, which is rated at 14 litres. The 250 Adventure gets an update to its feature list as well, with the biggest addition being the same 5-inch TFT display, also seen on the 390 Duke and the latest 390 Adventure. For the first time, the 250 Adventure features ride-by-wire, which allows it to be fitted with a bidirectional quickshifter.  In terms of design, the 250 Adventure is all-new for 2025, bringing it more in line with the bigger models in KTM’s line-up. Another change is a projector headlight setup in place of the outgoing bike’s halogen light.  For now, KTM has only revealed the technical details of the KTM 250 Adventure, but we do expect a bump in price when it goes on sale. For reference, the outgoing model is priced at Rs 2.48 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Also see: KTM CEO Stefan Pierer steps down",

    "title": "GLORY RESTORED: Chasing the Alpine Dream",
    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",
