    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advice-electric-cars/how-long-do-batteries-last-electric-cars",
    "description": "Should you be worried about the battery life of an electric car? Not if you pay close attention to our guide For many car owners, the electric car represents an entirely new way of driving and brings with it many queries and worries. One of the largest concerns is how long the battery life is on an electric car. You may well have read horror stories about electric car owners facing hefty bills for replacements or contemplating cutting their losses on cars that are otherwise worthless because they literally don't work. And it’s not hard to see where these rumours and anecdotes come from, because our extensive experience of mobile phones, tablets and laptop computers has shown many that, even over a relatively short period of time, the batteries powering them can quickly lose efficiency, resulting in the need for more frequent charging. In extreme cases, the degradation is so severe that the device won’t even fire up unless it’s permanently on charge, which is obviously no use for an EV. There’s also no denying that battery technology doesn’t come cheap, and should the cells ever need replacement, it’s quite likely that they will cost more to swap than the car is now worth - which is why we tend to replace mobile phones in their entirety rather than replace the battery pack.  Battery swapping stations, where depleted electric car batteries can be changed for fully charged ones in mere minutes, are beginning to crop up in Europe and may offer an answer to battery life queries. But how bad is the electric car battery problem really? The good news is that the more electric cars that are out there and the longer they are run for, the more evidence is produced to show that the power pack will often last the lifetime of the car. Better still, there are plenty of tips and strategies you can follow to make sure your car’s batteries will survive better than most. Battery life for electric cars Generally, electric car batteries last for as long as the rest of the car. But like with your phone or laptop battery, they degrade over time. Ultimately, the cells should still have at least 70% of their capacity even after 200,000 miles, which is the sort of mileage that few cars ever reach, whether they’re combustion-engined or electric.  As an example, a number of Tesla Model S taxis operating from Gatwick airport racked up more 300,000 miles each over three years and all retained at least 82% battery health. Why does an electric car battery lose charge or degrade? The truth is that batteries degrade over time and with use, meaning they become less efficient as they age and provide a shorter range. Continual advances in battery technology mean that issues surrounding degradation of performance are being reduced all the time. However, even the latest lithium ion cells aren’t completely immune to losing performance over time, with a number of factors playing a role.  Perhaps the biggest single contributor to the decline in efficiency is the cycle of use and charging. Frequent draining of the cells followed by a full charge can over time damage the battery’s ability to maintain its optimum energy storage. That's why manufacturers typically recommend charging only to 80% and never letting the range drop to zero miles. Rapid charging also plays a part, because channelling so much electrical energy and so quickly generates much higher temperatures in the battery pack.   Liquid cooling of the cells helps mitigate this, but use a rapid charger frequently and over time these extreme heat cycles will cause damage to the lithium ion packs. In a similar but less extreme way, cars that are used in hotter climates tend to suffer a subtly greater reduction in performance than those used in cooler conditions. How long do Tesla batteries last? Tesla claims its batteries last between 300,000 and 500,000 miles. For a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with a 436-mile WLTP range, that makes for between 700 and 1500 battery charge cycles. We have experience running used Teslas on our fleet, including a four-year-old used Tesla Model 3 that had covered roughly 40,000 miles. Despite this, its battery had degraded only 2%. Hundreds of other examples point to our findings too, so it's safe to say that Tesla batteries can last for a long time and hold their all important percentages.  How can I care for my electric car battery? Happily, there are ways you can help preserve the power and efficiency of your battery over time. One of the major ways of protecting the cells is by carefully managing the charging and discharging of the cells, which in an ideal world means trying to avoid the charge dropping below 20% and not adding more than 80% when charging - above the latter figure is when batteries tend to get hottest, which takes a toll on the cells’ delicate chemistry. Happily, most EVs now give you the option to programme your car’s charging schedule, allowing you to decide when the electricity flows and, crucially, letting you set a cap on exactly how much pours into the cells. By the same token, it’s best not to completely drain the battery. Most EVs will always make sure there’s a bare minimum of energy left even if it won’t allow the car to move, but storing your car for long periods and allowing electricity to leech away is to be avoided. Speaking of charging, it’s best to only use DC rapid chargers sparingly. Although fine for topping up on longer journeys or in emergencies when you need a quick burst of energy, a by-product of rapid chargers’ speed is the increased, lithium-ion-damaging temperatures in the battery as it copes with the electrical onslaught. If the car is to be used in extremes of hot or cold weather, always make sure the car is plugged in to charge (with the maximum limit set to 80%, of course) regardless of range. This trickle-charging technique allows the battery’s thermal management system to continue working and keep the cells at the optimum temperature for longevity. Finally, the way you drive your EV can affect its battery life. Much like rapid charging, quick depletion of the cells can cause damage that over time will lead to reduced efficiency and range. Ultimately, the faster you drive and the more you make use of an EV’s trademark instant torque for lightning getaways, the more you cause damaging heat build-up in the battery. So it’s best to take it steady if you want longevity. Electric car battery warranties Manufacturers are acutely aware that potential electric car buyers could be put off by the possibility of premature and expensive battery failure. The truth is that when treated correctly, most modern lithium ion batteries are likely to last the lifetime of the car. Even so, most firms cover the battery with a separate, extended warranty. Most car warranties are around three years and 60,000 miles, but this is increased for the battery element in EVs. For instance, Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Nissan and Renault cover the cells for eight years and 100,000 miles, while Hyundai ups the mileage limit to 125,000. Tesla has the same eight-year timeframe but a mileage limit of 150,000 on the Model S and Model X, 120,000 on the Model 3 Long Range and 100,000 on all other versions.  And apart from Audi and Tesla, most include a maximum allowable capacity (between 70 and 75%) for the battery, which will trigger a replacement if it dips below this figure during the warranty period.",

    "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "link": "",
    "description": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=7SaiVW3QfZc Photography: Rosario Liberti  In the early 1950s, a group of thrill-seekers in Zell am See, Austria, transformed their frozen lake into a playground of horsepower and daring. The inaugural Professor Ferdinand Porsche Memorial Race in 1952 saw skiers clinging to motorcycles, skijoring at breakneck speeds over the ice. This audacious blend of motorsport and winter sport marked the birth of a tradition that would see Porsche 356s and 550 Spyders sliding gracefully across the glistening surface, captivating thousands of spectators annually. The races continued until 1974, when a tragic accident halted the event, casting a shadow over the icy spectacle. Fast forward to 2019, and the frozen silence was broken by the roar of engines once more. Ferdi Porsche, great-grandson of the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, alongside his college friend Vinzenz Greger, resurrected the ice race, rebranding it under the F.A.T. International banner. This revival not only honored the legacy of the original races but also injected a modern flair, attracting a new generation of motorsport enthusiasts to the icy tracks of Zell am See. ​ To explore the history, evolution, and future of the F.A.T. Ice Race, as well as its impact on the automotive world, we sat down with Ferdi Porsche. In this conversation, he shares insights on reviving the event, Porsche’s enduring family spirit, the role of design in his vision, and his thoughts on the next generation of motorsport talent. Ferdi on F.A.T. and its Future Petrolicious:  Tell us a little bit about the FAT Ice race, and why its back? Ferdi Porsche: The ice race started in Selamsee in the 50s, and I honestly think it was an enthusiast event or race, basically. I think they saw that they had a frozen lake and decided to drive some cars around.  I found out about it because my dad bought a car that used to race on the frozen lake and it came with the spike tires and it still had the super long studs in there and I asked him what what it was because it was kind of forgotten already, the ice racing. I had the idea of bringing it back when I was in my architecture studies.  I was looking for something fun to do by the side and so this came at a perfect time. In 2019, we had the first ice race in Zell again. Then we did it twice before COVID. And when COVID hit, I was thinking, Okay, how do I, how do I take this to the next level? And how do I expand it from just one event? And that's when I found F.A.T. International and decided to revive the brand. Petrolicious: What does F.A.T. Stand for? F.A.T. used to stand for Francais Allemand Transit. It was a French German logistics company. And now it just stands for FAT It just literally describes the energy and the vibe of everything that we do basically. Funnily enough the first ice race kind of introduced that without the brand FAT being there. Petrolicious: What are the stars of this years F.A.T. Race? Ferdi: The stars of the show of the 25 Ice Race are probably the F.A.T. cars. Since F.A.T. was a sponsor in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s for all the great cars, Ferraris, Porsches, Mercedes, everything, they naturally take center stage. We brought this tradition back and are now sponsoring cars again. We have the 963 that raced at Le Mans last year here. Sadly, it is not driving because it is not high up enough, but we also have the Dakar cars, the ones that work better on the ice. We have a bunch of WRC cars, so we really have an amazing array of cars this year. That was always the idea of Ice Race, being open to any brand and any manufacturer. I think this year we have 22 different car brands in the race. Petrolicious: What is your favorite Porsche model on the ice this year? Ferdi: That's a difficult question. There's so many different, there's so many cool Porsches that I can't really decide for one. It changes over time. Sometimes I'm more towards the super old stuff, 550s obviously, also because of the history and the connection to ice racing. But obviously I love the Dakar, a sick car, and just the vibe also matches that somehow. It's hard to decide. Petrolicious: What are your long term plans for F.A.T. Ferdi: With F.A.T., we do a bunch of things. We're a young team, and the idea is to do stuff that we like, stuff that we enjoy, because we believe that when we like it, other people will like it too. Obviously, we have the event side of things. Last year, we brought it to Aspen, and I’m looking at where I can bring it next apart from Zell. But we're also looking into the summer. We have our \"Hot on Top\" at Großglockner with Mankei, where we do car meets every month during the summer. The idea is to do stuff that we think is fun. So you can expect F.A.T. to be all around the world many times. Petrolicious: So not just ice? Ferdi: I think F.A.T. works on every terrain. Basically, it got famous through Le Mans. Proper racing on tarmac is where it was kind of born, and it's still happening today with the 963 that we have in Le Mans, but also with the karting league for the kids. So F.A.T. works on every terrain, but its spirit is kind of born from ice racing because it's somewhat more about fun than speed. Petrolicious: As an Architect, how does your design sensibilities influence what you do? Ferdi: I think studying architecture kind of gives you a great opportunity to look at a blank piece of paper and then come up with stuff. So I think that obviously plays into F.A.T. I know what I can and what I can't do. I'm not a graphic designer, but I like paying attention to all of that stuff. And I think the devil and the beauty is in the detail. So that's why everything that we do with F.A.T. is always very detail focused. Obviously, it's sometimes festival and wild, and you can never fully plan an event that happens on a frozen airfield. Everything just is a bit wabi-sabi sometimes, but I think that's also kind of the beauty of it. Petrolicious: Where do you place yourself in within Porsche today? Are you involved with the brand at all in decision making? Ferdi: I think Porsche still has this kind of family business vibe, even though it's obviously a big company now. We build a lot of cars these days, and so many people work for Porsche, but it still has this energy of being a family brand. Obviously, I have a lot of love for the brand and want to see it thrive. Whenever I can give my two cents on something, I do, but I'm not involved in the day-to-day business. Petrolicious: What advice would you give to a young person with limited resources who wants to get into ice racing or racing in general? Ferdi: It depends on how young you are, but I think you should start in the F.A.T. Karting League. It’s the most meritocratic and a cheaper way to get into racing without losing any of the skill-building opportunities. I would advise any young person to start there and see if they have talent. From there, you can work your way through our completely meritocratic system and fight your way into F4 with us. And if you're looking to buy a car, I think what's cool about the car world is that it's very open. It doesn’t really matter if you buy a $20,000 car, a $10,000 car, if you have no car at all, or a $10 million car. In the end, everybody sits together, has a burger, and is the same because they all share the same passion for cars. Petrolicious: Please tell us more about the karting school. Ferdi: Coming from what we do with F.A.T. and the energy we wanted to bring, it was inspired by all the car events I went to as a kid, many of which felt somewhat stuck up and catered to an older crowd. I wanted to do something a bit more rebellious in that space. When I met [Renowned Formula 1 engineer] Rob Smedley and heard about the karting league and what he has done, building these karts that try to change the whole system by making it more approachable for everybody, it felt like the perfect match. That is why we teamed up and are now bringing it to the whole world. This year, we are bringing it to the U.S. for the first time. In the coming years, we are expanding to Asia and the Middle East. The goal is really to create a platform for everybody to start racing. Obviously, it still comes at a certain price, so it is not yet for everybody, but that is how democratization works. You start at some point and then you try to push it down and down. Petrolicious: So you're on the hunt for a Formula 1 driver then? Ferdi: Yes, we're looking for the first female F1 driver. Petrolicious: Mind if I give you a few rapid fire this or that questions? Ferdi: Lets do it. Petrolicious: Lewis at Ferrari or Mercedes?Ferdi: Lewis at Mercedes. Petrolicious: Stuttgart or Maranello?Ferdi: Stuttgart. Petrolicious: Racing in the desert or racing on the ice?Ferdi: Racing on the ice. Petrolicious: 962 or 917?Ferdi: 962. Petrolicious: Turbo or naturally aspirated?Ferdi: Naturally aspirated. Petrolicious: ST or GT3 Touring?Ferdi: ST. Petrolicious: Gravel or tarmac?Ferdi: Gravel. Many thanks to Ferdi Porsche for sitting down with us for a chat. We'll follow up soon on the noble efforts at F.A.T. Karting with a full story. Continue...",

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "description": "Tesla, which is looking to start sales in India soon, is in talks with carmakers in the country to explore the option of entering into a contract manufacturing arrangement here, according to industry sources. For that, the US-based carmaker has initiated discussions with manufacturers operating below their full capacity. Recently, Tesla also initiated homologation for the Model Y and Model 3 in India. Tesla is in talks with a Japanese and an Indian carmaker It is keen to partner with carmakers operating below full capacity The discussions for contract manufacturing are still in early stages Sources familiar with the developments have revealed that Tesla has approached a Japanese and an Indian carmaker to explore the possibility of utilising their spare capacity. The talks are still in the early stages, and a final agreement will depend on both parties reaching mutually beneficial commercial terms. Meanwhile, Tesla will start India sales by importing its initial models as completely built units, and it does not want to set up a greenfield unit here in the first year itself. If the Elon Musk-led company finalises a contract manufacturing deal with an Indian automaker, it would be the first such endeavour for a US carmaker. Why is Tesla opting for contract manufacturing? Lesser capital investment and quicker time-to-market The company decided to explore contract manufacturing after giving some thought to the other option of setting up a local manufacturing plant under the government’s proposed EV policy. However, this policy requires a minimum investment of $500 million (Rs 4,150 crore) in capacity to secure a lower 15 percent import duty on cars, capped at 8,000 units per annum. Besides, contract manufacturing would reduce capital expenditure and achieve a quicker time-to-market. Amid slowing growth and a significant capacity glut around the world, the company does not want to open an additional manufacturing front to cater to an emerging market. Globally, Tesla has an installed manufacturing capacity of 2.5-3.0 million units across the United States, Germany and China. Tesla likely to focus on brand-building and sales instead Geopolitical developments may have also influenced the decision not to go for local manufacturing initially. Industry experts say that given that a lower duty is on the anvil, it does not make sense for Musk to set up a factory in India. Instead, Tesla will likely focus on brand-building and sales infrastructure, ensuring it reaches its target consumers efficiently. Tesla’s expected positioning in India Midway between mass-market and luxury brands Tesla has the option of sourcing batteries from its gigafactory in Germany for its India operations and is likely to initially introduce its Model 3 and Model Y, with on-road prices expected to exceed Rs 40 lakh ($45,000). These models will cater to the premium segment, positioned right in between the mainstream car market up to Rs 40 lakh and the luxury car market that starts at around Rs 50 lakh, where brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi operate.

    "description": "Several car brands, such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Hyundai, have confirmed upcoming price hikes for their entire model line-ups. Set to take effect starting April 2025, the price increases are claimed to be a result of rising input costs and operational expenses for the carmakers. Maruti Suzuki and Kia to undertake price hikes of up to 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively Tata Motors has yet to specify the maximum price hike for its models The rise in prices will vary depending on the models and their variants Maruti Suzuki price increase in April 2025 Up to 4 percent higher prices Maruti Suzuki usually raises prices by varying degrees across its portfolio, so it remains to be seen which of its models will see the highest 4 percent rise from April, which will be the company’s third price hike this year. In previous instances, prices were increased by up to Rs 32,500 for the Celerio, Brezza, Alto K10, and other models in January and February. Maruti Suzuki hasn’t shared the exact reasons behind its increasing expenditure, but according to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, it may be driven by ballooning raw material costs and supply chain troubles that several automobile manufacturers are currently facing in India. Tata price increase in April 2025 Starting next month, Tata will also undertake price hikes across its full range, depending on the model and variant. The company attributes the price hikes to “rising input costs” but has yet to confirm the extent of the markups. Hyundai price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Hyundai cars like the Creta, Verna, Venue and Tucson will become costlier by up to 3 percent from April onwards. Rising input costs, increased commodity prices and higher operational expenses were some of the reasons cited by the mass-market car brand for the same.  Kia price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Kia has confirmed a price hike of up to 3 percent for its entire model line-up in India, which comprises the Seltos, Sonet, Syros, EV6, EV9, Carens and Carnival. The carmaker cites “rising commodity prices” and “escalating supply chain-related costs” as the reasons. Honda price increase in April 2025 Honda India's Kunal Behl said that effective April, all models, including the Amaze, City, City e:HEV and Elevate, will see a price increase. “Despite efforts to absorb [rising input costs and operational expenses], some price revision has become unavoidable and will be passed on to customers,” he added.
