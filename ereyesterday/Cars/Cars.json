    "description": "My guess is you’ve never heard of this brand of motorcycle before. Well that’s alright, because Brixton is a fairly new brand and hasn’t been around for even a decade. Brixton motorcycles are manufactured in China and are owned by the Austrian KSR group, which owns multiple motorcycle companies, including the old Italian marque Malaguti. They’ve partnered up with Kolhapur-based KAW Veloce Motors who will be assembling these motorcycles in India. While Brixton internationally sells 125cc to 1200cc motorcycles, they’ve been rather bold with launching their 500cc and 1,200cc motorcycles here in India. Brixton Cromwell 1200 performance and handling This was a very quick ride and we were only given 20 minutes on each motorcycle around the parking lot of a hotel in Kolhapur. So this will be more of a first look rather than a review. On paper, the Cromwell 1200 seems quite qualified to take on the competition. It has a 1,222cc in-line twin cylinder motor that produces 83hp at 6,550rpm and 108Nm at 3,100rpm. This motor is mated to a 6-speed gearbox and the bike has a 16-litre fuel tank. It tips the scales at 235kg. Brixton has also been quite generous and added features like traction control, ABS and even cruise control. From the moment I started moving, this motor felt surprisingly engaging and the limited space allotted to experience this motorcycle didn’t quite do justice to it. The strong surge of torque propels you off the line with incredible ferocity and I never had the chance to experience what any of the higher gears felt like. That aside, refinement levels were pretty decent and despite packing in so much performance, the vibrations were reasonably well contained. Unlike its smaller-capacity siblings that come equipped with J.Juan brakes, the Cromwell 1200 gets a set of Nissin calipers that performed surprisingly well, and the brakes provided good feedback for the speeds I did. While there is no hiding the heft of this motorcycle, its Pirelli Phantom Sportscomp tyres performed adequately well and I found myself scraping the pegs more often than not. Unfortunately, I can’t quite comment on the ride quality and outright handling since the location had but one low speed turn. Brixton Cromwell 1200 design and features The speedo is a circular TFT that isn’t too bright, and it's hard to read under direct sunlight. It can also be a little slow to respond at times and the animations aren’t as smooth as I would have liked. You also get an Eco Mode and Sport mode that can be controlled via a mode button. Weirdly enough this isn’t a simple tap-to-change-modes sort of setup, but instead, you’re forced to hold the button for at least five seconds. I tried changing the modes on the move but the button wouldn’t respond. Switchgear quality seems adequate, but it doesn't match the quality levels we’ve come to expect from other premium offerings. In terms of design, the Cromwell 1200 carries a typical silhouette of a modern retro motorcycle; it’s a good looking machine. Currently, the Cromwell 1200 is only available in this shade of Timberwolf Grey, which looks quite sombre. If you take a closer look, the Cromwell 1200 does have some nice looking details sprinkled around. Design elements like the beautiful looking LED headlamp and a knurled finish on the fuel tap cap look exceptional and are sure to catch your attention. Brixton Cromwell 1200 verdict For a price of Rs 7.84 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the Cromwell 1200 makes quite a case for itself. It undercuts its closest rival from Triumph by nearly Rs 4 lakh! It packs punchy performance and a timeless design at a price that’s hard to resist for buyers looking for a large capacity motorcycle on a relatively tight budget. The issue is one of multiple unknowns. There is no brand awareness and we also have no way of knowing what the long-term quality and reliability will be like. Moreover, availability will be very limited with the bike being sold in two cities currently and plans to expand to six by the end of the year. The company intends to address this and hopes to have a considerable footprint across the nation, but it remains to be seen how long that may take. All these are concerns that only time will answer.

    "description": "Chinese electric crossover has been revised ahead of its arrival in the UK. Has it been brought up to scratch? Before we delve into the merits of the Skywell BE11 as a car, let’s consider where its maker comes from.Skywell emerged in China in 2017 as a joint venture between one of the world's largest consumer electronics groups, Skyworth, and electric bus maker Nanjing Golden Dragon.Its cars are now being brought here by Gloucestershire-based importer Innovation Automotive.The BE11 is being introduced as not only Skywell's first car but also its attempt to grab a share of the UK fleet market and rival everything from the Ford Mustang Mach-E to the Skoda Enyaq and Nissan Ariya to the KGM Torres EVX.We initially drove a prototype and, truth be told, we didn't much like it. The steering was too light, the infotainment system was near-unfathomable, the speedometer only showed in KPH and the brakes were spongy.But Skywell has since fitted the BE11 with a new BYD-sourced motor, reduced the wheel size from 20in to 19in, reconfigured the suspension for comfort and downsized the infotainment screen by 2.2in so that users can see the 'start/stop' button once hidden behind it.This, then, is our chance to drive the finished product and find out if this new player has a fighting chance of success in the UK.The Skywell BE11 range at a glanceThe BE11 range is very simple, because there's only one trim level. Two different battery sizes are available: a 72kWh unit offering 248 miles of range and an 86kWh Long Range unit that yields 304 miles. Both are nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) in their chemistry and sit within the car's wheelbase.The single motor powers the front wheels, making 201bhp and 236lb ft of torque, which is good for a 0-62mph time of 9.6sec and a top speed of 93mph. All cars sit on passive suspension with a torsion beam at the rear and there's no option of four-wheel drive.",

    "description": "Does a technically progressive PHEV powertrain work in a coupe that exudes such old-school vibes? If the past decade of automotive history has proved anything, it’s probably that no modern car, however commercially successful it may once have been, can be considered totally timeless.The Mercedes berlinetta coupe, however, has certainly always looked like a timeless design classic. The celebrated line of two-door icons from the firm encompasses the original 1950s ‘gullwing’ sports cars; various larger ‘Ponton’ and ‘Fintail’ models following shortly thereafter; the imposing, square SEC models of the 1980s; the revered W124-generation coupes of the1990s; and even the popular CLK Kompressors of the noughties.And it’s the popularity of the CLK that Mercedes is hoping to rekindle with its latest two-door gambit: the Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe. The firm has, for sizable chunks of recent time, sold as many as three coupe model lines in parallel, not counting its AMG-only models and dedicated convertibles, but now the CLE becomes the only one. The S-Class Coupe died with the C217-gen model in 2020. Meanwhile, the old C-Class- and E-Class Coupe models now find a common successor in this CLE, which splits the difference between those cars with its outright size. For those who like such geekery, this car becomes Mercedes model codename ‘C236’ as a coupe, and ‘A236’ as a cabriolet. It entered production in October 2023, the first right-hand-drive models reaching the UK in spring 2024. It was offered with a choice of four- and six-cylinder petrol engines initially, as well as in turbo six-cylinder AMG 53 form, and can now also be had with the same choice of powerplants as a four-seater cabriolet, if you prefer.The final piece of the puzzle is our test subject, the CLE 300e: the coupe-only, technically progressive, fleet-friendly plug-in hybrid version, which braves the scrutiny of our timing gear in AMG Line Premium Plus model trim.",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mahindra-xuv-3xo-vs-tata-nexon-diesel-comparison-433597#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The newest entrant in the compact SUV space is the Mahindra XUV 3XO, which builds on the strengths of its predecessor, the XUV300, and ups its desirability quotient on account of a new interior, more features and an overall fresher design language. Mahindra’s changes seem to have paid off, as the 3XO has been well received by the market, with waiting periods on the rise. We put the diesel manual version through our real-world tests and, for perspective, compare it to the Tata Nexon diesel – one of the best-sellers in the segment – to find out which is better. The XUV 3XO’s squat stance, larger 17-inch alloys and connected LED tail-lamps give it a more premium look than the 300. However, certain design elements could come across as overdone to some. The Nexon’s sharper styling – the distinct Tata family look, coupé-like roofline and harmonious curves – lends it a more modern look. While both cars are similar in dimensions, the XUV 3XO’s wheelbase is much longer, which translates into more cabin room (more on that later). The Nexon sits slightly higher above the ground with a clearance of 208mm versus the XUV’s 201mm.   Mahindra XUV 3XO interior and seating The XUV 3XO’s cabin certainly looks more upmarket, thanks to a generous use of bright colours and a segment-first panoramic sunroof. Furthermore, soft-touch materials on the dashboard and door cards, as well as the dimpled, leather-wrapped steering, feel high quality – the overall fit and finish are top-notch. On the whole, the Mahindra’s cabin makes you feel like you’ve spent your money well, although it will require more effort to keep clean. Narrow seat, limited thigh support on offer in the Mahindra. The cabin fares well in terms of user-friendliness, too – ergonomics are agreeable, storage areas are well-defined, and the use of proper buttons and knobs makes things easier to use on the move. The driver’s seat, however, isn’t very comfy due to a snug backrest, inadequate thigh support and a cramped footwell, leaving no room for a dead pedal. XUV's longer wheelbase liberates more room. The rear seat experience is much better, though, with a broader seat, a comfier backrest angle and an overall greater sense of space than the Nexon. The shoulder room is good, too, so three abreast will be an easier fit. However, thigh support for the outer passengers will feel inadequate due to the curvy seat base design. What’s nice is that even the middle occupant gets a three-point seat belt as well as an adjustable head restraint. Three abreast comfier here; adjustable headrests, 3-point seat belts for all.   Tata Nexon interior and seating Shifting focus to the Nexon, the dark-coloured cabin hampers its sense of roominess and makes it appear a lot smaller, at least visually. The dashboard sports some modern-looking bits like a floating touchscreen, two-spoke steering wheel and capacitive touch controls for the HVAC system, but these bits are finished in piano black, which is likely to pick up surface scratches and smudge marks easily. Nexon's firm backrest isn’t very comfy. The Nexon continues to be plagued by ergonomic foibles, such as the inconvenient placement of its USB ports deep in a recess and the awkwardly angled bottle holders in the door. The buttons on the thick-rimmed steering protrude out a fair bit, and a wireless charging pad has replaced the front cup holders. Supportive seating in the Nexon, though contoured for two. The front seats have a ventilation function, but the seats are about as narrow as the 3XO’s. Knee and legroom at the rear are tighter, and even though there isn’t any dearth of shoulder room, its back seat seems to be designed to accommodate just two adults, as the thick, concave side bolsters force the outer passengers inward. Also, the middle passenger will have to make peace with the tall central floor hump and protruding air-con console. Adequate shoulder room, but concave shape is not comfy for outer occupants. In terms of boot space, the Nexon’s is a bit larger than the XUV’s, and its loading lip is higher, too. Interestingly, the 3XO only gets a temporary spare tyre (T135/90 R16), which is one of the reasons its boot space is more than that of its predecessor, which had a larger spare. Also, for an otherwise well-equipped car, the 3XO doesn’t get a parcel shelf as standard; it has to be bought as an accessory.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO has a much lower starting point, with its base variant priced at Rs 9.99 lakh – Rs 1 lakh lower than the Nexon’s. For this comparison, we have the XUV 3XO’s second-from-top AX7 variant priced at Rs 13.69 lakh and the Nexon’s fully loaded Fearless +S DT variant, which costs Rs 14.70 lakh. The Nexon’s Fearless variant is priced at Rs 13.70 lakh, but it misses the JBL sound system and the sunroof. The Mahindra also gets a fully loaded AX7 L variant priced at Rs 14.99 lakh, which adds ADAS, a 360-degree camera and an electronic parking brake. Excellent fit and finish and high-quality materials used in the cabin; Wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto didn’t work in test car; Bright colours, large sunroof elevate the cabin’s appeal; Footwell is too cramped in an otherwise user-friendly cabin. The Mahindra doesn’t get ventilated front seats, which the Nexon offers, but even this AX7 variant gets 17-inch alloys (vs Nexon’s 16 inchers) and a panoramic sunroof and rear disc brakes, which the Tata doesn’t get. As far as their user experience, user interface and sound systems go, the Nexon certainly has an edge. The touchscreen feels nicer to use, and the JBL speakerssound more immersive and deliver a better aural experience. In our XUV 3XO test vehicle, many features, such as wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, hadn’t been activated. Even the different sound modes didn’t change the audio experience. Performance is stronger, and acceleration times are better, too; Diesel engine sounds gravelly and coarse at all times; The sound quality of the JBL speakers is excellent; Its dark colour scheme hampers the sense of roominess. What worked better, though, were the XUV’s LED headlamps, which illuminated the road more evenly and had a better spread, too. Interestingly, the Nexon’s 360-degree camera is clearer in the day, but in low-light conditions, the XUV’s two reversing lights brighten up the area better. The Nexon’s single reversing light results in a camera feed that isn’t as clear, although it displays a much wider view. Both the cars are powered by 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel engines mated to 6-speed manual transmissions. But that’s where their similarities end. To meet stringent BS6.2 emissions norms, Tata uses a Lean NOx Trap (LNT) and diesel particulate filter (DPF). It is accompanied by the cost-effective Passive Selective Catalytic Reduction that eliminates the need for a urea tank and an injection system, which are a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The XUV 3XO diesel deploys the latter, which is more expensive as it warrants a separate AdBlue tank and other ancillaries. It also needs regular maintenance as owners have to refill the AdBlue tank at fixed intervals, which is an added cost. Right off the bat, the Mahindra’s diesel feels smoother and more refined. Yes, you can hear some diesel clatter at idle, but the engine note isn’t as coarse or as gravelly as the Tata’s. With 117hp and 300Nm, the XUV’s diesel has the numbers in its favour – 2hp and 40Nm more than the Nexon’s. However, its 1,469kg kerb weight makes it 112kg heavier than the Nexon diesel, which negates its advantage on paper. Like other Mahindras, a crisp throttle response lends it a nice feeling of power each time you dab the accelerator. There is some turbo lag below 1,700rpm, but the gush of torque beyond that makes the XUV sail past slower-moving traffic with ease. The Tata’s engine feels stronger, thanks to its lighter kerb weight and more aggressive power delivery. Turbo lag is also managed better, and the drive modes, which transform the way the Nexon behaves, make a significant difference. In ‘Eco’ mode, it feels starved of power in the interest of efficiency. However, dial it to ‘Sport’ mode, and the Nexon sprints forward with gusto. In our tests, both cars were neck and neck when accelerating from 0kph to 100, but in rolling acceleration, the Nexon leaves the XUV trailing by a significant margin in every gear. So, while the Nexon diesel impresses with its performance, refinement isn’t its strong suit. The gravelly diesel note gets progressively louder as you spin this engine harder.   The Mahindra XUV 3XO gets an automatic engine stop-start system to save fuel while idling, whereas the Nexon gets an Eco drive mode to abate fuel consumption. In our real-world test, the Nexon’s 1.5-litre diesel delivered an average fuel efficiency of 18kpl, which is 2.5kpl higher than what the XUV 3XO diesel achieved. In the city, the Nexon bettered the XUV’s number by 3kpl, delivering 16.5kpl. On the highway, the Nexon returned 19.4kpl in our tests, 2kpl better than the Mahindra. Also see: Mahindra XUV 3XO real-world fuel economy tested, explained Tata Nexon real-world fuel economy tested, explained Typical of a Mahindra, the XUV 3XO’s underpinnings feel tough. It soaks up harsh blows from bad roads with an added layer of cushioning, resulting in a plush low-speed ride, although the suspension can get quite loud while at work. At highway speeds, too, the XUV feels planted, and while vertical movement is greater than the Nexon’s, body movements aren’t to the point of feeling uncomfortable. There are steering modes on offer in the XUV 3XO that alter the weight and resistance of the electric power steering, and while ‘Sport’ mode makes the steering unnaturally heavy, ‘Comfort’ feels light and effortless, which is what most users are likely to prefer. While on the topic of user-friendliness, the clutch pedal doesn’t warrant any more effort than the Nexon’s, and even though its gearbox has long throws, it feels smoother and easier to slot into gates. The XUV gets rear disc brakes (the Nexon gets drums at the rear), so despite being 112kg heavier, in our panic braking tests from 80kph to a standstill, it stopped at a shorter distance. XUV’s suspension tackles bad roads with an added layer of cushioning; The Nexon is sportier to drive, and high-speed stability is excellent. The Nexon feels sportier thanks to sharper steering, a tighter chassis and an overall stiffer suspension setup. Its structure feels inherently robust, and it shrugs off bad roads and does so in a quieter manner. What’s also nice is that the Nexon remains glued to the road at highway speeds, and the body roll is well in check. However, since its suspension isn’t as absorbent as the XUV’s, passengers in the Nexon are likely to feel sharp body movements over rough sections of road, especially at city speeds.     The Tata Nexon brings a lot to the table, such as a spacious cabin, a long list of features, and a fantastic infotainment and audio experience. And besides feeling tough, it boasts a 5-star Global NCAP crash-test rating. The 3XO has scored five stars, too. What’s more, the Nexon’s strong diesel engine makes it both quicker and much more fuel-efficient than the Mahindra XUV 3XO. However, the XUV 3XO’s diesel engine is far ahead on smoothness and refinement; its driving controls are lighter, and ride quality in the city is plusher. A generous use of bright colours and higher-quality materials make its interiors feel more upmarket, too. Yes, it misses ventilated front seats, a very popular feature these days, but it makes up for it with others like a panoramic sunroof and ADAS (on the AX7 L), for a price very close to the Nexon’s. In summary, while the Nexon has strong fundamentals, it is the Mahindra that feels more polished and upmarket, and that’s why it wins this comparison test. Test scorecardMetricXUV 3XONexonCommentsComfort8/107/10The Mahindra has a comfier back seat, and ergonomics are more user-friendly. The Nexon’s front seats are better, though.Performance7/109/10Not only is the Nexon much quicker in terms of acceleration, but it is also much more fuel-efficient than the XUV.Refinement9/107/10The Tata’s diesel engine clatter is audible and sounds coarse, too.

    "description": "A motorcycle like the 1974 Ducati 750SS simply couldn’t be manufactured and sold today, and it’s a small miracle that it even passed in the 1970s. A barely homologated version of Ducati’s Desmo L-twin road racer, the 750SS was finicky, raw and probably illegal for road use in most places with its fiberglass fuel tank, Conti megaphones and unfiltered 40 mm Dell’Orto pumper carburetors. Just 401 examples were built from late 1973 into 1974, and these ‘green frame’ 750s are regarded as one of the most significant and desirable production Ducatis ever built. The story has been told time and time again, about how Paul Smart and Bruno Spaggiari accomplished a legendary 1-2 finish at the inaugural Imola 200 in 1972, catapulting Ducati to new heights globally.…",

Style and quality rank high, but so does usability—especially when it comes to tech accessories. Adding a gadget to your arsenal should enhance your riding experience, not hinder it. That goes as much for how easy it is to set up, as for whether it blends with the rest of your get-up or sticks out like a sore thumb. All that counts for double when you’re evaluating a Bluetooth comms system like the Cardo Packtalk Pro.

    "description": "A year and a half back, we broke the news that Royal Enfield was working on a new model called the Scram 440. Internally codenamed D4K, this project is now ready and has been revealed at the 2024 Motoverse festival. Bigger engine with improved performance Minimal chassis, visual changes Royal Enfield Scram 440 details The biggest talking point is that the engine has now been upgraded from 411cc to 443. This has been achieved via a bore increase of 3mm. Power and torque have climbed from 24.3hp at 6,500rpm and 32Nm at 4,250rpm to 25.4hp at 6,250rpm and 34Nm at 4,000rpm. Another big change is that the bike now gets a 6-speed gearbox, and Royal Enfield says it has also worked on reducing the clutch effort. Other changes include refinements in the SOHC valvetrain system, which RE says will result in reduced noise. Chassis-wise, the changes are far fewer, although the company says the chassis has been strengthened in certain areas and that the bike is now capable of carrying a top box. Ground clearance is the same 200mm, and suspension travel has not changed either – 190mm at the front and 180 at the rear. Seat height has also remained at 795mm. However, the company says it has improved the braking performance by moving to a bigger piston for the front brake caliper. Kerb weight has gone up by around 2 kilos, and the bike weighs 196kg with the 15-litre fuel tank filled. Like with the existing Scram 411, the bike will come with a 19-inch/17-inch wheel setup, but this time around, Royal Enfield has incorporated numerous features based on customer feedback. The first of these is that now, there is a choice of tubeless tyres and alloy wheels, although the spoked wheels continue to be on offer. The company has also incorporated switchable ABS, which was missed on the older Scram. Visually, not a lot has changed, apart from fresh colour schemes and a new LED headlamp borrowed from the rest of RE’s line-up. The display is the same digi-analogue unit as before, and a tripper navigation pod can be selected as an optional extra. The switchgear remains conventional, unlike the rotary-style switches seen in most of RE’s line-up.   The Scram 440 will launch in January 2025, and it will be available in two variants. The top Force model gets alloy wheels and tubeless tyres, while the Trail version continues with spoked wheels. The current Scram 411 is priced between Rs 2.06 and Rs 2.12 lakh, and we expect the new bike to be priced similarly, perhaps with a small increase. Also see: Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350 unveiled",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

But wherever there’s a great road, there’s likely to be a patrol car silently keeping order. Between 1968 and 1974, Japan’s expressways were policed by one of the coolest: the Porsche 912.

However, the interior fared a bit worse and seemed to step back in time with the seventh generation.",

    "description": "VinFast has officially launched its second model inside the United States, the three-row and all-electric VF9. Following the VF8 into the market, the VF9 arrives with an MSRP far lower than initially claimed and range estimates that should make it fairly competitive. The only problem is that the VF8 was kind of a disaster. Models handed to reviewers were riddled with issues, necessitating a smoother launch for the VF9 if the company has any hope of becoming relevant on our market.",
