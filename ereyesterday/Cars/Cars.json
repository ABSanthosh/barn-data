    "description": "For buyers who crave the thrill of a sports car without giving up the space and practicality of a sedan, the BMW M340i has always been an enticing option. While its blistering performance and attractive pricing made it a standout, its stiff suspension often compromised everyday comfort. With the 2025 update, BMW has addressed that concern in a big way. 2025 BMW M340i performance, ride and handling Now gets Adaptive M Suspension Adjustable damper settings transform the way this M340i behaves. The headline change? The addition of Adaptive M Suspension, previously exclusive to the now-discontinued X3 M40i in India. This system allows drivers to toggle between firmer or softer shock absorber settings at the push of a button, transforming the car’s ride quality. Yes, the 19-inch wheels and run-flat tyres still make it firmer than the standard long-wheelbase 3 Series, but in Comfort mode, the ride is significantly more forgiving than the outgoing model. Switch to Sport mode, and the M340i tightens up dramatically, delivering the razor-sharp agility and direct steering feel you would expect from a performance sedan. The new flat-bottomed steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock marker enhances the sporty vibe further. The ride quality is softer and far more forgiving than before.   Retains 374hp, 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The M340i retains its B58 3-litre 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, which makes 374hp and 500Nm. Those who have experienced the earlier iterations of the M340i will quickly point out that this unit is much quieter, especially in Eco and Normal drive modes. The engine sound, though, is prominently amplified by the cabin speakers in Sport and Sport Plus, and with BMW’s ‘iconic sounds’ turned on, you will also hear occasional crackles from the M exhaust. Yes, the sound is synthesised, but this 6-cylinder mill sounds sweet when revved hard. The 3-litre, 6-cyl unit is quieter than before; performance remains explosive.   0-100kph comes up in 4.39 seconds 2025 BMW M340i performance as testedAcceleration Time0-20kph0.70s0-40kph1.31s0-60kph2.14s0-80kph3.16s0-100kph4.39s0-120kph5.96s0-140kph7.75s20-80kph (kickdown)3.00s40-100kph (kickdown)3.39s The best bit is that performance remains explosive. In our performance tests, it sprints from 0 to 100kph in merely 4.39 seconds, and it hits 200kph rather effortlessly. Also, it retains the 48-Volt mild hybrid system, which facilitates a rather seamless automatic engine stop-start function to reduce fuel consumption while idling.  Complementing this engine is a fantastic 8-speed torque converter automatic, which transmits power to all four wheels. Besides being smooth and quick, it is a rather clever transmission, and you’ll seldom find this powertrain caught off guard when you put your foot down. For manual control, though, it gets paddle shifters, which certainly elevate driver engagement. 2025 BMW M340i exterior and interior New colour option and alloy wheels New blacked-out 19-inch alloys and red brake calipers look sporty. With this update, the M340i gets two new paint options, one of them being Arctic Race Blue, as seen on the test car. It also gets new blacked-out alloys as well as red brake calipers. Changes to the interior are minimal, with the most prominent ones being the new flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker and redesigned central air vents – though the latter feels flimsy to operate. The curved touchscreen now features an updated software interface, but it still feels cluttered with too many apps, making it unintuitive. Redesigned air vents feel flimsy in operation; flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker looks racy.   2025 BMW M340i price and verdict Rs 6 lakh more expensive than the 2023 model At Rs 74.90 lakh, this iteration is nearly Rs 6 lakh pricier than the 2023 version. However, the newly added Adaptive M suspension justifies this price premium. It has transformed this car’s character, making it more comfortable than before without hampering driver engagement. With stonking performance, adequate cabin room, a 480-litre boot and a decent standard kit, the M340i exerts serious appeal. If you love to drive and are in the market for a daily driver within Rs 1 crore, your search should end here.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/porsche-macan-turbo-electric-review-as-close-as-it-gets-to-ice-434892#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "It’s an SUV that doesn’t just drive brilliantly ‘for an SUV’, but one that, in true Porsche fashion, drives brilliantly, period. It’s a defining moment for Porsche and a risky one, too. The legendary German sports car maker has taken a proven and successful formula, torn it up and rewritten it – with lithium. Porsche has electrified its bestselling Macan, which, since its debut in 2014, has been the compact performance SUV benchmark. But, with a pair of motors replacing engines, including the much-loved V6, and a heavy battery pack slung underneath the floor, the question is, does the Macan Electric still feel like a proper Porsche? The litmus, er, lithium test is a quick dash to Mahabaleshwar. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric platform and exterior Built on the PPE base It’s important to note that the Macan Electric has nothing in common with its combustion-powered predecessors. Porsche has ditched the ICE platform and moved to the all-new Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which has been co-developed with Audi. Without the constraints of an engine up front, designers had a freer hand in the styling, but yet, from the outside, the Macan Electric is unmistakably a Macan. Signature four-point DRLs look great. The signature four-point LED daytime running lamps remain, but the full-width rear light bar is now slimmer and more pronounced. A key differentiator is the Macan EV’s proportions. The lowered nose, short overhangs, longer wheelbase (up by 86mm), and slightly wider track help improve aerodynamics (down to a slippery 0.25Cd) while giving it a more hunkered-down look. The Taycan-inspired front end and the subtly integrated active aerodynamics (including adaptive air curtains and a deployable rear spoiler) mark it out as a performance SUV even before you step inside. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric interior features Three screen-layout shared with Panamera The interior remains reassuringly familiar and is unmistakably Porsche – superbly built and driver-focused. Material quality is top-notch, with leather, brushed aluminium and soft-touch plastics that deliver a premium ambience. However, the gloss-black surfaces are prone to fingerprints. Infotainment is intuitive, logical and easy to navigate. The driving position remains spot on, thanks to 18-way adjustable front seats, which offer fantastic support and even a massage function – a first for the Macan. Dominating the dashboard is a trio of screens similar to the Panamera: a 12.6-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the centre, and an optional passenger display of the same size – a Rs 1 lakh upgrade. It’s a crisp, clean and well-integrated layout, maintaining the minimalist elegance Porsche is known for. The infotainment system is superb – logically laid out, sharp in resolution and not overrun with an excess of apps. Apple CarPlay is not wireless Porsche has also struck a happy balance between digital screens and physical controls. Unlike many rivals that have gone fully touchscreen, the Macan retains some key physical buttons – most notably for climate control. This ensures that adjusting basic settings remains easy and intuitive. However, there are some surprising omissions. Wireless Apple CarPlay, a feature expected at this price point, is absent and requires a wired connection. This wouldn’t be a major issue if not for the awkwardly placed USB-C ports on the left side of the centre console, which are hidden from view and difficult to access in the right-hand-drive versions. The rear seat isn’t particularly generous despite a longer wheelbase. Also, the rear seats, while benefiting from the Macan Electric’s 86mm longer wheelbase, aren’t particularly generous. The legroom is decent, but the high window line, coupled with the sloping roof, gives the back a slightly claustrophobic feel. Taller passengers will find headroom just adequate, and the knee-up seating position – common in EVs due to battery packaging – is noticeable but not objectionable. The panoramic sunroof helps brighten things up, but the Macan remains more of a driver’s car than a rear-seat-friendly SUV. The small 84-litre frunk is useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. With no engine up front, the Macan Electric offers a small 84-litre frunk – useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. The rear boot is well-shaped and reasonably spacious at 480 litres in the Turbo variant, though lower-spec models offer a more generous 540 litres. Folding the rear seats expands cargo capacity. Overall, the Macan Electric’s cabin stays true to Porsche’s ethos – driver-focused, high-quality and functional – without succumbing entirely to the touch-only trend that plagues many modern EVs. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric performance and ride 0-100kph takes 3.3 seconds Four drive modes on offer. The Macan Electric has debuted in India with the top-of-the-line Turbo, which has a dual-motor, all- wheel-drive setup. Lower variants like the Macan 4 and Macan 4S with rear-wheel drive are yet to be available. Straight-line performance is where the Macan Turbo Electric feels utterly ballistic. With up to 639hp and 1,130Nm of torque, it delivers the kind of acceleration – the claimed 0 to 100kph time is 3.3 seconds – that can humble supercars. Engage Sport+ mode, activate launch control, and the Macan Electric catapults forward as if fired out of a cannon. 260kph top speed While some EVs struggle to sustain their initial surge, the Macan Electric maintains its ferocity well beyond the first few seconds, and given the space, the Turbo can crack 250kph. Porsche’s sophisticated thermal management ensures that performance remains consistent, even after repeated hard acceleration runs. As a result, the performance is always effortless, relentless and completely addictive. Macan EV perfectly balances performance and practicality, making for a great daily driver. And it’s not just heart-stopping acceleration that is the Macan Electric’s forte. Like most high-powered EVs, it blends performance with daily usability. Unlike high-strung ICE-powered performance SUVs that tend to feel jerky and restless in traffic, the Macan Electric is buttery smooth. Thanks to the absence of a traditional gearbox and the instant torque delivery of its electric motors, crawling through traffic is smooth and seamless. Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable However, despite this city-friendly character, the ride remains firmly on the stiffer side. It isn’t uncomfortable, but there’s no escaping the underlying firmness, particularly at low speeds. Comfort- seekers may find this a little intrusive, but Porsche enthusiasts will appreciate the taut setup. Road noise also creeps into the cabin, especially at speed over coarse tarmac, which slightly dampens the otherwise refined experience. On the patchy NH66, which has bumpy concrete surfacing for most parts, it’s deafeningly obvious that Porsche hasn’t been generous with sound insulation, but that’s more to do with saving weight than saving money. The sound I do like is the synthesised ‘engine’ growl that’s electronically induced. It’s neither obtrusive nor over the top – just enough to add a layer of aural engagement without feeling forced. In contrast to some artificial, gimmicky EV soundtracks, Porsche has taken a more subtle approach. 591km claimed range Battery-cooling fan kicks up a dust storm. Range anxiety is often a concern with EVs, but the Macan Turbo Electric has addressed this with a large 100kWh battery, of which 95kWh is useable. After a full day of spirited driving, including high-speed runs and a 4,500-foot elevation climb, it still had 31% charge remaining. Given its claimed 591km range, the battery’s real-world performance is reassuring. Charging speed is where the Macan Electric truly shines. Thanks to its 800-volt system, it can charge at up to 270kW, but the challenge is finding such high-speed chargers in India, where the fast-charging network mainly consists of 30kW to 60kW units. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric handling Sharp and precise steering The steering is sharp and precise, with a level of feedback that most EVs lack. One of the biggest challenges in transitioning to an electric platform is weight, and at nearly 400kg heavier than the Macan GTS, the Macan Electric isn’t exactly light. Yet, you’d never guess it from the way it handles. On the twisty Ambenali Ghat, the Macan Electric is an absolute delight to thread through corners. It’s quick to change direction and delivers an uncanny sense of precision despite its mass. Performance is effortless and completely addictive.  Its near-perfect 48:52 front-to-rear weight distribution and strong rear motor create a rear-engine-like balance, allowing it to rotate beautifully into corners, and with the traction control off, it’s easy to get the tail out for some sideways action. The rear-axle steering (a costly but worthwhile option at Rs 2.70 lakh) further enhances its dynamic prowess, making it feel far smaller and nimbler than its size suggests. Grip levels and the overall body control are outstanding, thanks to a low centre of gravity courtesy of the floor-mounted battery. The all-wheel-drive system ensures unwavering stability, even when pushing hard. The Macan Electric is quick to change direction despite its mass. The steering is one of the best in any EV – sharp, precise and with a level of feedback most electric cars lack. It’s on the heavier side at parking speeds, but that’s a small price to pay for its dynamic edge. Regen braking does not feel aggressive Porsche has also nailed the braking feel. Unlike many EVs with an artificial, grabby ‘regenerative’ braking sensation, the Macan Electric’s brakes feel natural and progressive. There are no paddles to manually adjust regen on the fly – just two settings, ‘on’ and ‘off’, which can be accessed via the touchscreen or assigned to a shortcut key on the steering wheel. When engaged, the regen remains mild and unobtrusive, ensuring smooth and predictable deceleration rather than aggressive one-pedal driving. True to Porsche’s philosophy, the Macan Electric is tuned to feel like a proper driver’s car, recovering energy efficiently without compromising its dynamic character. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric price and verdict Macan Electric isn’t just an electrified version of a traditional SUV but more of a sports car engineered into an SUV body. The Macan Turbo Electric isn’t just another fast electric SUV; it’s a true Porsche. It feels natural, intuitive and engaging in a way that many EVs don’t. It doesn’t come across as an electrified version of a traditional SUV but rather a sports car engineered into an SUV body. Sure, it lacks the mechanical soul of an ICE – the visceral sound of an engine, the ebb and flow of power, and the rhythm of shifting gears – but it makes up for it with instant torque, razor-sharp responses and a level of precision that set it apart. Yes, the rear seats could be more spacious, but none of that matters when you’re behind the wheel. What matters is that this EV delivers the same thrilling experience as its petrol-powered predecessor, and in some ways, even better. Like most Porsches, the Macan Turbo Electric, too, is pricey, at Rs 1.68 crore. But that won’t stop many Porsche aficionados from queuing up for one.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/trump-announces-25-tariff-all-cars-imported-us",
    "description": "President claims new levy on all cars and car parts shipped into country will create \"tremendous growth\" for US A new tariff of 25% will be imposed on all cars and car parts imported into the United State, president Donald Trump has announced. This new levy will come into effect from 2 April, and will apply both to finished machines shipped into the country and car parts imported for vehicles assembled there. President Trump claimed the tariffs would lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the US auto industry, adding that it would create more investment for US-baed car makers and therefore more jobs. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said \"this is very exciting\", adding: “What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff for all cars that are not made in the United States.” Around eight million cars were imported into the US last year, around half the total number of machines sold in the market. Mexico will be the biggest country hit by the new levy. Car makers with production there include BMW, Ford, Nissan, Volkswagen, and Toyota all have plants. The US's other top importers are Canada, Germany, Japan and South Korea Trump confirmed that the new laws were \"permanent\", quashing any notion that they would be reversed. But he stated that \"if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff\". The likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen already have plants in the US, building key models for both the US and other global markets. BMW's Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, for example, builds the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and XM. It will be hit, however, as it builds and imports the 3 Series from Mexico for the US market. Some car firms have announced investment to expand or open new US facilities in recent months in an effort to spread production globally and avoid tariffs. The Hyundai Motor Group, for example, have invested more than £16bn to increase its vehicle production in the country, including a new steel manufacturing plant. The news will likely come as a big blow to the likes of JLR, which has seen an increase in Range Rover and Defender sales over recent years. Other car makers targetting the US which don't have factories across the Atlantic include Cupra – although its models could be manufactured at other Volkswagen Group brand facilities in the US – and Lotus. However, the move could also impact domestic US car makers and firms that currently manufacture vehicles there. GM, for example, manufactures a number of vehicles and car parts in Canada, China and Mexico that it then imports into the US, and those machines and parts would be hit by the tariffs. The announcement has been dubbed \"dissapointing\" by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the trade body, called for UK and US representatives to \"come together immediately and strike a deal that works for all\". \"The UK and US auto industries have a long-standing and productive relationship, with US consumers enjoying vehicles built in Britain by some iconic brands, while thousands of UK motorists buy cars made in America. \"Rather than imposing additional tariffs, we should explore ways in which opportunities for both British and American manufacturers can be created as part of a mutually beneficial relationship, benefitting consumers and creating jobs and growth across the Atlantic.\" Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said the bloc will study the latest announcement, adding: \"I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports.  \"As I have said before, tariffs are taxes - bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union.  \"The automotive industry is a driver of innovation, competitiveness, and high quality jobs, through deeply integrated supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\" This new tariff is the latest in a wave of levys introduced by president Trump since he took office for the second time. He said he wants to protect businesses and manufacturers in America.",

    "description": "Hyper Force concept shown in 2023 hinted at the next iteration of the GT-R In fresh hint at the GT-R's return, new CEO vows to keep models 'that really represent what Nissan is about' Incoming Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa has vowed that “driving excitement will always be at the heart” of the firm, hinting that halo cars such as the Z and GT-R will remain a key part of the brand’s future – and be offered worldwide. The current R35-generation GT-R will finally be discontinued shortly, having been in production since 2007. However, it hasn't been offered in Europe for several years, due to emission regulations. Nor has the Z. Asked about the importance of performance cars to Nissan, Espinosa said: “Driving excitement will always be at the heart of Nissan. This is what we do. \"There are many, many ways of explaining and showing to the world what this means, starting from the Z, which is affordable and fun to drive, to the GT-R, or even the Patrol [SUV]. “These will remain, for sure. I want to have four or five cars at the top of our portfolio that are really brand-oriented, cars that really represent what Nissan is about and show what the heartbeat of Nissan is. And these cars should go everywhere in the world. \"We keep the dream alive of what driving excitement is for. We will invest in signature Nissan models to deliver strong nameplates. Vehicles are the heartbeat of Nissan – and that includes sports cars, where we have very exciting plans.” In 2023, Nissan revealed the Hyper Force concept, which previewed an electric GT-R successor, but Espinosa previously told Autocar that such a car had to wait until electric car technology was ready. Asked if the firm has made any progress on that, Espinosa said the current electrification transition makes things “difficult” but “in a couple years, as the regulations start converging into more electrified powertrains, it might be easier to do this. This is what I will dream of doing.”",

For that reason, I always seek out the understated ones; bottles that look like they could have been in circulation when your grandpa was still on the sauce. Maybe you’ll find one of his old favorites. A project of the 2020 lockdowns, Brain Brew’s Dexter Three Wood straight bourbon is far from that, but its simple label exudes quiet confidence, and Edmund Dexter’s face on the bottle looks fit for a dollar bill. It also came highly recommended by the local liquor store owner, so color me sold. What’s in a Name The personality behind the spirit is Edmund Dexter, apparently a prolific 1800s bourbon blender who entertained the likes of author Charles Dickens and the future King Edward at his home in Cincinnati — or so the bottle says.…",

Working as NamiXII Design from Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan, he creates everything from furniture and sculptures to trophies. More importantly, he also builds radical 70s-style choppers. The last time we checked in with Fo, he wowed us with a wildly chopped Yamaha SR400. This time he’s back with an equally bodacious chopper on a very different foundation—a 2022-model Harley-Davidson Low Rider S. Dyna cultists must have felt cheated when The Motor Co. re-released the Low Rider S on their newer Softail platform. But the truth is, the contemporary Low Rider S is a total hoot to ride. Its 117 ci Milwaukee-Eight engine is a peach, and its chassis is vastly better than that of its predecessor.…",

    "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar NS160 has been updated for 2025 with ABS modes. Although the brand has not officially launched the model, it has already arrived at its dealerships. The updated Bajaj Pulsar NS160 has not been launched officially It features a new mode button to cycle between three ABS modes Bajaj Pulsar NS160: What’s new? It gets three ABS modes to cycle between. The ABS modes were earlier added to the updated RS200. Now, Bajaj has plucked this feature straight out of the RS200 and updated the NS160 with it. The ABS has three modes (Rain, Road, and Off-Road), and it alters the anti-lock braking system’s intervention depending on the mode. There is now a new Mode button to toggle through the different ABS modes.  In terms of design, this update has not brought along any aesthetic changes, and the Pulsar NS160 remains similarly styled as its elder sibling, the NS200. Although both motorcycles received a design and hardware update back in 2023, the updates were modest. The revisions included an upside-down front fork, a bigger 300mm front rotor, a gear position indicator and distance to empty. All these changes were common between the NS160 and NS200.  Powering the Bajaj Pulsar NS160 is an oil-cooled, single-cylinder, 160.3cc engine that comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. This motor produces 17.2hp and 14.6Nm. While the updated NS160 has already made its way to dealerships, Bajaj hasn’t officially launched this update or announced any prices thus far. It remains to be seen if the brand gives the NS160 a slight price hike or keeps the price unchanged when it finally launches it.  Image source: Power Engine world (YouTube) Also see: Bajaj Pulsar NS 200, NS 160 review: Keeping it fresh",

    "description": "It’s been a particularly troubled few months for Japanese carmaker Nissan as it navigates through financial distress, failed talks to form an alliance with Honda and a significant change in top leadership. The company recently invited select worldwide media to an event at its headquarters in Yokohama, Japan, where it shared details on upcoming product plans as well as other strategies to correct its course. Autocar India was a part of this event, and here’s what we learned. Nissan global recovery plan  New products, market-specific strategies The new Nissan Leaf EV (centre) is one of the new models for international markets. Chief performance officer Guillaume Cartier acknowledged the gravity of the situation, stating, “We recognise that the challenge is both external and internal and are working towards reducing our fixed cost in order to be profitable.” Cartier also mentioned how the competition has outpaced Nissan in some cases and how the company is not quick enough in certain markets, citing how it is missing out on the hybrid market in North America and the EV market in China as examples. Cartier also pointed out how new products are central to raising revenue. He elaborated that Nissan would now take on a twofold approach – to redefine its market strategy and to create market-specific strategies for different parts of the world. North America and China key markets for Nissan Following this, the current chief planning officer and soon-to-be chief executive officer (from April 1), Ivan Espinosa, revealed that the company will release several new and refreshed ICE vehicles and hybrids, as well as new EVs. He further stated Nissan’s two key markets, North America and China, are due to receive a multitude of fresh and updated models over the next two years. China, in particular, will get EV models that are being developed specifically for it. Two of these cars will be revealed very soon. New Nissan launches for India Nissan midsize SUV, compact MPV to join line-up Nissan’s Triber-based MPV and Duster-based SUV for India. India might not appear to rank as high on the priority list, with just two models currently on sale (Magnite and X-Trail), but it is an important market nonetheless. The Magnite has been a life-saver of sorts for Nissan in India, and it has not only been popular in terms of domestic sales but is also exported to over 65 countries in both RHD and LHD guises. Nissan has revealed that it plans to bolster the Indian line-up with two more models. The first will be a compact MPV based on the Renault Triber that will go on sale in FY25, while the second will be a new midsize SUV based on the new Renault Duster, itself long overdue, and it will be launched in India in FY26. This will be a more visually differentiated product from its platform sibling and will be launched at around the same time as when the Duster also goes on sale in our market. There is also expected to be a three-row derivative of the midsize SUV further down the line, which will be based on the Renault Bigster, which recently made its debut with a Dacia badge. Nissan EV for India a challenge As for EVs, the company said it is evaluating options for India but cited challenges in the form of tax and duty structures as well as localisation complications with the batteries. In 2023, the Japanese brand had plans to launch an entry-level EV based on the Renault Kwid’s CMF-A platform, but there has been no update on this model. However, Nissan is keen to expand its export potential from India, with the Magnite soon to be exported to additional markets, starting with Mexico. The upcoming midsize SUV for India will also be exported.  Multiple powertrains under development Nissan’s new Micra EV. On a broad scale, the company said it is keen to keep its options open, with plans to diversify its ICE, hybrid and EV powertrains. There are upcoming products based on the company’s latest, third-generation ‘e-Power’ range-extender hybrid powertrain, which is said to be quieter, more refined and more efficient. Nissan has also shown off some exciting new EVs. First, there’s the third-gen Leaf based on the company’s new EV platform, which underpins the new Juke EV. Then, there’s the reborn Micra, which uses the CMF-B EV platform from the recently launched Renault R5. These products are mainly for European, North American and Japanese markets and aren’t currently on the cards for India. Future Nissan technologies Nissan solid state batteries developed inhouse Nissan also shared some details on future technology platforms that are under development. Interestingly, the company said it plans to begin testing its own solid-state batteries on public roads in FY2026 and intends to start sales of EVs equipped with these batteries by FY2028. The company has been working on its solid-state battery technology from as far back as the mid-2010s, and it has some ambitious targets in terms of promised capabilities. These include a high energy density of 1000Wh/L, exceptional heat resistance and a 5-minute quick-charge time for topping it up from 0 to 65 percent. Next gen Nissan EV batteries to be smaller, safer Nissan's premium brand Infiniti's future US line-up teased. The company also plans to make its batteries cobalt-free and stated that it stands out from rivals by using a lithium anode instead of graphene. The advantage of this is a higher energy density, but it comes at the cost of being more difficult to engineer. Nissan said it has made some breakthroughs in terms of safety and has come up with a novel way of maintaining pressure on the pack to avoid density changes during charging and discharging – which can lead to serious safety concerns. The company didn’t go into more detail about this proprietary technology but told us it is about 70 percent more compact than existing mechanical spring or motor-driven solutions.  Nissan has already started a pilot plant within its Yokohama facilities to study how to ramp up the production for this battery technology. The company told us that according to publicly available data, their solid-state battery solution is superior to what else is currently being developed. This technology could be a significant breakthrough if Nissan can stick to the promised timeline. Nissan ADAS and self-driving tech Of course, like many other manufacturers, Nissan is also working on self-driving technology, but it does seem to be a bit behind the curve. Executives told us that the focus right now is not to take on technology leaders like Tesla but to refine the current Level 2 capabilities available in cars on sale in international markets before moving to Level 3. However, the company has some interesting long-term plans for fully self-driving vehicles, with intentions to have some on the road in Yokohama by around FY2026, expansion of this to more regions by FY2027-28 and a foray into commercial vehicles like buses by FY2029-30.  Nissan future global plans are clear, transparent This event showcased the fact that Nissan’s new leadership is making a shift in the way the company does things – and how it is willing to share those details with the public. Nissan certainly has challenging times ahead, but it also appears to be armed with a number of interesting upcoming vehicles – many of which were shown to us but on the condition that we can’t talk about them. While Nissan shared little about financials, the company was open about the fact that it has now revised its focus on increasing speed and bringing costs down. Hopefully, all these moves will give this iconic Japanese brand the push it needs to regain the lost ground.
