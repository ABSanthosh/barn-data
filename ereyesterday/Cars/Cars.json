    "description": "This 1967 Porsche 910 is the first of 28 coupes built during a single year of production and is among 12 examples initially built with power from a 2.0L magnesium-case flat-six. Chassis 910001 made its debut as part of the factory works effort with Hans Herrmann at the wheel in the Trento Bondone Hill Climb in July 1966 en route to one of four top-three finishes in as many European Hill Climb Championship starts that year. In 1968, the car was sold to Porsche works driver Rudi Lins, who campaigned it in endurance races through a 1968 season that was highlighted by a class win and fourth-place finish overall in the 1000km Monza. It was subsequently registered for street use in Austria by Lins in 1969 before being sold to theater costume supply heir Lambert Hofer, who continued to campaign it through 1970 with support from Bosch Racing in races throughout the UK and Europe. The car was sold by Hofer in 1994 to the seller’s father, who commissioned refurbishment work that began in the early 2000s and was later resumed and completed between 2014 and 2019. Work during the project included an engine overhaul, repair and alignment of the tube frame, a repaint of the fiberglass bodywork in white with a red nose accent, rebuilds of the running gear, and the removal of various modifications made over the car’s life. Additional features include Bosch mechanical fuel injection with a single-row pump, slide throttles, twin-plug ignition, a five-speed manual transaxle, coilover suspension, 13” center-lock magnesium wheels, and fiberglass bucket seats with red and black cloth over the driver’s side. After its completion, the car appeared at the 2019 Schloss Dyck Classic Days and in 2022 was imported to the US, where it appeared at the 2024 Greenwich Concours d’Elegance and the 2024 Amelia Werks Reunion. This 910 is now offered in Charlotte, North Carolina, by the owner’s son on behalf of the owner, who is located in Germany, with a 207-page book outlining the car’s history and documentation, an FIA Historic Technical Passport, the original Austrian registration, US import documentation, and German registration in the current owner’s name.",

    "description": "This 2007 Porsche 911 997.1 GT3 RS is one of 410 examples built for the US market during a two-year production run. It is finished in black with orange accents over black upholstery, and power is provided by a 3.6-liter flat-six that was rebuilt in 2024 with a replacement crankshaft, rod bearings, drive belt, and pinned coolant lines. Shifting is through a six-speed manual transaxle, and the clutch and flywheel were replaced at the time of the engine rebuild. The car features a limited-slip differential, 19” wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, an adjustable rear wing, a removable roll cage, a center muffler delete, and hard-back sport seats. It was previously listed on BaT in November 2020 before it was acquired by the current owner in 2021 and listed again on BaT in August 2022. This 997.1 GT3 RS has 6k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment in Oregon with a window sticker, an owner's manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",

    "description": "Audi's class-defining upmarket hatchback gets a fresh look and some new digital technology The Audi A3 was the original premium hatchback and it now has more than 25 years and several model generations of success behind it. It remains Audi UK's biggest-selling car by some distance, outselling its nearest in-house rival by about a factor of two.So while it's no longer Britain's favourite compact premium operator (take a bow, the Mercedes A-Class), it's still very much the kind of smallish car that's rather a big deal for its maker.Now halfway through its fourth generation, the car has been treated to a mild nip and tuck and an equipment upgrade in a bid to bolster its ability to compete with its key rivals.Just like its Seat Leon, Skoda Octavia and Volkswagen Golf relations, it continues to use an evolution of the Volkswagen Group’s ubiquitous MQB platform, with enhancements to accommodate a wider spread of powertrain options that include mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and, whisper it, even old-fashioned diesel-engined variants.The A3 remains available as a (curiously popular) compact saloon or, as driven here, in five-door Sportback guise - and while neither has been radically reinvented, a decently extensive package of visual, technological and mechanical revisions make this a tangibly different proposition from the outgoing car.We have separate reviews for the performance A3 models. The Audi S3 is the hot version, while the Audi RS3 is the full-on vindaloo four-wheel drive mega hatch with a drift mode and 394bhp.",

    "description": "Stuttgart’s top-of-the-range EV limo gets extra equipment and range The limousine class has long been something of a technological vanguard for the automotive industry, and in one respect in particular – when it comes to the provision of outright electric range in EVs - it’s preserving that status.Some of the competitors of the updated Mercedes-Benz EQS – the subject of this road test – really are pushing the envelope when it comes to squeezing mileage into a big four-door saloon. The UK market may still be waiting for right-hand-drive versions of them, but for the past two years the Lucid Air has been offering North American buyers a range in excess of 500 miles, while China’s Nio ET7, with its 150kWh semi-solid-state battery, has become the first electric production car to be certified for more than 1000km (621 miles) of range on a single charge.So there’s pressure on the likes of the EQS to keep up. Introduced in 2021, this was Stuttgart’s memorable bid to respond to the Tesla Model S and successfully electrify much of its S-Class customer base. It has thus far failed to do that, consistently being outsold by its more traditional sibling, with global demand for both cars slackening far enough for their shared production line at Sindelfingen to dial down output from two shifts a day to only one.Stand by to find out just how Mercedes has sought to boost this electric saloon’s fortunes by bolstering its power reserves.",

    "description": "The vintage BMW R-series boxer remains a perennial favorite among custom motorcycle builders. But there’s a downside to its popularity; with so many custom boxers on the road, it’s hard to build one that truly stands out. This lovely 1978 BMW R100/7 from Japan’s Heiwa MC doesn’t rely on wild engineering or crazy fabrication to grab attention. Instead, it’s the small details that distinguish it as a master-built machine. The brief for this project was familiar territory for the founder of the Hiroshima-based workshop, Kengo Kimura. His customer wanted a handsome street bike with café racer underpinnings and simplicity as a guiding principle. That meant retaining recognizable parts like the OEM fuel tank, but nipping and tucking everything else. Kimura-san responded with an array of judicious mods and subtle finishes, showing the sort of restraint that’s become a hallmark of his work.…",

CEO Rudy Banny and President Buffy McCoy Kelly opened their doors in 2006 after illustrious careers in the agency world. When they’re not busy creating ad campaigns for the likes of Victory, Dodge, and John Deere, they use their creativity to reimagine vintage motorcycles. Their bikes all have a clean and stripped-down style that strives to express the essence of their purpose and form. “They must move a rider emotionally before moving them physically,” explains Rudy. They’ve yet to put a bike up for sale, saying it’s “out of fear that once we do, we might lose sight of the fact that building bikes is a passion and not a job.”…",

    "description": "Audi is no stranger to odd naming decisions. It replaced its engine displacement badge with an arbitrary ‘performance’ number; ‘e-tron’ (aside from its meaning in French) was first a model, then a suffix, and now a sub-brand; and did you know its CNG cars are badged g-tron? Most recently, in 2023, the brand made the bold decision to assign odd numbers to all its ICE model names and even numbers to all EVs, turning decades of legacy on its head. It was so confusing to customers that the brand reneged in 2025 and is back to numbering cars based on their size. But even before this double U-turn, one model never quite sat right on the scale, and that’s the Q8. 8 is the largest number in the Audi model range, but the Q8 is not the largest SUV. It also implies a relation to the A8, but the Q8 offers nowhere near that kind of chauffeur-driven experience. Most confoundingly, it shares its name with the Q8 e-tron, an EV that’s noticeably smaller. Some argue that it earns its 8 because it’s a sporty, stylish coupé-SUV positioned above the Q7 – but then, its name would include ‘Sportback’, which it doesn’t. Looks menacing and sleek without going over the top. Having spent some time with our long-term Q8, I’ve realised it is best not to think about any of that too much because it detracts from the fact that this is an honest-to-goodness great luxury SUV. For one – and going back to that ‘Sportback’ point – though it looks a little sleeker than most big 5-seat SUVs, it sacrifices no space or practicality to the design. You’d have seen Santa Sergius load it up with Christmas gifts (Autocar India, January 2025), and I, too, managed a couple of airport runs in my time with the Q8. The boot can hold a lot more than its 605-litre rating or the dipping roofline would have you believe, and the rear seat is wide and spacious. I once carried a full complement of passengers, and they actually marvelled at how they weren’t making contact with one another. 605-litre boot is more spacious than it looks on the outside. The Q8 is part of the outgoing generation of big Audis, and with it will go a distinct interior layout that was started with the current Q7 a decade ago. It’s not without its flaws, like the dashboard and centre console made entirely of gloss-black plastic and screens, which attract a layer of dust every time I open the windows even for a short while. But back then, it successfully modernised the Audi interior while keeping it classy and expensive-looking, and that holds true even today, more so now that we’ve seen what’s coming next. It’s a similar story with the digital dials that, though simple, are incredibly clear and easy to read on the move. Among the last Audis to use this cabin layout. Not without flaws, but oh so classy. It’s a big car, for better or worse. I absolutely love lording over traffic on the way to work every day, but navigating the tiny streets in my neighbourhood and parking in my small driveway is tedious, to say the least. At my typical crawling speeds, it’s not surprising that a 2.1-tonne SUV with a turbo-petrol V6 isn’t going to be efficient, but 5.4kpl is low by any measure. And while Sergius enjoyed the ride quality on his highway drive to Goa, in town, the suspension feels firm (and the steering heavy); air suspension is a feature they should not have deleted. Struggled to reach even 6kpl on the daily commute. Then there’s Sakhir Gold: a colour that doesn’t even slightly resemble gold but is no less alluring for it (another confusing Audi naming choice, I suppose). I love the paint shade and am glad they offer it amidst the greys, blacks and silvers typical of German luxury cars. You can even get it on the Q7 now, and it never fails to rouse a remark from anyone who steps into the SUV. In fact, in my experience, whoever does experience the Q8 has only good things to say about it. It’s only those of us who’ve been trying to wrap our heads around its positioning who never quite got it. With the facelift and price revision, it’s now better placed against the likes of the BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE, and in my opinion, it looks better than either of them. By the time you read this, it will have left the fleet and been replaced by a Q7, and for many in the team, that will be an upgrade. For one, it’s got even more space and, crucially, smaller wheels and air suspension, which should allow it to ride better. But its colour? Samurai Grey. Boo!

    "description": "India and the UK have concluded a landmark trade deal that should give a boost to our country’s automotive sector, along with opening opportunities for both nations to have cheaper imports. As part of the free trade agreement, India will reduce tariffs on “high-end cars” imported from the UK from the current 100 percent to just 10 percent. Meanwhile, “India will gain from tariff elimination on about 99 percent of the tariff lines, covering almost 100 percent of the trade value,” the release stated. However, quotas will be established for automobile imports on both sides, it added. British luxury cars to become more affordable Prices of cars from JLR, Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce to reduce As the import duty on made-in-UK cars will come down drastically, carmakers like JLR, Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce – all of which manufacture in the UK and import models to India – will likely benefit from price reductions across their respective portfolios. The UK government’s press release states that it has secured “India’s best-ever agreement on rules of origin”. This indicates that cars exported to India may not require local content in order to comply with the new tariff rules. Among the points of clarification still required from both governments are the number of models that will be tariff-free, and what constitutes a “high-end car”. Rs 650 crore worth of cars imported to India from the UK in 2024 In 2024, India imported cars worth Rs 650 crore from the UK, while motorcycle imports stood at Rs 30 crore; the Indian government site also lists auto parts imports worth Rs 1,150 crore during the year. Among the luxury brands present in India – from Mercedes-Benz and BMW to Bentley, Ferrari and Rolls-Royce – JLR accounted for imports worth over Rs 500 crore. Made-in-UK limited edition Triumph bikes will become cheaper The free trade agreement also means limited-edition Triumph bikes, like the Rocket 3 Evel Knievel edition, are likely to reduce in price, as they are directly brought in from the UK. We’ll have to wait and see how much that amounts to when further clarification is provided. Carmakers and bike manufacturers in India could benefit Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, JLR, Royal Enfield, TVS and Bajaj could leverage tariff elimination on imports to the UK The India-UK free trade agreement will also be beneficial for Indian manufacturers like Mahindra, Royal Enfield, TVS and Bajaj, and international companies that manufacture in India, like JLR, Maruti Suzuki and Toyota. These brands are currently importing or plan to import made-in-India models to the UK. Mahindra's executive director and CEO, Auto and Farm Sectors, Rajesh Jejurikar, had said that the brand is looking to launch the BE 6 and XUV 9e in the UK, “We do have a plan to go to the EU with our electric vehicles at some point in the future, but that will be in a calibrated way. We will do right-hand-drive EVs first and then move to left-hand-drive.” The FTA will help price Mahindra’s EVs competitively among other similar-sized e-SUVs in the UK market. Maruti and Toyota’s first EVs, the e Vitara and Urban Cruiser, respectively, are being produced at Suzuki’s Gujarat plant for domestic sales and export, including the UK. The free trade agreement will also help price the Japanese company’s EVs well for the UK market, where it may also go up against the Mahindra BE 6. That JLR already locally assembles the Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover Velar, Range Rover and Land Rover Discovery Sport at its Pune plant means that prices for these models may also reduce in India. There are a few Indian bike makers – Royal Enfield, TVS and Bajaj – who will be able to benefit from the FTA between the two nations. Royal Enfield’s entire portfolio is sold in the UK, which creates opportunities for the brand to start exports from India. Meanwhile, Piaggio, TVS and Bajaj make select models – the Aprilia 457, upcoming Norton bikes and Triumph 400s and sub-400cc KTMs, respectively – in India for the UK market. These would likely see a rationalisation in price as well, making them more affordable there.

    "description": "Mahindra recently announced that it has delivered over 6,300 units of the BE 6 and XEV 9e electric SUVs since deliveries began in March this year. The company also revealed that more than 75 percent of all bookings so far have been for the top-spec Pack Three variant, which exclusively gets the larger 79kWh battery pack. However, going forward, Mahindra is planning to introduce the larger battery pack on lower trims for a more rationalised variant line-up. 6,300 units of Mahindra BE 6, XEV 9e delivered so far Over 75 percent of bookings have been for the top-spec Pack Three variant Mahindra targeting greater volumes from lower trims Inquires not converting into bookings for lower trims Production and deliveries prioritised for Pack Three variants Mahindra has a staggered delivery schedule for the BE 6 and XEV 9e. Deliveries began with the top-spec Pack Three variant in March. Pack Three Select variants will start arriving in June, followed by Pack Two in July. The base ‘Pack 1 Above’ and Pack 1 variants will only start arriving in August. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, the company’s executive director and CEO (Auto and Farm Sector), Rajesh Jejurikar, revealed that despite healthy inquiries for the lower-spec variants, consumers are hesitant to commit without seeing the vehicle in person. “They do not get converted into bookings right now because people want to see the vehicles before they book.” Jejurikar said that the current bookings mix is still very skewed to the top end – more than 75 percent of bookings are for Pack Three. “We believe that the mix will start changing when we put out the display and test drive vehicles of Pack Two and Pack One,” he added.  Greater preference for range from larger battery 79kWh battery needed on lower trims for sustained volumes What’s interesting is that Jejurikar revealed consumers are showing a preference for extended driving range over features. Therefore, Mahindra is now rethinking its variant line-up to offer the 79kWh battery on lower trims. “There is a very large segment of people who will want 79kWh in lower packs. This has been very different from our assumption that 79kWh will be only in the top end and everything else will be 59kWh. There is a segment of people for whom range is really important over many of the other features that we are offering,” said Jejurikar. To address this, Mahindra may introduce new versions of the BE 6 and the XEV 9e that offer the 79kWh battery but fewer features to make them more affordable. The company believes this could unlock a broader customer base and drive higher volumes. “To start growing volumes, we will need to have a reasonable mix in Pack One and Pack Two. We will saturate at a price point where it will be difficult to sustain high volumes. We will have to start getting at least 25-30 percent of our volumes from Pack 2 and Pack 1,” he said.
