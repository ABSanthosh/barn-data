    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "The Vellfire is Toyota’s big global MPV. It’s the current craze among India’s rich and famous, and has even gone on to become an unlikely red carpet regular. Mind you, this new-gen model was launched in India way back in 2023, but such has been the demand (nearly 1,200 were delivered last year), even the team at Toyota – that wouldn’t cut a queue – seemingly got their hands on their own media car only now. 2025 Toyota Vellfire exterior design and engineering: 7/10 5 metres long and 2 metres tall Vellfire has big presence You wouldn’t buy a Vellfire – or any MPV for that matter – primarily for the way it looks, but this latest-gen model does look more luxury product and less upscale airport pickup than the last one did. Of course, it’s the 5-metre length, 2-metre height and massive body that make the hulking Toyota unmissable even amidst luxury sedans and SUVs. Chrome treatment extends to 19-inch rims. Chrome details add bling to large MPV There’s more bling too. The huge 6-slat grille that almost extends to the floor is slathered in dark chrome, there’s more of the shiny stuff lining the bumper and even the headlamps sport a jewelled effect. You get the full effect of the Vellfire’s towering size at the side. Even the 19-inch rims look small amidst the vast body. A stylistic fold at the window line does give the slab-sided Vellfire some distinction in the world of MPVs. At the back, a roof spoiler and protruding bumper add some sportiness, if you will. Upward sweep of window line limits visibility for middle row passengers. The Vellfire uses a monocoque construction and is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform meant for large models. Toyota claims the new Vellfire is significantly stiffer in its construction yet engineered to be comfier and quieter than the last-gen model. 2025 Toyota Vellfire interior space and comfort: 9.5/10 Middle row comfort is exceptional Make what you want of the way the Vellfire looks, because the real story starts when you get inside. The first and perhaps only place of interest for the Vellfire’s chauffeur-driven clientele will be the middle row seats, access to which is via powered sliding doors. It is a bit of a step up into the living room-sized cabin. However, the short trek is worth it, ending in a pair of individual chairs that are no less than thrones. Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar. Vellfire's middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar.  Physical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests. There’s a wide range of motion, and, at full extension, you can really stretch out business-class style to catch a power nap on the go. Heating, ventilation and massage functions only up the comfort levels. However, the upswept rear windows don’t give the panoramic view out you’d expect in an MPV. Detachable screens mounted on armrests control seat adjustment, heating, ventilation and massage.   Third row offers enough room for three adults to sit in comfort Middle-row space and comfort is just brilliant, but it isn’t too bad for your entourage at the very back either. In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage. Access to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.   Access to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that's large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’. There's loads of flexibility built in: push the third row seats far forward or manually swivel them up and to the sides to free up courier van-levels of room. For all its space though, the Vellfire doesn't offer enough room for a spare tyre. Vellfire's boot offers courier van-levels of space, but there’s no provision for a spare tyre.   Cabin quality sees a huge jump over last-gen Vellfire We don’t foresee too many Vellfire owners getting into the intricacies of the front section of the cabin, but even so, the news is good. The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality. There’s more generous use of leather and padded surfaces, and even the wood-like detailing is convincing. Front seat comfort is also really good. Wraparound look to dash and high quality materials make cabin look rich and inviting.  The Vellfire gets abundant storage spaces across all three rows (including roof-mounted boxes), although the glovebox is unusually small. 2025 Toyota Vellfire features and safety: 8/10 14-inch touchscreen and digital dials are part of long equipment list The Vellfire comes loaded with goodies, so let’s break down the features set row-wise. Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either. 14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn't cutting edge.    Middle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos The multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system. Also, there won't be any quarreling with your co-passenger over sunroof opening thanks to the presence of individual glass panels with powered sunshades atop both seats. Middle row passengers get dedicated sunroofs. Adjustable seats, AC vents and powered sunshades for the quarter glass are features of note for third-row passengers. ADAS is part of Vellfire’s safety suite Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are also included. Lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control worked well on the smooth and well-marked Coastal Road in Mumbai, though it was the Blind Spot Warning function that came in most handy when piloting the oversized Vellfire. 14-inch rear entertainment screen folds out of the roof.    2025 Toyota Vellfire performance and refinement: 7/10 Vellfire offered in India only in front-wheel drive form Before we get moving, you should know that the Vellfire is sold in India only in front-wheel-drive format. Versions on sale overseas can be had with a rear electric motor that powers the rear wheels, effectively enabling all-wheel drive when driving conditions require. As things stand, the Vellfire is the most expensive front-wheel-drive vehicle on sale in India. Strong hybrid powertrain delivers a max of 250hp Driving the front wheels via an eCVT is a strong-hybrid arrangement. The powertrain comprises a 192hp, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine and a 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp. Vellfire doesn’t like to be rushed and feels its best in city confines.  It goes without saying that this is not a vehicle you buy for performance. If you’re in a hurry, the Vellfire is probably not the right vehicle to pick from your garage. This one’s job is to transport seven passengers in comfort. Vellfire can run in electric-only mode when battery has enough charge The Vellfire loves easy-going driving and gentle cruises, but ask anything more of it by pressing down harder on the accelerator pedal and that CVT-ness of the drivetrain comes right through. The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point. When there is enough charge in the battery, the Vellfire will slip into all-electric EV mode, which brings the decibel levels right back down. This is when you see the Vellfire in its best light. The Vellfire is ideal for easy-going driving and gentle cruises.  The Vellfire actually feels its best in stop-start urban confines, where the hybrid setup keeps the big Toyota in its comfort zone. It works as a long-distance vehicle too, but the powertrain simply doesn't feel as effortless as a strong diesel or even a strong turbo-petrol engine would. 2025 Toyota Vellfire ride comfort and handling: 7/10 Suspension doesn’t iron out all bumps and road noise creeps in to the cabin On the go, the VIP sat at the back will have reason to nitpick. Ride comfort is good but not good enough for a vehicle that sets you back by Rs 1.5 crore. The bumps and potholes do get filtered to quite an extent (it’s far nicer than the last Vellfire on this front), but the experience is not as pliant as it should have been. There’s also a fair bit of road noise that makes its way into the cabin, and at high speeds, you’ll hear air slamming against the A-pillar. Drivers will take some time getting used to the Vellfire’s size.    Drivers will need some time to get comfortable with the Vellfire’s size Also, the Vellfire isn’t the kind of vehicle that you just get into and get comfortable behind the wheel of. Sure, the high-set seat and large glasshouse give a commanding view of the world, but the windscreen that extends far forward makes it tricky to judge the Vellfire’s frontal extremities, at least initially. The size takes some getting used to and U-turns will need a bit of planning. There’s more ground clearance than the low floor would suggest. Ground clearance might appear inadequate but the Vellfire clears big speedbreakers without scraping its belly. No height adjustable air suspension here; the Vellfire rides on steel springs. 2025 Toyota Vellfire price and verdict: 8.5/10 Toyota Vellfire prices start at Rs 1.22 crore (ex-showroom) The Vellfire starts at Rs 1.22 crore for the Hi trim, while this VIP Executive Lounge spec is yours for Rs 1.32 crore (ex-showroom). Fun fact? That’s a crazy Rs 40 lakh-plus jump over the last-gen model’s launch price in 2020! The Vellfire is clearly not your average level-headed Toyota, nor is it your typical practicality-above-all-else MPV. It’s a luxury good and Toyota would like you to think it’s priced as such too. The Vellfire is for the chauffeur-driven who want to lounge on their way to work or home. A like-priced luxury sedan or SUV will get you more power and deliver a quieter experience, and of course, there’s the lure of a more prestigious badge too. But nothing, and I mean nothing, at this price can match the Vellfire’s rear seats for comfort. For the chauffeur-driven who merely want to lounge on their way to work or home, the Vellfire will be money well-spent. Toyota’s peace of mind ownership and a claimed 19.28kpl fuel economy figure would perhaps help strengthen the case for the Vellfire with the company CA too. But you know what? There’s an even more exclusive, more refined and comfier option from the house of Toyota – the Vellfire’s cousin. It’s called the Lexus LM, and it goes up to Rs 2.6 crore. Van damn!

    "description": "Shadowy teaser image suggests that 671bhp V8-engined racing hypercar will be converted for road use Porsche looks to be readying a Le Mans car for the road, which it could unveil at the famous 24-hour race in June. A shadowy teaser image released by the German brand shows a side profile of the 963 hypercar (below) that currently competes in the World Endurance Championship (WEC). During the announcement, Porsche heavily referenced the 917, one of few Porsche endurance cars ever modified for road-going use, some 50 years ago. Originally designed for track racing, chassis 030 was sold in 1974 by Porsche to Count Rossi di Montelera (the heir to the Martini brand), who then converted it. After showing videos of that machine, Porsche asked “what if?” before showing the darkened side profile of the 963. The 963 is powered by an electrically assisted, twin-turbocharged 4.6-litre V8 engine, derived from that of the old Porsche 918 Spyder supercar. It produces a maximum of 671bhp, although its output in WEC races is dictated by Balance of Performance regulations. While no confirmation has yet been made by Porsche, a road-going 963 would likely be either a one-off or made in an extremely limited batch.",

That’s a tough ask Alpine, in its 21st-century incarnation at least, is still a young brand, but it’s quickly growing up. The first step in the masterplan was to make us all take notice with a sports car: the brilliant A110. Then it came up with something more attainable: the Renault 5-based A290 hot hatchback. Now it needs a car for all the family to enjoy. That’ll be the new Alpine A390.Because it’s 2025, that means it’s electric, and because the batteries need to go in the floor, it’s crossover-shaped. But stick with us, because this isn’t one of those slightly limp Esprit Alpine versions of a Renault: it’s a completely stand-alone Alpine model with a special trick up its sleeve – or rather, three of them.",

Visually impactful engines like Suzuki’s Ram-Air 550, Fabio Taglioni’s 90-degree desmo twin or Harley’s robust Knucklehead add depth and mechanical marvel to a build, reminding us that it’s all about the connection between man and machine. But if you really want to rattle the cage, abandon pistons altogether, because after all, there’s more than one way to combust fuel and air. By day, Larry Houghton runs a successful engineering firm in Salisbury, England, but he’s recently retired to devote more time to his passions, predominantly two-wheeled ones. With time on his side, and free rein over the equipment at his company, he could finally pursue a project he’d shelved in the back of his mind for years.…",

    "description": "Motorcycle dealer build-offs are a great way for brands to showcase their bikes, and for bike dealers to flex their customization muscles. But there’s a catch. Once the competition is over, those dealers often need to sell the bikes they built to recoup costs—so it pays to balance style and usability. This BMW R12 nineT street tracker rides that line deftly. It was built by Unikat Motorworks for their local BMW dealership in Wrocław, as part of BMW Poland’s custom build contest. Even though the workshop had free rein on the project, practicality was always front of mind. “This is a pure custom build—one that’s visually striking, but also remains highly functional,” says Unikat co-owner, Michał Pamuła. “And we think that’s an often overlooked advantage in the world of competition customs, where bikes need to find new homes after the contest—and continue to bring joy, not just from their looks.”…",

    "description": "The MG Windsor will soon be updated with a larger battery pack option, say our sources. Besides this crucial addition, the Windsor is expected to receive more features, and the launch is expected as soon as next month. A new 50.6kWh battery pack is expected on the Windsor New feature additions will likely include an ADAS suite Updated Windsor launch expected next month Updated MG Windsor: what to expect? The Windsor is currently sold in India with a 38kWh battery pack, but it gets a larger 50.6kWh battery in Indonesia where it is sold as the Wuling Cloud EV. This same battery will make it to the India-spec model; it has a claimed range of 460km on the CLTC cycle. For reference, the existing 38kWh battery on the Windsor returns a range of 332km (ARAI-rated). However, the power and torque figures of 136hp and 200Nm are expected to remain unchanged with the larger battery, as will the front-wheel-drive configuration. Our sources have also hinted at an updated features list, the highlight of which will be the inclusion of an ADAS suite.   New battery could bring a notable update to real-world range In our real-world efficiency tests, the Windsor fared really well, returning an efficiency of 8.1km/kWh and a range of 308km – just 24km off the claimed figure. For reference, The Nexon EV with a larger 45kWh battery returned a real-world range of 350km but with a lower efficiency of 7.79km/kWh. The larger battery could take the Windsor’s range closer to 400km, probably making it viable even for trips outside the city. MG Windsor sales in India It is currently outselling the Nexon EV  Since its launch in September 2024, the Windsor alone has given significant boost to MG’s sales in India. In the seven months between September 2024 and March 2025, the Windsor sold 19,394 units, averaging more than 2,700 units a month. More importantly, it has consistently been outselling its chief rival, the Tata Nexon EV, which had long been the undisputed bestseller in the EV segment. The addition of the larger battery surely will give a further impetus to its sales. But expect a reasonable bump in its ex-showroom price, which currently ranges between Rs 14 lakh and Rs 16 lakh.  Also See: Renault Duster, Bigster hybrid under evaluation for India Tata Nexon EV 5-star BNCAP safety rating extended to 45kWh variants",

    "description": "Skoda has unveiled a concept bike dubbed the Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B. This cafe racer is a modern interpretation of the original Slavia B, which was launched over a century ago in 1899. Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B is an electric concept bike The motorcycle will not enter series production It has been conceptualised by in-house designer Romain Bucaille Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B Concept: a concept bike from Skoda Designed by Romain Bucaille, Skoda’s in-house exterior designer At first glance, it might seem unexpected to see a concept bike from Skoda. However, for those who may not know this, the Czech carmaker actually began its journey with motorcycles and bicycles, originally produced under the Laurin \u0026 Klement badge. With the Slavia B Concept, the brand aims to revive that legacy, launching a new series under the Laurin \u0026 Klement moniker, one that reimagines its iconic vehicles with a modern twist. While these reinterpretations are going to remain concepts, they serve as a fascinating tribute to Skoda’s two-wheeler origins. About the 1899 Slavia B The modern interpretation draws its lineage from the original Slavia B, which was launched in 1899. The motorcycle was a slender machine and featured a 240cc air-cooled engine producing 1.75hp, capable of reaching a top speed of 40kph. Interestingly, it had no gearbox; instead, power was delivered via a flat belt connected directly to the engine. As was the norm at the time, pedals were included for starting and auxiliary propulsion. A total of 540 units of the Slavia B were produced. About the Laurin \u0026 Klement Slavia B Concept The Slavia B Concept was developed by Romain Bucaille, a French designer who typically works on exterior design for Skoda’s cars. Despite its electric vision, the concept retains the silhouette of early Laurin \u0026 Klement motorcycles, especially the distinctive frame that dips lower than the rest of the structure. While the original Slavia B housed its engine within this frame, Bucaille’s concept leaves this space empty, instead featuring a floating modern reinterpretation of the Laurin \u0026 Klement logo. The front end of the concept pays homage to Vaclav Laurin, who was known for designing motorcycles with exceptional stability and handling.   While this concept will never enter series production, it’s interesting to see manufacturers going down unusual roads to come up with such one-off concepts that give their heritage models a modern interpretation.
