    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/car-makers-brace-huge-financial-impact-trump-tariffs",
    "description": "BMW builds SUVs in Spartanburg, South Carolina, but actual local content is reported to be only around 30% All cars and light commercial vehicles imported into the US will be hit with a 25% tariff from 2 April Car makers in the UK and Europe are bracing for what for many will be the biggest financial shock since Covid when the newly announced 25% tariff on cars imported into the US are applied on 2 April. The tariffs apply to all cars and light commercials imported into the US that aren't covered by the Mexico-US-Canada automotive tariff agreement, significantly raising the cost of doing business in the US. Firms including Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, BMW and JLR were relying on healthy sales in the US to balance out crashing demand in China and a weaker European market.  “It's a perfect storm for the European auto industry,” said David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School. “UK auto already has a low-volume crisis, with plants operating well below capacity.” The US is UK’s second largest car export market after the EU, with 101,100 cars shipped in 2024, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The lobbying body called the tariff hike \"disappointing\". JLR was by far the largest British automotive exporter to the US, with sales up by 29% to 116,294 cars last year, of which around two thirds were built in the UK. Ultra-luxury brands including Aston Martin, Bentley, McLaren and Rolls-Royce accounted for around 9000 car imports there last year. JLR chose not to comment on the tariffs except to say it was awaiting further information. The share value of JLR owner Tata Motors dropped 5.6% after the news. Ineos Automotive stated: \"We are outraged that the tariff situation with the US has been neglected by the EU. \"[US] president [Donald] Trump has been very clear on his intention to implement tariffs on the auto industry. He has been asking for fairness and reciprocity and yet European leaders have not come to the table to negotiate a better solution.\" The 25% tariff comes on top of the 2.5% duty already paid by car makers importing into the US and is paid on the ‘landing’ price of the car, minus the dealer margin. The tariff will in effect add 15% to the recommended retail price of the car, estimated the bank Bernstein in a note to investors.  Car makers will have to choose whether to pass on the cost to customers or absorb it and take the hit on margins. Given the size of the tariff compared with the 10% that most analysts had been expecting earlier in the year, most will have no choice but to increase prices. “We are assessing different scenarios on how to handle it, but it will be finally passed on to the consumer,” Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser said earlier in March after the tariffs had been announced but before the percentage had been revealed. “At the end of the day, the consumer will have to pay it, and this would have an impact on the business, very clearly”. Trump said the tariffs “addressed a critical threat to US security” and would bring vehicle manufacturing back to the country, creating 2.8 million jobs and growing the economy by $728 billion. Some car companies have already said they will increase their US manufacturing footprint. Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (£16.3bn) to increase its vehicle production in the country and develop new technology there, including autonomous driving capability. Audi has said it's in discussion over which models can be localised in the US. However, JLR is unlikely to build in the US to mitigate the tariffs, according to Ian Henry, head of consultancy AutoAnalysis. “You can’t just do that overnight. They don’t have the supply chain in place and a CKD [completely knocked-down kit] plant would face tariffs on components anyway,” he said. Car makers also face the problem of not knowing how long the tariffs will remain in place amid a chaotic decision-making process at the White House. “They could be a negotiating tactic and therefore very short-lived or they might not,” Henry said. “Car makers can ride out temporary turbulence, but if they last for four years, that’s a much more serious issue.” Even those car makers with plants in the US will face higher costs on the components they import. Trump claimed that of the eight million cars built in the US last year, US-built content amounted to only half the total amount. “Therefore, of the 16 million cars bought by Americans, only 25% of the vehicle content can be categorized as Made in America,” a White House fact sheet published in support of the tariffs stated. The local content of BMW SUVs made in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is below 30%, according to documentation seen by Henry. BMW imports engines from Europe for fitment into cars assembled in the US facility, which in theory will now be subject to tariffs from 2 April. The impact on car makers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo exporting from the US into Europe could be amplified by potential retaliatory tariffs from the EU. “We will now assess this announcement, together with other measures the US is envisaging in the next days,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “Tariffs are taxes – bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union.” Bernstein said in a note: “This would impact the SUVs that BMW and Mercedes produce in the US for global markets, like the BMW X5 and X7 and the Mercedes GLE and GLS.\" The UK has less room to retaliate and will instead seek to negotiate a carve-out, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has suggested. “We're not at the moment at a position where we want to do anything to escalate these trade wars,” Rachel Reeves told Sky News. “Trade wars are no good for anyone.” The financial impact of the tariffs if extended to the end of the year would hit Stellantis worst, knocking back its profit margin by 5.1 percentage points, according to Bernstein analysis. BMW is set to drop by 2.0 points, Mercedes by 2.2 points and the Volkswagen Group by 1.5 pts.  All financial predications are pure guesswork, however, given that Trump could backtrack at any moment. As one industry watcher said: “Basically, it’s a mess.”",

For that reason, I always seek out the understated ones; bottles that look like they could have been in circulation when your grandpa was still on the sauce. Maybe you’ll find one of his old favorites. A project of the 2020 lockdowns, Brain Brew’s Dexter Three Wood straight bourbon is far from that, but its simple label exudes quiet confidence, and Edmund Dexter’s face on the bottle looks fit for a dollar bill. It also came highly recommended by the local liquor store owner, so color me sold. What’s in a Name The personality behind the spirit is Edmund Dexter, apparently a prolific 1800s bourbon blender who entertained the likes of author Charles Dickens and the future King Edward at his home in Cincinnati — or so the bottle says.…",

The last time we checked in with Fo, he wowed us with a wildly chopped Yamaha SR400. This time he’s back with an equally bodacious chopper on a very different foundation—a 2022-model Harley-Davidson Low Rider S. Dyna cultists must have felt cheated when The Motor Co. re-released the Low Rider S on their newer Softail platform. But the truth is, the contemporary Low Rider S is a total hoot to ride.

    "description": "For buyers who crave the thrill of a sports car without giving up the space and practicality of a sedan, the BMW M340i has always been an enticing option. While its blistering performance and attractive pricing made it a standout, its stiff suspension often compromised everyday comfort. With the 2025 update, BMW has addressed that concern in a big way. 2025 BMW M340i performance, ride and handling Now gets Adaptive M Suspension Adjustable damper settings transform the way this M340i behaves. The headline change? The addition of Adaptive M Suspension, previously exclusive to the now-discontinued X3 M40i in India. This system allows drivers to toggle between firmer or softer shock absorber settings at the push of a button, transforming the car’s ride quality. Yes, the 19-inch wheels and run-flat tyres still make it firmer than the standard long-wheelbase 3 Series, but in Comfort mode, the ride is significantly more forgiving than the outgoing model. Switch to Sport mode, and the M340i tightens up dramatically, delivering the razor-sharp agility and direct steering feel you would expect from a performance sedan. The new flat-bottomed steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock marker enhances the sporty vibe further. The ride quality is softer and far more forgiving than before.   Retains 374hp, 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The M340i retains its B58 3-litre 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, which makes 374hp and 500Nm. Those who have experienced the earlier iterations of the M340i will quickly point out that this unit is much quieter, especially in Eco and Normal drive modes. The engine sound, though, is prominently amplified by the cabin speakers in Sport and Sport Plus, and with BMW’s ‘iconic sounds’ turned on, you will also hear occasional crackles from the M exhaust. Yes, the sound is synthesised, but this 6-cylinder mill sounds sweet when revved hard. The 3-litre, 6-cyl unit is quieter than before; performance remains explosive.   0-100kph comes up in 4.39 seconds 2025 BMW M340i performance as testedAcceleration Time0-20kph0.70s0-40kph1.31s0-60kph2.14s0-80kph3.16s0-100kph4.39s0-120kph5.96s0-140kph7.75s20-80kph (kickdown)3.00s40-100kph (kickdown)3.39s The best bit is that performance remains explosive. In our performance tests, it sprints from 0 to 100kph in merely 4.39 seconds, and it hits 200kph rather effortlessly. Also, it retains the 48-Volt mild hybrid system, which facilitates a rather seamless automatic engine stop-start function to reduce fuel consumption while idling.  Complementing this engine is a fantastic 8-speed torque converter automatic, which transmits power to all four wheels. Besides being smooth and quick, it is a rather clever transmission, and you’ll seldom find this powertrain caught off guard when you put your foot down. For manual control, though, it gets paddle shifters, which certainly elevate driver engagement. 2025 BMW M340i exterior and interior New colour option and alloy wheels New blacked-out 19-inch alloys and red brake calipers look sporty. With this update, the M340i gets two new paint options, one of them being Arctic Race Blue, as seen on the test car. It also gets new blacked-out alloys as well as red brake calipers. Changes to the interior are minimal, with the most prominent ones being the new flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker and redesigned central air vents – though the latter feels flimsy to operate. The curved touchscreen now features an updated software interface, but it still feels cluttered with too many apps, making it unintuitive. Redesigned air vents feel flimsy in operation; flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker looks racy.   2025 BMW M340i price and verdict Rs 6 lakh more expensive than the 2023 model At Rs 74.90 lakh, this iteration is nearly Rs 6 lakh pricier than the 2023 version. However, the newly added Adaptive M suspension justifies this price premium. It has transformed this car’s character, making it more comfortable than before without hampering driver engagement. With stonking performance, adequate cabin room, a 480-litre boot and a decent standard kit, the M340i exerts serious appeal. If you love to drive and are in the market for a daily driver within Rs 1 crore, your search should end here.

    "description": "Officine Fuoriserie Maserati opened its doors today, ushering in a new level of personalisation previously not offered to customers of the Italian sports luxury car brand. While cost options like colours, hides and trim materials were always on offer, the new programme allows for far greater customer involvement, including consultations at the brand’s Centro Stile design studio in Italy. Available on all Maserati models from Grecale to MC20 Bespoke builds include consultation with Maserati design team Detailed Fuoriserie sections to feature in all showrooms Maserati open to doing coach-built one-off models too New 11-million-Euro Fuoriserie wing added to Modena HQ The foundation for Officine Fuoriserie Maserati, which translates from Italian to ‘Maserati custom workshop’, is a new 4,000-square-metre wing installed at the brand’s historic headquarters in Modena, Italy. It is a result of an investment of 11 million Euro (Rs 102 crore); a large chunk of this is the state-of-the-art paint shop that features a combination of robotised and hand-finished paint stations, but more is invested regularly on new materials and paint finishes. Incidentally, this inauguration coincides with the 100th anniversary of the ‘Tridente’ – the iconic Neptune’s Trident logo that was designed by Mario Maserati and debuted on the Tipo 26 race car at the Targo Florio the following year. “I like to think that the three prongs of the Tridente represent luxury, performance and Italian craftmanship,” said Maserati CEO Santo Ficili. “The three reasons customers choose a Maserati.” Maserati Fuoriserie to feature two tiers of personalisation The programme will be available on all models, right from the Grecale SUV to the Folgore EVs to the MC20 supercar. While basic customisation found in the online configurator also includes certain special ‘Fuoriserie’ options, such as pearl-effect paint, these still count as ‘catalogue’ options. Maserati Grecale Trofeo by Officine Fuoriserie Maserati. The true Fuoriserie experience begins after this, and comes in two tier levels – Collezione and Bespoke. The former offers up specifications curated and suggested by Maserati, divided into two distinct themes – the forward looking Collezione Futura and the Collezione Corse, which references Maserati’s storied motorsport history. “Maserati is the automotive equivalent of a top fashion brand,” says Davide Baldini, head of Fuoriserie, Maserati. “And therefore we have created our own collections.” Futura builds are designed to highlight the tech in the vehicles, featuring brighter colours, futuristic patterns, new-age upholstery fabrics and experimental tech like laser-etched body panels and interior trim. Corse builds, meanwhile, would use classic paint shades, historic liveries, tanned leather and anodised metal trim pieces to give a period look. Maserati Fuoriserie Bespoke lets you choose every material Maserati Granturismo 110 Anniversario by Officine Fuoriserie Maserati. The final level is Bespoke, in which buyers are involved in every step of the process and end up with a car that’s uniquely theirs. They can create their own paint shades, design their own liveries and much more. “The starting point is listening to the customer,” Baldini says. “We have to understand what the customer wants, and what can and can’t be achieved.” This involves sketches, renderings and even material samples being sent to the customer, regular contact with the design and production teams and even a visit to the Maserati Centro Stile design centre in Modena to collaborate with design head Klaus Busse. This, of course, stretches the production time (and the cost) considerably. “We do not say no to customers” – Maserati Fuoriserie team While Maserati boldly says the Fuoriserie programme has ‘no limits’, there are of course some considerations to make. “We often like to say that we have customisation without limits, but of course we have some limits,” said Baldini in response to a question from Autocar India. “One is the quality, and of course the other is safety. These are the only limits we put on our customers.” “The answer is yes; now, what is the question?” joked Giovanni Perosino, chief marketing officer, Maserati, adding: “What we try to do is guide them. Several times a customer is not an expert at customising a car at this level, so we want to educate them while following [their] design.” He also proudly spoke of one customer who “received a no” from another prominent carmaker in Italy’s Motor Valley, and then came to Maserati where their request was fulfilled. Combining traditional techniques with modern tech Highlighting the level of workmanship of the programme, Davide Guerra, Maserati head of manufacturing and the Modena plant, says it aims to deliver “Quality, efficiency and flexibility”. It uses a hybrid operation that combines automation and manual processes, the latter especially important for delivering a bespoke feel. For instance, for the one-off custom MC20 Cielo “Less is more…?” (pictured), an elaborate combination of matte and gloss paint is used. This is achieved by applying a matte finish on the whole car and then individually isolating and polishing the required sections to a gloss finish by hand. This car is also a demonstration that Maserati is willing to break tradition to fulfil customers’ wishes. “We take a lot of liberties playing with the Tridente [logo] as well, unlike other brands. Here, we broke it up, for example.” Busse says of the one-off MC20 Cielo, which features a Bauhaus interpretation of the trident painted on the engine cover. “Strictly no stickers here.” Maserati Fuoriserie programme to be offered to Indian customers The Maserati GranTurismo launched in August last year from Rs 2.72 crore, ex-showroom. As all Maseratis are built to order, there is no regional limitation to the programme, and hence it will be available to Indian customers as well. The brand is keen to open more showrooms around the country soon, and globally, all will be directed to feature a special area for Officine Fuoriserie, featuring paint, material and trim samples that buyers can touch and feel. While the programme has been introduced in Modena, however, it is still rolling out to dealerships worldwide.  “We need to involve our dealers in this fantastic programme,” Ficili says. “We are ready but we are in the process of training our dealers to be ready for Fuoriserie.” With this, Maserati aims to further establish itself as not just a performance car maker, but a bona fide luxury brand that can provide a custom experience for those who wish to avail of it.

    "description": "Red Bull Racing has confirmed that Yuki Tsunoda will replace Liam Lawson at the team from the 2025 Japanese GP (April 4-6) onwards. “It has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races, and as a result, we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,” said Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal Christian Horner. “We came into the 2025 season with two ambitions: to retain the World Drivers’ Championship and to reclaim the World Constructors’ title, and this is purely a sporting decision.” Lawson replaced after just two rounds Tsunoda to make Red Bull debut at his and Honda’s home race Tsunoda replaces Lawson: Why the early switch? Having made the decision to part ways with Sergio Perez, Red Bull had narrowed down its shortlist to Lawson and Tsunoda.  At the time, Lawson had made 11 grand prix appearances – replacing an injured Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull’s sister team at the end of 2023, and later taking his place from the 2024 US GP onwards. Tsunoda, meanwhile, had raced in F1 for four seasons, and 2024 was his best yet. Red Bull eventually opted to promote Lawson. At the time, Horner suggested that the 23-year-old’s mental resilience played a key role in this decision. However, Lawson has had a difficult start to the 2025 F1 season. Starting both races from the pit lane, he crashed out of the Australian GP and finished P12 in China (after Charles Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton and Pierre Gasly’s disqualifications). Horner acknowledged that “there’s a lot of work to be done” on Red Bull’s 2025 race car, the RB21, adding that “Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car.” As for Lawson’s early demotion to Racing Bulls, Horner explained, “We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam. We see that after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience as he continues his F1 career with Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well.” Also see: Cadillac, General Motors to join F1 in 2026",
