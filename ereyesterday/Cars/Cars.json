    "description": "This 1958 Lancia Aurelia B20 GT is a right-hand-drive coupe that was completed on May 8, 1958, as one of an estimated 3,900 examples built during an eight-year production run. Chassis 3980 is said to have been exhibited at the 1958 iteration of the Turin Motor Show, and it remained registered in Italy for some time before making its way to the US in 2024. Finished in black over beige cloth and tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 2.5-liter V6 paired with a column-shifted, rear-mounted four-speed manual transaxle. It rides on metric steel wheels and is further equipped with a Weber 40DCL6 carburetor, a de Dion rear axle, and hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units. Recently acquired by the current owner, this Series VI B20 is now offered on dealer consignment with a FIVA identity card, Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine, and a clean Arizona title.",

    "description": "Rugged Avenger 4x4 combines a petrol engine with two electric motors for improved off-road ability The new Jeep Avenger 4xe, the model line’s new range-topper, has gone on sale in the UK priced from £30,999. At launch, the 4x4 is available in two trims: base Upland and a special The North Face Edition. The latter is priced at £34,999 and limited to 4806 examples. Over the standard car, it gets Summit Gold accents and “a nature-inspired colour pallet”. Deliveries will begin in March. Featuring an all-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain – it is not offered as an EV –  the 4xe will “go further, faster and better off road” than any rival and “establishes a new standard” in the class, says Jeep.  “We are proud to introduce a model that not only delivers on performance and sustainability but also sets a new standard for versatility and style,” said new Jeep Europe boss Eric Laforge. The Avenger was launched as an EV in mid-2023, with a cheaper pure-petrol variant introduced in the UK a few months later. Both are front-wheel-drive models, but Jeep had always planned to eventually offer an all-wheel-drive variant to build on the brand’s long history of off-road ability. A 4x4 version was first previewed at the 2022 Paris motor show. Former boss Antonio Filosa, now head of Stellantis North America, previously told Autocar: “Every time we think of a Jeep product, we think of a four-wheel-drive version. Jeep is by far the most capable brand in the world, and for us capability is all around off-road. So in each segment, any Jeep vehicle must have more capability than every rival.” The Avenger 4xe combines a 134bhp 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine driving through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox with a pair of 28bhp electric motors (one on each axle). The 48V hybrid system is designed to offer significant traction and torque to boost its off-road performance. Jeep claims it can generate up to 1400lb ft at the rear wheels, a figure likely achieved by multiplying motor torque by the gear ratio. The all-wheel drive system helps to give the 4xe a 0-62mph time of 9.5sec and the top speed is 120mph. Jeep also claims a “minimal” increase in CO2 emissions over the existing Avenger hybrid offered in some markets, although the firm has yet to give an exact figure. The powertrain uses a ‘smart’ all-wheel drive system, so power is always sent to all four wheels below 19mph. Between 19mph and 56mph, the rear axle is powered only when required, and two-wheel-drive is always used at higher speeds to minimise fuel consumption. There is on-demand torque distribution in all-wheel drive mode, with a split of up to 50:50 front to rear. The Selec-Terrain drive mode function features Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud and Sport settings, which alter the power distribution and stability control for the various conditions. The powertrain features a 22:7:1 reducer on the rear axle to allow for that 1400lb ft of torque, and Jeep claims that gives the Avenger 4xe the ability to traverse slopes of up to 40% - and 20% even when there’s no grip at the front wheels. With a ride height of 210mm, the 4xe model sits 10mm higher than the regular Avenger, enabling the ability to ford up to 400mm of water. Another bespoke addition is multi-link rear suspension, which allows for greater articulation on the rear axle. Additionally, the Avenger 4xe offers 22deg approach, 21deg breakover and 35deg departure angles. As previewed by the 2022 concept, the Avenger 4xe features a number of design tweaks from the regular version. The foglights have been moved slightly higher to provide better visibility, and there are roof rails and a rear tow hook. The front and rear bumpers are now made from mould-in-colour material and feature an anti-scratch finish, and the front bumper shows more of the wheels and includes extra cladding. There is a new optional bonnet sticker designed to reduce reflections when driving in sunny weather. Mud and snow tyres are offered as standard, with optional All Terrain 3PMSF tyres also available. Both are mounted on black alloy wheels. Inside, the 4xe gains new seats made from an easily washable material, along with greater use of more durable materials to extend the cabin life.",

    "description": "Where does Nissan's second bespoke EV rank in the electric crossover class? The mid-sized family EV market is stacked with a diverse range of models – and what that means for buyers is a greater amount of choice. You can invest in a smaller high-riding hatchback, or go for something that blends the credentials of a crossover with the appeal of an SUV, much like the markedly different Nissan Ariya. Its rivals could not be more varied. The Tesla Model Y and Model 3 major on range, performance and efficiency. The Audi Q4 is a sleek and tech-heavy alternative. And then there’s the Korean trio: the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Genesis GV60. Oh and we can't forget the coupé-SUVs, too, such as the Volkswagen ID 4 and Ford Mustang Mach E.So where does the Ariya sit among this ever-growing list of electric crossovers? Nissan had plenty of time to mull its plans on how best to expand its line-up of zero-emission vehicles, with an long gap between the Ariya and Nissan Leaf. Since its inception in 2022, the Japanese brand’s second ‘proper’ EV has led a somewhat quiet life. That looks set to change, with a Nismo in the pipeline – and last year the firm added two new trim lines to its line-up to fend off competition from Europe, China and America. Range at a glanceThe Ariya is offered in a choice of four trim levels, with two battery options and either a single-motor front-wheel-drive format or a more powerful twin-motor four-wheel-drive layout. Entry-level Engage trim is relatively basic, with fabric seats, LED headlights and a selection of safety-based features. Mid-level Advance gets synthetic leather seats, with fabric inserts, a hands-free tailgate, heated front seats and surround-view camera with 'Intelligent' rear-view mirror. Evolve carries over most of the features of the Advance, but gains plusher leather and suede seats, a panoramic roof, ventilated and heated front seats and a flexible centre console.Evolve+ tops the range and features the same equipment as the Evolve but with larger, 20in wheels and blue nappa leather seats.",

    "description": "The bike you see here is emissions-compliant, ABS-enabled, and saree guard-equipped, which means it can be registered for road use in our country. That’s a big deal because no Japanese manufacturer has yet attempted to sell one of its road-legal dual sport motorcycles in India, and for that reason alone, Kawasaki deserves your praise. But does it also deserve your money? And how much should you be willing to spend on this motorcycle?  Kawasaki KLX230 design, underpinnings, seat height What goes in the KLX’s favour is that it’s the real deal. This is a proper, purpose-built dual-sport motorcycle with a perimeter chassis, 21-inch/18-inch wheels, and exactly the sort of uncompromising ergonomics and bodywork you’d want to see. Long-travel suspension with 240mm/250mm of front/rear travel and 265mm of ground clearance are impressive numbers that make for a wonderful pairing with a low 139kg kerb weight. 880mm seat but slim form doesn’t make it feel so tall. With an authentic dirt bike form factor must come a tall seat, and the KLX’s stands at a towering 880mm. That’s a frightful number for a market that’s deeply sensitive to tall seats, but bear in mind that this bike is much slimmer than your regular motorcycle, which makes reaching the ground a little easier than the number suggests. Some of my colleagues, who were about 5’7” tall, found themselves on tip-toes but able to manage. Another side effect of the slim proportions is a tiny 7.6-litre fuel tank, but the KLX’s mellow engine should help stretch the fuel range decently far. The simple air-cooled, 2-valve, 233cc single-cylinder motor sends a humble 18.1hp and 18.3Nm to the rear wheel via a 6-speed gearbox. It’s not very powerful but has a proper perimeter chassis. Those numbers may sound quite underwhelming, but in an off-road scenario, the performance is more than enough to keep you engaged without being intimidating. First gear is very short, and I found myself in second and third most of the time. A small dab of the light clutch lever gives you a decent kick of power if you need to raise the front wheel over a crest, and there’s enough juice to slide the rear wheel around in the first few gears as well. At the same time, the power also felt completely trustworthy, with no threats of the bike snapping out of control. This is just the sort of performance that a newer off-road rider would enjoy on their journey towards becoming more skilled. Kawasaki KLX230 off-road ability Unfortunately, we didn’t get to try the KLX out on the road, so how it functions as a street bike remains to be seen, but a few safe assumptions can be made. The first is that it won’t be very comfortable for long durations with that thin seat, and the engine probably isn’t geared for easy high-speed cruising either. That being said, the motor feels impressively refined, even when hammering it at redlining speeds off-road. MRF tyres are standard for the Indian market. The MRF tyres that Kawasaki India has equipped this bike with were quite decent on dry, muddy terrain, but you’ll want something more off-road appropriate to properly exploit the bike. While the KLX is designed to look like one of Kawasaki’s angry KX motocross racers, it’s actually quite a gentle thing. The non-adjustable suspension is absorptive and can take in some pretty big hits, but it’s also on the soft side, which makes it easier for less-skilled riders to read the terrain underneath. The braking works well off-road, and you can deactivate the ABS (front and rear) with the push of a button. What I also like is that, despite this being a relatively small bike in Kawasaki’s off-road line-up, it’s still a physically large machine and will fit bigger riders as well. LCD is easy to read, but lacks a gear indicator. By definition, this is a simple, lightweight motorcycle, so don’t expect much in the way of features. That being said, it’s not all bad. It gets a good-looking LED headlamp and a clean LCD that includes ‘luxuries’ like a clock, a fuel gauge, and even Bluetooth compatibility. Jokes aside, the only thing some folks might miss in the display is a gear position indicator. Kawasaki KLX230 verdict and expected price To sum up, I am not as good an off-road rider as I’d like to be, and this is exactly the sort of bike I’d like to spend some time on in the process of getting better. The fact that Kawasaki is going through the pains of bringing this bike to our market alone deserves your appreciation. However, if you’ve been following our news on this bike over the past few months, you’ll have noticed that we reported Kawasaki was working on localising the KLX for our market and that its target price would be around Rs 2 lakh, which would make it a fantastic rival to the Hero Xpulse.  However, the localisation process is still underway, and Kawasaki has decided to bring the bike here as a CKD import for the time being. That means the price will not be as tempting as we hoped, at least not at the start. We were given to understand at the launch event that a price between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, ex-showroom, is fair to expect, which is not bad but not great either. We’ll know for sure when Kawasaki formally reveals the price at the India Bike Week in early December. The KLX 230 is a handsome, well-made motorcycle. There are two ways to look at this. The first is that it means the KLX will cost very close to the likes of the Himalayan 450, which will undoubtedly be a turn-off for many. The other perspective is that you’ll finally be able to get your hands on a road-legal, quality Japanese dual-sport for a realistic sum of money, and that will undoubtedly be music to some ears. With the way things currently stand, I believe that this bike will find takers, even if it will be quite niche. However, I also believe that Kawasaki would find more success if they brought in the KLX 230 S as well, which is essentially the same motorcycle with reduced suspension travel and a more palatable 845mm seat height. Nevertheless, what’s without doubt is that we’re lucky to finally have the option of a bike like this, and I’m looking forward to spending more time with it. Also See: Kawasaki KLX230 video review",

    "description": "It isn’t often that a new car impresses me as much as the Toyota Hyryder has. The hybrid’s EV-like initial responses, fuel efficiency that’s better than most frugal diesel cars and a likeable package backed by Toyota are some of the reasons why I persuaded my wife to buy the SUV as soon as it was launched. But while I have one at home, it’s hard to pry it away from my wife. So, I grabbed the keys to the one Toyota lent us as a long-termer. I think the Hyryder’s design is very appealing, and its ‘Speedy Blue’ paint makes it quite striking, too. On the inside, the dashboard and doors have a nice leatherette padding, and the brown and black colour scheme certainly lifts the cabin’s perceived quality. You can’t ignore that it shares many parts with lower-priced Marutis, but it isn’t to the extent of feeling cheap or offensive at its Rs 20 lakh price. The Hyryder’s ergonomics are spot on, with plenty of seat, steering and central armrest adjustment for you to get comfortable. However, the seats aren’t the comfiest, and the cushioning results in some body ache on longer drives. At the rear, space is adequate for two adults – it isn’t as wide as the Creta’s – although six-footers will find headroom tight even with the backrest fully reclined. Soft leatherette materials up the cabin’s premium appeal. After several road trips and airport runs, I can confidently say that with a plus-sized check-in bag in the boot, there’s only about enough room for a laptop bag; you can slide a laptop bag into the slim storage beneath the boot floor, too. On either side of the boot, there’s a deep storage area that is useful to stow smaller items. I must talk about the touchscreen and wireless charger as well; the touchscreen’s software is buggy, resulting in frequent disconnection and low call volume when connected to wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. We hope a software update solves this. The wireless charger is also flawed; it suspends charging often without reason, which is very annoying. Wireless phone charger’s erratic functioning is frustrating. Also, the thin sun shade for the sunroof allows the cabin to be soaked in heat far too quickly when parked outdoors. A high-quality sunfilm on the sunroof could alleviate this issue. Though Toyota has connected car tech, the vehicle locator is the only feature I found useful. It also tells you how much fuel is left and the current range, but I would have liked more information, especially related to fuel efficiency, and a trip log. You can’t unlock the vehicle via the app if you don’t use the app to lock it in the first place, which is quite strange. There is a pre-cooling feature, too, that I’ve used only once. Rounding off the not-so-nice bits, when the engine/generator kicks in to charge the lithium-ion battery, the system occasionally makes quite a few sounds, which can take the uninitiated by surprise, and if you’re paying attention, you’ll also feel some vibrations at idle. Hybrid’s drivability and responsiveness are spot on. Now, let’s talk about the things I really love. The first is performance. A seamless and silent electric startup is something I truly appreciate. Next, the electric motor nicely complements the three-cylinder petrol engine, delivering almost electric vehicle-like responses, making it ideal for closing gaps or when overtaking. The torque curve tapers soon after, and the e-CVT makes the engine rev quite a bit when your foot is pinned to the throttle, emanating a rather unpleasant note. But the highlight is its fuel efficiency. In Eco mode, the best I’ve achieved is 26.5kpl, with 80 percent highway driving and the rest in the city. With no effort to drive with the intent of maximising efficiency, the average city efficiency is about 20-21kpl in winter months, and this number drops to 18-19kpl in summer. An insider at Toyota explained that the e-compressor puts a high load on the hybrid system, which explains the lower efficiency when ambient temperatures are higher. Do note that these numbers are measured using the tankful-to-tankful method. i-Connect app is too basic; more info on efficiency, trip log would’ve been nice. Lastly, the Hyryder’s suspension is on the firmer side, but driving manners and steering make it feel very confident at highway speeds. It also exudes an underlying toughness while dealing with poor, broken roads, which, to some extent, makes it similar to its rugged sibling, the Toyota Fortuner. The Hyryder has been a fill-it, shut-it and forget-it car, one that goes about doing all that’s expected of it in a fuss-free and competent manner.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki’s next big launch for India is the all-new Dzire compact sedan, the prices for which will be announced on November 11. In an earlier story, we had confirmed that Dzire will go on sale in India after Diwali 2024.  New Dzire will be sufficienctly marked out from Swift  Will have more features than outgoing model, including a sunroof  Petrol and petrol-CNG powertrains expected. New Maruti Dzire to look different from Swift With the new Dzire, Maruti will be aiming to take the premium route, especially in terms of design. It will help give a unique identity to the compact sedan, which will look a lot different than the Swift hatchback. However, both models will have a lot in common under the skin. Leaked images that surfaced earlier gave us some hint about the new Dzire’s design. It will feature an Audi-esque nose, a blacked-out horizontally slatted grille with some chrome elements, slim headlights with black bezels and a sportier-looking front bumper. The diamond-cut alloy wheels will be different from the Swift; the all-new wraparound LED tail-lights will get stylish LED outlines and some body parts with more angular creases will further help it differentiate from its hatchback sibling. New Maruti Dzire: expected features  In terms of feature, the new Dzire will get a sunroof and a few other creature comforts over the Swift. Though it will share a lot of its interior with the hatch, it will get lighter shades for the dashboard and upholstery for a premium feel. Features that will be carried over include a 9-inch free-standing touchscreen, automatic climate control and an analogue instrument cluster with a 4.2-inch digital MID. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the new Dzire could get ADAS – at least in the higher variants. New Maruti Dzire: powertrain options  The new Dzire will use the Swift’s 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine. It will come with a petrol-CNG option as well. While the petrol variants will get an automatic gearbox option, the CNG-powered ones will come with a five-speed manual only, as per our sources. Expect Maruti to commence bookings for the new Dzire in the coming weeks, with deliveries starting by around mid-November. Just like the current model, the new Dzire will take on the likes of the Hyundai Aura, Honda Amaze and Tata Tigor. The new Amaze is also due for a global debut in the coming months.

    "description": "The new Kia Carnival has gathered over 3,000 bookings, which is commendable considering prices for the MPV, which had launched less than 20 days ago, start at Rs 63.9 lakh (ex-showroom).  Sources tell us that waiting period for the new Carnival is close to 1 year. Kia Carnival is available in a single fully-loaded variant in India Only two exterior paint shades on offer Kia India looking to increase Carnival production Kia India gearing up for additional demand for Carnival The Carnival is available in a single fully-loaded variant, with just two exterior paint shade options and just a single seven-seat seating layout. Kia India had anticipated a low-volume MPV in terms of sales, and wanted to keep the variant line-up simpler than the outgoing model. Almost 90 percent of the previous-gen Carnival's sales had been the top-end variant, finished in either the black or the white exterior paint shades. Consumer response to the new Carnival has been surprising according to Kia India, considering the brand sold around 3,500 units of the previous-gen MPV during 2022. There is also the fact that the new Carnival‘s price is much higher than the outgoing model. The Carnival is being assembled at Kia India’s plant in Ananthapur, AP from semi-knocked down (SKD) kits. At the moment, the Korean company can assemble around 300 units of the Carnival MPV every month. \"Going by the bookings for the Carnival, which has not seen any cancellations even after the price announcement, we are now looking to increase production of the MPV and have requested the headquarters for more kits,\" said Hardeep S. Brar, the sales and marketing head at Kia Motors India. At Rs 63.9 lakh (ex-showroom), the Carnival doesn't have any direct rival in India as it finds itself sandwiched between the Toyota Innova Hycross (Rs 19.77 lakh-30.98 lakh) at one end, and the Toyota Vellfire (Rs 1.22 crore-1.32 crore) at the other. The brand recently announced that deliveries to customers for the new Carnival have commenced in a phased manner.

    "description": "A custom motorcycle has very little in common with soulless machines like a Toyota Camry or a washing machine, so why would you sell it like one? We pour our hearts, souls and wallets into our bikes, perfecting every detail of form and function, but when it comes time to pass it on to the next owner, too many of us are guilty of doing the bare minimum. When we choose to release a motorcycle from our clutches, it’s usually to fund the next bike, and that’s why all of this matters. As unique as your custom bike is, it’s worthwhile to put extra effort into the sale process—because it’s not just a motorcycle you’re selling—you’re selling your personality, your handiwork and your brand.…",

    "description": "Pierre Terblanche has penned countless motorcycles in his career, but he’s best known for the 11 years he spent at Ducati. In that time, the South African designer became infamous for designing bikes that were polarizing at first but went on to become successful. The Ducati 999’s boxy bodywork and stacked headlights upset Ducati purists, but it was wildly successful on the race track. The Ducati Hypermotard was a massive departure from the Italian marque’s usual fare, but it was immensely popular among riders. And the Ducati Multistrada 1000 DS, although goofy as heck, went on to spawn one of Ducati’s most successful model ranges. There’s a huge difference between the Multistrada 1000 DS and the current range-topping Multistrada V4—both aesthetically and mechanically.…",
