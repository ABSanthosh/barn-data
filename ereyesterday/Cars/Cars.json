    "description": "This 2000 Acura NSX-T was acquired by the seller's late father in 2006, and over the next several years, they spent several weekends caring for and modifying the car, which was inherited by the seller in 2024. Work had involved rebuilding the six-speed manual transaxle, fitting a Science of Speed clutch and lightweight flywheel, and mounting 17\" and 18\" Fikse multi-spoke wheels in addition to installing aftermarket exhaust, suspension, and brake components. The interior has been outfitted with an aftermarket sound system, a Hella horn, a radar detector, and carbon-fiber trim. The car is powered by a 3.2-liter DOHC V6 and further equipped with a limited-slip differential, a removable body-color roof panel, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, and cruise control. This New Formula Red NSX-T shows 76k miles and is now offered with 2017 and 2022 service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Mississippi title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "Ever since it came out in 2022, the Hunter 350 has been a runaway success for Royal Enfield. And it's not hard to see why - it's a stylish, well built and reasonably affordable entry point into one of the most aspirational brands in our market. But that's not to say it was a perfect machine and it did have one significant flaw. Recently, Royal Enfield updated the Hunter with changes that kept customer feedback in mind. So, are the Hunter’s drawbacks a thing of the past now?  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 suspension and ride comfort - 8/10 New shocks offer noticeable improvement in ride comfort What was perhaps the biggest problem on the Hunter (and a number of recent Royal Enfield launches) - the stiff rear suspension. For 2025, the company has replaced the earlier model’s linear springs with these progressive units you see here. And in a word, the effect they've had on the ride quality is landmark!  New progressive springs have transformed the Hunter's ride quality. Whether you're going over big potholes that have started appearing now that the monsoon is here or you're tackling high frequency recurring bumps like thickly painted rumble strips, this rear suspension keeps you reasonably comfortable. Do bear in mind, it's not suddenly become as thoroughly plush as a Classic 350 but the ride comfort on the Hunter is no longer the dealbreaker it once was.  The Hunter's ride quality is no longer the dealbreaker it once was. Even when you’re just sitting on a static bike, you can feel the suspension sagging a little, unlike the previous model. And when you’re tackling uneven patchwork, big potholes, jarring concrete and the myriad of road imperfections that Mumbai’s road infrastructure is littered with, you’re no longer wincing in pain while getting tossed out of the seat like on the older bike. The good news for existing Hunter owners is that you can retrofit these new shocks to an older bike and have this same level of comfort.   Royal Enfield Hunter 350 clutch effort - 9/10 New slip/assist clutch greatly reduces clutch effort, helpful in city traffic Another pain point on the earlier Hunter was its heavy clutch pull, especially inside staccato big city traffic. Royal Enfield has remedied this problem by giving the latest model a slip/assist clutch which has greatly reduced the effort needed to pull in the clutch lever. While it is much lighter (thankfully!) it still has a decent amount of feel. This is especially important because the new riders this bike is aimed at can be deterred by a heavy clutch pull. Slip/assist clutch greatly reduces effort needed to pull the clutch lever, helpful in long traffic jams. And another little cherry atop this cake is that this lighter clutch action will soon be common across RE’s 350cc lineup as they will all be updated with this same slip/assist clutch in the coming months.  More good news is that just like the new suspension units, you can also retrofit this slip/assist clutch to existing Royal Enfield 350cc models. It might not be cheap to do so, but if you spend a lot of time stuck in traffic, your left forearm will thank you for it.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 ride and handling - 8/10 It's wonderfully agile yet never feels unstable  Aside from these two changes, the Hunter is mostly the same as it's always been although there are a few small updates that we’ll talk about further down. This is an accessible and fun machine, and even more so now with our few earlier complaints being addressed.  The Hunter is an agile machine but isn't overly reactive. The best way to describe the Hunter’s demeanour is to say that it is an agile yet surefooted and confidence inspiring machine but not an overly eager one. And that's okay because this is meant to be a relaxed roadster at the end of the day.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 seating comfort - 9/10 Despite its small size, it is roomy for taller riders While it is a compact machine, it's not cramped even for larger riders although with a pillion onboard, it can get a little tight. The company tells us that the handlebar is now a little closer to the rider than before and the seat foam’s density has been reworked, although seat height remains the same at 790mm. The reason behind making these changes has been to improve rider comfort over longer stints in the saddle. Truth be told, the difference is minimal and it's something most riders aren’t likely to notice.  Despite its diminutive size, the Hunter can seat taller riders comfortably. And while it's not aimed at doing long stints in the saddle, you can take the Hunter on longer trips without too much hassle.One change that's sure to help on our unpredictable roads, especially when riding two up or with luggage is the added ground clearance (now up by 10mm to a total of 160mm) Royal Enfield has liberated by rerouting the exhaust piping.  Seat foam density is now revised for added comfort. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 engine sound and refinement - 9/10 Characterful, smooth and torquey, the RE 350cc motor is an absolute peach  One very compelling reason you'd want to take the Hunter on longer rides is that charming engine. It's torquey, smooth, characterful and has a lovely exhaust note to accompany you on your getaways. It remains unchanged with the same 20hp and 27Nm as before. While those numbers aren't spectacular, its the way the torque is delivered, the gentle thump at low speeds and how the motor is absolutely calm at 80-90kph with just a slight pulse through the touch points that makes you want to take the longer route to your destination.  The Hunter's exhaust note also sounds remarkably different to the other 350s and has more of a fast-paced beat to suit its demeanour than its more relaxed siblings.  Royal Enfield Hunter 350 headlight performance - 7/10 New LED headlight looks good but its performance is rather average The final change on the Hunter 350 is the LED headlight and this is the same unit that has come from the shared RE parts bin. The previous model’s halogen setup worked well at lighting up a dark road and this new LED headlight provides rather average illumination in comparison to it. That being said, from a purely visual standpoint, the LED suits the modern look of the Hunter more than the earlier bulb headlight. LED headlight looks good but illumination is adequate and is the same as almost every other RE. Royal Enfield Hunter 350 price and verdict - 9/10 Lot of changes for a small increase in price, its a properly compelling option now Summing up, the Hunter 350 is now a really sorted machine and the best part is that Royal Enfield has only increased the price by Rs 7,000 for the mid and top variants, while keeping the starting price the same as it was before. As before, the difference between the mid and top versions is only in the colour schemes. Meanwhile, the base bike has simpler switchgear, wire spoked wheels with tubed tyres and single-channel ABS owing to the rear drum brake. The Hunter is a stylish and well-built machine. With this update, most of the Hunter’s flaws have been ironed out and it's encouraging to see a big company like Royal Enfield address customer feedback so comprehensively. As it stands today, the Hunter is one of the most compelling options in its class and it will surely become an even bigger success for Royal Enfield.  Also See: 2025 Royal Enfield Hunter 350 video review",

    "description": "This feels familiar. This time last year, I was right here, at the CoASTT high-performance centre, sweltering heat searing my skin, with the keys to a 911 in my hands. I was giddy with excitement then, and I am once again now. The difference is that last year, I had for company what I consider the pinnacle of modern 911 engineering, the mighty GT3 RS, and as the Porsche nerds among you know, that version comes near the end of the car’s mid-life cycle. So now the model range has been reset, and we’ve gone from the top of the pecking order back down to the bottom with this 992.2 Carrera. Porsche 911 Carrera exterior design and engineering Only aficionados will spot the wider LEDs that mark out the 992.2. Don’t let the dramatic wing fool you – this isn’t a GT3 but rather a Rs 11 lakh aero kit option.In fact, in classic Porsche fashion, there are a lot of options you can add to your Carrera (this car has Rs 67 lakh worth) to help make it look, feel and perform better. But I’m here to tell you that, even if you don’t, through the power of immaculate engineering, you will still be in possession of one of the finest sports cars on the planet. DRLs, indicators moved into headlamp, so bumper is free for aero, cooling. One of the most underappreciated facets of a 911, I find, is how easy it is for anyone to just get in and go fast. Stepping in, it immediately feels welcoming and familiar. But even if you’ve never driven one before, the great forward visibility, thin A-pillars, visual markers in the form of the raised fenders, a driving position that’s not overly aggressive, a slim-rimmed steering wheel, and an uncluttered dashboard ease you in. Porsche 911 Carrera interior and features Like all modern cars, it too has succumbed to screens; the 10.9-inch touchscreen returns, and behind the steering wheel, the wonderful central analogue tachometer has met its inevitable demise, replaced by a full-digital screen. But even here, Porsche has to be applauded for keeping both screens simple, legible and free of distraction. Sacrilege! Iconic five dials go full digital but remain easy to read. The PCM (Porsche Communication Management; how German) 6.0 interface is one of the cleanest and least complicated while still being packed with features. And though they’ve gone digital, the dials still look like ‘dials’, albeit with a number of configurations, ranging from the classic 911 5-dial setup to a full map display. You can even reorient the tacho to have the redline at the top of the circle. Tactile, twist-to-start knob replaced by boring starter button. There are now no rear seats by default, but they can be optioned for no cost. However, a change I’m less enthused about is the switch from the twist-to-start ignition knob to a regular start/stop button; a small but annoying blow to driver involvement. Porsche 911 Carrera performance and refinement Porsche 911 Carrera specsLength/width/height 4582mm/1852mm/1302mm Wheelbase 2450mmEngineFlat-six, 2981cc, twin-turbo petrol Power 394hp at 7,500rpm Torque 450Nm at 2,000-5,000rpm Gearbox8-speed dual-clutch auto Kerb weight 1520kg 0-100kph 3.9 seconds (claimed)Economy 9.6kpl (WLTP) While on the topic, does choosing the ‘lowly’ Carrera rob you of even more driver involvement? The twin-turbo 3.0-litre flat-six certainly doesn’t disappoint. 394hp and 450Nm might sound meek in absolute sports car terms, but trust me when I say they’re more than plenty. Even out on the race track, where all but the fastest cars can feel slow, it never feels lacking. 911 hallmarks remain: great visibility, pointy front end, perfect driving position. Maybe it’s the tremendous sound from the optional sports exhaust, the instantaneous responses, or the ceaseless thrust you get all the way to 7,500rpm. It’s not the goosebump-inducing 4.0-litre naturally aspirated screamer you find in the GT3s, but it doesn’t fall far behind. You could even argue that its more accessible power makes it better for everyday use. Incidentally, compared to the old 992.1 Carrera, they didn’t just pump up the boost pressure and call it a day. It’s got different turbos, borrowed from the outgoing 911 GTS, and new intercoolers out of the Turbo S. Porsche 911 Carrera ride and handling Fantastic as the engine is, I’d argue that what truly makes a 911 is the chassis, and I’m happy to report that it is, as ever, impeccable. A downside is you can’t specify any handling-enhancing options on a Carrera, as you can on higher 911s. Adaptive dampers are standard, but not on the options menu are PDCC (active roll stabilisation), PCCB (carbon-ceramic brakes) or, most disappointingly, rear-wheel steering. Balanced as it is, a firm prod will swing its heavy rear around like a pendulum. So, it’s a testament to how solid the core setup is that it doesn’t suffer for this. 60 years of honing has turned an inherently unbalanced weight distribution into a deftly balanced one. It’s slightly pendulous, not overwhelmingly so, with the rear-engine layout helping the back of the car be a little livelier around corners. The steering has heft and is supremely communicative.  As ever, no engine weight at the front means the steering remains uncorrupted. It’s sharp, it’s got heft, and it is full of micro-communications fed directly to your palms. The car’s limits are high but also clearly spelled out, so as I approach them on the fast right-hander that is C1, I know almost instinctively how far down the throttle travel my foot has to be to induce some oversteer without overcooking it. You gotta love track time! Porsche 911 Carrera price and verdict Really, there’s nothing entry-level about the new Porsche 911 Carrera then. Certainly not its Rs 2.11 crore starting price (ex-showroom); that was how much a previous-gen Turbo cost when it was new. And, of course, once you start rummaging through the options list, the sky is the limit. The base Carrera offers 85 percent of the 911 experience.   Though we didn’t drive it on the road much, you already know what to expect there. The nose-lift kit is an essential option to tick. The ride quality is firm but compliant – stay away from the larger wheel size if that’s a concern. The front boot is more spacious than its 135 litres would suggest. But the simple fact that it’s got me grinning as wide as I was last year with the GT3 RS – and without pulverising me along the way – speaks volumes. It tells me that the humble Carrera is 85 percent of the way there, and moving up the range is an exercise in diminishing returns. That’s not to say you won’t get more out of a Turbo S or a GT3 or even a GTS t-hybrid; but rather that you can’t go wrong with any 911.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/real-legacy-woodstock-how-subaru-cracked-liberal-america",
    "description": "The New York town that hosted the legendary music festival loves a 4WD wagon – all thanks to clever marketing \"It’s a tie-dye sort of place,\" says the woman behind the counter of a petrol station cafe in upstate New York when I ask her what Woodstock is like, because it’s nearby and my road trip has no definitive destination. I’d thought it was just a quaint town near the Catskill Mountains, but when she explains, I realise it’s that Woodstock – the one from the famous 1960s rock festival that promised ‘three days of peace and music’ and whose cultural impact shook the world. But despite the fact that the festival actually took place 60 miles from Woodstock and was 56 years ago, the town clearly retains its ‘peace and love’ vibe. My server wasn’t wrong. It’s normal to see Trump flags and signs in rural New York, because it’s the big city that’s the state’s most liberal part and Americans are more vocally political than the British; an occasional ‘Liberal Democrats Winning Here’ sticker is about as boisterous as we get. But you won’t find many Republican signs near Woodstock. “Presidents come and go, but Wu-Tang is forever,” reads one alternative. “Make America groovy again,” adds a CND-symbolled T-shirt in a shop window. Aside from the city, Woodstock is in one of New York’s most liberal areas: it voted 58% Democrat in the 2024 presidential election. And it is to America what Glastonbury is to England: almost a parody of peace and love. On this Sunday afternoon there is, honestly, a drum circle on the village green, which is bordered by a vegan cafe and a herbal remedy shop. Then I notice something else: the Subarus. Lots and lots of Subarus. More in one place than anywhere I’ve ever been, by miles. In one car park (I realise this isn’t a scientifically rigorous survey), almost 20% of the cars are Subarus. It turns out that this isn’t entirely coincidental. This is a fact more widely known in the US than it is in the UK: in the 1990s, Subaru of America surveyed who was buying its cars, and while it had expected the vets, outdoorsy types and teachers it identified as customers, there was also a group that it hadn’t foreseen: lesbians. When it and its marketing agencies looked into this, the fit made sense: these were women with decent incomes who were less likely to have children and who had outdoorsy hobbies, so Subarus were what they were buying. Subaru figured that, while there might be pushback in conservative areas, it should start running gay-targeted adverts, combining selling the virtues of the car as a country wagon with a knowing wink for its target audience. “Get out, and stay out,” ran one advert. “It’s not a choice, it’s the way we’re built,” said another, sort of selling the 4x4 powertrain. “At least we’ve got our *priorities* straight,” read a 2004 Forester advert ostensibly about safety. While Subaru UK was selling Impreza Turbos to young men who couldn’t get a girlfriend, Subaru of America was selling Outbacks to women who could. It had thought its campaign might be divisive, and it wasn’t wrong. Lots of consumers, target audience or not, enjoyed the ads, but it also received letters of complaint from conservatives threatening to boycott the brand – although, its research suggested, not from anyone who had previously bought a Subaru anyway. And those turn-of-the-century adverts gave the brand a reputation in the US that it retains now. If you’re liberal, you’re more likely to buy a Subaru; if you’re conservative, you’re more likely to take against it. Opinion polling firm YouGov’s bipartisan brand rankings for 2024 found that “28% of liberal Americans [and 33% of gay women] would consider purchasing a Subaru but just 16% of American conservatives feel the same”. Subaru leads all car makers with this 12-point difference, ahead of Honda (10 points) and Volkswagen (eight). For conservatives’ most favoured brands – Ford, Chevrolet and GMC – the difference the other way was smaller: 29% of conservatives would consider a Ford but so still would 23% of liberals. There are practical reasons to own a Subaru in the north-eastern US, of course: they have proper four-wheel drive and it snows in winter. But that isn’t the only explanation for the fact that, while most small American towns reverberate to the sound of Detroit V8s, the bongos of Woodstock are accompanied by the gentle hum of a Subaru’s sensible all-season tyres.",

    "description": "Peugeot’s and Citroën’s pared-back takes on the hot hatch theme still hit the spot today In the 1990s, soaring insurance costs put paid to affordable hot hatch fun – until this duo arrived The 1990s wasn’t the friendliest environment for hot hatchbacks. The previous decade had bred some of the genre’s biggest icons, but an epidemic of thefts and spiralling insurance costs began to stifle car makers’ swagger. The Golf GTI, a pioneer of the formula, was softened in its third generation, while the Escort Cosworth’s irresistibility to more than its paying customers meant Ford’s follow-ups lost their lustre too. Thankfully, towards the decade’s close, rescue came from a reliable source of inexpensive fun: the French. The cars you see here were not only dinky in size and affordable, but their running costs were also attainable by everyday folk. The Citroën Saxo VTS was flung to the top of the hot hatch sales charts by its now ludicrous-sounding free insurance deals, which, allied to its slim list price, lured in a younger demographic than that of the new car norm. The Peugeot 106 GTi was a bit less bargain-bucket in its approach, but it is rumoured to have lowered its premiums another way. While the pair share the same genes, right down to identical four-cylinder engines, there was a minor gulf in their performance figures – chiefly the 106 taking half a second longer to hit 60mph than its non-identical twin. The internet is awash with speculation about why that was the case, but the pair claim identical gear ratios, quelling any suggestions the Saxo could hit the accelerative benchmark with just one gearchange. That only throws more weight behind the old wives’ theory that Peugeot started the stopwatch with more ballast on board in order to sandbag its car into a lower insurance group. Either way, these are both joyously simple devices at their core. Each deploys a 120bhp 1.6-litre 16-valve naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine that is allied to a short-stacked five-speed manual gearbox and powering the front wheels bereft of complicated electronics or intelligent differential set-ups to interrupt the process. Their suspension set-ups are a mix of off-the-shelf struts, trailing arms and a torsion bar. Their exterior designs don’t feel too far from the regular parts locker, either: there are no wider tracks or requisite swelled arches, no muscular bonnet humps or indeed much you would describe as ‘bodykit’. Their 14in alloys look delightfully restrained now but surely acted as placeholders for 1990s buyers itching to redeem their Demon Tweeks gift card. It’s small wonder cars such as these were quickly modified to the hilt, no doubt tearing those noble insurability claims into tatters. That does, however, make it ever trickier to hunt down examples that haven’t been tuned, crashed or eaten by corrosion. The pair we have here must be among Britain’s very best remaining examples of each, and they both represent the apples of their respective owner’s eye. The 1999 106 GTi has joined us from South Wales, where Carl Lampard has kept it for seven years, fully repainting it in its dazzling Sundance Yellow during a restoration to borderline brand- new condition. Everything, down  to its official 106 GTi mats, looks as standard as the day it was born. The 1997 Saxo VTS driven up from the south coast by Zac Jiggins is more demure still, a very early Quartz Silver car lacking even a rear spoiler to hint at any aggression beneath. He has owned his Citroën for five years, and it arrives in front of photographer Jack’s camera fresh from an engine rebuild to ensure it feels as factory-fit as it looks. Both Carl and Zac appear too young to have lusted after these cars new but, crucially, they’re pouring their time and money into faithfully maintaining their original condition now. A true antithesis to the clientele who could have got their modifying mitts on these cars new. Two special cars, then, ensuring today isn’t about cutting the same outlandish shapes as Tiff Needell on Autocar’s £15,000 performance mega-test around Rockingham in 2003, when these cars laid waste to some huge names to finish fourth and fifth out of 25 cars. Yep, 25 sub-£15k cars. You can barely get a base-spec Dacia for £15k now. While the Saxo nipped ahead of the 106 on that occasion, the pair exchanged places in our affections across their six years on sale to hammer home with conviction just how closely related they are beneath their skin. Yet flick through any period magazine and you will discover they offered quite different driving experiences: the Citroën is more agile, exciting and occasionally wayward, while the Peugeot operates with a mite more professionalism to serve up even greater thrills (at least on the road) with its greater breadth of ability in all conditions. What united them both were lap times that outgunned more muscular competition: their flyweight physiques, keenly revving engines and hyperactive handling propelled them around racetracks with the startled energy of a fly stuck in a hot room. Once again, the truth behind their handing differences is argued at length online, but the debate appears to focus on the 106 getting grippier tyres from the factory – and there are plenty of forum anecdotes of both cars exhibiting frenzied (or downright frightening) lift-off oversteer during ownership. Today, we have a grubby British morning to ride their waves of excitement and see how they each stack up almost 30 years after their respective launches. What they both share is an upright driving position and a cramped, offset pedal box. That you can still heel and toe with such a tiny throttle is a credit to the sharpness and accuracy of the controls beneath your feet. They possess similar steering wheels too, each perfectly proportioned and sited ahead of an attractive set of Jaeger dials with alternative colour schemes. Cute immobiliser keypad aside, the Saxo cuts a more modern dashboard aesthetic, while the 106 visibly shares vents and controls with Peugeots from a decade before to betray the fact that GTi trim arrived with the 106’s mid-life facelift, while the Saxo was fresh on the market. I begin in the Peugeot, its hardened four-cylinder soundtrack and vibrant paint ensuring it buzzes down the road like an angry little hornet. Its steering is quick, alert and full of feel, while its modest 107lb ft of torque vastly over-delivers with less than a tonne to propel. The gearshift is a little notchy and a far cry from the slicker shifts we’ve enjoyed in more modern and sophisticated hatches since, but the GTi is already a delightful palate cleanser that still feels quick enough to be relevant. True to form, the Saxo is immediately more agile. It points so incisively into corners that you’re almost caught off guard, while the rear wheels lighten with just a hint of a relaxed throttle. With more aggression, you can sense its bum poised to pivot round at the point the 106 is still working its grip more evenly across all four wheels. This is in mostly dry conditions, but were there more rain, I sense a perkier, perhaps meaner streak, is lurking within the VTS. Yet it’s probably more addictive as a result, a live wire in which it is hard to resist upping your game while at the wheel. It charges hard even with a polite 5000rpm cap to avoid punishing Zac’s refreshed engine, and it eagerly matches the Peugeot’s enthusiasm. The Citroën has the smoother, neater gearshift of the pair and feels the more refined and finessed car to operate, despite the potential mischief barely concealed beneath. Both of them proudly demonstrate the endless benefits of making a car small, light and agile, and while they probably wouldn’t impress the Euro NCAP testers now, each has airbags, ABS and luxuries such as electric windows and power steering to prove they were always value propositions rather than outright cheap. Each rides well on its 185/55 tyres and is narrow and nimble enough to snick around potholes anyway, negotiating the worst of broken British B-roads in its own inimitable way. On quicker asphalt they will both buzz away above 3000rpm during a 70mph cruise, and you’d need a strong resolve to daily one now – not least because you’d be exposing an appreciating asset to the grit and grime of a British winter. The Saxo VTS is the flamboyant extrovert, a car that’s truly got under my skin on these tight Somerset lanes, while the 106 GTi is the more precise and accurate device, though still emboldened with a sense of humour. It feels like it would make a superior circuit toy, allowing you to bombilate around your local track evening without spending a fortune on fuel and tyres – not to mention doing so while embarrassing quicker and pricier cars in the process, just like this pair of French fancies did in those turn-of-the-century track tests. Ultimately these saviours of the affordable hot hatch remain enticing for more than simply their valour. I’ll take one of each.",

    "description": "Taking on someone else’s motorcycle project is a gamble. Low prices can lull you into a false sense of security, especially when you’re motivated and capable—two qualities that Gas \u0026 Oil Bespoke Motorcycles have in abundance. Polished, high-end custom motorcycles are Gas \u0026 Oil’s usual fare, so this fantastically filthy Honda XL500 flat tracker is a little left field for them. It was originally delivered to their Prague workshop in numerous boxes, but because it was an XL500 and the price was right, shop boss Matěj Sysel bought it. As soon as the basket case was spread out on the workshop floor, the team experienced the more painful side of buying an unfinished project; numerous parts were broken or missing. With this realization, the excitement of a new project waned, and the Honda XL500 was mothballed until they could decide what to do with it.…",

    "description": "Based in Hangzhou, China, the mononymous RoninSu doesn’t have a bona fide workshop. But what he does have, is a wild imagination, a handful of handy skills, and an undying devotion to choppers. Those qualities have culminated in this nutty Honda Cub chopper. Built by RoninSu over six months, the stretched Honda underbone has more chopper swagger than some bikes twice its size. As far as RoninSu is concerned, the key to building a radical chopper is getting the ingredients right. “In my opinion, chopper building is an art of subtraction,” he explains, “but that doesn’t mean you don’t consider every detail and proportion. Each step of the process requires careful consideration before it can be executed.” RoninSu may have started the project with a humble Honda Cub, but very little of the donor bike remains.…",

    "description": "Hyundai is planning to bring the Bayon compact SUV to India next year, and it’s expected to be powered by a brand-new 1.2-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, Autocar India can exclusively confirm. As we reported last year, the Bayon is a global model that’s built on the same platform as the i20, and will serve as Hyundai’s rival to the popular Maruti Suzuki Fronx in India when it launches here in mid-2026. Upcoming Hyundai Bayon to utilise brand-new 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine Hyundai will build the engine in India; it will be hybrid-ready and stronger than 1.0 turbo The Bayon may offer both the 1.2-litre and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol powertrains Hyundai Bayon engine and gearbox New Hyundai 1.2-litre engine to slot in between carmaker's current turbo motors Earlier today, we broke the news of Hyundai developing a new locally-built 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine for the Indian market, which will slot in between the Korean carmaker’s current 1.0-litre turbo-petrol (used in the Venue and i20) and the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol (used in the Creta, Verna, and Alcazar) units. This 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine will offer greater torque and drivability than the 1.0-litre unit (120hp, 172Nm), whilst being more compact and fuel-efficient than the 1.5-litre motor (160hp, 253Nm). It’s also being engineered to be hybrid-ready, and so will likely be crucial to Hyundai’s future hybrid powertrains. As it stands, the transmission options for the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine could include a dual-clutch automatic or an e-CVT, depending upon the use case. Bayon could get both 1.2-litre and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engines According to our sources, the new engine is expected to power the 2026-bound Hyundai Bayon, as well as future iterations of the i20, Venue, and other models that fall in the Rs 15-20 lakh price bracket. Hyundai is gearing up to launch the next-gen Venue in October 2025, so it remains to be seen if the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine debuts with the compact SUV. The Bayon is available with the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine with a 6-speed manual and 7-speed DCT in overseas markets, so these powertrains may be offered in the India-spec version as well. Hyundai Bayon exterior design Sleek and futuristic styling Up front, the Bayon’s styling closely resembles that of the Verna, thanks to a split-headlight setup comprising an LED strip on the bonnet and angular main units underneath. There’s also a wide honeycomb-patterned air dam, with silver trim and black plastic cladding that wraps all around the body. Over to the side, the Bayon gets 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels and several cuts and creases, and at the rear, the compact SUV has a blacked-out section housing rakish boomerang-shaped tail-lamps connected by an LED strip, with indicators, black cladding, and silver trim on the bumper. Hyundai Bayon interior and features 10.25-inch infotainment screen, Bose sound system, and more The Bayon’s all-black cabin shares a lot of components with Hyundai models, such as the familiar four-spoke steering wheel, 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, HVAC control panel, etc. Other creature comforts include wireless charging, connected car tech, over-the-air (OTA) updates, fast-charging USB Type-C ports, ambient lighting, ADAS, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, and more. The Bayon also gets a 411-litre boot. Also see: Hyundai India's 26 product launch onslaught by 2030 decoded New Hyundai Verna SX+ trim launched at Rs 13.79 lakh",

    "description": "The Hyundai Exter sub-compact SUV and the Verna mid-size sedan are set to get mid-cycle facelifts by next year. Both models had launched in India in 2023, and the arrival of refreshed models just 3 years after indicates Hyundai India is accelerating its product lifecycles. Hyundai Verna facelift expected to get new front end Likely to retain 1.5-litre petrol and turbo-petrol engines Hyundai Exter facelift also likely to retain 1.2-litre petrol and CNG options Hyundai Verna facelift details Changes are expected to be cosmetic only IMAGE SOURCE: Rushlane Recent spy shots that surfaced online show that the refreshed Verna is likely to look quite similar to the current model from the rear and the sides. The facelift for the fourth-gen model wears heavily camouflage, but the details that can be gleaned include tail-lights that seem to be very similar, the same 16-inch alloy wheels, and a slightly tweaked rear bumper. We expect most of the design changes to feature on the front-end as the current Verna has an aggressive-looking nose that polarises opinion. The interior is not expected to change much, though the features list and amount of safety kit is likely to expand. The current Verna’s 115hp, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol and the 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine options are also expected to continue unchanged. While the NA engine has a CVT auto option and the turbocharged unit has a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox option, both get a 6-speed manual as standard. With the facelift, the Honda City, Volkswagen Virtus and Skoda Slavia rival’s price will increase from the current Rs 11.07 lakh-17.58 lakh. Hyundai Exter facelift details Current Exter used for representation only. Hyundai’s answer to the Tata Punch and entry-level versions of the Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger is also likely to get cosmetic changes only with the facelift. There’s little information about the refreshed Exter available, but more features, new upholstery and additional safety kit could be made available. The current model’s 1.2-litre engine – which makes 83hp on petrol and 69hp on CNG – is expected to continue, along with the manual and AMT options for the petrol mill. The Exter facelift will command a premium over the current car's Rs 6.00 lakh-10.51 lakh price range.
