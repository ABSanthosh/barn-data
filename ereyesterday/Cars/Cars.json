    "description": "This ex-works 1993 Alfa Romeo SZ is #1,004 of 1,036 examples produced over a three-year model run, and just one of approximately 20 Trofeo cars built for the single-make Zagato Trophy series. The car was assembled for use in a support race held during the 1993 Formula One Monaco Grand Prix weekend and later driven as part of various Italian Supercar GT series races. Following its use as a factory-owned race car, the car was acquired by former Formula One driver Andrea de Adamich, who retained stewardship until 2007. It was purchased by the current owner from a Dutch collector in 2014. Finished in a red and white livery, the car is powered by a 3.0-liter Busso V6 mated to a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. It rides on 16\" OZ wheels and is further equipped with adjustable coilover suspension, a rear spoiler, a CSC muffler, and an auxiliary oil cooler. Inside, a pair of AP Sport fixed-back bucket seats is accompanied by multi-point harnesses, a roll cage, and a two-spoke MOMO steering wheel. Now showing 23k kilometers (~14k miles), this SZ Trofeo is offered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a specification sheet from Centro Documentazione Alfa Romeo, service records, and German registration in the owner's name.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-i-love-tools-and-not-just-fixing-my-cars",
    "description": "Tools are the gateway to mending and repairing all manner of things I am going to talk cars in a moment, I promise, but it’s front of mind: the other week I had to put up a gatepost. Or rather two of them, joined back to back, at a pretty normal height of 1.5m but overall a hefty 20cm by 40cm thick. I knew I’d need tools for this. In no definitive order, I needed a tape measure, T-square, spirit level, sledgehammer, ratchet strap, chainsaw, drill (with a very long bit), spanner (preferably ratchet), club hammer and crosshead screwdriver and coach bolts. If I’d been missing any single item, the job would have gone, by varying degrees, from slightly more difficult to nearly impossible. And had I been missing anything, I wouldn’t have tried it, and the only tool I’d have used instead would have been a telephone. If there’s something I find utterly exasperating (I’ll admit that’s quite a lot of things these days), it’s not being able to do a job because I’m missing the right kit. And so as a result: I love tools. It’s not so much that I adore the tools themselves, not in the way I love cars. I don’t spend hours poring over the Screwfix or Machine Mart websites in the way I might the Caterham or Indian motorcycle configurators. I don’t lovingly polish my trolley jack of an evening [I’ve tried various tools there to find one that doesn’t sound too much like a euphemism]. I just love what tools allow me to do. Although, given that they’re tools, perhaps by definition that amounts to the same thing. If the feeling is analogous to the one I get from cars, it’s that tools provide a sense of freedom. I can make things, and I’ll enjoy it. I can repair things, and while I might not enjoy it because it gets in the way of a cup of tea and an episode of Yellowstone, I have options on how, when and perhaps how affordably a fix will happen. And maybe I’ll learn something on the way, too. And without tools, there are some things I simply wouldn’t have: a greenhouse, a stocked woodshed, a sim rig for Gran Turismo, a dining room table that will outlive me, two modified cars and a motorcycle that lives in a shelter I made for it. I once saw a sign that said something to the effect that you have to be practical if you aren’t rich, because the other way to create or maintain nice things is to do the work yourself. Pretty cheesy. A sort of ‘live, love, laugh’ for the spiritual shed owner. But I kind of get it.  Tools have given me countless days skinning knuckles, learning new swear words and undergoing serious self-esteem issues. But the sense of satisfaction at the end when, finally, something works that didn’t, or something exists that didn’t, is unbeatable.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/where-i-go-yo-go-exploring-london-electric-golf-buggy",
    "description": "Yo-go buggies have been launched across west London as part of a trial London’s pay-as-you-go personal transport mix has got a new player in the form of Yo-Go’s electric golf buggies Bus, bike and underground are just three of the ways you can travel around London – and now there’s another: golf cart. There are currently 10 of the yellow electric buggies, operated by Yo-Go and scurrying around Hammersmith and Fulham, as part of a trial launched in September 2024. The idea sounds bonkers, but once you’ve driven one, it soon makes sense. Each buggy can carry two people plus their luggage. They’re restricted to the prevailing speed limit of 20mph, but because they’re partially open to the elements, they feel faster. They can be driven by anyone aged between 25 and 70 who has held a UK driving licence for more than two years. The hire charge – 10p per minute for subscribers paying a £10 monthly fee, or 20p a minute for non-subscribers – includes insurance with a £250 excess. When the vehicle is parked, the hire charge falls to 5p per minute. These rates make the buggies cheaper to use than a Lime e-bike or Zipcar Flex. To drive a Yo-Go buggy you need to have registered as a user by submitting your licence and payment details, national insurance number and postcode. Approval takes 24 hours. You will find the vehicles (there are plans to increase the currently small fleet to 70) in dedicated parking bays dotted around Hammersmith and Fulham. Find one, scan the QR code on the side of it or select the vehicle on the Yo-Go app to unlock it (just like a car, each buggy has a registration number) and your hire session begins, ending only when you return the vehicle to the parking bay. Future plans include allowing users to park them where they choose, perhaps on their street, meaning that a buggy would be available for a group of households. In Hammersmith and Fulham the buggies enjoy free parking, but elsewhere parking becomes chargeable. The brains behind the Yo-Go buggies is Samuel Bailey. The automotive engineer wanted to give Londoners an alternative to the expensive electric car and found the answer in China, where the buggies are built by a company called Marshell. Each has a small 5kWh battery powering a 4kW electric motor and giving a range of 30 miles. Charging is via London’s lamp-post network or a roof-mounted solar panel, which, after a day’s sunshine, can provide a six-mile top-up. However, for all its clever electronics, a Yo-Go buggy is still a golf cart, right? In fact, the vehicle is homologated for UK roads, so it’s now classified as an L6e quadricycle. Its body has been redesigned, too, to make it more practical and weatherproof. Even so, my fear of being the laughing stock of the capital’s road users is not helped by the sight of my test buggy awaiting me at Yo-Go’s Parsons Green parking spot. The small vehicle looks only a couple of rungs up the evolutionary ladder from the rickshaws that clog London’s West End. And what city needs yet another electric ‘personal mobility’ solution? My scepticism isn’t helped by the buggy’s questionable weather protection, its basic plastic interior (although the two seats look comfortable) and its twin rear-mounted boots, which can’t be locked. At least the foot pedals marked ‘Stop’ and ‘Go’ appear to be foolproof and, save for indicators and a windscreen wiper, there are few extras to distract the inexperienced driver. Driving the buggy is just a case of ‘unlocking’ it, belting up, selecting D for drive and pressing the Go pedal. Thanks to its low weight, the buggy surges forward effortlessly; helped by fairly aggressive brake regen, it stops easily too. Independent front suspension absorbs the worst of the area’s battered roads, and although the buggy is narrow, its track is just wide enough to clear speed cushions. Its ‘chunky wheel at each corner’ design means the buggy can turn on a sixpence, while its low centre of gravity keeps it from rolling excessively in tight corners. It’s fun to drive, aided by excellent visibility. To my relief, it attracts positive reactions from drivers and pedestrians. In fact, the nimble, space-efficient and environmentally friendly buggy seems the natural choice compared with the large, heavy cars jostling for space around it. “Users love them,” says Bailey. “Each of the 10 buggies is booked out around three times a day, and we have around 5000 registered users. They include everyone from parents doing the school run and carers visiting patients to builders who take public transport and use the buggy to collect materials.” On the question of buggies one day being abandoned like e-cycles, Bailey says the fact that they’re registered to the user will prevent that. He’s confident the security tech he’s designed and installed will make them theft-proof too, although that’s what mighty JLR used to say about its security… Meanwhile, with little weather protection available, he urges users to dress appropriately. Only time will tell whether his Yo-Go buggies are a solution to a problem or just another piece of city clutter, but on the strength of Autocar’s drive, they deserve a chance.",

    "description": "First released in 2020, the MV Agusta Superveloce is one of the most spectacular bikes the Varese firm has produced in the last decade. It’s an enchanting blend of retro charm and modern style, and it’s high on the list of exotic machines that would be parked in the mythical Bike EXIF garage (or living room). MV Agusta has been making subtle upgrades to the Superveloce ever since it launched. Now, they’ve unveiled the most exclusive version of it yet—the 2025 MV Agusta Superveloce 1000 Ago. Just look at it. MV Agusta and Giacomo Agostini go together like Coke and vanilla ice cream; each is great on its own, but together, they’re unstoppable. Agostini’s motorcycle racing career was legendary. He won 15 World Championship titles, had 123 World Championship race wins, 18 Italian Championship titles, and even achieved 10 Tourist Trophy wins.…",

Depicted as a bird, it is believed that he may have been the original inspiration for the legend of the phoenix—which is exactly why the owner of this enchanting 1978 Harley-Davidson Shovelhead named it after him. Even though the donor bike was almost a half-century old, this story of rebirth has less to do with the bike’s restoration, and more to do with the man behind it. It comes from Hideki Hoshikawa, founder of the Japanese custom shop Asterisk Custom Works. And it’s the first time in six years that he’s attempted a build of this scale. Hoshikawa-san’s last ground-up vintage Harley was an equally majestic hardtail, nicknamed Jenny Lind, which debuted at that year’s Yokohama Hot Rod Custom Show.…",

    "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

    "description": "Happy tenth birthday to the Bentley Bentayga! It’s hard to believe the SUV has been around this long, and over the years, it has seen many powertrains, a much-needed facelift, and the addition of an extended-wheelbase version. But while it was a pioneer of sorts when it was launched, a decade on, the market is flooded with super-luxury sports SUVs. So, as a sort of birthday present to itself, the performance-oriented Speed variant has been reintroduced, albeit repositioned slightly to help it stand out better in a crowded marketplace. Where the previous Speed represented the ultimate in Bentley excess, the new one leans more into its sporty side. The W12 engine has been replaced by the twin-turbo V8, albeit without the hybrid system of the Continental GT Speed, the suspension has been stiffened, and almost all mechanical aspects of the car have been retuned to make it more agile, more responsive and more emotional. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed exterior design and engineering – 8/10 Bigger wheel option adds drama to an SUV already high on road presence. Optional 23-inch wheels are largest ever on a Bentley. You’ll have to be well versed in Bentley’s various model lines to identify the Bentayga Speed, because the visual cues are few and subtle, and much can be changed in customisation. For example, red brake calipers are standard on the Speed, but you can specify other colours. You can also specify silicon carbide brake discs – the largest in the world, measuring 440mm at the front. You can also option 23-inch wheels for the first time ever on a Bentley – finished here in Grey Satin – and these do well to highlight the Speed’s added performance. There are ‘Speed’ badges on the front doors of course, and by default, bright chrome is replaced by dark chrome, the headlamp internals are dark, while the tail-lamp lenses are clear. Headlamp internals get a darkened finish on the Speed variant. These changes aside, there are of course different bumpers on the Speed compared to other Bentaygas, and the options list does include a few unique extras. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed interior space and comfort – 8/10 Classy place to spend time, enhanced with a few sportier trim options. The Bentayga Speed is not available in EWB guise, but don’t think that means it is short on space, comfort or luxury. The rear seat can be had as a single bench or a split, two-seat layout with powered chairs, heating, ventilation and massage, and a fixed centre console between them. These offer exceptional support and comfort, ‘Speed’ embroidered into the seatbacks and the option of sportier upholstery options, like Alcantara. You get the option of a panoramic sunroof as well, and powered window blinds and a touchscreen controller are also part of the package. The Speed is not available in EWB guise, but there's no shortage of space or comfort.  Quality is, expectedly, exceptional, save for the front centre console, which as in all Bentleys, continues to be plagued by very ordinary-looking plastic buttons. Elsewhere though, you’ll find thick hides, generous cross stitching, shiny chrome and vast customisation possibility (although not quite as much as in the range-topping Mulliner variant). This includes a huge choice of trim levels, including stone instead of wood – something unique to Bentley. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed features and safety – 8/10 Good amount of standard features, and lots more possible via the options list. As with any luxury vehicle these days, prepare to spend for additional specification and personalisation, but in the Bentayga Speed, the upgrades are more performance oriented. That said, the standard specification for the SUV appears to be pretty generous as well. It includes a 590W, 12-speaker audio system (20-speaker Naim audio is optional), Matrix LED headlamps, 8 airbags, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, park assist, onboard Wifi and a digital assistant. Centre console still retains tactile physical controls for essential functions. The 10.9-inch central touchscreen will be familiar if you’ve used other VW Group luxury cars, and the layout is generally simple and easy to navigate. Bentley must be credited here for providing tactile physical controls on the centre console for all essential functions and then some. The digital driver’s display has also come a long way in a decade and now has several customisable displays, including some unique to the Speed, all of which look sensational. There’s also a heads-up display, and while clean looking, it doesn’t show you a whole lot of information; there’s an ADAS suite on offer as well. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed performance and refinement – 8/10 Feels strong and surprisingly aggressive, but not quite up there with the peak super SUVs. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed specsEngineTwin-turbocharged V8Displacement3996ccPower650hpTorque850NmGearbox8-speed automaticDrive layout Permanent all-wheel drive0-100kph (claimed)3.6 secondsTop-Speed (claimed)310kph Yes, the venerable 6.0-litre W12 that Bentley introduced in 2003 is no more – it was simply too expensive and low-volume to keep upgrading for newer emissions norms. Bentley says customers have been very accepting of the 4.0-litre V8, including its PHEV versions, but for the Bentayga, it will be non-hybrid only. This not only saves over 200kg in an already heavy car, but wound up to 650hp and 850Nm in the Speed, it’s more powerful than the W12 ever was. And it’s not just bigger turbos that have brought them to these figures. The V8 uses higher-flow fuel injectors, the compression ratio has been lowered and lag is said to be reduced too, thanks to greater turbo control. The throttle map has been made more responsive, and the gearshifts quickened, and there’s also launch control for the very first time. Venerable W12 has made way for a non-hybrid, 650hp 4.0-litre V8 engine. The result is 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 310kph, making this the quickest and fastest Bentayga ever, and Bentley says all this comes into play only in Sport mode; Comfort and ‘Bentley’ mode remain as refined as they ever were. What can’t be put into numbers is the effect the new sports exhaust has. By default, the Speed gets a steel sports exhaust different to the rest of the range, but as an option, there is a titanium Akrapovic option that saves 12.5kg. It also sounds utterly wild, especially from the outside; almost unbecoming of a car with the Flying B on its nose. Inside, they’ve chosen not to enhance the sound through the speakers, so though a little muted by all that sound insulation, what you hear is real. Acceleration is forceful in Sport mode, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes. Performance is every bit as strong as you’d expect, with launch control, in particular, feeling almost comically aggressive in a luxurious barge such as this. And, as Bentley said, there is a huge difference between Sport and the lesser modes. Acceleration is forceful, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes, and when you’re ready to rein it in, those massive brakes haul you back down with ease. It’s, of course, not as strong as some of its PHEV rivals like the Cayenne Turbo S e-hybrid or Lamborghini Urus SE, or even its stablemate, the new Continental GT Speed, but they’ve managed to deliver an eagerness and potency far greater than any previous Bentayga has delivered. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed mileage and efficiency – 6/10 The kind of efficiency you’d expect from an ultra-luxury performance SUV. Standard Bentayga V8 has a WLTP-rated fuel efficiency of 7.5kpl. Of course, mileage in a 2.5-tonne twin-turbo V8 SUV is not going to wow you, and at no point on our test drive did we even look at the figure. As the product is brand new, Bentley has yet to reveal an official fuel economy figure for it. However, for reference, the WLTP rating of the standard V8 variant is 7.5kpl, while the Speed’s W12-powered predecessor was rated at 6.99kpl. If you are after reasonable running costs, though, there is the V6 hybrid version of the Bentayga, rated at a solid 33.33kpl on the WLTP cycle. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed ride comfort and handling – 9/10 Deftly hops between limousine plush and razor sharp at the flick of a switch. More impressive than even the performance of the Bentayga Speed is its dual dynamic nature. Here too, there have been several key tweaks. Rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll bars are standard, as is a limited-slip differential. The suspension tune is 15 percent stiffer overall than the base Bentayga, and as mentioned before, silicone carbide brakes and 23-inch wheels (with Pirelli P Zero rubber) are optional. The torque vectoring system has been tuned to be far more aggressive, while the ESC system has been slackened to allow for far more slip. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight.  The results of these tweaks are easy to see, as they imbue the big Bentley with an agility never seen before. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight, and more akin to its sportier VW Group counterparts – the Urus and the Cayenne. It’s far more eager to turn in, and it now has a greater affinity for oversteer. This was made even clearer on the dirt track that Bentley had laid out for us, across which the large SUV bounded gleefully like a bucking bronco, kicking its tail out at every opportunity. On a dirt track, it was eager to kick its tail out at every oppurtunity. Even on the tarmac, though, you can feel the active roll-suppression system working overtime to keep the Bentayga level, as the rear-axle steering cuts the turning radius down to hatchback size. While luxury is what most of us associate Bentley with, the Speed wants to remind you that the brand has a history of sport too. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel plush; on the contrary, its air suspension manages the difficult task of oscillating between comfort and sport, and it does it seamlessly. You do feel the 23-inch wheels over bumps, though. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed price and verdict – 7/10 Bentayga’s new-found naughty side elevates it above the rest of the range. We’ll admit Bentley’s decision for the Bentayga Speed to forego the potent new 780hp PHEV powertrain, which its two-door Continental GT stablemate had recently received, left us a little confused. After all, the ultra-high-end performance luxury SUV, where a few 100 kilograms could easily be added or removed without anyone noticing, seems ideally suited to such a powertrain. And the Speed models have always been about excess, so why not give this Bentayga the most excessive powertrain? Foregoing the 780hp PHEV V8 gives the Speed a purer, more engaging experience. Bentley says that it wanted to go deeper into sports SUV territory, following customer feedback that cried out for a purer, more engaging experience. To that end, they’ve succeeded, and have also cleverly filled a void in the market vacated by VW Group’s own Lamborghini Urus. With the Urus having moved up into ludicrous 800hp PHEV hyper-SUV territory, Bentley’s decision not to follow it and instead fill the void might just be a masterstroke. Perhaps this should have been the new ‘Bentayga S’, which, fun fact, has been phased out by the Speed, since the two would have been too similar in proposition. While we do not have the Bentayga Speed India price just yet, expect it to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom, before options). It sounds ludicrous to think of such vehicles in terms of segments and rivals, but the Aston Martin DBX 707 does come to mind, an SUV which seems like it might be a tad more engaging, but not quite as plush and cossetting as the Bentley. Bentayga Speed India price expected to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom). The Bentayga, and indeed Bentley as a brand, has always been about the delicate confluence of luxury and sport, and should you have forgotten its storied and spirited motorsport history in recent times, the Speed’s slightly wilder approach is here to remind you of just that.

    "description": "Mahindra Racing secured its second podium finish of the 2025 Formula E season, with Edoardo Mortara finishing second at the Jakarta E-Prix. Mortara narrowly missed out on victory to Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, who scored his first-ever Formula E win. Andretti’s Nico Mueller completed the podium in third place. The race delivered plenty of drama, with a dusty track described by some drivers as a “wet race without water”. Ticktum wins, 0.371 sec ahead of Mortara Mueller on podium for Andretti Rowland extends Formula E championship lead Ticktum scores first Formula E win Cupra Kiro’s first Formula E win since Season 1 Starting from fifth on the grid, Ticktum initially dropped down the order after the first round of Attack Mode. But he clawed his way up the field and soon found himself in contention for victory after Jake Dennis and Nyck de Vries’ retirements. He had to fend off Mortara in the closing laps, though. Ticktum was helped by the timing of the final Full Course Yellow, which came just as Mortara took his final Attack Mode activation, leaving the Mahindra driver unable to use the power boost and four-wheel drive that came with it. Ticktum successfully kept Mortara at bay to secure his first Formula E win after 60 race starts in the championship. This is also Cupra Kiro’s first race win since the inaugural 2014-15 season, when the team competed under the name NEXTEV. Addressing the media after the race, Ticktum said, “I’ve got a lot of hate from people over the years – people with short-term memory issues forgetting that I’ve won a fair few things on my way up the ladder.” “I think the first three seasons in Formula E were very tough. It was difficult to remain motivated, but this season is pretty much as good as I could have hoped for,” he added. “We definitely struggled at the start; hit the ground running to adapt to all the new systems and the new powertrain, and the team has done a remarkable job. Specially since Miami, I think the rate of improvement has been very good.” Mahindra on podium at Jakarta De Vries out of race after contact with Dennis The Jakarta E-Prix started off as a strong round for Mahindra, with both of its drivers making it through to the duels in qualifying. Mortara’s P2 finish hands the team it’s second podium result of the season so far, following de Vries’ second-place finish at Monaco. However, it was bitter-sweet result for Mortara. While he did secure his best result of the season so far, he also admitted he was disappointed for the team. “I think we should have got both cars on the podium,” he said. “The race was lucky and unlucky [for me]. For the second Attack Mode, yes I was in front of Dan (Ticktum) and I think if we had no interruptions, probably we had a good chance of finishing in front of him. But we’re also very lucky that the good guys in front of us stopped.” De Vries, meanwhile, was locked in battle for victory with Jake Dennis early on. On lap 23, the Mahindra driver pulled alongside Dennis and was ahead by just a whisker, but moved to the right and made contact with Dennis’ Andretti car in the process. Stewards handed de Vries a 10-second penalty for the incident, but none of it would matter with both Dennis and de Vries dropping out. Dennis ended up P17 after an issue with releasing the Full Course Yellow limiter, while de Vries retired due to a technical issue. Mortara’s podium result was enough for Mahindra to hold on to fifth place in the teams’ championship, just six points behind McLaren. Reflecting on the race, Mahindra Racing team principal Frederic Bertrand said, “For us it was a super well-executed race on Edo’s [Mortara] side for sure. Also on Nyck’s side, [but there was a] small mistake at one moment and a small issue for him.” He added, “It was a proud moment for us to see two Mahindra’s leading the race; maybe it could have been a one-two at the end, to be honest. But we are super happy and proud because this is our second podium – first podium for Edo, which should give him an additional level of confidence for Berlin.” 2025 Formula E championship standings Nissan, Oliver Rowland extend lead Mueller ended up finishing third, gaining 10 places from his starting position. Antonio Felix da Costa finished fourth, followed by Nick Cassidy and the McLaren duo of Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird. Envision Racing teammates Sebastian Buemi and Robin Frijns finished P8 and P9, respectively. After a disappointing qualifying performance, championship leader Oliver Rowland made some good progress in the race. But he was handed a 5-second penalty for causing a collision with Max Guenther, dropping him to 10th place. Despite scoring just one point at Jakarta, Rowland has managed to extend his championship lead to 69 points over Pascal Wehrlein, who finished just outside the top 10 in P11. Da Costa is third overall, just three points behind his Porsche teammate. Formula E will next head to Berlin for another double-header round on July 12-13. 2025 Jakarta E Prix results 2025 Jakarta E-Prix resultsPosDriverTeam1Dan TicktumCupra Kiro2Edoardo MortaraMahindra Racing3Nico MuellerAndretti Formula E4Antonio Felix da CostaPorsche5Nick CassidyJaguar6Taylor BarnardMcLaren7Sam BirdMcLaren8Sebastien BuemiEnvision Racing9Robin FrijnsEnvision Racing10Oliver RowlandNissan11Pascal WehrleinPorsche12Mitch EvansJaguar13Lucas di GrassiLola Yamaha ABT14Norman NatoNissan15Jean-Eric VergneDS Penske16David BeckmannCupra Kiro17Jake DennisAndretti18Zane MaloneyLola Yamaha ABTNCNyck de VriesMahindra RacingNCStoffel VandoorneMaseratiNCJake HughesMaserati NCMax GuentherDS Penske Also see: 2025 Formula E: Maserati, Nissan win Tokyo E-Prix Mahindra Racing: New Formula E car designed for performance, not cost",

MoRTH mandates ABS on all new two-wheelers Effective from January 2026 Ministry of Transport mandates ABS from January 2026 Along with this, every new 2-wheeler sold should come with two helmets In a significant move aimed at enhancing road safety, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has announced that all new two-wheelers sold in India from January 2026 must come equipped with ABS, regardless of engine capacity. In addition, it will be mandatory for dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with every new vehicle—one for the rider and one for the pillion passenger. The decision is expected to address a major cause of road fatalities in the country, especially among two-wheeler users. According to government data, a large number of two-wheeler accidents involve brake-related skidding and head injuries, which the new rules aim to reduce. While the move is widely welcomed by road safety advocates, some manufacturers have raised concerns over potential cost implications for entry-level models. However, government officials believe the benefits in terms of saved lives and reduced injuries will far outweigh the price increase.  For reference, major two-wheeler manufacturers like Hero, Honda, TVS, Bajaj and Suzuki have a number of their products that fall under the 125cc mark, which will all need to be updated to meet this new rule. All of these products are priced around the Rs 1 lakh mark (ex-showroom), and they are likely to see an increase in price owing to the additional hardware necessitated by this new rule.  Perhaps the segment of the market that will be the most affected will be the entry-level 100cc motorcycles, which start from the Rs 60,000 ballpark (ex-showroom). For two-wheelers that require the addition of a front disc as well as single channel ABS, customers could be looking at a price hike of roughly Rs 6,000 - Rs 10,000.   The ministry is expected to release detailed guidelines and timelines soon to ensure a smooth rollout of the regulation.   Also see: Rajiv Bajaj to step down from KTM parent company Pierer AG’s supervisory board",
