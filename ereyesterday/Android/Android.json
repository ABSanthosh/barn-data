    "description": "The new Huawei Watch GT 5 series is out, and we have both the vanilla GT 5 and the GT 5 Pro. Now let's take a peek inside the box of the GT 5. At first glance, the GT 5 offers a modest upgrade and for the most part, it's true. The GT 5's hardware is largely the same as the GT 4 from last year. It comes in two variants - 41mm and 46mm, built around 1.32\" and 1.43\" screens, respectively. Huawei managed to shave 0.3mm off the thickness, though.

    "description": "Amazon Canada has an offer that applies to all Pixel 9 models – you can get $200 off the Pixel Watch 3 and 50% off the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you buy them alongside one of the new Google phones. We will start with the Google Pixel 9 Pro as this one has the best discount. It’s not automatic, you have to use the code listed below (but it’s also listed on the Amazon page, so it’s easy to copy and paste). The Pixel 9 Pro is on the small side as far as Android flagships go, but has a high-res LTPO display, a 50+48+48MP camera (including a 5x 113mm periscope), satellite SOS and will receive 7...",
