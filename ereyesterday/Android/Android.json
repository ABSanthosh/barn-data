    "description": "Sony's Xperia 1 V received its update to Android 15 a few days ago, and today the company has started delivering the same update to the Xperia 5 V as well. There are already reports on Reddit from people who have received the update notification. It's a 1GB download and once you've installed it you'll be on software version 67.2.A.2.41.
