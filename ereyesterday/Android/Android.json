    "description": "Hey there, vivo X200 Pro! We've spent some time with this gem of a cameraphone over at its launch event but we now have it at the office and it's ready for a review! The X200 Pro ships with a phone-matching blue case, a 90W charger, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. When you put the new X200 Pro next to vivo's current flagship, the X100 Ultra, there are some obvious differences. The X200 Pro has a less-curved front and back glass, and a wider frame, to compensate for the difference.

    "description": "It’s time to revisit some old offers as the discounts on select phones have gotten better than what we saw even during the recent Prime Day event. There are also a few offers that aren’t quite as good, but they are worth checking out in case you missed the Prime deals a couple of weeks ago. We start with the Samsung Galaxy S24. Last week, the base 8/128GB variant was $720. Now you can get the model with more storage, 8/256GB, for just $705 (was $780 last week). Keep in mind that this isn’t just doubling the storage, the 128GB variant uses older UFS 3.1 chips, while the 256GB one is built...",
