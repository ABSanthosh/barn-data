    "description": "Apple is expected to unveil iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 at its annual WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, and we've already heard rumors that these versions of its mobile operating systems will feature the most changes in years, with UI elements reminiscent of Apple's visionOS.

Today three new images have been leaked showing all four members of the iPhone 17 family on top of each other, and it's very, very obvious which one is the Air. There's barely any room for the buttons on the sides and the USB-C port at the bottom, that's how thin it is. Of course, rumor has it this will come at the expense of battery capacity, unsurprisingly, and it will also only have one rear camera. iPhone 17 family dummy units...",
