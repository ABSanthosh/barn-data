    "description": "Google's Pixel 9a is expected to land in March, and we've already seen it in some intriguing leaked renders, which very much highlighted its lack of a camera bar/visor thing. Now a new rumor tells us the Pixel 9a will ditch the 64 MP main camera of its predecessors, and will instead borrow the 48 MP unit used in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google's most expensive smartphone. The Pro Fold being a foldable device, and one not made by a Chinese manufacturer, you shouldn't expect top level quality. But still, this should be a better snapper than what the Pixel a line has had before. While...",

    "description": "Insta360 has launched the Ace Pro 2 action camera today, its entrant in the space dominated by GoPro and where DJI is also a contender. The camera costs $399.99, which actually makes it $50 less than its predecessor. In the EU, it's €449.99. The GoPro inspiration for the design is clear, and yet the Insta360's front display only displays information, not a live feed of what the camera sees. For that you get the hinged main screen, now 2.5\" in size, with improved brightness and pixel density. The Ace Pro 2 is rugged and water resistant up to 12m (with precise underwater controls).
