The Motorola Edge 60 Pro took victory, ahead of the Samsung Galaxy A56, while another rookie rounded up the podium - the OnePlus 13T. [#InlinePriceWidget, 13603, 1#] The Galaxy S25 Ultra managed to somehow retain its fourth position, despite all the surrounding action. The next three positions bring three more new faces. The Redmi Turbo 4 Pro narrowly edged the Honor GT Pro for the fifth spot, while the vivo X200 Ultra is not far behind in seventh. The Poco X7 Pro is all the way...",

These phones have been repaired by Samsung engineers with 100% genuine parts, have a brand new battery installed and have a 1-year manufacturer warranty. And keep in mind that the S24 generation is slated for 7 major updates – Android 15/One UI 7 is currently rolling out (after a short hiccup), which leaves six more years of support. The question is whether the extra cost of the new models is worth the upgrade. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra starts at $1,020, the 512GB variant is...",
