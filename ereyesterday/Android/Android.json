    "description": "The recently unveiled iPhone 16e doesn't have MagSafe, and Apple has already explained that this has nothing to do with the use of its first in-house developed modem. So why did it happen? Well, Apple says it decided not to equip the iPhone 16e with MagSafe because \"most people in the 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable\".

But nothing more than that. In case you've been wondering when to expect it to be fully unveiled, a new report from Korea today gives us an actual date: April 16. Since time zones exist, do note that it could actually happen on April 15 in some places. Either way, Samsung seems to have settled on mid-April to fully launch the thinnest member of its flagship line. The launch event will allegedly be online-only. The report...",
