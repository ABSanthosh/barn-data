The Mini is clearly inspired by vivo's success in China with the X200 Pro mini, and we've heard that OnePlus will also have its very own smaller device soon - this is likely to be at least based on, if not identical to the Find X8 Mini. Today from Digital Chat Station in China come more details about the Find X8 Mini.
