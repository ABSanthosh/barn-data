We now have the same details for the Galaxy Z Flip7 which unsurprisingly shares identical scores in terms of overall energy efficiency (B), durability (A) and repairability (C) while also boasting an IP48 ingress protection rating.

Steel balls are being shot at the phone to make a point about its durability, and of course it withstands the impacts without any issue. See for yourself above. The Honor...",
