    "description": "The Realme 15 and Realme 15 Pro are being announced on July 24, and the company is already engaged in a full-on teaser campaign for the duo. That said, so far the focus has primarily been the Pro. That changed today as Realme has put up a listing for the 'vanilla' 15, which confirms some of its specs. It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300+ SoC, and boasts a display with 144 Hz refresh rate and 6,500-nit peak brightness, bolder design, smarter AI, and sharper videos from its dual 50 MP 4K cameras.

    "description": "Here's a clear case of 'looking too much at spec sheets may not be very productive', especially when we're talking about 0.1mm differences. See, on paper, the Honor Magic V5 in one specific colorway (called Ivory White) is advertised by the brand to be 8.8mm thick when folded. Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7, on the other hand, is 8.9mm thick when folded. So there's a clear winner here, right? A clear \"world's thinnest book-style foldable', as it were. Well, not so fast. Place the two side by side and try to balance something off of them, as famed Chinese leaker Ice Universe has done in the video...",
