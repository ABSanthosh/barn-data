The Plus is gone after just one generation, it seems. The Nothing Phone (3a) is purportedly pictured below in a heavy-duty case that's meant to protect its design from prying eyes.

The Plus is gone after just one generation, it seems. The Nothing Phone (3a) is purportedly pictured below in a heavy-duty case that's meant to protect its design from prying eyes. It can't, however, hide the fact that this will be the first Nothing handset with three rear cameras. According to another rumor from yesterday, it has a 6.8-inch FHD+ AMOLED screen with 120 Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC at the helm, and a triple rear camera setup with a first for Nothing: a 50 MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom. It will be joined by a 50 MP main camera and an 8 MP ultrawide. On the front, there will be a 32 MP selfie snapper. The device is said to have a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast wired charging, as well as Glyph lights on the back and NFC support. It will run Nothing OS 3.1 based on Android 15 from day one. The Phone (3a) will be available with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Phone (3a) Pro will come in one single version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Both will come in black, the (3a) in white as well, the (3a) Pro in gray. It's unclear what upgrades the Pro will bring compared to the 'vanilla' model, but at this rate we expect that information to leak in a few days. Source 1 | Source 2",
