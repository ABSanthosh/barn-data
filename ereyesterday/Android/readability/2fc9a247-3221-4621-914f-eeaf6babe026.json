The FE features the Exynos 2400e chipset, a 6.7” 120Hz 1080p+ OLED display and a 4,700mAh battery with 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. The camera system includes a 50MP main, 8MP 3x/75mm telephoto and 12MP ultra-wide. Meanwhile, the rivalry between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Edge continues. The Edge is slender and light (5.8mm, 163g), while the Ultra is chunkier (8.2mm, 218g) but more capable. It has longer battery life, a built-in S Pen, not one but two telephoto cameras (50MP 5x/111mm and 10MP 3x/67mm), plus a higher resolution 50MP ultra-wide. You can read the detailed head-to-head comparison for a closer look. If you prefer smaller phones – shorter and narrower, not just thinner like the Edge – the Samsung Galaxy S25 is one of the few petite flagships. This generation got bumped up to 12GB of RAM, bringing it on par with the rest of the S25 series. Next up, tablets. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra chose the Dimensity 9300+ over a Snapdragon chip. They have expandable storage, a water-resistant frame, bundled S Pen and DeX support. The Ultra is as large as Android tablets go at 14.6”, while the Plus has a 12.4” display. If you want something even smaller, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is the current 11” flagship. It is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and has two more OS updates to go (it launched on Android 13 and is currently on 15). We’ve been hearing murmurs of smaller Tab S11 models, but there’s nothing official yet. Alternatively, you can get the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE – this one has a 10.9” display, but it’s a 90Hz IPS LCD instead of a 120Hz OLED like on the premium Tab S models. And it has less processing power with the Exynos 1580, also the USB-C port does not support video out. The FE models are cheaper, though, and you can still get a fairly large screen if you want it – the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ has a 13.1” panel. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
