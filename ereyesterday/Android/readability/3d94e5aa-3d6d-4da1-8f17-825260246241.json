  "text": "As far as mobile devices go, Apple’s iPhone series has pretty much enjoyed overwhelming support form different case and accessory manufacturers. More recently, veteran camera brand Leica announced that it was launching a camera grip attachment for iPhones, which it dubs the “Leica LUX Grip.” According to Lecia, the LUX Grip is designed to feel similar to a “classic Lecia camera,” at least in terms of handling and feel. The grip is able to attach to iPhone using MagSafe connections, and communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy, with added support through the Leica LUX app for iOS, which itself comes with added photographic features that builds on what Apple already offers with its devices. For its physical controls, Leica adds that it once again turned to its own camera designs which were refined for a more compact accessory, complete with a two-stage shutter release, a quick-switch button for different shooting modes, as well as a hardware shortcut for frequently-used functions. There’s also a built-in dial which cycles between different camera settings for added convenience. Leica says that the LUX Grip can last for up to 1,000 shots, with a total charge time of two hours. It’s priced at 300 EUR.",
