A new leak suggests the Galaxy Z Fold 6â€™s S Pen will be compatible with the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7, potentially saving you some cash. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) The report comes from tipster PandaFlash on X, who claims the current S Pen will work just fine on the Fold 7. Thatâ€™s in line with what Samsung typically offers with stylus continuity across generations. Like the S25 Ultraâ€™s S Pen, this new version for the Fold 7 wonâ€™t use a battery, which keeps things simple. While itâ€™s nice to reuse your old S Pen, the case compatibility may be an issue. The Fold 7â€™s size or design tweaks could mean the Fold 6â€™s S Pen case wonâ€™t fit properly. You can always carry it separately, but itâ€™s something to be aware of if you rely on a case for storage. Thereâ€™s also a small performance note. The tipster mentions that Samsung may have reworked the S Pen internals for the Fold 7, which could result in slightly better input latency. That means the older stylus might feel just a bit slower in comparison. Itâ€™s a minor difference for most users, but those who care about the fastest possible stylus response may want to consider the newer pen. If youâ€™re considering an upgrade, Samsung is now accepting early reservations for its upcoming product lineup. Locking in your reservation gets you a $50 Samsung Credit and qualifies you for extra savings of up to $1,150 at checkout. Youâ€™ll also be entered into a sweepstakes for a chance to win a $5,000 Samsung Creditâ€”no purchase required. ðŸ‘‰Â Reserve your spot now and secure early access before these new releases sell out.
