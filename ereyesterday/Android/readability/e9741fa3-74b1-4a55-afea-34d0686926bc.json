  "text": "The AM4 platform from AMD was a generational run, and it seems that Team Red isn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet. When it seemed like the platform was finally being laid to rest in favor of AM5, the Ryzen 5005G refresh arrived, injecting new life into the aging socket with six new APUs. Now, this might not be the high-end power move some enthusiasts were hoping for, but it’s a blessing for ultra-budget-conscious builders looking to squeeze more value out of their existing setups. With solid integrated graphics and respectable processing power, the 5000G series proves that the AM4 platform still has some fight left in it. However, is this refresh worth considering or just a final farewell tour? Related 5 AM4 lives on- and that’s a big deal Down but not out Source: AMD Eight years is an insane lifespan for the AM4 platform. AMD could very well have pulled the plug on this socket when AM5 launched, but instead, they’ve brought out six new models — Ryzen 7 5705G, Ryzen 5 5605G, and Ryzen 3 5305G and their energy-efficient 'GE' counterparts. Needless to say, this is huge for budget-conscious builders who can’t afford to swap motherboards, RAM, and coolers. AMD’s continued support has made upgrading a breeze for budget and casual gamers still on the AM4 platform, extending the life of their gaming rigs without breaking the bank. We’re living in an era of forced obsolescence, but AM4’s resilience is a rare and welcome sight. Plus, the gamer in me is happy because it also means my AM5 rig will remain relevant for at least just as long. 4 Where it works for gamers Keeping things light Yes, yes — the new Ryzen 5005G APUs aren’t built for gamers, but they do carve out a niche for budget gamers. Esports titles like Valorant and CS2 could run well on these APUs, provided one keeps settings low, of course. They’re also a great fit for HTPC builds, where power efficiency and integrated graphics are more important than raw horsepower. For those sticking to the AM4 platform with perhaps something like the R5 1600, the 5005G series provides an easy upgrade from older Ryzen 1000 or 2000 chips without requiring a full system overhaul. APUs would also shine in retro and emulation gaming, handling PS2, GameCube, and even some Switch emulation without breaking a sweat. If your gaming revolves around older titles, indie games, or casual experiences, these chips provide a cost-effective way to stay in the game — without needing a discrete GPU. 3 Integrated graphics that matter Efficient and capable Source: AMD Not everyone can afford a discrete GPU, and that’s where AMD’s Ryzen 5005G series shines. Intel’s UHD graphics might struggle with anything beyond spreadsheets and MS Paint, but these 5005G APUs, despite their less-powerful Cezanne-based architecture, are great alternatives to a dedicated GPU. It’s undeniably more of a considerable choice for business and commercial users, sure, but let’s not forget that HTPC enthusiasts can also get onboard with the new AMD Ryzen 5605G or 5705G, which have the same specs as their 5600G and 5700G counterparts. If you’re building on AM4, these APUs are easily the best onboard graphics solutions available. 2 Upgrading to AM5 is still costly A fresh lease on AM4 builds AM5 is undeniably the future of AMD’s desktop lineup, offering next-gen performance, PCIe 5.0, and DDR5 memory support. But let’s be real — the costs of upgrading aren’t small, with pricey motherboards and DDR5 RAM making the jump a tough sell for budget-conscious builders. That’s where the Ryzen 5005G series comes in. For those sticking with AM4, these chips provide a fresh lease on life without the cost of a full platform switch. Whether it’s a budget build, a second PC, or a simple upgrade, AM4 still holds value, and the 5005G keeps it relevant for just a little longer. 1 Better deals and competitive pricing Beneficial across the board AMD extending AM4’s lifespan isn’t just great for upgraders — it benefits the entire PC market. More budget-friendly motherboards and CPUs stay in circulation, keeping entry-level and mid-range builds affordable. Furthermore, this move pressures AMD to price AM5 more competitively while at the same time pushing Intel to refine its mid-range offerings. Even if you’re not buying a Ryzen 5005G chip, its existence alone keeps the market balanced, ensuring better deals and options for everyone. Related Unlike AMD, why doesn't Intel stick with the same motherboard socket? If AMD can make the most out of one socket, why don't Intel do the same? Should PC gamers care? Look, the new AMD Ryzen 5005G series isn’t setting any new records. However, it does serve a practical purpose for gamers who aren’t ready to move on from AM4 just yet. If you’re building a budget-friendly rig, upgrading a very old system, or need a competent APU with solid integrated graphics, these chips do the job. Pairing one with a used GPU or waiting for GPU prices to drop? Even better. That said, the clock is ticking for AM4. The 5005G might have extended the platform’s lifespan, but AM5 is definitely the inevitable next step for anyone remotely serious about PC gaming. Slowly but surely, DDR5 prices will become reasonable, and future GPUs will benefit from PCIe 5.0. But for now, if you’re looking for an affordable, power-efficient solution for 1080p gaming or casual use, the 5005G isn’t a bad choice. It’s a stopgap — not a revolution — but one that makes sense for the right gamer in the right situation.",
