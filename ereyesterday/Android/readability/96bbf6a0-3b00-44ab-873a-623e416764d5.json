  "text": "In preparation for Star Wars Day on May 4th, Nanoleaf announced an upcoming promotional event and the release of two new limited edition smart lighting bundles for fans of the franchise. The sale will run from May 1st to May 5th, 2025, and will feature discounts on select Nanoleaf products and the introduction of bundles inspired by Star Wars Characters. This includes the Small Baby Gu Bundle which is available at $187, and allows users to create custom panel layouts, with Connect+ technology for added expansion, and support for touch response and sound, as well as over 16 million colors for customization via the Nanoleaf App, including a paint feature for individual panel coloring. There’s also the Artoo Bundle that’s priced at $500 with a 15% discount, and features a color scheme based on—you guessed it—beloved droid R2-D2. Nanoleaf is also offering the Pegboard Desk Dock at $100, which functions as a versatile organizational tool for desks, featuring a pegboard design for customizable arrangement of items. There’s also the 4D 85-inch Kit that’s going for $100, and is designed to add a bit of “oomph” to your Netflix TV binges with features like Nanoleaf’s 4D screen mirroring technology, which synchronizes Nanoleaf lights with the colors displayed on the television screen for real-time ambient lighting. You can check out the full list of deals with this link.",
