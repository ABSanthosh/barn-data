Apple now holds the global broadcast rights for the entire league, making this the only way to watch every game, including the playoffs, no matter where you are. The best part? The Season Pass is now 30% off, dropping to $69 for a full season, or just $59 if you’re already an Apple TV+ subscriber. Unlike most sports packages, the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV delivers every match with zero blackouts, so you never have to worry about your local team being blocked. The 2025 season introduces Sunday Night Soccer, a new flagship game every week, bringing big-match energy to your Sunday nights (or, for UK viewers, the early hours of Monday morning—most games start around midnight UK time). It’s perfect if you’re a night owl or just want to catch the best US soccer action without jumping through hoops. Apple’s platform lets you stream on just about any device, with English and Spanish commentary, high-quality 1080p video, and on-demand replays. It’s a clean, ad-free way to follow your favorite teams, keep up with the playoff push, or dive into the drama of every last-minute goal. For anyone tired of missing out due to local broadcast restrictions (or the infamous blackout rule), this deal finally solves that problem—MLS is available everywhere, whenever you want it. Thinking about subscribing? You get every match for $14.99/month or $69 for the season, with Apple TV+ users saving even more at $12.99/month or $59 for the full season. No hidden fees, no regional blocks, just uninterrupted soccer all year long. Unlock every MLS match—subscribe to the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+ now and never miss a game.
