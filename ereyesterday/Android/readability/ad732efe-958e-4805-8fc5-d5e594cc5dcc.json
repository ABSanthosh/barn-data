  "text": "Following the launch of its One UI 7 beta, Samsung recently unveiled that it’s working on even more streamlined approaches to modern AI solutions on smartphones, including a big step towards a “true AI companion.” The South Korean tech giant states that it’s been working on new AI-based software for improved user experiences across the board, under its Galaxy AI system. READ: Samsung’s One UI 7 Goes Live in Beta Form This includes the Personal Data Engine, which Samsung claims ensures on-device and cross-app personal data protection for users. User data is stored in a secure space with an encryption key that’s managed by Samsung’s Knox Vault. It also integrates “post-quantum cryptography” for enhanced data protection. Another AI-based feature is Now Bar, which is able to highlight relevant activities from different apps, giving users instant access to notifications based on importance. This will also allow for a more dynamic lock screen user experience, at least on paper – it’s essentially a powered-up digital assistant which will be able to automatically handle additional helpful tasks based on your current activities, such as preparing essential files and apps for flights and travel. We can expect more Galaxy AI features to be unveiled soon, and Samsung is aiming to focus on giving users a more personalized (and smarter) means of using their devices every day.
