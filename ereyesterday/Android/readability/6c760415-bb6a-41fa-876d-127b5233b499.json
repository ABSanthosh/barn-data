Initially branded as “Nearby Share,” Google has continued to add more and more features, eventually teaming up with Samsung to rename it under the latter’s Quick Share file transfer feature. While Quick Share has since evolved to work between different phone brands, Android versions, and even Windows devices, it’s still not compatible with platforms such as iOS and macOS for example, given how closed-off Apple’s hardware and software ecosystem is. New reports however seem to indicate that there’s a slim possibility of Quick Share arriving for Apple devices in the future. While there’s no official Google Quick Share feature that supports Apple platforms, the folks over at Android Authority report that a code comment was made by a Google engineer which mentions a bug fix for iOS and macOS. The bug fix addresses a quirk where non-localized account names are used with the device type on iOS and macOS devices. Of course, this isn’t an official confirmation from Google about anything at this point, but given that work has gone into software compatibility for Quick Share and Apple devices, one can’t help but expect the feature to arrive for Apple’s platforms in the future. Right now, there are numerous third-party solutions for file-transfer between Android and iOS phones, although a lot tend to come with ads and other unwanted extras. Source: Android Authority",
