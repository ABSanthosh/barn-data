The OLED screen will launch with a totally redesigned MacBook Pro, so far rumored to go with a hole-punch for the webcam instead of a notch. It should also be thinner and lighter than the current models, and that's going to be enabled by the thinner OLED panels. On the other hand, if you've been waiting for a MacBook Air with an OLED screen, that will take even longer - much longer, in fact. Those will apparently show up in 2029 at the earliest. Today's rumor on this contradicts previous mumblings that talked about 2027 or 2028, but either way - it's a long time from now. When the first MacBook Air with an OLED panel does launch, it should sport an inferior single-stack display, compared to the MacBook Pros which are getting two-stack panels. The latter will be much brighter than the former. Source (in Korean)",
