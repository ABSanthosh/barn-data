It charges at up to 25W via wires with an advertised 55% reached in \"around 30 minutes\" with a Samsung adapter (that you'll have to buy separately as there isn't one in the box). There's wireless charging support too. The S25 Edge's 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display has QHD+ resolution, 1-120 Hz variable refresh rate, and Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on top. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, paired with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. On the rear there's a 200 MP main camera with f/1.7 aperture and OIS, which Samsung says is capable of \"2x optical quality zoom\". Next to it is a 12 MP ultrawide with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus for macro shots. Selfies get taken care of by a 12 MP camera with f/2.2 aperture. The S25 Edge runs Android 15 with One UI 7 on top, is IP68 certified for dust and water resistance, has a titanium frame, and will be offered in \"a captivating range of colors\", Samsung's press release says, including Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Icyblue. Its full measurements are 158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm.",
