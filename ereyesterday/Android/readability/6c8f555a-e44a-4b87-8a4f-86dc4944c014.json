Huawei was always something of an innovator in the smartphone industry, especially when they were still able to fight for the global market without any handicaps. Unfortunately, that's not the case anymore, and its most innovative device in years, the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate, won't be able to achieve worldwide dominance. But do you know which brand has never had a problem reaching every corner of the globe? Samsung. Reports say that Samsung is considering making a tri-fold device of its own, and if it does, it could launch as soon as next year. That's big news and I'd be excited to see what the South Korean manufacturer can do there. Samsung Could Possibly Launch A Tri-Fold Smartphone As Soon As Next Year Image: Samsung Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate got the Chinese manufacturer way more glowing press on an international scale than it has had in a very long time. While it won't suddenly make its phones more appealing to North American and European markets—the lack of Google services will always be its Achilles heel—it does show other manufacturers that there's an opening there. Needless to say, we can all agree that if Samsung releases a tri-fold smartphone, it's going to be the most popular one in the world. The South Korean manufacturer has the most street cred when it comes to any Android OEM. It's why its current foldables are king (even if I don't think they're the best ones). According to a report out of Korea, Samsung might be planning to release a tri-fold smartphone next year. The company has the necessary tech ready for it and the supply chain is on standby if it does happen. However, nothing is confirmed yet and a final call still needs to be made from within the company. It would be exciting to see a more mainstream take though. Would You Get A Samsung Galaxy Tri-Fold Device? Image: Huawei So, if Samsung does follow through and release a tri-fold device next year, would you be in line for it? I haven't owned a foldable before, but I think I see a lot more value in getting a tri-fold over getting a regular foldable, so I might consider it. However, remember that this is Samsung we're talking about, so a tri-fold from them will almost certainly cost more than $3,000, especially as Huawei has set a precedent in pricing. At that price, I certainly wouldn't be interested. Would you though? Let us know in the comments. Samsung Could Have Given Us A Cheaper Z Fold But Chose Not To Image: Samsung If you've got a good memory, you'll remember that there were some whispers regarding a Z Fold FE (though we eventually got the Z Fold Special Edition). We expected a cheaper Z Fold 6 variant but that never happened. The thing is, Samsung did consider it, so it isn't as if the Z Fold 6 FE was a figment of someone's imagination. However, the company's early production run seemed to show what was ultimately an uncompetitive device when compared to competitors and the company scrapped the idea. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
