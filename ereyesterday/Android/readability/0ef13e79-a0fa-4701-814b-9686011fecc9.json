Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: JLab Rewind2 Review: A Blast from the Past? Officially dubbed the JLab “Party Speaker” Line, the new range includes the Pop Party, GO Party, JBuds Party, and Epic Party Speaker. JLab has designed the new speakers with customizable RGB lighting and LabSync technology, which enables audio synchronization across multiple speakers or via stereo pair-ups. First up is the JLab Pop Party Speaker ($19.99), which comes in a compact form factor with a 2-inch full-range driver and passive radiator. It includes customizable RGB lighting through the JLab App, as well as IPX5 waterproof rating, and a detachable loop handle. If you want to go a bit bigger, there’s also the GO Party Speaker ($29.99) that comes with 10W of sound with dual 2-inch drivers and passive woofers, and an IPX6 rating for added durability. For bigger spaces, you can always go for the JBuds Party Speaker ($69.99) which comes with 30W of power, a more powerful bass sound and clearer highs. It’s also waterproof, which makes it ideal for poolside weekend barbecues and whatnot. The largest of the bunch is the Epic Party Speaker ($149.99) which provides 360-degree sound, thanks to 100 watts of power from four 2.5-inch full-range drivers, a 5.25-inch subwoofer, and a 5-inch passive woofer. It also comes with 16 hours of playtime and wireless connectivity with up to 100 JLab Party speakers. The new JLab Party Speakers are available starting today via JLab’s official website, and will be available in different colours including black, with navy and mulberry options for the Pop Party, GO Party, and JBuds Party Speakers to follow later in the year. Target will offer exclusive cyan, pink, and lime colors for the Pop Party and GO Party speakers.",
