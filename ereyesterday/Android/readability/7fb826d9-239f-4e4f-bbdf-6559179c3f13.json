As usual, it will also be streamed live via Google’s official YouTube channel. With that in mind, Google wasn’t too specific as to what it was going to show off during the event, vaguely stating that it will present “newest products, technologies and innovations in AI” at this year’s conference. While it previously showed off the latest Pixel A-series phones at the event, it looks like this will not be the case this year as the Pixel 9a is expected to be shown off later in March.

With that said though, it should be interesting to see Google’s upcoming plans moving forward with Pixel, AI, and Android, to name a few.",
