  "text": "While it’s not at the top of OnePlus’ pecking order, there’s little doubt that the OnePlus 13R is as great as they come, with a nice balance of premium hardware and performance that outshines similarly-priced smartphones from rival brands. It’s also on sale right now, going for much less than its usual 600-dollar price point. As for what you’re getting, the OnePlus 13R features a display that measures at 6.78 inches with a 1264×2780 pixel resolution and a sooth 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s powered by the still-capable Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside, which makes it ideal for gaming and intensive apps. There’s also a massive 6,000 mAh battery inside which should easily last for more than a day in most situations.
