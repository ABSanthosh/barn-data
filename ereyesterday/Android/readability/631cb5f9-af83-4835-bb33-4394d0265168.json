  "text": "Following the launch of the highly-impressive OnePlus Watch 3, Oppo has gone ahead with launch of its own Wear OS-powered smartwatch, the Oppo Watch X2. Much like the Oppo Watch X from last year however, the Watch X2 is simply a rebranded version of the OnePlus Watch 3. For those unfamiliar, OnePlus and Oppo occasionally share hardware designs, and this has lately included wearable devices. There are a few differences though in terms of design, with the Oppo Watch X2 available in “Summit Blue” and “Lava Black” color variants, which are slightly different from what OnePlus offers. Additionally, the Summit Blue version also features a uniquely-shaped bezel that stands out from its siblings. There’s also a bit of difference in terms of software – Wear OS still runs the show, though you’re getting Oppo’s software offerings instead of OnePlus. As for the rest of the hardware, the Oppo Watch X2 comes with the same specs as the OnePlus Watch 3, including the 1.5-inch LTPO display, Snapdragon W5 and BES2800 MCU Efficiency chipset combo, as well as a 631 mAh battery. The Oppo Watch X2 starts at around $373.",
