Mass production of the chip is apparently going to begin next year and the first phones powered by it will also launch in 2025. Chinese officials have repeatedly asked local firms to reduce their reliance on foreign tech as much as possible, and Xiaomi seems to have received the message loud and clear. Of course, it remains to be seen how the chip will be positioned and in what part of the market it will be used. And of course, how well it will perform compared to competing offerings from Qualcomm and MediaTek. Unfortunately this report doesn't tell us any of that, so we'll have to wait for more details to be outed, either officially or through more rumors. Xiaomi is planning to invest around CNY 30 billion ($4.1 billion) in R\u0026D in 2025, up from CNY 24 billion ($3.3 billion) this year. The new chip will undoubtedly eat some of that. Source",
