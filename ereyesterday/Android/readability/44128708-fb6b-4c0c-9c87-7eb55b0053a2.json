The former is a more compact version of the full-fledged Watch S4, while Band 10 is the newest entry in the Smart Band (formerly Mi Band) lineup. Both wearables are expected to debut globally at some point, but Xiaomi did not share those details just yet. Xiaomi Watch S4 41mm Watch S4 41mm offers a 1.32-inch round AMOLED display with 466 x 466px resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate and 2,200 nits peak brightness. It’s 5ATM waterproof like its Watch S4 siblings and comes in at 32 grams. Xiaomi brought its updated 4-LED + 4PD heart rate module for accurate health tracking and a modified version of Xiaomi’s Xring T1 chip with a modem that’s 35% more efficient than the one in the regular Xiaomi S4 watch. You also get real-time swim heart rate tracking and an 8-day battery life. Watch S4 41mm starts at CNY 999 ($140) in Black and Mint Green with the TPU strap. You can upgrade to the brown leather strap version for CNY 1,199 ($167) or opt for the Milanese strap version, which goes for CNY 1,499 ($209). Smart Band 10 Smart Band 10 upgrades to a 1.72-inch AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and up to 1,500 nits peak local brightness. While the design looks unchanged from last year’s Smart Band 9, the new model has thinner bezels and now comes in ceramic edition which will be available outside of China for the first time. Xiaomi claims Band 10 offers more accurate health and activity tracking thanks to its 9-axis sensor and sleep monitoring with a guided improvement plan. Band 10 also gets an updated vibration motor and the same 233mAh battery as its predecessor which is rated at up to 21 days in typical usage and 9 days with Always-On display mode activated. Xiaomi Smart Band 10 starts at CNY 269 ($38) for the regular version and goes up to CNY 379 ($52) for the ceramic edition. Xiaomi Watch S4 41mm • Smart Band 10",
