These are some of the Monopoly Go Events and Tournaments you can expect to occur regularly in the game: Tournaments – These are competitive events where you can try your luck and try to advance to the top of the leaderboard. Play against other players for special prizes. Reaching certain milestones will reward you, and if you place in the top 20, you will earn additional rewards. Partner Events – These events enable you to play directly with friends. You will need to reach milestones together in order to win rewards. Partner up with friends who you know will participate in the event with you. Photo: Scopely Board Rush – This earns you some dice and an extra bit of cash when this event is on. It happens pretty regularly in Monopoly Go and completing a board will enable you to earn these rewards. Cash Grab – This is an event where you earn additional cash when landing on certain tiles on the board, such as the Chance tile. You will enter a mini-game where you will tap on as much of the cash falling on your screen as possible. Property Wheel Boost – This event gives you an additional color wheel spin when you complete a set on the board, note that you need to have an entire set of hotels before you can earn a spin. Photo: Scopely Prize Drop – Mini Peg-E board is a simple mini-game that grants you additional rewards after completing milestones. Rent Frenzy – Additional players are added to your board, and they will have to pay rent if you land on their tiles. Landmark Rush – Completing landmarks, ie. sets with hotels on them, will grant you additional rewards for the specified amount of time. Photo: Scopely Mega Bank Heist – This is a limited-time event that enables you to earn additional money from bank heists. There is a catch though. You will have to choose three gold bars on the screen to earn the maximum amount of money available. The higher your multiplier, the higher your payout. Photo: Scopely Free Parking Event – This event grants you additional rewards, such as dice or cash when landing on specific tiles on the board. Monopoly GO Rewards – What Are They? Monopoly Go rewards are plentiful and can vary in so many ways. Below we have listed a few of the rewards you can expect to earn in Monopoly Go events, as well as normal gameplay: Dice – By far the most important current in Monopoly Go, if you don't have dice, you cannot play. You cannot earn money by rolling the dice if you don't have it, and in turn, you cannot buy property which means you are stranded. Additional dice will become available after waiting 5 minutes, as well as other methods, such as free dice links, and more. Cash – Of course, cash is a factor in Monopoly Go! Without it, you cannot purchase additional properties and progress. You need to build houses and transform them into hotels, which will grant you additional rewards as can be seen above. Stickers – Stickers are one of the most coveted items in Monopoly Go. With a hefty 10,000 Free dice reward, a new token, and cash, one can understand why! Earn this massive reward by trading stickers with your friends, and participating in Monopoly Go Events \u0026 Tournaments. Emojis – To be honest, the purpose of the emojis is not well-known, however, using them to give a well-deserved getting to friends after attacking them can be a blast! Shields – You need these in order to avoid that attack on your property! Earn them by rolling dice and landing on designated tiles on your board. Tokens – Your tokens can be seen when you attack another player, as well as when you are rolling around your own board. Earn them by placing in the top numbers on leaderboards during Monopoly Go Events \u0026 Tournaments. Final Thoughts That's it, folks!
