  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Proton Pass now allows users to attach files to passwords, making it a one-stop secure storage solution. Users can creatively use this feature by attaching files like scans of passports to logins, and it's free. Proton Pass offers a free account, with paid subscriptions starting at just $2.99 per month. Proton VPN is one of the best VPN services out right now. But Proton offers a lot of other important services as well, with one of the more popular ones being its password manager, Proton Pass. Related While we've seen plenty of improvements to this service over the past couple of years, like the introduction of Pass Monitor, the brand is now introducing a new feature, allowing users to attach files to passwords. Source: Proton Going forward, Proton Pass users will now have the ability to safely store files using the service, which makes it a one-stop shop for all things you want to keep secure and private. Users will have the ability to attach files to new and existing passwords that are stored on the service, or attach files to a login, alias, card, note, and more. Proton has included a number of examples of how this new feature can be used, like keeping \"scans of your passport saved to an airline login or a note with your flight details.\" The brand also mentions attaching \"Attach SSH keys or API tokens to logins for developer platforms.\" For the most part, we think that users will be able to get pretty creative with this. The best part is that you can attach as many files as you want to one item, and the only limitations being the storage size of the account, which ranges from 10GB to 500GB, and files that need to be kept under 100MB. For the most part, not a bad addition to an already good service. If you've never tried Proton Pass, you can always give it a try for free. And if you think this works for you, you can always upgrade to a paid account which now starts at $2.99 per month. Proton Pass works on all platforms and there's even an Android app for easy access.",

store files using the service, which makes it a one-stop shop for all things you want to keep secure and private. Users will have the ability to attach files to new and existing passwords that are stored on the service, or attach files to a login, alias, card, note, and more. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eProton has included a number of examples of how this new feature can be used, like keeping \u0026#34;scans of your passport saved to an airline login or a note with your flight details.\u0026#34; The brand also mentions attaching \u0026#34;Attach SSH keys or API tokens to logins for developer platforms.\u0026#34; For the most part, we think that users will be able to get pretty creative with this. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe best part is that you can attach as many files as you want to one item, and the only limitations being the storage size of the account, which ranges from 10GB to 500GB, and files that need to be kept under 100MB. For the most part, not a bad addition to an already good service. If you\u0026#39;ve never tried Proton Pass, you can always give it a try for free. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you think this works for you, you can always upgrade to a paid account which now starts at $2.99 per month. Proton Pass works on all platforms and there\u0026#39;s even an Android app for easy access. \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
