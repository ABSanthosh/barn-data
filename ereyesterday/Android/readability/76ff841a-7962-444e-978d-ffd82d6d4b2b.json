Take a look: Oppo says the fan's design boosts cooling efficiency by 300% over traditional fans, while reducing space usage by 70% and increasing the fan's power by 120%. Obviously the whole point of adding the fan is providing smooth high frame rate gaming with no dips in performance due to throttling because of excess heat. And according to Oppo K series product manager Wei Wei, the new devices will be able to run Honor of Kings at an average of 120.36fps, while Game for Peace averages 119.76fps, both with incredible stability when the fan is engaged. As an optional extra, the K13 Turbo and Turbo Pro will get the Super Cooling Set which consists of a case with magnets onto which you can attach an external fan to make things even cooler. The K13 Turbo and K13 Turbo Pro will be IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 certified for water resistance, which is a very tall feat of engineering considering the fan inside. Via",
