While the prices of big-screened TVs have dropped over the years, obviously the larger the TV, the more expensive it gets. Luckily for you, TCL is running a sale for its smart TVs ahead of the holiday season, so check out these deals below if you want to save yourself some money! TCL 98″ Q Class 4K UHD HDR QLED Smart TV Starting with the 98-inch TCL Q6 TV, the company has announced that for a limited time only, they are offering it at a 47% discount. This brings the price of the TV down to a mere $1,599. We know that it still isn’t cheap per se, but compared to competing brands and considering what you’ll be getting, it’s an outright steal. The TCL Q6 is a smart TV with support for Google TV. This means that you’ll be able to download and access a bunch of apps, including those made by your favorite streaming service. The Q6 features the use of a QLED PRO Quantum Dot display. It boasts a 4K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports HDR PRO+ with Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG. There’s support for Dolby Atmos Audio, DTS Virtual:X, a built-in subwoofer, and support for Bluetooth connectivity. It also works with various digital assistants and smart home platforms like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple’s HomeKit. TCL 98″ Q Class 4K UHD HDR QD-Mini LED Smart TV Next up, we have the 98-inch TCL QM7. We’re not going to lie, this will cost you more. However, as part of TCL’s early Black Friday sales, this TV is enjoying a 54% discount which brings it down to $2,299. It’s not cheap, but looking at its specs, features, and size, it’s not a bad TV deal. The TCL QM7 features a 4K resolution and relies on QD-Mini LED display technology. It has an Ultra LED backlight that helps boost the brightness of the display, and it also comes with a 120Hz refresh rate to ensure that buttery smooth experience, whether you’re watching movies or playing games. Similar to the Q6, there’s support for HDR Ultra with Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG. There’s a built-in game accelerator with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so if you plan to hook up a console to the TV, you should have a fantastic gaming experience. Especially when combined with Dolby Atmos Audio and DTS Virtual:X. The QM7 comes with Google TV and Chromecast built-in, along with Apple’s AirPlay 2, so casting content from your phone, tablet, or laptop shouldn’t be an issue.
