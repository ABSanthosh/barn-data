  "text": "Fortnite's new Blitz Royale mode is the most fun shooter I've played in a while, and you should play it too Sign in to your XDA account Fortnite is one game that I don't think I could ever stop playing. Having been a player for eight strong years now, I'm genuinely in awe of how the game manages to stay fresh and keep renewing itself. I'm yet to see a game remain this fun, so consistently, while changing so much about its gameplay, themes, environments, and mechanics with almost every update. Consider the original version of the game from 2017, and today's version — they're worlds apart. Now, the game has come out with a new, fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping mode called Blitz Royale. What's insane about this is that Blitz Royale has become the most popular game mode in the game, beating out even the game's main Battle Royale mode. But why? The answer's simple — Blitz mode right now is the best way to play this game, for veterans and newcomers alike. Related 4 ways Elden Ring Nightreign reminds me of Fortnite Elden Ring Nightreign feels like melding of Elden Ring and Fornite. The rules of the Blitz mode are made to deliver non-stop adrenaline Yes please, inject it into my veins Over eight years, I’ve seen Fortnite evolve from a regular Battle Royale to introducing Blitz mode in 2018 (where I got my first win). Then came Limited Time Events with unique themes, weapons, and mechanics I still miss. Zero Build renewed our love for the game, and Reload lets you come back after dying. Fortnite has changed so much that the original BR returned as the “OG” mode — and even that’s gone through three chapters. All that is to say that the current Blitz mode that Fortnite has us playing is the fastest the game has ever been. It's also the most rewarding, and the most forgiving, all at the same time. It's a tiny map consisting of a few recycled locations, filled to the brim with chests, supply drops, and just 32 players instead of the regular 100. There is no building in the game (thank god), either. Players spawn with a randomized medallion that grants them extra powers like infinite stamina or ammo, and no matter where you are, what your health is, or how much ammo you have, you must keep moving, because the storm circle just doesn't stop in this game mode. Related I spent 100 hours recreating my high school in Fortnite and here's how it went It had been an age-old dream, and what started with the Source engine, ended in Unreal Editor for Fortnite, eight years later. It's a chance to test and enjoy the game's best weaponry, every single game Gold weapons, exotic medallions, and infinite boons From the moment you touch the ground, you’re surrounded by loot chests. Blitz ensures that the spawn rate of chests is higher than ever, meaning you always have a weapon to pick from, close by. In fact, you even have one in your inventory before you land, half the time, and that too, a Mythic weapon class that’s the highest caliber in the game. With a certain medallion already equipped and a mid-to-high-tier weapon close by, you literally hit the ground running. In the main game, you need to spend five to six minutes on average taking down a very difficult boss to score just one medallion, let alone two. This is the game making sure that you don’t bother yourself with lower-tier weapons for more than a couple of magazines and clips. Because not only have chests been increased, but also the special chests that offer up the highest epic or legendary items. Something that might take you an hour’s worth of games to find in the main game is impossible to avoid every two minutes in Blitz. From start to finish, your inventory looks pristine, every single time. Then, there’s the Blitz level – a quick ranking system that resets every match, and rewards you for knocking and eliminating players, and surviving circles. The higher it goes, the more Exotic and Mythic weapons spawn right into your inventory — you don’t even have to hunt for them. Just hunt players, and the weapons will follow. Adding to the mix are Golden Loot Drops that spawn across the map, sometimes even in the storm, and they drop more medallions to collect if you’re willing to risk it. Supply drops may have weapons and medallions, but golden llamas are what it’s all about. They offer not weapons, but mythic, status-changing items that could help you insanely with traversal or attack. From start to finish within five minutes, whether you’re playing solo, duos mode, or squads, Blitz mode ensures that your inventory looks pristine, every single time. In the regular modes, one out of twenty-five squads or fifty duos would look like this, and it would still take them fifteen minutes to get there. Related Blitz Royale is the best way to learn the game The victories never stop coming, and neither do the L's For all of its fancy, fast-paced hijinks, Blitz Royale is also the best way to learn the game. With the tiny map and unstoppable storm circle, you have no other option than to confront other players who you will keep running into. In every confrontation, you'll die if you suck, but that is never going to be a problem, because you're going to be back on the ground in the next map, all within 45–50 seconds, tops. Now, if you know how to handle yourself, there is no doubt that the victories will simply keep on coming. However, the best part about the Blitz Royale mode is that I can play a guaranteed 6–7 games within a span of 30 minutes. With a strong chance of victories or just rewarding, fast-paced combat in each match, I'm completely onboard. I now have a reason to boot up the game even during short breaks or sessions, knowing I'll rank up, get more victories, and if nothing else, I'm certainly going to be having a ton of fun. My partner, who has just begun gaming and playing Fortnite, actually avoided Blitz Royale because of how fast-paced it was. After I convinced her to drop into the Blitz mode with me, she realized how good it was for learning the game quickly. No matter how many times she messed up (there were aplenty), she could try making attempts by trying out new strategies and weapons the next time, and all it took between attempts was a minute. If I was fighting a duo by myself, she would be forced to come in and help, aim at fast-moving opponents, and make mistakes that I could actively point out for the next match. The best thing? That 'next match' won't be three or four minutes away, and the next time such an opportunity arises, it won't be a matter of chance. Related Can we stop crying about celebrity skins in Fortnite? Players are mad about Sabrina Carpenter in Fortnite, but the chaos is exactly why the game still thrives. Blitz Royale isn't here to stay, and it will keep changing The new game mode will change themes every week before leaving in a month It's been a week since Blitz Royale dropped, and at the time of writing this, the mode has moved into week 2, where it has changed its theme. A few locations have changed assets, but the map remains largely the same. Now, instead of looking for golden llamas and mythic items, players will now spawn with either Waterbending, Airbending, Firebending, or Earthbending scrolls in their inventory already. Each of these abilities from Avatar: The Last Airbender is equally fun to wield. After that, weeks three and four will have different themes and special weapons, keeping things fresh in this already-unique new game mode. Perhaps that is why players simply can't stop playing the mode, myself included. It's not here to stay, and once it's gone, we're going to miss it like one of the great LTMs that never came back. Players have been taking to Reddit and other social media platforms to constantly ask Epic Games to make Blitz a permanent game mode they could always go to. In the meantime, Epic Games has extended Blitz Mode by a full month, and leaks suggest that future weekly collaborations could include Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball, among others. Already, it's clear that the player base wants Blitz to be a permanent fixture in the game. Related Fortnite is breaking down a huge barrier for Snapdragon chips Fortnite is just the start for broader game support on Snapdragon chips. Even if you don't play Fortnite, give Blitz Royale a chance to change your mind Do yourself a favor and try out the game's Blitz Royale If you've never tried Fortnite before, now is the best time to do it. Blitz Royale is really going to keep you on your feet, keep giving you amazing weapons to collect and use, and familiarize you with the core gameplay loop at the center of each mode. The only thing it does better is to keep rewarding you even for losing, because you'll be back in the next game before a minute is up, and you'll be able to try out more weapons and techniques until something clicks. All that would be left then is to take those newfound skills to the main Zero-Build mode, where you'd be a lot more familiar with the game and derive so much more enjoyment with longer matches and the victory royale at the end. Blitz gives you everything Fortnite is about in its purest, most condensed form, and eight years later, it's the most fun this game has ever been for me.

I can't believe how fresh Fortnite keeps things, consistently If you've never tried Fortnite before, now is the best time to do it. I mean it when I say this is the most fun I've had playing a shooter in forever. Of course, before this, it was Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, since I couldn't find it in myself to resume my toxic relationship with the Warzone battle royale mode the game has. I truly hope the Blitz Royale mode is here to stay, and I can keep running it back every five minutes to try something new whenever I'm bored. Gaming",

Having been a player for eight strong years now, I\u0026#39;m genuinely in awe of how the game manages to stay fresh and keep renewing itself. I\u0026#39;m yet to see a game remain this fun, so consistently, while changing so much about its gameplay, themes, environments, and mechanics with almost every update.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eConsider the original version of the game from 2017, and today\u0026#39;s version — they\u0026#39;re worlds apart.

What\u0026#39;s insane about this is that Blitz Royale has become the most popular game mode in the game, beating out even \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe game\u0026#39;s main Battle Royale mode\u003c/a\u003e.

Then came Limited Time Events with unique themes, weapons, and mechanics I still miss. Zero Build renewed our love for the game, and Reload lets you come back after dying. \u003cem\u003eFortnite \u003c/em\u003ehas changed so much that the original BR returned as the “OG” mode — and even that’s gone through three chapters.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAll that is to say that the current Blitz mode that \u003cem\u003eFortnite \u003c/em\u003ehas us playing is the fastest the game has ever been. It\u0026#39;s also the most rewarding, and the most forgiving, all at the same time. It\u0026#39;s a tiny map consisting of a few recycled locations, filled to the brim with chests, supply drops, and just 32 players instead of the regular 100. There is no building in the game (thank god), either.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003ePlayers spawn with a randomized medallion that grants them extra powers like infinite stamina or ammo, and no matter

is also the best way to learn the game. With the tiny map and unstoppable storm circle, you have no other option than to confront other players who you will keep running into. In every confrontation, you\u0026#39;ll die if you suck, but that is never going to be a problem, because you\u0026#39;re going to be back on the ground in the next map, all within 45–50 seconds, tops.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eNow, if you know how to handle yourself, there is no doubt that the victories will simply keep on coming. However, the best part about the Blitz Royale mode is that I can play a guaranteed 6–7 games within a span of 30 minutes. With a strong chance of victories or just rewarding, fast-paced combat in each match, I\u0026#39;m completely onboard. I now have a reason to boot up the game even during short breaks or sessions, knowing I\u0026#39;ll rank up, get more victories, and if nothing else, I\u0026#39;m certainly going to be having a ton of fun.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eMy partner, \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/unspoken-video-game-rules-playing-with-partner/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewho has just begun gaming\u003c/a\u003e and playing \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e, actually avoided Blitz Royale because of how fast-paced it was. After I convinced her to drop into the Blitz mode with me, she realized how good it was for learning the game quickly. No matter how many times she messed up (there were aplenty), she could try making attempts by trying out new strategies and weapons the next time, and all it took between attempts was a minute. If I was fighting a duo by myself, she would be forced to come in and help, aim at fast-moving opponents, and make mistakes that I could actively point out for the next match. The best thing? That \u0026#39;next match\u0026#39; won\u0026#39;t be three or four minutes away, and the next time such an opportunity arises, it won\u0026#39;t be a matter of chance.\u003c/p\u003e            \n

A few locations have changed assets, but the map remains largely the same.

Perhaps that is why players simply can\u0026#39;t stop playing the mode, myself included. It\u0026#39;s not here to stay, and once it\u0026#39;s gone, we\u0026#39;re going to miss it like one of the great LTMs that never came back. Players have been taking to Reddit and other social media platforms to constantly ask Epic Games to make Blitz a permanent game mode they could always go to. In the meantime, Epic Games has extended Blitz Mode by a full month, and leaks suggest that future weekly collaborations could include Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball, among others. Already, it\u0026#39;s clear that the player base wants Blitz to be a permanent fixture in the game.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n
