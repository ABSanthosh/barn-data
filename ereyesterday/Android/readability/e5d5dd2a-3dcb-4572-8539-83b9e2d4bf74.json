  "text": "A growing trend in the last few years has been the release of retro game collections. These compile multiple releases within a given series and put them into one package for fans to own some of their favorite video game franchises. Longtime players love revisiting some of the classics they remember playing often. Now that the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally hit store shelves, one can expect to see more retro collections released for the platform, especially ones rooted in Nintendo's history. Because the Switch 2 is a more powerful version of the original Switch, the range of retro titles that could be released as collections has become much wider. But which retro game collections would be a good fit for the Nintendo Switch 2? Nintendo has a variety of great and classic titles on their previous consoles, ones that many gamers remember helped define some of the consoles they released on. But if companies want to take advantage of people's nostalgia for games they love to play, then it's time that certain video game series finally got their time in the spotlight. Here are some retro game collections we need to see released on the Nintendo Switch 2, and why they would be successful. Related Nintendo Switch 2 Online: Launch experience impressions Is playing the Nintendo Switch 2 online a great experience for everyone? Here are launch impressions of what it's like going online with Switch 2. 4 Super Smash Bros. Collection Settling all of it in Smash Most people who play games on Nintendo platforms love the Super Smash Bros. series, which is all the reason needed to see a collection of the series put onto the Switch 2. Luckily, the Nintendo Switch 2 is able to run games from the GameCube and Nintendo Wii libraries very well, which opens up the possibility of seeing some of the most popular Super Smash Bros. games once again. Ask anybody who knows of the series, and they'll often bring up Super Smash Bros. Melee at some point, maybe even Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. But instead of just having single releases of these games on the eShop, having a collection that brings together these games into one spot would be something Nintendo fans would love. Does this mean that a collection would need to have Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the most recent entry in the series? Not necessarily, as that game can already be ported easily to the Switch 2 alone and has plenty of content. The predecessors of that game, however, haven't always been re-released in places like the Nintendo Classics through Switch Online, or the eShop. Keeping things simple with just Super Smash Bros. on N64, Super Smash Bros. Melee on GameCube, and Super Smash Bros. Brawl from the Wii would be more than enough for a classic Smash Bros. collection. This would give fans what they've always wanted, an easy way to pull these incredibly hype-inducing games out once again, and let Nintendo reap the profits from everyone's nostalgia. 3 Star Wars Rogue Squadron Trilogy The saga we need on Switch 2 When it comes to Star Wars games on Nintendo consoles, the Rogue Squadron series is a major high point. The first game was released on the Nintendo 64, and later ported over to PC, while the two sequels to it were on the Nintendo GameCube. Star Wars Rogue Squadron puts players into the cockpit of a starfighter to fight for the Rebel Alliance during a time when the Galactic Empire is dominating the galaxy. Not only can you pilot ships like X-Wings, A-Wings, and other Rebel starships, but a collection of unlockables lets you play as other legendary ships from the Star Wars universe. The missions that happen during the story of each game take place during various times in the original Star Wars trilogy of films, with some iconic scenes from them being recreated in the games. This is a series of classic Star Wars games that should have been put into a collection a long time ago. It's the one trilogy of games that has hardly ever been re-released in any form, despite how popular the games are. Each Rogue Squadron game received critical praise and was a commercial success on its respective console, despite the last entry in the series being criticized more than its predecessors. Some might prefer the more simulation-style of flying that comes from the X-Wing and TIE Fighter series on PC, but Star Wars Rogue Squadron became very popular with its arcade approach to gameplay. Seeing these games bundled together on the Switch 2 would be a very cool thing for Star Wars fans. Related 5 Star Wars PC games that need to be remastered now There are many different Star Wars games that are on PC, but these are the Star Wars games we want to see get the remastered treatment! 2 Turok Dinosaur Hunter Collection Give us all the dinosaur hunting There has been a resurgence of the Turok Dinosaur Hunter games in recent years. Nightdive Studios remastered three of the original Turok games that were released on Nintendo 64 and PC, making them definitive versions of those titles with the best of both worlds. However, not every game in the series has gotten that level of remastering, nor have the three games that did ever been bundled together into a Turok collection. This is something that should be done, especially with the previous games bundled together into one package. Those who grew up playing games on the Nintendo 64 know how important the series was for pushing a more mature tone for the console, which eventually led other third-party studios to release more mature games on the N64. But having the first three Turok games isn't enough for a collection like this. The final game that was part of that saga on the N64 was Turok: Rage Wars, a multiplayer-focused entry that used some of the same mechanics and engine from Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. The game was never remastered by Asypr Media like the three mainline entries, which would make it a great addition to a collection that brought together all the original games. Finding some way to make the multiplayer of Turok: Rage Wars functional through Switch Online would also be a big step toward making something like this very appealing to fans of the series. 1 Wario Land Collection It's Wario time to shine The Wario Land games are very good platformers starring Nintendo's greedy antagonist. All of these games were originally released on the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, following in the same footsteps as the Super Mario Land titles. Although Wario Land began as the third entry in the Super Mario Land series, it became popular enough to spin off on its own. Wario is a fun character to see get into mischief, especially when it involves giant stacks of coins and wacky transformations in the quest to get them. The first three games on the Game Boy took Wario on crazy adventures, while the fourth entry on the Game Boy Advance began to change the tone of the series. Eventually, two more entries that were adjacent to the Wario Land games would be released on the GameCube and Nintendo Wii, but they were very different from the others. The four Wario Land games are incredibly fun and should be put together into one collection. It would be hilarious if Nintendo gave something like this the same treatment they did with the Super Mario collection or Kirby's Dream Land Collection, which were on the Nintendo Wii, but twisted the concept to fit Wario's personality. While some of these games can be played in the Nintendo Classics applications through the Switch Online service, it'd be great to see them get a full release as a retro classic collection. There are plenty of things Nintendo fans would be curious about seeing that are Wario-related, such as concept art or the history of the character from the Game Boy era. Wario may have switched things up as he became more relevant to the WarioWare titles, but some of the best times with him were definitely in the Wario Land games. What's old can be new again Nintendo is no stranger to re-releasing some of its older games, especially as eShop, Classics, or Virtual Console releases. But more people love the idea of having bundles that compile games they love into one place, perceiving what they feel is more valuable. Luckily for Nintendo, there are plenty of great series to browse through their history for retro collections that could be popular on the Switch 2. And with the new console capable of playing games from more recent eras, the number of games that could be re-released is greater than ever. There are also plenty of great examples of how a retro collection can be done, with some of the best ones coming from developers like Digital Eclipse. Hopefully, retro gaming fans can eventually see more of their favorite titles return in a big way with the Nintendo Switch 2.

Ask anybody who knows of the series, and they\u0026#39;ll often bring up \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Melee\u003c/em\u003e at some point, maybe even \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros.\u003c/em\u003e on the Nintendo 64. But instead of just having single releases of these games on the eShop, having a collection that brings together these games into one spot would be something Nintendo fans would love.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eDoes this mean that a collection would need to have \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\u003c/em\u003e, the most recent entry in the series? Not necessarily, as that game can already be ported easily to the Switch 2 alone and has plenty of content. The predecessors of that game, however, haven\u0026#39;t always been re-released in places like the Nintendo Classics through Switch Online, or the eShop. Keeping things simple with just \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros.\u003c/em\u003e on N64, \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Melee\u003c/em\u003e on GameCube, and \u003cem\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\u003c/em\u003e from the Wii would be more than enough for a classic \u003cem\u003eSmash Bros.\u003c/em\u003e collection.

resurgence of the \u003cem\u003eTurok Dinosaur Hunter\u003c/em\u003e games in recent years. Nightdive Studios remastered three of the original \u003cem\u003eTurok\u003c/em\u003e games that were released \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-3-best-things-about-the-nintendo-64-that-everyone-forgets/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon Nintendo 64\u003c/a\u003e and PC, making them definitive versions of those titles with the best of both worlds. However, not every game in the series has gotten that level of remastering, nor have the three games that did ever been bundled together into a \u003cem\u003eTurok\u003c/em\u003e collection. This is something that should be done, especially with the previous games bundled together into one package. Those who grew up playing games on the Nintendo 64 know how important the series was for pushing a more mature tone for the console, which eventually led other third-party studios to release more mature games on the N64.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eBut having the first three \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-game-revived/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTurok\u003c/em\u003e games\u003c/a\u003e isn\u0026#39;t enough for a collection like this. The final game that was part of that saga on the N64 was \u003cem\u003eTurok: Rage Wars\u003c/em\u003e, a multiplayer-focused entry that used some of the same mechanics and engine from \u003cem\u003eTurok 2: Seeds of Evil\u003c/em\u003e. The game was never remastered by Asypr Media like the three mainline entries, which would make it a great addition to a collection that brought together all the original games. Finding some way to make the multiplayer of \u003cem\u003eTurok: Rage Wars\u003c/em\u003e functional through Switch Online would also be a big step toward making something like this very appealing to fans of the series.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"wario-land-collection\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Wario Land Collection\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"it-39-s-wario-time-to-shine\"\u003e\n            It\u0026#39;s Wario time to shine\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eWario Land\u003c/em\u003e games are very good platformers starring Nintendo\u0026#39;s greedy antagonist. All of these games were originally released on the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, following in the same footsteps as the \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Land\u003c/em\u003e titles. Although \u003cem\u003eWario Land\u003c/em\u003e began as the third entry in the \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Land\u003c/em\u003e series, it became popular enough to spin off on its own. Wario is a fun character to see get into mischief, especially when it involves giant stacks of coins and wacky transformations in the quest to get them. The first three games on the Game Boy took Wario on crazy adventures, while the fourth entry on the Game Boy Advance began to change the tone of the series. Eventually, two more entries that were adjacent to the \u003cem\u003eWario Land\u003c/em\u003e games would be released on the GameCube and Nintendo Wii, but they were very different from the others.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe four \u003cem\u003eWario Land\u003c/em\u003e games are incredibly fun and should be put together into one collection. It would be hilarious if Nintendo gave something like this the same treatment they did with the Super Mario collection or Kirby\u0026#39;s Dream Land Collection, which were on the Nintendo Wii, but twisted the concept to fit Wario\u0026#39;s personality. While some of these games can be played in the Nintendo Classics applications through \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-online-launch-experience-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Switch Online service\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0026#39;d be great to see them get a full release as a retro classic collection. There are plenty of things Nintendo fans would be curious about seeing that are Wario-related, such as concept art or the history of the character from the Game Boy era. Wario may have switched things up as he became more relevant to the \u003cem\u003eWarioWare\u003c/em\u003e titles, but some of the best times with him were definitely in the \u003cem\u003eWario Land\u003c/em\u003e games.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"what-39-s-old-can-be-new-again\"\u003e\n            What\u0026#39;s old can be new again\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNintendo is no stranger to re-releasing some of its older games, especially as eShop, Classics, or Virtual Console releases. But more people love the idea of having bundles that compile games they love into one place, perceiving what they feel is more valuable. Luckily for Nintendo, there are plenty of great series to browse through their history for retro collections that could be popular on \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Switch 2\u003c/a\u003e. And with the new console capable of playing games from more recent eras, the number of games that could be re-released is greater than ever. There are also plenty of great examples of how a retro collection can be done, with some of the best ones coming from developers like Digital Eclipse. Hopefully, retro gaming fans can eventually see more of their favorite titles return in a big way with the Nintendo Switch 2.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
