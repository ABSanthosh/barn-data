It's currently limited to users in the US, who are enrolled into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.

Search Live works in the background too, so you can continue the conversation even while you're in another app. And the Transcript option will switch you into a text mode. With AI Mode history, you can always revisit a specific response and pick up where you left off. The only question here is why does this need to exist when Gemini Live already does, and on Android is much easier to access. Why can't both of these \"Live\" AI things by Google be the same thing? We don't know. Search Live uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice capabilities, Google says. In the coming months, it will let you use your camera when you talk back-and-forth so you can show it what you're seeing in real time - again, just like Gemini Live. Source",
