In Bangladesh, the phone comes in two configurations - 4/64GB for BDT 11,000 and 6/128GB for BDT 13,000. Other specs include a 32MP main camera and an 8MP selfie. There is also a 5,200 mAh battery on board, with support for 18W charging. The Redmi A5 4G also has a side-mounted fingerprint reader, Bluetooth 5.2, a Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack, plus a microSD expansion slot. All of this is housed inside a 171.7 x 77.8 x 8.26mm, 193g body. The phone boots Android 15 Go edition. Xiaomi Redmi A5 As per the source, the European market might just get a storage tier that is unlike the ones we already mentioned – 4GB, plus 128GB for €149. We aren't sure if a charger is included in this price. The Bangladesh units seem to come with a 15W charger. Source",
