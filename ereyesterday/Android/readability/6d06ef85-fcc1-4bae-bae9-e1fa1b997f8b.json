  "text": "Google's Gemini Live is about to receive a significant upgrade with video and screen-sharing capabilities. These new features promise to revolutionize how users interact with AI assistants on their devices. With the Mobile World Congress 2025 showcasing AI innovations, Google stands at the forefront of creating more intuitive digital experiences. Google recently announced two groundbreaking additions to its Gemini Live AI assistant: video sharing and screen sharing capabilities. These features represent a significant evolution in how artificial intelligence interacts with users, allowing the AI to see what you see and provide real-time assistance based on visual information. Initially available exclusively to Gemini Advanced subscribers, these innovations mark Google's commitment to creating more intuitive and contextual AI experiences. Video sharing brings Gemini's eyes to life Image: Fizkes The new video-sharing feature in Gemini Live leverages Google's Project Astra technology, enabling the AI assistant to analyze real-time camera feeds. This capability transforms how users can interact with the assistant in everyday situations. For instance, a craftsperson could show their work to Gemini and receive instant feedback on glazing colors that would create a modern aesthetic. Unlike previous iterations of AI assistants that relied solely on verbal descriptions, Gemini can now “see” objects, environments, and situations directly. This visual understanding creates a more natural interaction pattern, like showing something to a friend for their opinion rather than struggling to describe it accurately. The interface has been thoughtfully redesigned with a cleaner look and ergonomic control buttons, making navigation more intuitive during video-sharing sessions. This enhancement reflects Google's focus on creating seamless user experiences that feel less technological and more human. Screen sharing transforms digital assistance Complementing the video functionality, Google's screen sharing feature for Gemini Live represents another significant advancement in AI assistance. When activated through a “Share screen with Live” button in Gemini's Android overlay interface, users can receive contextual guidance without needing to describe what's on their screen. This capability proves particularly valuable when navigating online stores, comparing products, or attempting to understand complex information. For example, when shopping for clothing online, Gemini can analyze the selected item and suggest complementary pieces to complete an outfit, drawing from what it sees on screen. What distinguishes this feature from previous iterations is its conversational continuity. Users can scroll through pages, switch between screens, and ask multiple questions without restarting the interaction. The AI maintains context throughout, creating a more natural conversational flow that mirrors human assistance. Premium features signal Google's AI monetization strategy These powerful new capabilities are currently restricted to subscribers of Google One AI Premium plan with Gemini Advanced access. This exclusivity highlights Google's strategic approach to monetizing its AI innovations while recouping development costs for these sophisticated features. The restricted availability follows a pattern seen with previous Google AI tools, which often begin as premium offerings before eventually becoming available to wider audiences. Industry analysts expect video and screen sharing may follow this same trajectory, potentially becoming accessible to all Android users in the coming months. Google's decision to showcase these features at Mobile World Congress 2025 demonstrates how central AI capabilities have become to mobile technology. With competitors rapidly developing their own AI assistants, Google's visual interaction features may provide a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded marketplace. The future of visual AI interaction These developments signal a fundamental shift in AI assistant capabilities, from primarily text and voice interfaces to truly multimodal interactions incorporating visual understanding. The ability of AI to interpret what users are seeing creates possibilities for previously impossible assistance. As these features mature, they could transform how people use their devices for tasks ranging from shopping and cooking to troubleshooting and learning new skills. The continuous conversation model, where users can move between screens while maintaining context, more closely mimics human interaction patterns. While privacy considerations inevitably arise with visual sharing features, Google has emphasized user control through clear activation buttons and visual indicators when sharing is active. The technological breakthrough represents one more step toward AI assistants understanding the world as humans do – through multiple sensory inputs working together. With over a decade's experience covering the world of Android and having reviewed more devices than he can count, Peter is excited about where the world of tech is heading. He is currently packing the Oppo Find X8 Pro, OnePlus Pad 2, and an ASUS Chromebook Plus.",
