As such, Sennheiser finally took the wraps off its new HD 505 headphones, which are priced at just around 285 USD. The Sennheiser HD 505 headphones pack a lightweight and comfy design which features a synthetic leather headband and metal mesh earcups, which make for a subtle look. The headphones are also compatible with 3.5mm plugs and include a 6.3mm adapter, and allow users to easily swap cables and earpads without tools.

The headphones offer a wide frequency response of 12 to 38,500 Hz and extremely low total harmonic distortion (less than 0.2%), which should make for some crisp listening sessions whether with music, movies, or even during gaming sessions.
