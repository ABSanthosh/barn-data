Whether you're upgrading to an SSD or getting rid of an old PC, securely disposing of your old hard drive is very important. Just so you know - simply deleting files or reformatting the disk isn't enough. In this guide, I'll list the most essential actions you need to take before saying goodbye to your old storage friend. Related How to plan a storage upgrade for your PC: A guide to HDDs, SSDs, PCIe, and NVMe drives Upgrading the storage on your PC or laptop doesn't need to be hard, you just need to know where to start. 8 Back up your data before it's too late Ensure you don't lose anything important before wiping the drive Before doing anything irreversible, make sure to back up all your important files first. This includes documents, photos, passwords, and anything else you might need in the future. You can use another external hard drive, a cloud storage service like Google Drive or OneDrive, or even transfer the files to your new PC. A good practice is to use Windows' built-in Backup and Restore tool or a third-party backup tool like Duplicati. If you're unsure about what to back up, take a systematic approach: go through your folders, export browser bookmarks, save application settings, and even make a full system image if needed. Once you're sure everything is backed up, you can move on to the next step. Some partitions don't show up in File Explorer but may still contain data Your hard drive might have hidden partitions that contain old system backups, recovery images, or leftover files from previous installations. These partitions won't appear in File Explorer, so you'll need to check for them manually. To do this, open Disk Management by pressing Win + X and selecting Disk Management. Look for any partitions labeled as OEM Reserved, Recovery, or Hidden. If these partitions contain sensitive data, you'll want to delete them before disposing of the drive. You can use Diskpart to manually clean the disk by running the following commands in Command Prompt in this exact order: diskpart list disk select disk X (replace X with the correct disk number) clean This ensures every partition, including hidden ones, is erased properly. 6 Decrypt encrypted drives to avoid data corruption issues If your drive is encrypted, decrypt it before wiping it If you've used BitLocker or another encryption method to protect your hard drive, you'll need to decrypt it before wiping it completely. Encrypted drives don't always erase cleanly and recovery tools might still be able to extract some data. To disable BitLocker, open Control Panel \u003e BitLocker Drive Encryption, select the encrypted drive, and choose Turn off BitLocker. If you use third-party encryption software like VeraCrypt, follow its decryption process before proceeding with data erasure. Related 5 Erase the data completely, not just reformat A standard format doesn't actually erase data Many people assume that reformatting a drive removes all data, but that's not true. A simple format only deletes the file system structure, making files invisible, but they can still be recovered with specialized tools. To securely eradicate your hard drive's data, you'll need a proper data-wiping method. Here are a few ways to securely erase your hard drive: DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) – Use this free tool that overwrites data multiple times, making recovery impossible. Windows Secure Erase (for SSDs) – If you're wiping an SSD, use the manufacturer's secure erase tool (e.g., Samsung Magician, Crucial Storage Executive). Command Prompt (for HDDs) – Run cipher /w:C: to overwrite deleted files on the selected drive. These methods ensure your data is gone for good and can't be recovered by anyone. 4 Verify data erasure to be absolutely sure Double-check to confirm that nothing is recoverable Source: XDA / Apple Once you've erased the data, it's a good idea to verify that the drive is truly empty. You can do this by using a recovery tool like Recuva or EaseUS Data Recovery to scan the drive. If these tools can't find any recoverable files, you know the erasure was successful. For added peace of mind, you can also try writing new random data onto the disk to further ensure that no traces of your old data remain. 3 Avoid selling it unless you're 100% sure Reselling a hard drive comes with risks, even if it looks wiped Selling your old hard drive might seem like a good way to recover some money, but it's rarely worth the risk. Even if you've erased the data, sophisticated recovery techniques can sometimes restore old files. If you absolutely must sell it, ensure you've performed a multi-pass overwrite with a tool like DBAN. Alternatively, consider repurposing the internal hard drive for personal use, such as turning it into an external storage device with a USB enclosure. That way, you don't have to worry about where else it may end up. 2 Physically destroy the drive if you want zero-risk The most foolproof way to secure your data is to destroy the drive entirely. If your hard drive contains extremely sensitive information, and you want to eliminate any chance of recovery, physical destruction is the way to go. Here are a few effective methods: Drill holes through the platter (HDDs) – A few well-placed drill holes will make data recovery impossible. Use a degausser (HDDs) – This tool demagnetizes the drive, making it unreadable. Shatter the NAND chips (SSDs) – Unlike HDDs, SSDs don't have platters, so you'll need to destroy the memory chips directly. If you don't have the tools to do this yourself, many e-waste recycling centers offer secure drive destruction services. 1 Document the disposal process for future reference Keep a record of how you disposed of the drive for accountability Apple If you're getting rid of a hard drive from a work computer or handling multiple drives, it's a good idea to document the disposal process. This can be as simple as taking a photo of the destroyed drive or keeping a log of when and how you erased and disposed of it. Documenting is especially important for businesses to comply with data protection laws and industry standards. Some recycling centers also provide certificates of destruction as proof that data was securely erased. Don't let your old hard drive become a security risk Throwing away an old hard drive without taking the right precautions can put your personal data at risk, and it could be a goldmine for data thieves. From backing up your files to completely erasing and even physically destroying the drive, every step matters. Whether you're upgrading to a new storage device or simply cleaning out old tech, following these precautions ensures that your private information remains safe. If you're unsure what to do, just keep the hard disk safe somewhere with you, because once it leaves your hands, there's no getting it back or knowing where it may end up.",
