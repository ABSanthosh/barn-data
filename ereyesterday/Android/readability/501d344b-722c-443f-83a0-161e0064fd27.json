  "text": "Samsung’s launch of its DeX feature (short for ‘desktop experience’) for Windows devices was a revolutionary means to integrate software functionality between Samsung Galaxy Android phones and Windows PCs. A separate feature from the DeX interface on Galaxy devices, it also provided an easy way for users to manage files between two devices. With that in mind though, new reports indicate that Samsung might sunset the feature soon – as spotted on the Samsung UK website, the upcoming One UI 7 update for Galaxy devices will no longer support the DeX app for Windows, and users will have to rely on the “Link to Windows” feature to connect their Samsung devices to a computer. The notice reads: The DeX for PC on Windows OS will end support from One UI 7 version. We encourage customers to connect mobile phone and PC through the Link to Windows feature. To use the “Link to Windows” feature, refer to the following website… It should be noted though that users can still connect their phones to desktop PCs, as it’s only the Windows DeX app that will be discontinued. DeX itself will still be available on upcoming Samsung hardware and software products. Source: Android Authority",
