  "text": "HORI Split Pad Pro Attachment Set $40 $80 Save $40 A great way to breathe new life into your Switch. The Hori Split Pad Pro features a larger grip, assignable rear triggers, turbo functionality, and more. Grab it now for 50% off as it drops to just $40. The Switch 2 is taking the world by storm, with the console finally getting into the hands of eager Nintendo fans, becoming the fastest-selling console so far with 3.5 million units sold over the four days. Of course, not everyone is looking to spend big money to upgrade to Nintendo's latest console, and will instead stick with their current Switch for the time being. Related The good news is that this console will still be supported, which means grabbing games and accessories should come with a nice discount. With that said, if you've been looking to spruce up your Switch without breaking the bank, we recommend grabbing the Hori Split Pad Pro Attachment Set. Not only are you getting some beefy new Joy-Con controllers, but the set also delivers some perks that don't come with the originals. What's great about the Hori Split Pad Pro Attachment Set? These Joy-Con replacements are quite substantial when compared to the originals, offering a beefier hand grip that can be more comfortable if you're someone that plays in handheld mode for hours at a time. The great part is that it isn't just the grips that gain enhancements, but the buttons, analog sticks, triggers, and shoulder buttons also get substantial size improvements as well, making it more comfortable to play overall. In addition, Hori also adds some nice perks to its controllers with assignable rear triggers and turbo functionality. You can even use this as a wired controller thanks to an included attachment. However, it's important to note that there are trade-offs here. The Hori system does not include motion controls, rumble, NFC or an IR camera. With that said, these are going to be an excellent replacement for standard Joy-Cons if you're looking to get something that's more comfortable. Of course, you'll still have your original Joy-Con controllers just in case you need some of the more expanded features. Just be sure to pick these up while they're on sale because a deal like this doesn't come along all that often.",

However, it\u0026#39;s important to note that there are trade-offs here.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe Hori system does not include motion controls, rumble, NFC or an IR camera. With that said, these are going to be an excellent replacement for standard Joy-Cons if you\u0026#39;re looking to get something that\u0026#39;s more comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, you\u0026#39;ll still have your original Joy-Con controllers just in case you need some of the more expanded features. Just be sure to pick these up while they\u0026#39;re on sale because a deal like this doesn\u0026#39;t come along all that often. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
