  "text": "As far as content creation hardware goes, GoPro’s offerings are some of the best out there. If you’re after one for a more affordable price, the GoPro Hero12 Black is currently on sale right now, and while it is an older model it still packs some premium features not found on most competing products. As for what you can expect, the Hero 12 Black is made to be durable and waterproof for up to 33 feet, and can record footage continuously for up to 155 minutes of 1080p footage (or 70 minutes of 5.3K video). It also comes with support for HDR photos and videos, built-in GP-log and LUT support, as well as wireless audio support for compatible devices including AirPods and other Bluetooth audio gear. Inside, the Hero12 Black uses a 1/1.9″ sensor with an extra-large 8:7 aspect ratio, that allows for cropping into different sizes including vertical 9:16, widescreen 16:9, traditional 4:3 or full-frame 8:7 aspect ratios.
