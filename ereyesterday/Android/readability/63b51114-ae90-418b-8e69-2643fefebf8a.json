The Headphone (1) features an unorthodox design, comfy earpads and a set of premium features. The goal is to go head-to-head with the likes of Sony, Bose and Sennheiser. The headphones follow Nothing's transparent, techy design language and offer premium build quality.

They feel super convenient. The Headphone (1) has all the bells and whistles too. The pair features adaptive active noise cancellation. The 42dB ANC system is touted as a hybrid, relying on six microphones. The dynamic sound drivers are plenty big, measuring 40mm and are developed in collaboration with KEF. Support for the most common high-definition codecs like AAC, SBC and LDAC is available. Battery life is supposed to be 80 hours without ANC, which is outstanding, at least on paper. That's because they house a huge 1,040 mAh battery that charges over USB-C. There's also a 3.5mm audio jack if you prefer to go analogue. Nothing Headphone (1) Stay tuned for our full review where we dive deeper into all the features, design, sound quality and everyday use.",
