Apple will allegedly continue this trend of developing important connectivity chips in-house, and a new report today claims that the entire iPhone 17 family, coming this fall, will feature Apple's first self-developed Wi-Fi chip. This would replace the Broadcom chips Apple currently uses. The information comes from Ming-Chi Kuo, always in the know when it comes to Apple's supply chain in Asia. Interestingly, he notes that the iPhone 17 Air will not only use the Apple Wi-Fi chip, but also the Apple C1 modem that made its debut in the iPhone 16e. The iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max meanwhile will use Qualcomm modems with Apple's Wi-Fi chip. This is obviously a very deliberate cost reduction move, as in the long run investing in creating such chips in-house will save Apple a lot of money it's currently paying Qualcomm and Broadcom. But according to Kuo, it's not just all about money - the switch to the in-house Wi-Fi chip will also \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices\", whatever that means. Source",
