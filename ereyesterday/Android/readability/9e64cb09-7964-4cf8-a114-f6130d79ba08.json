  "text": "Sony’s audio products are unmatched when it comes to overall quality, and while the Japanese electronic brand’s audio offerings are more widely known thanks to gear like the XM4 and XM5 headphones, a lot of folks might be pleased to know that it also offers more affordable products, such as the Sony SRS-XB100 Bluetooth speaker. For buyers after a relatively affordable Bluetooth speaker, the Sony SRS-XB100 comes with a powerful bass sound, IP67 dust and water resistance, and up to 16 hours of battery life, making it ideal for outdoor excursions and such. It can also be paired to a second speaker for stereo sound, which is a much-welcome addition to its list of features. It’s currently on offer via Amazon at the moment, and you can check it out using the link below.
