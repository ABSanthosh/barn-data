If Google manages to release Android 16 before the end of June, then the Pixel 10 devices will launch with it on board from day one, but so will Samsung's next-gen foldables, which should become official in July. Interestingly, Google says there will be a second Android release in 2025, this one coming in the fourth quarter (October to December), but it will be a \"minor release\" that will \"pick up feature updates, optimizations, and bug fixes since the major release\". To us this sounds like we're getting Android 16.1 around this time next year. Source",
