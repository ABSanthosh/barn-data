The latest reports, which groups smart bands and smartwatches, shows Xiaomi as the world’s top vendor with 8.7 million shipments and a 19% market share. Xiaomi saw impressive 44% annual growth in shipments as the brand updated its Smart Band and Watch series and also introduced more affordable Redmi series products. The Redmi Band 5, in particular, was one of the best-selling wearables during the Q1 period. Apple came in second place with an estimated 7.6 million shipments and a 16% market share. Huawei came in third place with 7.1 million shipments and a 15% market share, thanks to strong demand for its Watch GT and Watch Fit series devices. Global wearable brands shipments Q1 2025 Samsung shipped 4.9 million wearables, earning an 11% market share thanks to solid growth in emerging markets. Garmin rounded out the top five with its 1.8 million shipments, earning it a 4% market share. Canalys also conducted a consumer study in Europe on the factors considered by users when buying a smartwatch. Price and battery life were the two most important factors for consumers, unsurprisingly. Health-tracking features, brand name and design were the other main factors in choosing a smart wearable. Interestingly enough, sport features were among the less important deciding factors. Looking ahead, Canalys predicts that ecosystem integration and post-purchase services will remain the leading fields of competition in the wearables market. Subscription-based models will be key to driving user engagement and brand revenues. Source",
