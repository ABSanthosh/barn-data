  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account T-Mobile has changed quite a bit from its Un-carrier days and is no longer the scrappy underdog. The brand has done quite a bit of expanding over the past few years, with new acquisitions, and further building out its home internet network. Of course, the brand is always trying to find new ways to expand, and it looks like it could be offering its own credit card in the near future. Related A new way to expand business The news comes from The Mobile Report, with its sources sharing that the wireless carrier may be looking to offer a new credit card to its customers. And while there are very few details at this point, the news outlet was able to find an image of a credit card within the T-Life app that could give this news a little more weight. As far as other details go, it appears that there may be an option to link the card to the T-Life app in order to process payments, and that the card may be backed by Capital One. Of course, there's probably a lot more to this than information available right now, but branded cards can be quite lucrative, especially if the brand is able to deliver additional perks by using the card. Both AT\u0026T and Verizon have credit cards of their own, and offer sign-up bonuses, along with points that can be earned through purchases. Again, it's unclear just what kind of promotions T-Mobile will offer, or if this card will even get out of the planning phase. But if there is already a graphic ready to go in the app, there's a pretty good chance that the release is close. And maybe if the times line up, you could even double-dip, taking advantage of the new promotions that T-Mobile has when switching from other carriers. Of course, if you're a legacy customer, there's always the chance that you're trying to move away from T-Mobile, especially with the latest price increases and fee adjustments.",

comes from The Mobile Report\u003c/a\u003e, with its sources sharing that the wireless carrier may be looking to offer a new credit card to its customers. And while there are very few details at this point, the news outlet was able to find an image of a credit card within the T-Life app that could give this news a little more weight. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs far as other details go, it appears that there may be an option to link the card to the T-Life app in order to process payments, and that the card may be backed by Capital One. Of course, there\u0026#39;s probably a lot more to this than information available right now, but branded cards can be quite lucrative, especially if the brand is able to deliver additional perks by using the card. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBoth AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon have credit cards of their own, and offer sign-up bonuses, along with points that can be earned through purchases. Again, it\u0026#39;s unclear just what kind of promotions T-Mobile will offer, or if this card will even get out of the planning phase. But if there is already a graphic ready to go in the app, there\u0026#39;s a pretty good chance that the release is close. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe if the times line up, you could even double-dip, taking advantage of the new promotions that T-Mobile has when \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/t-mobile-family-freedom-plan-release/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eswitching from other carriers\u003c/a\u003e.
