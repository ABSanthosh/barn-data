ChatGPT integration, Genmoji, and the Image Playground app are all expected as part of this update. Apple will reportedly launch its upgraded Siri in April as part of iOS 18.4. Apple finally launched its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features this week, but this is just the initial set of capabilities.
