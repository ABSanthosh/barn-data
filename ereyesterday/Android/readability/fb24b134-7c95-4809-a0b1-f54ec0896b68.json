  "text": "Oct 15, 2024 [[read-time]] min read We’re launching new theft protection features, a private space for sensitive apps, multitasking capabilities on foldables and tablets and more. Today, Android 15 starts rolling out to Pixel devices. These updates include security features that help keep your sensitive health, financial and personal information protected from theft and fraud. Plus, we’re introducing improvements for large-screen devices that help you get more done, and updates across apps including camera, messaging and passkeys.Your Android devices are always getting better thanks to new features and updates rolling out all the time — not just once a year. This year, we rolled out helpful new AI updates to Android devices, including Circle to Search and new ways to interact with Gemini. And today, we’re bringing you even more updates, here’s a look at what’s new:Help deter theft and recover a stolen device fasterThe new Theft Detection Lock1 uses AI to help keep your data safe. If your phone senses someone has snatched it and is trying to run, bike or drive away, it will automatically lock your device. You can also use Remote Lock to quickly lock your device from any device using your phone number and a simple security check. These features are now available for most Android 10+ devices.And Android 15 brings additional protections that prevent thieves from guessing your passwords and accessing sensitive information. For example, we’re adding authentication requirements for settings targeted by thieves, like removing your SIM or turning off Find My Device, and will lock down your device if we sense multiple failed attempts for apps and settings. These updates make it harder for thieves to reset and sell a stolen device, and deter more thefts before they happen. Learn more about the new theft protection features on the Google Online Security blog. Video format not supported Keep sensitive apps out of sightPrivate space in Android 15 acts like a digital safe on your phone. You can create a separate private space to organize sensitive apps, like your social, dating or banking apps. When private space is locked, apps remain virtually invisible to others and are hidden from your apps list, recent apps view, notifications and settings. To access private space, there’s an additional layer of authentication to keep apps secure and away from prying eyes. And for additional privacy, you can choose to hide the existence of private space from view on your phone. Video format not supported Get more done on your foldables and tabletsNew features in Android 15 make it easier for you to access the apps that help you get things done — whether you’re writing an email or brainstorming in a doc.On foldables and tablets, you can now easily pin and unpin your taskbar on the screen. This allows you to customize your layout and keep your favorite apps, like Google Photos or Gmail, in reach for quicker access and improved productivity. Video format not supported App pairing provides a quick shortcut to make multitasking easier. For example, you can open Google Drive and Gmail at the same time to easily drag and drop files. You can also save your most frequently used app combinations and they’ll appear as a single app icon on your foldable or tablet. With just a tap, you can quickly retrieve them in split-screen for faster access. Video format not supported Log in securely, take better photos and moreThere are even more Android 15 improvements across camera, messaging and passwords. Here’s a look at what else is new:Low Light Boost and in-app camera controls now work better in low-light conditions. And third-party apps have more camera control, like more precise flash control.Carrier messaging apps can use satellite connectivity to send and receive messages without a mobile or Wi-Fi connection.In apps that use Passkeys for authentication, you can log in with a single tap.Try out these Android 15 features — plus many more features coming to Pixel devices — and stay tuned for more updates to come.",
