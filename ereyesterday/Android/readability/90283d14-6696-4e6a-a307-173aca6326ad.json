The new phone is expected to have the 48 MP Sony IMX787 sensor in its main camera that is also in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Alongside it will be a 13 MP ultrawide snapper, and a 13 MP selfie camera inside a punch hole at the front. Dimentions of the Google Pixel 9a are 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm with a body that weighs 186 grams. The larger battery and display will not affect the price; once again, it will begin from $499, just like its predecessor. Source",
