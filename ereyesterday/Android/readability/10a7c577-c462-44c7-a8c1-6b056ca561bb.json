I've been a tech enthusiast for a very long time, so I always feel compelled to have the best that there is. Flagships cost a lot though—which explains why I aim to use each one for at least three years straight. However, some people really don't give a hoot about power. They just want a phone that's affordable and that does the job well. Well, if you're looking for a budget phone, one of the most consistent lineups that you can turn to is the Moto G series. Today, Motorola just unveiled the Moto G and Moto G Power for 2025, and I promise you that both phones are shockingly good for the price that they come at. Let's talk about them. The Moto G 2025 Is Very Affordable and Offers Just Enough for Everyone Image: Motorola One thing I love to see is that from the top to bottom of its phone portfolio, Motorola has settled into its new design language, and I like it a lot. Whether you hate it or love it, you can't but admit that they're distinct and are very easy to pick out of a lineup. The Moto G 2025 protects the 6.7-inch 120Hz HD display with Gorilla Glass 3, uses vegan leather for the back panel, and only has a water-repellant design—that's IP52. The Moto G 2025 supports 5G thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 inside it. You also get 4GB of RAM with either 64 or 128GB of expandable storage. There's a 5,000mAh battery and support for 30W wired charging (don't complain; Samsung's base S25 will still stick to 25W). The 50MP primary camera is a big part of the marketing, paired with a 2MP macro. On the front, you'll find a 16MP camera. Image: Motorola The Moto G 2025 comes with Android 15 out of the box and manages to squeeze in a headphone jack, which is nice for a device that will start at merely $199.99. You'll be able to get it unlocked starting from January 30th. The Moto G Power 2025 Is Built to Last, with Surprising Durability Image: Motorola If you want a little bit more and you're not afraid to pay for it, the Moto G Power 2025 is the device for you. You get a similar design, a vegan leather back panel, and a 6.8-inch 120Hz FHD display protected by Gorilla Glass 5. That's not where the toughness stops. The phone has MIL-STD-810H certification, which makes it military standard. On top of that, it has IP68 and IP69 ratings, which is pretty surprising to see at its price point. You get a 5,000mAh battery and 30W wired charging, but the Moto G Power adds 15W wireless charging for added convenience. In the camera field is a 50MP primary camera with OIS, but this phone differs from the Moto G 2025 with an 8MP ultrawide and macro lens—most people will prefer that. There's a 16MP camera for selfies too. The device runs on a Dimensity 6300 as well and comes in an 8/128GB configuration with a microSD slot. Image: Motorola Of course, Android 15 appears here too, and very pleasantly, a headphone jack is present. The Moto G Power 2025 will be available from February 6th and will cost $299.99, making it a full $100 more expensive than its partner. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
