This means that the $50 is just deposited into your account automatically. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic comes with a $100 Amazon gift card, which you have to manually redeem.Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 40mm + $50 promotional creditSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 40mm + $50 promotional creditBrighter display, better battery lifeThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 offers a new 'squircle' look, with new band attachments, backed by new software, a 50% brighter display over last year's model, and a slightly larger battery. The watch is available in four configurations: a 40mm display in Wi-Fi or LTE and a 44mm display in Wi-Fi or LTE.The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 adopts a new design, with a more square bezel and circular screen that more closely resembles the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s look. Love it or hate it, it certainly makes it stand out from most other smartwatches.It’s also 11% thinner. While thinner, it still features an IP68 rating, so it is resistant to both water and dust. So much that it even gets a 50ATM rating, which means you can submerge it as deep as 50 meters. Additionally, it gets a MIL-STD-810H certification. In short: this thing can take a beating!Build quality aside, it is a really fun watch to use. You get a large 1.47-inch Super AMOLED panel with a whopping 3,000 nits of brightness. This is comparable to the highest-end smartwatches available. And the 480 x 480 resolution is sharp and 327ppi (pixels per inch).You’ll also get a pretty nice 30-hour battery life when the always-on display feature is enabled. If you disable it, it gets extended to 40 hours.Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic + $100 Amazon Gift CardSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic + $100 Amazon Gift CardGoing squircle, still ClassicThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic continues the Classic lineage but with a squircle redesign. Available in Wi-Fi and LTE, with a 3,000 nit display and big 445mAh battery, enjoy all of the best Samsung smartwatch software experiences in style.The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is fantastic, but the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is even better. Let’s go over the benefits of upgrading.For starters, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers a more refined design that looks more like a traditional watch. The frame is made of stainless steel instead of aluminum. It also has twice as much storage, at 64GB.This one also features a rotating bezel that provides a more interesting way to interact with the smartwatch. Not everyone will deem these improvements worthy, but if you do, the $100 gift card makes this a more enticing upgrade. The retail price is $150 higher, though. Again, these offers are pre-order deals, and both smartwatches will be released tomorrow. You might want to secure your free gift card while you can!",
