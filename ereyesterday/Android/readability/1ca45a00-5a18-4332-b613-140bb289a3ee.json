You can like text messages on your favorite budget Android phone thanks to the inclusion of RCS (Rich Communication Services). The communication protocol offers a step up from regular SMS text and features new additions like typing indicators, message reactions, better encryption, and read receipts. Here's how you turn on RCS messaging and react to text messages on your Android phone. Related How to activate RCS messaging Newer Android phones often have RCS activated by default, but you may need to activate it manually on other smartphones. You'll also need to ensure your messaging app is compatible with RCS. Most Android phones use Google Messages as the default messaging app, which we recommend using because of its valuable features like end-to-end encryption, automatic birthday reminders, location sharing, and more. If you're already using RCS messages, you can skip to the How to like a text on your phone section; otherwise, you'll need to set up the feature in Google Messages or Samsung Messages. The sender and receiver must turn on RCS messaging to react to texts. How to activate RCS on Google Messages Tap your Profile icon in the upper-right corner. Tap Messages settings. Select RCS chats. Turn on the toggle beside Turn on RCS chats. How to activate RCS on Samsung Messages Tap the three-dot menu in Samsung Messages. Open Settings. Choose Chat settings. Turn on the toggle next to Chat features. Some smartphones may prompt you to turn on RCS chats from Google within your Samsung Messages. If this happens, tap Agree to turn on RCS chats. RCS may not work with Samsung Messages on some phones since it is carrier-dependent. 0:57 Related How to know if someone read your text messages on Android You should know if someone is lying through their teeth about missing your text How to like a text message on your phone Now that you have turned on RCS messaging on your Android smartphone, you can like a text message or send message reactions. Open a message conversation thread in your Messages app. To like a message, press and hold a message. A popup shows several message reactions. Select the thumbs-up reaction to like the message. Related How to change your text message reaction on Android Apart from liking a text, you can choose to send any emoji as a reaction to a message. There are hundreds of supported emojis in RCS, giving you a variety of reactions to use as a response. You can even change your message reaction. Tap the like or another message reaction you sent to change a message reaction. Choose from the suggested reaction or tap the emoji+ button to access all the emojis. Tap the emoji you want to send as a reaction. It replaces your original reaction with the new emoji. Communicate with ease, no matter the app Emoji reactions make conversations flow smoothly in RCS-enabled chats, providing typing indicators, read receipts, location sharing, high-res media support, and interactive emojis. And since Apple adopted the communication standard with iOS 18, texting between devices is simpler. You can also try one of the best messaging apps to stay connected with friends and family, but if you prefer the convenience and security of Google Messages, try these great Google Messages tips and tricks to get the most of it.",
