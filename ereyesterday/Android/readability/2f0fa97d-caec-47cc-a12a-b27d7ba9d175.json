You can run a network-attached storage (NAS) installation on just about anything these days, including single-board computers (SBC). Even an old laptop will work as a beginner NAS, allowing you to go down the custom-build route without spending too much on hardware. All you'd need are a few external drives and you're good to go. Related How to turn your old laptop into a great home server We'll show you how to take your old laptop and configure it as a small, quiet home server. 4 It has everything a NAS requires CPU, RAM, display, and more CPU? Check! RAM? Check! Internal storage drive? You bet! Your laptop is very similar to a desktop PC, aside from discrete graphics and expansion slots for bulky cards. You've got all the basics a NAS requires, including an AMD or Intel CPU, more RAM than you'll likely require, and an internal storage drive for installing the NAS OS of your choosing. While a laptop cannot be upgraded or expanded like an old PC, it'll still prove useful in running TrueNAS, Proxmox, OpenMediaVault, Ubuntu, Unraid, or some other OS. The laptop even has an always-connected display, which may sound pointless at first since a NAS is all about network connections, but it will prove invaluable should something go wrong somewhere down the line. There's also a trackpad and keyboard good to go, so you won't need to keep one spare should you need to interface with the NAS. Little touches such as this make your first NAS deployment all the more straightforward and less daunting. Related 10 useful home projects you should build with Proxmox If you've got a Proxmox server lying around, you can make your life easier with these ten projects 3 The almighty integrated UPS What power cuts? A laptop has a trick up its sleeve in the form of an internal battery pack. Should you lose power for whatever reason, your server will remain online thanks to the internal power source, which can take over should the AC line drop. It's more vital than you'd initially assume and can be overlooked by other useful features of the laptop. Should you rely on your NAS server for running home surveillance and other services, keeping it online is a priority. Not requiring an external UPS for the laptop NAS server is a great way to save yet more money. I would recommend investing in some form of power protection for your networking infrastructure, router included. There's no use for your server to remain online if you still cannot access it both internally and externally. 2 It will save you money No need to buy new hardware The cost of a turnkey NAS can range between $150 to $5,000 depending on the specifications. This is why I recommend repurposing an old PC for your first (and most powerful) NAS enclosure. A laptop is almost as good, aside from lacking any PCI slots and SATA ports for mechanical drives. External USB drives aren't terrible, but they're not great for a long-term NAS deployment. The best part about using a laptop, however, is not requiring any expensive hardware. Inside the laptop is everything you need for running a NAS OS and you can attach storage drives to the USB port array, should they be required. Some notebooks even have more than one internal storage drive connection, which can prove useful for maintaining high performance and not resorting to dangling external hard drives everywhere. 1 It's great for learning about NAS Before you make the plunge with a server Ready to broaden your horizons when it comes to knowledge? That's precisely what installing a NAS OS on an old laptop can provide. Whether you choose TrueNAS, Ubuntu, Unraid, or some other solution, you can install Docker containers, and configure your LAN with reverse proxies, a DMZ, virtual LANs, and much more. This is just the beginning of your home lab journey, which can lead to custom firewalls and other incredible DIY projects. You won't need to buy anything new by using an old laptop, aside from a drive or two. Once you've outgrown the system or require something with slightly better connectivity than a few USB ports, you can use an old desktop system or build a small compact server from scratch, opening up additional possibilities for self-hosting everything from surveillance and password managers to media streaming and websites. Not every laptop makes for a great NAS If your laptop doesn't have ethernet, you must purchase a USB to LAN adapter or attempt to use the integrated wireless card. Then there's the I/O. If you're limited on ports and dedicate one for the network interface card (NIC), you'll lose out on potential storage capacity. This shouldn't be a problem if you're trying out a few things before creating a permanent solution, but it's worth remembering if your laptop has a weak port selection. Related",

Should you lose power for whatever reason, your server will remain online thanks to the internal power source, which can take over should the AC line drop. It\u0026#39;s more vital than you\u0026#39;d initially assume and can be overlooked by other useful features of the laptop.

This is why I recommend repurposing an old PC for your first (and most powerful) NAS enclosure. A laptop is almost as good, aside from lacking any PCI slots and SATA ports for mechanical drives. External USB drives aren\u0026#39;t terrible, but they\u0026#39;re not great for a long-term NAS deployment. The best part about using a laptop, however, is not requiring any expensive hardware.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eInside the laptop is everything you need for running a NAS OS and you can attach storage drives to the USB port array, should they be required. Some notebooks even have more than one internal storage drive connection, which can prove useful for maintaining high performance and not resorting to dangling external hard drives everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"it-39-s-great-for-learning-about-nas\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            It\u0026#39;s great for learning about NAS\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"before-you-make-the-plunge-with-a-server\"\u003e\n            Before you make the plunge with a server\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eReady to broaden your horizons when it comes to knowledge? That\u0026#39;s precisely what installing a NAS OS on an old laptop can provide. Whether you choose TrueNAS, Ubuntu, Unraid, or some other solution, you can install Docker containers, and configure your LAN with reverse proxies, a DMZ, virtual LANs, and much more. This is just the beginning of your home lab journey, which can lead to custom firewalls and other incredible DIY projects.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou won\u0026#39;t need to buy anything new by using an old laptop, aside from a drive or two. Once you\u0026#39;ve outgrown the system or require something with slightly better connectivity than a few USB ports, you can use an old desktop system or build a small compact server from scratch, opening up additional possibilities for self-hosting everything from surveillance and password managers to media streaming and websites.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"not-every-laptop-makes-for-a-great-nas\"\u003e\n            Not every laptop makes for a great NAS\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your laptop doesn\u0026#39;t have ethernet, you must purchase a USB to LAN adapter or attempt to use the integrated wireless card. Then there\u0026#39;s the I/O. If you\u0026#39;re limited on ports and dedicate one for the network interface card (NIC), you\u0026#39;ll lose out on potential storage capacity. This shouldn\u0026#39;t be a problem if you\u0026#39;re trying out a few things before creating a permanent solution, but it\u0026#39;s worth remembering if your laptop has a weak port
