  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the more anticipated foldable phones coming out in the US because it's one of only a handful of new foldables set to make an appearance in the US. Despite foldables gaining more traction, they still aren't all that common thanks to their high prices. Of course, we won't have to wait long to find out what's next from Samsung, as the brand has a Galaxy Unpacked event set for July 9. Related Naturally, we're seeing a lot of information about Samsung's next phones leak ahead of the event, with information suggesting that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be the brand's thinnest foldable yet. There could always be compromises made to achieve this feat, but durability doesn't look to be one of them, as a new piece of information from a known leaker suggests that we'll be getting the same IP rating as the previous model (via 9to5Google). Thin, sleek, and resistant to dust and moisture According to leaker PandaFlash on X, the Z Fold 7 is going to have an IP48 rating, which is exactly the same as the Z Fold 6. As far as what that means, Samsung has an in-depth page sharing what an official IP48 certification delivers in terms of protection, and for the most part, it's pretty good, with the device being capable of withstanding exposure to water at a depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. It's important to note that there are a lot of specifics here, like the device can only withstand this when it is not moving, and it's also only rated for fresh water. Furthermore, it was tested in water that is 15–35 °C, and you don't want this to drop into other types of liquids if you want to ensure the device is protected. The IP48 rating also ensures some protection from physical particles as well, with coverage from objects over 1mm in size. While it looks like we won't be getting an upgrade this year, it's still better than going backwards. For the most part, Samsung could have one of its most exciting years when it comes to foldable phones. Along with the Z Fold 7, the brand will also debut the Z Flip 7 with a large outer display. The brand also has plans to unveil a new set of wearables, with the possible return of the Classic line that will feature a rotating physical bezel. From what we've seen so far, though, the design might not be well-received, as it does make some pretty drastic changes from the previous model. Of course, all of this is just rumors and leaks at this point, but luckily we won't have to wait long to find out. If you think you'll be interested in the next batch of foldable phones from Samsung, we think it's a good idea to register for the phones ahead of the official event that will take place on July 9. Not only will you get news about the release straight to your inbox, but Samsung will also treat you to a $50 credit that can be used towards accessories with your phone purchase.

event, with information suggesting that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be the brand\u0026#39;s thinnest foldable yet. There could always be compromises made to achieve this feat, but durability doesn\u0026#39;t look to be one of them, as \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1939725957088387297\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea new piece of information from a known leaker\u003c/a\u003e suggests that we\u0026#39;ll be getting the same IP rating as the previous model (via \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/06/30/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-might-be-just-as-dust-resistant-as-the-fold-6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"thin-sleek-and-resistant-to-dust-and-moisture\"\u003e\n                        Thin, sleek, and resistant to dust and moisture\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eAccording to leaker PandaFlash on X, the Z Fold 7 is going to have an IP48 rating, which is exactly the same as the Z Fold 6. As far as what that means, Samsung has an \u003ca href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1\u0026amp;publisher_slug=androidpolice\u0026amp;article_name=The+Galaxy+Z+Fold+7+may+not+get+the+major+durability+upgrade+you+hoped+for\u0026amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-ip48-rating%2F\u0026amp;u1=UUapUeUpU1028765\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fae%2Fsupport%2Fmobile-devices%2Fare-flip6-and-fold6-ip68-water-and-dust-resistant-compliant-devices%2F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein-depth page sharing what an official IP48 certification delivers\u003c/a\u003e in terms of protection, and for the most part, it\u0026#39;s pretty good, with the device being capable of withstanding exposure to water at a depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s important to note that there are a lot of specifics here, like the device can only withstand this when it is not moving, and it\u0026#39;s also only rated for fresh water. Furthermore, it was tested in water that is 15–35 °C, and you don\u0026#39;t want this to drop into other types of liquids if you want to ensure the device is protected.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe IP48 rating also ensures some protection from physical particles as well, with coverage from objects over 1mm in size. While it looks like we won\u0026#39;t be getting an upgrade this year, it\u0026#39;s still better than going backwards. For the most part, Samsung could have one of its most exciting years when it comes to foldable phones. Along with the Z Fold 7, the brand will also debut the Z Flip 7 with a large outer display.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe brand also has plans to unveil a new set of wearables, with the possible return of the Classic line that will feature a rotating physical bezel. From what we\u0026#39;ve seen so far, though, the design might not be well-received, as it does \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-watch-8-may-be-a-smartwatch-mistake/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emake some pretty drastic changes\u003c/a\u003e from the previous model. Of course, all of this is just rumors and leaks at this point, but luckily we won\u0026#39;t have to wait long to find out.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you think you\u0026#39;ll be interested in the next batch of foldable phones from Samsung, we think it\u0026#39;s a good idea to register for the phones ahead of the official event that will take place on July 9. Not only will you get news about the release straight to your inbox, but Samsung will also treat you to a $50 credit that can be used towards accessories with your phone purchase.\u003c/p\u003e
