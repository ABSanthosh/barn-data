The Galaxy S24 placed tenth, outperformed by Xiaomi's Redmi 13C. In total these 10 smartphones accounted for an impressive 19% of the total sales in the Septemnber quarter. There's a noticeable shift in consumer demand as users are now looking for higher-end phones, including in emerging markets. Due to reasonable trade-in offers and local financing schemes, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max see significant growth in those markets. Samsung's Galaxy S24 is the first Galaxy S series phone to get a spot in the top 10 in Q3 since 2018. Xiaomi's Redmi 13C rides on the success of its predecessor, the Redmi 12C, as it offers better specs than the vast majority of its competitors in the segment. Source",
