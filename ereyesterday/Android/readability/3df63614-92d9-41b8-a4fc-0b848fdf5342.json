The company recently announced the launch of its new Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station, which crams a lot of new features into a relatively compact design. READ: The Nebula X1 Smart Projector is Official, and it Packs a Ton of Impressive Hardware Right off the bat, the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station delivers up to 120 Gbps bandwidth and even supports dual 8K displays, with built-in Gallium Nitride (GaN) power supply technology as well. This allows the dock to supply up to 232 watts of total power output and 250 watts of total power input, which greatly reduces the need for external power adapters. The docking station includes both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs as standard, and Dual Thunderbolt 5 downstream ports for high-speed daisy-chaining and linking high-performance external devices, SSDs, and multi-monitor setups. The dock features a modern aluminum alloy housing and adjustable ambient lighting, and features a U-shaped air duct and a built-in fan for cooling, which works alongside software-based temperature controls. Users can further keep an eye on device settings and updates via Anker’s Dock Manager software. The Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station and Thunderbolt 5 start at $399.99.",
