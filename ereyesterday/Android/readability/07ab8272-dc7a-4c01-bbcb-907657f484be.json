The phone's screen has 1080x2340 resolution and 450 ppi pixel density. The F36 is powered by Samsung's Exynos 1380 SoC, paired with 6GB of RAM.

Google Play Console listings strongly imply that the Galaxy F36 will be identical to the Galaxy M36, which was spotted in the Geekbench database in April rocking the same Exynos chipset. These are both likely to become official very soon, perhaps even by the end of the month. Via",
