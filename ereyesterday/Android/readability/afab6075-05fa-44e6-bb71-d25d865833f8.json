A far cry from a successor to the legendary PlayStation Portable (PSP) and PS Vita, a new report from Bloomberg News suggests that Sony is considering a full-fledged handheld gaming console that can play full PS5 titles natively. PlayStation Portal According to the rumor, the device can play titles locally without needing an active internet connection, making it a true handheld console and not just a remote-play device. According to people familiar with its development, Sony’s new handheld is reportedly “years away” from launch. The source also warned that Sony may pull the plug on the project before it ever reaches the market as it is still in its early days of development. Gaming handhelds have seen a recent resurgence with the success of the Nintendo Switch line and the more recent wave of devices like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally. Microsoft is also rumored to be developing an Xbox handheld which could make for a very interesting battle for handheld supremacy in the coming years. Source (paywall)",
