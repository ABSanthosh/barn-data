  "text": "Korean tech giant LG recently announced that it was expanding global availability of the OLED evo M5, one of its newest (and more advanced) smart TVs, which packs some pretty impressive hardware in the mix. One key feature is LG’s Zero Connect Box, which acts as a wireless audio-video transmission system. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) LG says that the Zero Connect Box is able to transmit content wirelessly with low input lag (up to 4K 144Hz), with performance that’s supposedly on par with wired solutions. The evo M5 comes with support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium for visually-smoother gaming sessions, with response times lesser than 0.1ms. READ: Xbox app now available on LG TVs: Play Call of Duty without a console That being said, the M5 also works with HDMI input for gaming consoles and other media players for example, although these will instead go through the Zero Connect Box instead of a direct connection through the TV itself. Other features include Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and Filmmaker Mode with Ambient Light Compensation. LG has also included a number of AI-based features such as AI Picture Pro and AI Sound Pro for digitally-enhanced viewing and listening. The LG OLED evo M5 series will roll out globally in 97, 83, 77 and 65-inch screen sizes, with more pricing details to follow.",
