  "text": "LG recently announced that it’s been working with auto giant Kia to bring over media and content streaming via its webOS-based Automotive Content Platform (ACP) to several of Kia’s cars. This includes Kia’s new European models such as the new EV3, as well as the upcoming EV4, EV5 and New Sportage models. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: Jaguar Land Rover Announces Incoming Layoffs For those unfamiliar, ACP uses LG’s webOS entertainment system under the hood, which is the same exact platform that’s found on several of LG’s TVs and smart monitors. It essentially serves as a centralized hub that displays all your streaming and entertainment apps, although the automotive version does offer some additional features tailored for drivers and passengers, while adhering to vehicular regulations and safety standards. As for what owners can expect, supported Kia models will provide users access to several major content providers including Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, as well as Rakuten TV (later in the year), to name a few. Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG’s Vehicle Solution Company states: By bringing the webOS Automotive Content Platform to Kia’s European model lineup, we are making it easy for people to enjoy their favorite content wherever they go… LG remains committed to enhancing partnerships and expanding our content ecosystem to deliver premium in-vehicle entertainment and next-level connectivity. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart.
