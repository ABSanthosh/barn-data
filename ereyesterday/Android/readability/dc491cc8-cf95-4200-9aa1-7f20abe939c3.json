The US has a bunch of different mobile carriers that you can choose from. There's the Big Three, which are essentially household names, but then there are tens of other operators to choose from. Google Fi is one of those other options that you can choose from. Recently, a lot of subscribers to Google Fi complained that they were facing a lot of issues with their SIM cards. Phones weren't detecting the SIM cards even though they had been inserted. Google has now acknowledged the issue as a manufacturing error and is going to be making it up with a $60 bill credit. Google Fi SIM Cards Weren't Working Right Due To A Manufacturing Issue Image: Google If you're a Google Fi subscriber or you know some of them, you might know that some of them were facing an issue with their SIM cards. Despite having them inserted in the phone, they were still getting error messages telling them to insert a SIM. Even after swapping in a new SIM card, the issue would persist. Annoying. The problem was on a wide enough scale to show that the problem had something to do with Google, and not a dirty SIM card or a buggy device. Well, now the mystery has been solved as Google has sent messages out to acknowledge the issue. Apparently, the failure of these SIM cards was the result of a manufacturing error, so no, your phone doesn't need to be taken into the shop. Fortunately, Google says the issue has been resolved and recommends getting a new SIM card to mitigate the risk of a failure. To Compensate Affected Users, Google Is Giving Out A $60 Bill Credit Image: Google If you're one of the users who might have been affected by this mass SIM card failure, worry not. To make up for its transgressions, Google is going to be offering you a $60 bill credit. You'll know that you're eligible if you receive an email from the search giant mentioning a “service credit” being applied to your account. Fortunately, that's not the only way that Google is making up for it, as they are prepared to send you a brand new SIM card with expedited shipping for entirely free. As it should be, considering some users are mentioning having gone through as many as 6 SIM cards in 2024. The typical SIM card should be able to outlive phone after phone, so that's grossly inconvenient. Keep in mind that some users report that the emails they received only mention a free SIM card replacement and nothing about a bill credit. However, one user on Reddit mentioned that after reaching out to support and asking about the bill credit, he had it applied to his account. Closed mouths don't get fed, right? Google Has Also Offered A $25 Bill Credit For Those Impacted By The Current Hurricane Season Image: Google If you live in the US, you know all about the current intense hurricane season, and if you live on the East Coast, it may have potentially torn through the areas that you live in. Google offered $25 bill credits to those who were determined to live in ZIP codes affected by the disaster. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
