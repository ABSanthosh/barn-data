The Galaxy AI experience is baked in, offering tools across the camera, Circle to Search, and much more. Best of all, Samsung continues to evolve their fold folding hinge assembly, promising reduced visibility of the crease.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the biggest, beefiest, and most expensive device in the 2025 Z lineup. At $1999.99, it’s not cheap! If you were already thinking of getting it, though, the free storage upgrade and $300 Amazon gift card add up to $420 in freebies.Of course, you’re paying the big bucks, so you should expect nothing but quality. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is far from being a slouch. It comes with premium specs like a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12-16GB of RAM. The large internal screen has a gorgeous Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a 2,184 x 1,968 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. It will offer an amazing viewing experience. And if you want a smaller screen for more casual tasks, there is an external 6.5-inch display.While it is rarer in foldable phones, it still has an IP48 rating and a stunning construction. The triple-camera setup includes a primary 200MP camera. The battery is smaller at 4,400mAh, but this is a common issue with foldable phones.
