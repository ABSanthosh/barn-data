It packs some impressive specs though, along with some pretty neat improvements overall. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) Inside the MIX Flip 2 is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the go-to flagship chipset of choice for Android manufacturers this year. This is accompanied by different storage configurations including 12GB+256GB, 12GB+512GB, and 16GB+1TB. There’s also a considerably large 5165 mAh battery onboard, which is great to have especially considering that it’s a foldable. READ: Xiaomi Expands its EV Lineup with the YU7 SUV Outside, there’s a larger 3.5-inch AMOLED display which comes with an impressive 3200 nits of peak brightness, as well as a 120Hz refresh rate and enhanced protective glass. Inside, the 6.86-inch foldable screen also comes with the same brightness and refresh rate specifications, in addition to Dolby Vision support, HDR 10+ and HDR Vivid. For photography, the phone’s main camera setup consists of a dual 50MP wide and ultrawide sensor tandem, with support for 8K video recording at up to 24fps; there’s also a 32MP selfie camera with 4K video recording. The Xiaomi will be available in four colour options including White, Purple, Green, and Checkered Gold, starting at 5,999 RMB (around $840). In addition to the standard MIX Flip 2, Xiaomi also announced the MIX Flip Special Edition, which shares a colour scheme with the new Xiaomi YU7, and starts at the same price.",
