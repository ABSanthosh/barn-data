As an Android power user, I very frequently fall into the trap of not giving budget smartphones the attention they deserve, at least until a cash-strapped friend is looking for a new device to purchase. That's my bad, as budget phones are an essential part of the smartphone market. When it comes to budget devices, the Motorola Moto G is one of the best options you can go with, especially because Motorola is underrated when it comes to its software experience. The Moto G (2025) will be arriving soon, and here's our first chance to see what the device looks like. The Motorola Moto G (2025) Changes The Design Language Just A Little Image: OnLeaks x 91Mobiles The Motorola Moto G (2024) is by no means an ugly smartphone, but looking at it closely, you can tell it's a budget device. With a few tweaks, it could be made to look at least a little more attractive and it seems that's the direction that Motorola chose to take with its successor, based on the first renders that we're seeing. We get this early look at the Moto G (2025) thanks to OnLeaks and 91Mobiles. I have to say that I like the way the design changes. The frame remains flat and the back panel and screen both curve into that frame, which should make it a little more comfortable to hold. The power button and volume rocker will be on the right side and we can spot a selfie camera seated in a punch-hole. The 3.5mm jack can be seen on the bottom. Quite notably, on the backside of the phone, the camera module becomes more squarish, clearly due to the addition of a third camera to the setup. The render doesn't give us an idea of the finish Motorola will opt for on the back panel, but I'm guessing that it might be vegan leather like the device that came before it. It's Nice To See The Headphone Jack Stick Around On This Model The Motorola Moto G (2025) keeps the headphone jack, and for a budget phone, that might not seem like such a big deal since most of them have headphone jacks anyway. However, it seems that the trend might be close to changing for the worse. For one, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy A26 will be losing its headphone jack, and Samsung's position in the mobile space might serve as a signal for other budget smartphone makers to do the same. The Motorola Moto G (2025)'s Third Camera Might Go The Ultrawide Way Image: OnLeaks x 91Mobiles As you can tell from the renders, the Motorola Moto G (2025) will be adding a third camera to its arsenal. The current model has a regular wide camera as well as a macro camera, so it begs the question as to what the mystery third camera will be. There's nothing solid for me to base this on, but I reckon that it'll be an ultrawide. That camera option shows up more on lower-priced devices than telephoto modules do. And even if it does happen to be a telephoto setup, I wouldn't expect anything beyond a 2x magnification. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
