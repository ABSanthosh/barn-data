  "text": "Dbrand jumped on the Nintendo Switch 2 train early, and their signature Killswitch case is already available for the latest handheld console on the market. We got our hands on one to test it out on your next Mario Kart machine. Sturdy Design If you haven't had a chance to use a Switch 2 yet, it's a bit bigger than the Switch 1 but still has some of the same ergonomic drawbacks. That's putting it nicely, but bluntly, it still isn't great to hold, and this time, it's bigger. I'm not going to be drop-testing mine, but I don't imagine it would hold up exceptionally well. Image: Talk Android / Jared Peters The Killswitch case is built to help give your Switch 2 some extra HP and defense. The main part of the case fits around the Switch itself, with precise cutouts for the ports, buttons, and air vents. It's made of reinforced material that Dbrand says should survive hardwood and concrete impacts, and there's enough of a lip around the front to protect the screen if your Switch goes face down. Everything is fully accessible, like the kickstand and game card slot, even when cased up. Dbrand throws in a dock adapter, too, so you can still connect your Switch to a TV without taking the case off and on. It allows the Switch to sit in front of the dock, and honestly, I much prefer Dbrand's solution here over fiddling with the official dock connections. Image: Talk Android / Jared Peters Joy Con Grips The cases on the Joy Cons follow the same design philosophy, but they add one key feature: grips. The actual case around these is significantly larger than the Joy Con itself, but it feels more like holding a full controller instead of Nintendo's hybrid controllers. They're considerably bulkier, so it's not all positive, but actually feeling like you have something to grab when you're playing for extended sessions is well worth the tradeoff. Plus, you can easily attach and re-attach the Joy Cons with the Killswitch case on, so it doesn't interfere with the unique features of the Switch hardware. Image: Talk Android / Jared Peters I will note that the Killswitch cases on the Joy Cons will prevent it from working with the included controller grip that comes with the Switch 2 console. You'll either have to take the cases off or use something else. Easy Installation Installing everything is as simple as clipping the Killswitch onto your Switch or accessories. They do include some extra adhesive if you really want to make sure the Killswitch stays on (and you're not planning on frequently removing it), but I've been testing it with and without the case, and being able to adjust my setup on the fly quickly has been great. If you opt for some of the extra accessories that Dbrand offers with the Killswitch, like the travel cover or the screen protector, you'll also find them very easy to use and install. Image: Talk Android / Jared Peters The travel cover holds a few extra games and comes with a latching mechanism, allowing you to shell up your Switch if you plan on traveling with it. This option makes sense if you plan on carrying the Switch around, since it likely won't fit in normal cases with the bulkier Joy-Con grips. But the travel cover completely covers the face of the Switch and Joy Cons, offering considerable fitted protection from being jostled around or dropped. The screen protector is arguably one of the easiest and best applicators of a screen protector that I've ever used, regardless of device. It comes with the template and cleaning supplies you'll need, and if you follow the instructions, you can have your Switch perfectly covered and protected in about five minutes. Image: Talk Android / Jared Peters You can also pick up some stick covers and decals, which I'm not a fan of, but part of the fun of Dbrand is all these customization options. Can't fault them for that. Worth it? Dbrand has cast a wide net with the Killswitch here, offering an extremely versatile option for protecting your Switch 2. It's bulky, which might be a deal breaker for someone who's trying to keep the Switch 2's sleek profile, but the grips and protection are worth that tradeoff if you'd rather have something more comfortable to hold. I'm in the middle, since I don't usually take my Switch anywhere more dangerous than a tiled kitchen, but having those grips really does make a difference. It's also not cheap, with the biggest bundle that Dbrand offers running a cool $99. They do soften the blow with a lot of extra stuff, including some skins for your switch, two glass screen protectors, travel cases, dock adapters, and so on. You can tweak that bundle a bit too, saving some money if you don't need the travel cover. The flexibility here really does make the Killswitch a compelling option if you're looking for a case that can adapt to many situations. However, I think it shines best if you frequently travel with your Switch or put your console through some tough situations. If you're primarily a couch player who leaves the Switch in the dock most of the time, that's a tougher sell, especially at the price.

This option makes sense if you plan on carrying the Switch around, since it likely won\u0026#39;t fit in normal cases with the bulkier Joy-Con grips.

I\u0026#39;m in the middle, since I don\u0026#39;t usually take my Switch anywhere more dangerous than a tiled kitchen, but having those grips really does make a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also not cheap, with the biggest bundle that Dbrand offers running a cool $99. They do soften the blow with a lot of extra stuff, including some skins for your switch, two glass screen protectors, travel cases, dock adapters, and so on. You can tweak that bundle a bit too, saving some money if you don\u0026#39;t need the travel cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe flexibility here really does make the Killswitch a compelling option if you\u0026#39;re looking for a case that can adapt to many situations. However, I think it shines best if you frequently travel with your Switch or put your console through some tough situations.
