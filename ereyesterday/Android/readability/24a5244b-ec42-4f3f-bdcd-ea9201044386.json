This has today been leaked in the renders you can see below, which show a stainless steel bracelet instead of the rubber strap we're used to seeing smartwatches in. That makes for a nice change of pace, but what's still a mystery here is whether this will run Wear OS or some proprietary OS. The source of this leak \"expects\" it to be the former, but that doesn't sound like a very convincing argument at this point.

Moto 360 (2025) leaked renders The first Moto 360 came in 2014 and ran Android Wear, being the first round smartwatch using Google's platform. There were two generations before discontinuation, and then in 2019 the name Moto 360 was revived, but under a licensing agreement with a third party. This time around, the implication is that Motorola is back at the wheel, hence the belief that Wear OS is involved somehow. Then again, the recently launched Moto Watch Fit doesn't run Wear OS, hence our skepticism. Anyway, the new Moto 360 will apparently be available in five colors when it arrives later this year. Unfortunately, no other details about it are known just yet. Source",
