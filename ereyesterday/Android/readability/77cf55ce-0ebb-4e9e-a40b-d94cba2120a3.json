  "text": "You've probably seen many posts complaining that the Galaxy S25 series isn't all that different from the S24. They're not wrong. Samsung has once again played it safe and refined its phones rather than reinvent them. If you were hoping to make an upgrade, you should know the key differences before deciding for yourself whether they're worth it. We've discussed them in detail across different aspects. Specs overview: Galaxy S24 vs S25 Images:ComponentSamsung Galaxy S24Samsung Galaxy S25Display6.2″ Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, HDR10+, 2600 nits (peak), 1080 x 2340 pixels (~416 ppi)6.2″ Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, HDR10+, 2600 nits (peak), 1080 x 2340 pixels (~416 ppi)ChipsetQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (4 nm)Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite (3 nm)CPUOcta-core (1×3.3 GHz Cortex-X4 \u0026 5×3.2 GHz Cortex-A720 \u0026 2×2.3 GHz Cortex-A520)Octa-core (2×4.47 GHz Oryon V2 Phoenix L + 6×3.53 GHz Oryon V2 Phoenix M)GPUAdreno 750Adreno 830RAM \u0026 Storage8GB RAM, 128GB/256GB UFS 4.012GB RAM, 128GB/256GB/512GB UFS 4.0Main Camera50MP (wide) + 10MP (3x telephoto) + 12MP (ultrawide)50MP (wide) + 10MP (3x telephoto) + 12MP (ultrawide)Front Camera12MP12MPVideo Recording8K@24/30fps, 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60/120/240fps, HDR10+, gyro-EIS8K@24/30fps, 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60/120/240fps, HDR10+, gyro-EISBattery4000mAh, 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless4000mAh, 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wirelessOSAndroid 14, One UI 6.1 (7 years of updates)Android 15, One UI 7 (7 years of updates)BuildGlass front (Gorilla Glass Victus 2), glass back (Gorilla Glass Victus 2), Armor Aluminum 2 frame, IP68Glass front (Gorilla Glass Victus 2), glass back (Gorilla Glass Victus 2), Armor Aluminum 2 frame, IP68Color optionsOnyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Jade Green, Sandstone Orange, Sapphire BlueIcy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver ShadowOther FeaturesUltrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, Samsung DeX, Samsung Wireless DeXUltrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, Samsung DeX, Samsung Wireless DeXPrice$699.99$859.99 Design If you've had a look at the specs overview table, there's been no mistake of repetition. The S25 and S24 phones have little differences setting them apart. The newer phone is slimmer and lighter at 7.5mm and 165g respectively, while the S24 measures 7.6mm and 168g. Whether that's a good thing is up to you. Slimmer is comfortable, but if you're a klutz, it's a problem. Image Credit: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Another design change is the frame. Though it's still the same armor aluminum material, Samsung has gone flatter on the edges. On the back of both phones is a triple-lens setup, though the S25 now has thick black rings around each lens that make them more pronounced. Picture the camera design on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and its Special Edition model. On the S24, the lenses blended into the phone’s color instead. This may be one upgrade we'll be seeing more of on future Galaxy phones. Image: Samsung The back material itself is made from the same Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 3, and the phones share an IP68 rating that allows you to dunk them in water and brave a sandstorm of up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.  You can get each phone in four different color options, although there's a high chance you'll want to slap on a case rather than rocking them naturally. Both are too slippery without one. Related: What’s the Difference Between the S24 Plus and S25 Plus? Display The Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S24 displays  are nearly identical, they could pass as twins. Both feature Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panels using Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 material. They support 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.  The size, resolution, and pixel density remain unchanged at 6.2 inches, 1080 x 2340 pixels, and approximately 416 ppi. The only difference is the screen-to-body ratio, with the S25 having 91.1% and the S24 at 90.9%. Thinner bezels are undeniably attractive. But in this case, you'd barely notice the change. Performance It would've been a crime for Samsung to copy and paste the same processor as before on the S25, especially with competitors pushing for more power and efficiency. Lucky for us, Samsung knows better and has upgraded the System-on-Chip from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 to the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite on the Galaxy S25.  Image: Qualcomm Globally, the S24 may have launched with the Exynos 2400. Even with that, the 8 Elite chip still wins. Now, this is an interesting part to consider because the 8 Elite chip is the only option you get on the S25. Samsung’s decision to go all-in on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite means a consistent experience no matter where you buy your device from. The Oryon CPU is a focal point too as it brings a 45% performance boost over the Kryo CPU in the Gen 3. The main core in the 8 Elite runs at 4.32GHz, while the Gen 3 only reaches 3.4GHz. The Snapdragon 8 Elite also uses less resources and a 3 nanometer design instead of Gen 3’s 4 nanometer process. Both chips use Adreno GPUs, but the 8 Elite’s Adreno 830 version is powerful and 30% faster. Artificial Intelligence is also more alive on the Galaxy S25, considering the appeal of on-device processing. It has a two-times faster Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of running every generative task on the phone, as well as providing real-time image enhancement, voice recognition, and smart photo editing.  Image: Qualcomm Basically, both phones guarantee privacy if you don't want your data being uploaded to some remote server. So, your major consideration here is getting the one that does it in less time and smoother. Obviously, the better performer costs more, so you also have to think if it's a big enough reason to splurge extra cash. Battery Wireless charging sounds great on paper, but most people don’t care because wired charging is faster, more reliable, and more convenient. Even with the release of the Qi2 standard, wireless charging is still slower, generates more heat, and needs perfect alignment. But it's nice knowing you can go wireless if you ever decide to, considering the amount of money you pay to own a flagship. Speaking of, the S25 is Qi2 ready, specifically with Qi2.1. Meanwhile, the S24 supports standard Qi wireless charging. Qi2 is an upgraded version of Qi wireless charging that brings stronger alignment. But where we should have been applauding Samsung, we're still scolding them. They forgot to put in the magnets, meaning you won’t benefit from Qi2’s magnetic attachment. You’ll be able to use Qi2 chargers but without the secure snap-on experience that makes the technology stand out. As consumerism would have it, the best solution is to buy the official magnetic charging case from Samsung.  Aside from that, the battery capacity, wired charging speed, and reverse wireless charging remain the same as those of the Galaxy S24. Expect 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging with a 4,000mAh battery. Related: What Makes Qi, Qi2, And MagSafe Wireless Charging Different? Memory If you buy the Galaxy S24, you'll get the choice of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB RAM. The S25 excludes the 128GB option but provides 12GB of RAM across all storage. Meanwhile, the S24 starts at 8GB for most variants, except for one 256GB model with 12GB RAM. That means the S25 gives you more memory by default, which you'll need if you plan to keep the phone for a long time or handle heavy files frequently. Another difference is that the S25 uses UFS 4.0 across all models, while the S24’s 128GB version is stuck with slower UFS 3.1. If you go for the 128GB S24, you’ll get sluggish read/write speeds, impacting app loading times and overall performance. Neither phone has a microSD card slot, so your storage choice is final. You don't get to expand unless you rely on cloud services, export to a larger storage device, or switch to a new phone in the long run. Cameras Both the Galaxy S24 and S25 have cameras that mirror each other. You still get a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP selfie lens. The only justification for why Samsung gets away with keeping the same hardware is the ProVisual Engine.   Image: Samsung The brand feels you'll benefit from the ProVisual engine, improved HDR processing, and low-light noise reduction. However, many tests from experts reveal that there's not much difference. So, if the camera is your sole reason for buying the new phone, you're better off staying put with the S24. Software and features The Galaxy S25 comes with One UI 7 pre-installed, based on Android 15, while the Galaxy S24 initially came with One UI 6 based on Android 14. It's still upgradable to One UI 7. That is, when Samsung decides it's stable enough for older phones. The brand has guaranteed seven years of updates for both, but since the S25 starts with a newer OS, it will receive updates for a year longer. One UI 7 brings new Galaxy AI features, such as morning and evening briefings, audio-based Circle to Search, Now bar, and upgraded generative AI tools. While these features will likely be available on the S24 after the One UI 7 update, how they run matters more. If you recall, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which allows most AI features to run on-device, whereas the S24 may rely more on cloud processing because of its older processor. Image: Samsung Software aside, the Galaxy S25 does have the upper hand in connectivity. It supports satellite messaging, while the S24 doesn't. This means you'll be able to use T-Mobile and SpaceX’s Direct-to-Cell technology in the future. If you'd like to see it in action, the beta is now open. Yet, there's no difference between both phones’ SIM configurations. They offer similar regional variations, where the international models support two physical Nano-SIM cards and two eSIMs, but only two can be active at a time. US models support one physical Nano-SIM and two eSIMs, again with a maximum of two active at once. The Galaxy S25 also supports Wi-Fi 7, while the S24 maxes out at Wi-Fi 6E. Wi-Fi 7 brings lower latency and is more stable in congested areas. But you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7 router to take advantage of it. As for Bluetooth, the S25 users version 5.4, which newer accessories will benefit from, while the S24 uses Bluetooth 5.3, which is perfectly fine. The verdict The Galaxy S25 is a solid flagship worth buying if you're coming from a Galaxy S22 or a different brand and want to see what it offers. It has one of the best displays in the industry, a refined design, and a camera system backed by powerful software enhancements. Samsung has also done well in equipping the S25 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite worldwide. Regardless of where you are, you're getting the best possible chipset. But if you already use a Galaxy S24, the S25 doesn’t give you many reasons to upgrade. The design changes are subtle, the display is nearly identical, and the camera hardware remains the same. Performance is where you’ll see the most significant improvement, thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite, but unless you’re pushing your phone to its limits, the S24’s chipset still holds up well.",

But where we should have been applauding Samsung, we\u0026#39;re still scolding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/499504-galaxy-s25-qi-2-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eThey forgot to put in the magnets\u003c/a\u003e, meaning you won’t benefit from Qi2’s magnetic attachment. You’ll be able to use Qi2 chargers but without the secure snap-on experience that makes the technology stand out. As consumerism would have it, the best solution is to buy the official magnetic charging case from Samsung. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAside from that, the battery capacity, wired charging speed, and reverse wireless charging remain the same as those of the Galaxy S24. Expect 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging with a 4,000mAh battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelated: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/485473-wireless-charge-standard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eWhat Makes Qi, Qi2, And MagSafe Wireless Charging Different?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"memory\"\u003eMemory\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you buy the Galaxy S24, you\u0026#39;ll get the choice of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB RAM. The S25 excludes the 128GB option but provides 12GB of RAM across all storage. Meanwhile, the S24 starts at 8GB for most variants, except for one 256GB model with 12GB RAM. That means the S25 gives you more memory by default, which you\u0026#39;ll need if you plan to keep the phone for a long time or handle heavy files frequently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother difference is that the S25 uses UFS 4.0 across all models, while the S24’s 128GB version is stuck with slower UFS 3.1. If you go for the 128GB S24, you’ll get sluggish read/write speeds, impacting app loading times and overall performance. Neither phone has a microSD card slot, so your storage choice is final. You don\u0026#39;t get to expand unless you rely on cloud services, export to a larger storage device, or switch to a new phone in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cameras\"\u003eCameras\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the Galaxy S24 and S25 have cameras that mirror each other. You still get a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP selfie lens. The only justification for why Samsung gets away with keeping the same hardware is the ProVisual Engine.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/498983-galaxy-s25-plus-official/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"847\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-847x361.jpg\" alt=\"What\u0026#39;s The Difference Between The S24 And S25? 6\" srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-847x361.jpg 847w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-380x162.jpg 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-550x235.jpg 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-800x341.jpg 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-1160x495.jpg 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20width=\u0026#39;847\u0026#39;%20height=\u0026#39;361\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20847%20361\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-847x361.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-847x361.jpg 847w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-380x162.jpg 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-550x235.jpg 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-800x341.jpg 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec-1160x495.jpg 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/galaxy-s25-features-provisual-engine-spec.jpg 1440w\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage: Samsung\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe brand feels you\u0026#39;ll benefit from the ProVisual engine, improved HDR processing, and low-light noise reduction. However, many tests from experts reveal that there\u0026#39;s not much difference. So, if the camera is your sole reason for buying the new phone, you\u0026#39;re better off staying put with the S24.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"software-and-features\"\u003eSoftware and features\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Galaxy S25 comes with One UI 7 pre-installed, based on Android 15, while the Galaxy S24 initially came with One UI 6 based on Android 14. It\u0026#39;s still upgradable to One UI 7. That is, when Samsung decides it\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/500235-one-ui-7-delay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003estable enough for older phones\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe brand has guaranteed seven years of updates for both, but since the S25 starts with a newer OS, it will receive updates for a year longer. One UI 7 brings new Galaxy AI features, such as morning and evening briefings, audio-based Circle to Search, Now bar, and upgraded generative AI tools. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these features will likely be available on the S24 after the One UI 7 update, how they run matters more.

It supports satellite messaging, while the S24 doesn\u0026#39;t. This means you\u0026#39;ll be able to use T-Mobile and SpaceX’s Direct-to-Cell technology in the future.

They offer similar regional variations, where the international models support two physical Nano-SIM cards and two eSIMs, but only two can be active at a time. US models support one physical Nano-SIM and two eSIMs, again with a maximum of two active at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Galaxy S25 also supports Wi-Fi 7, while the S24 maxes out at Wi-Fi 6E. Wi-Fi 7 brings lower latency and is more stable in congested areas. But you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7 router to take advantage of it. As for Bluetooth, the S25 users version 5.4, which newer accessories will benefit from, while the S24 uses Bluetooth 5.3, which is perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-verdict\"\u003eThe verdict\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Galaxy S25 is a solid flagship worth buying if you\u0026#39;re coming from a Galaxy S22 or a different brand and want to see what it offers. It has one of the best displays in the industry, a refined design, and a camera system backed by powerful software enhancements. Samsung has also done well in equipping the S25 with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite worldwide. Regardless of where you are, you\u0026#39;re getting the best possible chipset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you already use a Galaxy S24, the S25 doesn’t give you many reasons to upgrade. The design changes are subtle, the display is nearly identical, and the camera hardware remains the same. Performance is where you’ll see the most significant improvement, thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite, but unless you’re pushing your phone to its limits, the S24’s chipset still holds up well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
