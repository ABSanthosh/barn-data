They will be available starting March 6. The company also released full specifications for these cards. The RX 9070 has 56 compute units, 2.1GHz game clock, up to 2.5GHz boost clock, and a 220W power target. The RX 9070 XT has 64 compute units, 2.4GHz game clock, up to 3.0GHz boost clock, and a 304W power limit. Both cards have 16GB memory with 256-bit memory interface and 64MB of Infinity Cache. Both also feature DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b connectivity. AMD is also sticking with older 8-pin power connectors. AMD also released some first-party benchmark results, where it compares both new cards against the RX 7900 GRE. According to these results, the 9070 is on average 21% faster at 4K across 30+ games, including ray traced as well as rasterized results, with greater gains across ray tracing titles due to the improved ray tracing performance in RDNA 4. Meanwhile, the 9070 XT is 42% faster in the same titles at the same resolution. AMD also claims that the 9070 XT is on average only 2% slower than the $750 Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti in the same titles at 4K. AMD also provided additional info on FSR 4, which is its next generation super resolution and frame generation technology. FSR 4 is optimized for the new ML hardware inside RDNA 4 graphics cards and can provide significantly better image quality compared to the older versions of FSR that are hardware agnostic. As such, it will be available exclusively on the new 9000 series cards at launch. AMD is promising availability in 30+ games at launch and 75+ before the end of 2025. The RX 9070 and the RX 9070 XT were first announced in the beginning of January during a keynote at CES 2025. At the time, AMD briefly teased their existence without committing to any further information as Nvidia was yet to launch its products. The 9070 and the 9070 XT will only be available through AMD board partners, which includes Acer, ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston. The OEMs have had stock in the hands of retailers for some time now so availability should be good on launch day.",
