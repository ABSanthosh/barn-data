Reportedly, mass production of the devices is well underway, so it comes as no surprise that product spy shots are starting to surface online.

Arguably, that's the most boring angle to view the device from since it reveals nothing regarding its alleged new edge-to-edge cover display or its reported impressive thinness, measuring just 3.9mm. We can't see the allegedly massively reduced inner display bezels either. Just a backside with a familiar vertical triple-camera arrangement. In fact, this could easily be a dummy unit and perhaps not even a complete one, but just one half. Regardless, it's a first look at the device in real life. Plus, the original Weibo source of the image seems to be gone, which suggests there is at least a bit of credibility to the leak. Speaking of dimensions, we believe the Z Fold7 will measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 3.9 mm. We also think that the phone will use the Snapdragon 8 Elite globally, which is not necessarily a given for the other cited foldables. The Z Flip7, for instance, will likely only use the Snapdragon 8 Elite in North America and China but rely on the Exynos 2500 in other markets. As for the mystical Z Flip7 FE, which we still know very little about, it is assumed to use the older Exynos 2400. Source",
