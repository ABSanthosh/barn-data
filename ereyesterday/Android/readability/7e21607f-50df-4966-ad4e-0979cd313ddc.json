Actually, the Google Pixel 9a doesn’t have a discount as such, but it does come with a free pair of Pixel Buds A-series. The 9a is similar to the Pixel 9, both use the same Tensor G4 chipset and have IP68-rated aluminum frames. However, the “a” phone has some downgrades to reach the lower price point. The Google Pixel 9 does have a discount – a £250 discount at that – so the base model is only £50 more than the 9a. And we think it’s well worth the premium. For starters, you get 4GB more RAM. Also, the glass is GG Victus 2 instead of GG3. This model has much better camera hardware with a large 1/1.31” sensor in the main (vs. 1/2.0”) and a 48MP ultra-wide (vs. 13MP). The battery is smaller but faster (4,700mAh, 27W/15W vs. 5,100mAh, 23W/7.5W). The jump up to the more capable Pixel 9 Pro is a big one in terms of cost. For the extra cash you get another 4 gigs of RAM and a sharper LTPO display (same 6.3” size as the other two). Even better, there is a 48MP 5x (113mm) periscope. Check out our Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro comparison article for a more detailed look. For a larger flagship, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL brings a 6.8” display and a 5,060mAh battery with faster charging – 37W wired and 23 wireless. We have a Pixel 9 Pro vs. 9 Pro XL head-to-head article for a closer look at how these two compare. Foldables didn’t take the world by storm as makers might have wished – the high price of book-style foldables is one of the things holding them back. Even with a hefty £350 discount the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not cheap, but it gets you on the ground floor of Google’s work on foldables. For example, Android 16 will make app resizing more flexible to smooth out the transition from cover to inner display. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
