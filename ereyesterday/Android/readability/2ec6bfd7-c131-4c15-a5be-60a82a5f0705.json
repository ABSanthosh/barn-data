We've been hearing a lot about T-Mobile's collab with SpaceX, bringing direct-to-cell satellite service to regular phones, similar to what some manufacturers are already equipping their devices with. This lets you communicate with satellites when out of service, but T-Mobile's solution means you don't need a special phone for that. The carrier's goal was to launch the service to the public in 2024, and while it seemed like they weren't going to meet that mark, they've just announced open registration for the service's beta testing. That means you have the chance to give the new service a spin. You Can Now Register To Be A Part Of The Beta Launch Of “T-Mobile Starlink” Image: T-Mobile Satellites play a minimal role in how we're able to communicate with each other using our smartphones. We mostly rely on cell towers, which covers specific areas on ground, and as long as you're within that range, you'll have no problem whatsoever making phone calls and reaching out to your loved ones. However, the problems start when there are no cell towers in your vicinity, which can put you in a bad spot in the event of an emergency. With the new T-Mobile Starlink service being deployed thanks to a partnership between the carrier and SpaceX, that problem may no longer exist in a year or two. The idea is that your phone will be able to connect with special satellites launched into orbit by SpaceX, giving you the power to stay connected to emergency services and loved ones, even if you're hiking through unoccupied land in the middle of the night. The best part is that this service isn't just a pipe dream. T-Mobile and SpaceX are ready for you to help them test this feature out, as they've opened up registration to be part of the beta program for the T-Mobile Starlink service. Things To Know About The T-Mobile Starlink Beta Program Image: Starlink If you're interested in hopping on this program, you'll be glad to know that you have a chance to join as long as you're a T-Mobile subscriber. That's the only requirement. However, if you've never found yourself in a cellular dead zone before, there might be no point registering for this (as you won't be able to test it out). The beta test will only include text messaging for now. While there's an expectation for voice and data support, I don't think you should be holding your breath for that to show up any time soon. Some Phones Can Already Communicate With Satellites Directly, But Use Special Hardware Image: Google Some smartphones, particularly many flagships released in China, come with special hardware that allows them to communicate directly with satellites, just like a sat phone. However, these features work in a region-specific way, so you won't be able to use that satellite connectivity if you take the phone to Madagascar, for instance. T-Mobile and Starlink's solution takes the burden of the special hardware off the phones, instead, putting it in the satellite. Not needing to buy a special device to get such a potentially life-saving feature makes all the difference. Apologies to the Google Pixel 9 and recent iPhones, as that niche feature is less of a showstopper now. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
