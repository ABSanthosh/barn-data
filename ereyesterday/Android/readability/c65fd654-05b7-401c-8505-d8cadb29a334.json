There is, as the saying goes, some good news and some bad news. Let's start with the good. The entry-level model with 128GB of storage will cost $499, just like the Pixel 8a did last year. And now the bad news. The 256GB version will be $599, which is $40 more expensive than what the Pixel 8a's 256GB variant launched at.

The new pricing structure is in line with what Google started doing with the launch of the Pixel 9 family in August, where the 256GB model was always $100 more than the 128GB one. That's obviously a cash grab since the storage itself doesn't come with such a cost delta, and it's something Apple's been doing for many, many years, and now Google is too. The Pixel 9a will have a 6.285-inch screen with 2,700-nit peak brightness and 1,800-nit HDR brightness, the Tensor G4 SoC at the helm, 8GB of RAM, a 48 MP main camera, a 13 MP ultrawide, and a 5,100 mAh battery, the biggest ever seen in a Pixel.
