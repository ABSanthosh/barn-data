After meeting sales expectations throughout the course of 2024, new numbers from the company paint a strong start to 2025, at least in terms of sales numbers. After delivering 150,000 cars to customers (with 25,000 in December of 2024), Xiaomi is now aiming to sell 300,000 cars for this year. For those unfamiliar, the SU7 made its debut back in March of last year, with Xiaomi increasing its production lines in the months that followed. The company is also preparing a larger SUV model (called the YU7) which is set to launch in the middle of 2025. The achievement comes thanks to a very strong December, where Xiaomi delivered over 25,000 SU7s, setting the stage for an ambitious 2025 target of 300,000 vehicle deliveries. The SU7 was only launched in March 2024, but it’s enjoying strong demand by consumers and Xiaomi is very quick to ramp up production. Recent sales figures in China showed that the SU7 was able to outsell the Tesla Model 3 during December 2024, making it the fourth time that Xiaomi’s debut EV dominated its veteran rival in the local scene. Since its launch, the SU7 has seen strong demand and sales, and given that it’s a homegrown brand it’s not too surprising to see support for the Xiaomi-branded EV. Source: Arena EV",
