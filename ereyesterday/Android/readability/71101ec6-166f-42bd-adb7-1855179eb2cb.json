  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Samsung Auto is an in-car OS that is exclusive to China, using Baidu and ICCOA standards for wired and wireless connectivity. The interface resembles Android Auto, supports navigation, music, widgets, and Bixby as voice assistant. It comes with a few neat features, including \"Quick navigation,\" instant message navigation, and address recognition. One UI 7 is rolling out, albeit slowly. Samsung 's updated mobile operating system comes with plenty of bells and whistles, but one feature is catching attention precisely because most users will never see it. It's called Samsung Auto, and it is exclusive to China. Related The new feature was spotted by a Reddit user and confirmed through sideloading on a US Galaxy S25 Ultra (via 9to5Google). Samsung Auto is a surprisingly well-developed in-car interface that connects to vehicles using Baidu CareLife+ or ICCOA Car Link. Both of these standards support wired and wireless connections, but they are only available on vehicles sold in China. The rest of the world can only watch from the window. Samsung Auto comes with some great features Android Auto should steal Source: 9to5Google Samsung Auto comes with a built-in list of compatible vehicles, although every model on the list is specific to the Chinese market. This includes localized versions of major brands like Audi and BMW. The interface itself appears to resemble Android Auto and Apple Carplay. There's a dashboard that shows navigation, music playback, and some widgets. Users can pin up to four apps in the left-hand sidebar for convenient access while driving. Samsung Auto uses Bixby as its default voice assistant. One of its standout features is a \"Quick navigation\" system. The app supports continuity between phone and car, so you can start directions on your phone and finish them in your car, or vice versa. If someone sends a message with an address while you're driving, you'll receive a notification and can jump straight into navigation. There's also address recognition which allows you to tap a floating shortcut that sends directions directly to the car's display, although this only works with supported Chinese apps. Don't hold your breath for this Overall, it looks like a well-thought-out car system. Unfortunately, Samsung Auto is unlikely to expand outside of China. The platform relies on Baidu and ICCOA standards, and without major firmware changes to vehicles here, global expansion is impossible. But Samsung Auto shows what a smart in-car OS could look like, and if we ask really nicely, and with a bit of luck, perhaps Google will bring some of those features to Android Auto .",

Samsung Auto is a surprisingly well-developed in-car interface that connects to vehicles using Baidu CareLife+ or ICCOA Car Link. Both of these standards support wired and wireless connections, but they are only available on vehicles sold in China. The rest of the world can only watch from the window.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"samsung-auto-comes-with-some-great-features-android-auto-should-steal\"\u003e\n                        Samsung Auto comes with some great features Android Auto should steal\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/04/15/samsung-auto-galaxy-phones-screenshots/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSamsung Auto comes with a built-in list of compatible vehicles, although every model on the list is specific to the Chinese market. This includes localized versions of major brands like Audi and BMW.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe interface itself appears to resemble Android Auto and Apple Carplay. There\u0026#39;s a dashboard that shows navigation, music playback, and some widgets. Users can pin up to four apps in the left-hand sidebar for convenient access while driving. Samsung Auto uses Bixby as its default voice assistant. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOne of its standout features is a \u0026#34;\u003cstrong\u003eQuick navigation\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#34; system. The app supports continuity between phone and car, so you can start directions on your phone and finish them in your car, or vice versa. If someone sends a message with an address while you\u0026#39;re driving, you\u0026#39;ll receive a notification and can jump straight into navigation. There\u0026#39;s also \u003cstrong\u003eaddress recognition\u003c/strong\u003e which allows you to tap a floating shortcut that sends directions directly to the car\u0026#39;s display, although this only works with supported Chinese apps.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"don-39-t-hold-your-breath-for-this\"\u003e\n            Don\u0026#39;t hold your breath for this\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, it looks like a well-thought-out car system. Unfortunately, Samsung Auto is unlikely to expand outside of China. The platform relies on Baidu and ICCOA standards, and without major firmware changes to vehicles here, global expansion is impossible. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nBut Samsung Auto shows what a smart in-car OS could look like, and if we ask really nicely, and with a bit of luck, perhaps Google will bring some of those features to     \n\n        \n\u003cspan data-id=\"1001885\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-auto-apps/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndroid Auto\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n.     \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
