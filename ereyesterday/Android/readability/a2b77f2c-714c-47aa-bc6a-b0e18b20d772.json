Scheduled for May 13 KST (8PM EST and 5PM PT), the event will be accessible through Samsung’s official YouTube channel. READ: Sony’s New Xperia Phones are Finally Arriving this Month As far as specifications go, Samsung obviously hasn’t revealed everything about the device, although it’s expected that the phone will come with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, as well as a dual-camera design, a slight difference from the triple-sensor setups on other Galaxy S25-series phones. The S25 Edge will also come with a slimmer design, and most possibly a smaller battery to go along with it. With that being said though, Samsung isn’t the only smartphone maker that’s set to launch its new phone on the 13th, with Sony likewise teasing its upcoming Xperia devices for the same date. This will include the Xperia 1 VII, which is also expected to feature the 8 Elite inside.",
