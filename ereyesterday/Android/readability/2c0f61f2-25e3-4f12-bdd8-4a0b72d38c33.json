If you've been into smartphones for at least 10 years now, then you remember the entire mess that happened with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The device got into the hands of consumers on a massive scale, before it became painfully evident that it wasn't safe there. The phones began to explode and catch on fire at an alarming rate. Of course, there was a mass recall, and now, several years later, it is (relatively) ancient history. It seems that Motorola may have potentially averted a similar situation. This is purely a rumor with very little backing, but it seems that delays in Razr 2025 shipping could be due to fire incidents with the phone at Verizon outlets. Update: Verizon has responded to our request for a comment on this rumor, which would appear to be just that, a rumor, going by the following: “We adjusted the availability timeline of the new Motorola Razr (2025) to ensure the best possible launch experience for our customers. It will be available at Verizon, Straight Talk, Total Wireless and Visible on May 22.” Verizon It all seems perfectly reasonable, going by the carrier's statement above. Let us know in the comments below about your experience ordering the new Razr 2025 from Verizon (or anywhere else for that matter). Thanks to Verizon for their speedy reply! Motorola Razr 2025 Shipping Is On Hold and There's No Official Reason Why Image: Motorola We reported on the Motorola Razr 2025 when it launched a few weeks ago, and I think it is an absolutely spectacular device, especially for those into clamshell foldables. The Razr Ultra 2025 is even better, but it costs a lot of money, so it isn't much of a surprise that many will go for the more laid-back model from the lineup. While many have placed their orders, there's been a bit of a setback. Users reported on orders being canceled or intercepted, which is odd for a device that was already in transit to a consumer. Verizon, through its official X account, mentioned in a reply to someone that the device has been placed on hold, despite being intended for launch on May 15th, 2025. Image: Verizon on X There's no official reason given as to why orders are being stopped to such an extent, but needless to say, it is a very serious issue if a stop sale has been put out on the phone, at least for Verizon. Hopefully, in due time, the carrier will come out to explain what's happening, instead of leaving people to formulate theories. Speaking of theories… The Razr 2025 Might Be Setting on Fire, and That Could Be a Serious Problem There's one major rumor as to why all this drama is going on around the new Motorola Razr, and to be honest, it makes plenty of sense. It seems it might be a repeat of the Note 7 incident, though caught much earlier. The Razr 2025 might be setting on fire, and that's a big problem. Image: Motorola First of all, it explains the urgency of the stop sale. No company wants to have exploding phones end up in the hands of customers. Under the original Reddit post where this rumor was started, another user mentions that their store was advised to be quarantined, and being a fire hazard is the only reason why that makes any sense. The OP even reports that there were fires in three Verizon stores. However, Verizon seems to be the only carrier affected by this, which would make this pretty odd. We're awaiting some kind of official information from the carrier, but for now, this might explain why your new foldable hasn't gotten to you.
