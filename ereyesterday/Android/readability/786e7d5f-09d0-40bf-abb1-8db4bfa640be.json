  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account It’s been over eight years since Pebble shut down, but a loyal crew of die-hard fans never really let go. They’ve kept their old-school smartwatches ticking, patiently waiting for something new that captures that same Pebble feel. Well, the wait is finally paying off. Pebble’s former CEO, Eric Migicovsky, launched a new project called Core Devices earlier this year, bringing back Pebble's signature charm, but this time with way better battery life. In a recent update, Migicovsky shared some fresh milestones as these new smartwatches gear up for their debut later this year. Related According to Migicovsky's latest blog post, Core 2 Duo watches start shipping in July for customers who have pre-ordered, with a wider rollout set for August (via 9to5Google). Around 200 lucky users will get early hands-on time through a beta program. If you pre-ordered, keep an eye on your inbox later this month, as Core Devices will be reaching out for your shipping details. Retro looks, modern upgrades The upcoming Core 2 Duo smartwatch, priced at $149, sticks to its roots with the classic black-and-white e-paper look (technically a transflective LCD) and the same body as the beloved Pebble 2. But don’t let the retro shell fool you. Migicovsky says it’s a major leap over the Pebble 2, with the biggest win being battery life. We’re talking 30 days on a single charge, up from just 7. For anyone tired of babying their color-screen smartwatch every night, that’s a game-changer. Meanwhile, the $225 Core 2 Time takes everything the Core 2 Duo offers and dials it up a notch. It adds a responsive touchscreen and sleep and step tracking. The smartwatch is scheduled for release later this year. Compared to the Duo, it’s got a slightly bigger screen, a tougher metal build, and a built-in heart rate monitor. Core Devices says it's on track to whip up working prototypes within the next month. Alongside the new hardware, Core Devices is also launching a brand-new Pebble app built for both iOS and Android. While it’s designed with the Core 2 lineup in mind, the good news is it’ll also support older Pebble watches like the Pebble 2 and Pebble Time series. Migicovsky confirmed that legacy users can join the beta to test things out, but heads up, spots are limited and sign-ups are already live. Related",

But don’t let the retro shell fool you. Migicovsky says it’s a major leap over the Pebble 2, with the biggest win being battery life. We’re talking 30 days on a single charge, up from just 7. For anyone tired of babying their color-screen smartwatch every night, that’s a game-changer.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the $225 Core 2 Time takes everything the Core 2 Duo offers and dials it up a notch. It adds a responsive touchscreen and sleep and step tracking. The smartwatch is scheduled for release later this year. Compared to the Duo, it’s got a slightly bigger screen, a tougher metal build, and a built-in heart rate monitor. Core Devices says it\u0026#39;s on track to whip up working prototypes within the next month.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAlongside the new hardware, Core Devices is also launching a brand-new Pebble app built for both iOS and Android. While it’s designed with the Core 2 lineup in mind, the good news is it’ll also support older Pebble watches like the Pebble 2 and Pebble Time series. Migicovsky confirmed that legacy users can join the beta to test things out, but heads up, spots are limited and sign-ups are already live.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
