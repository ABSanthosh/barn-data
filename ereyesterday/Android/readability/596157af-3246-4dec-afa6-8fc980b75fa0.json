There are also a few offers that aren’t quite as good, but they are worth checking out in case you missed the Prime deals a couple of weeks ago. We start with the Samsung Galaxy S24. Last week, the base 8/128GB variant was $720. Now you can get the model with more storage, 8/256GB, for just $705 (was $780 last week). Keep in mind that this isn’t just doubling the storage, the 128GB variant uses older UFS 3.1 chips, while the 256GB one is built with UFS 4.0 chips. This means faster read and write speeds. Next up, Motorola Edge (2024). During Prime Day, this phone cost $450 – now it’s $350 for the same 8/256GB configuration. It’s no match for the Galaxy, but for half the price you get a curved 6.6” 144Hz OLED display with 1080p+ resolution, a 50MP (1/1.5”, OIS) main camera and 13MP ultra wide, 32MP selfie and a 5,000mAh battery with fast 68W wired and 15W wireless charging. The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 is slow, but it’s okay in this price range. The Motorola razr (2024) was $600 during Prime Day – as we noted back then, that wasn’t a great deal. But this one is, the 8/256GB model is down to $450. With a large 3.6” cover display, high-quality 6.9” 120Hz LTPO inner display (1080p+), a 50+13MP camera and a 4,200mAh battery with 30W/15W charging, this is a solid pick for a mid-range flip foldable. The Dimensity 7300X is underpowered, but it can handle casual browsing and app usage just fine. A higher end alternative is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 – a 12/512GB unit will set you back $940. That’s not as good as the $874 price tag from Prime Day a couple of weeks ago, but it’s pretty close. You get a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip with this one but no DeX. The battery is 4,000mAh and supports 25W/15W charging. Motorola’s actual competitor to the Z Flip is the Moto razr+ (2024). It was $760 during Prime Day, now it’s $800 for a 12/256GB unit. The Snapdragon 8s Gen is a (small) step down from the 8 Gen 3, but you get faster wired charging for the 4,000mAh battery at 45W (wireless is still 15W) and a 50MP 2x camera to go with the 50MP main (the Z Flip has a 12MP ultra wide instead of a tele module, the vanilla razr has a 13MP ultra wide). The OnePlus 12R was one of the top Prime Day deals – $380 for 8/128GB and $475 for 16/256GB. Now, they are $430 and $530, respectively. Not as good, but still a solid offer for a 6.78” LTPO OLED display (1264p+), Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and a 5,500mAh battery with 90W wired charging. We skipped this one previously, but the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) is a capable 5G mid-ranger, especially now that it costs just $250. It has a 6.7” 1080p+ 120Hz OLED display, which supports a stylus, a 5,000mAh battery with 30W/15W charging, 50+13MP camera, stereo speakers, 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot and a faux leather back. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 is a fine 4nm chip for this price range, if not amazing. Amazon unveiled its first-ever color Kindle e-reader. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition has a 7” e-paper display, which achieves 300ppi pixel density when showing black and white content and 150ppi for color content. This is great for reading comic books (Comixology is natively supported) or highlighting text with different colors. It’s not cheap at $280, though. If you plan on sticking with good old black on white print, check out the new Kindle Paperwhite. It is available in regular (16GB) and Signature edition (32GB). The Signature edition adds wireless charging and a light sensor that automatically adjusts the warm front light. Note that the Colorsoft is available only as Signature edition and has the same features. The Paperwhite (including the vanilla version) and Colorsoft are waterproof (IPX8) and have a front light with adjustable color temperature. The regular Paperwhite is much cheaper than the Colorsoft, but you can go even cheaper with the new vanilla Kindle. Its screen is smaller (6” vs. 7”), but is just as sharp – both panels have 300ppi pixel density and this generation has improved contrast. The reason to get the Paperwhite is the larger screen and the IPX8 rating, but whether those are worth the extra $50 is up to you. Amazon also upgraded the Kindle Scribe. This one is focused on reading documents and note-taking with its large 10.2” display (300ppi, B\u0026W). It adds new AI features that can clean up your handwriting, convert your notes to digital text and summarize that into bullet points. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
