Of course, I wasn't spending my own funds since I had $1,800 worth of prize money at my disposal, but I still regret many of the hardware purchases I made for this build. One of these purchases was the G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4-3600 C16 32GB RGB kit, which I picked for slightly lower latency and, of course, the RGB design. While it didn't exactly cost double that of other 3,600MT/s non-RGB kits at the time, I could have used the extra money on a better CPU cooler, power supply, or NVMe SSD. Each of these components would have served me better than a more expensive, better-looking memory kit. Related Switching from an air cooler to an AIO wasn't the upgrade I expected The upgrade from an air cooler to an AIO liquid cooler was a hollow one I paid for the brand and the looks Paid for it dearly I had decided beforehand that I would choose white-themed components as much as possible. Choosing the graphics card wasn't in my hands since Nvidia was sponsoring the RTX 3080 FE, but I could freely choose the rest of the components as long as they fit the overall $1,800 budget. While browsing memory sticks, I found many regular-looking, non-RGB modules with black heatsinks that were priced around 30% less than the model I was eyeing. These cheaper 32GB kits were also rated at 3,600MT/s, and even the brands were reliable — Adata, Kingston, Patriot, and TeamGroup. Still, I added the G.Skill RGB kit to the cart, thinking I was buying a \"better\" brand. The white RGB design might have been better-looking compared to the other kits I ignored, but G.Skill didn't exactly belong to the cream of the crop. If anything, I should have chosen Corsair if I wanted a top brand. Considering I would be spending my own money on my next build, I would think twice before splurging on expensive white RAM that wouldn't do anything for gaming performance. I might even go for a non-RGB black kit and a white case for a dual-tone theme. Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6000 kit (2x16GB) The Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6000 32GB kit falls right in the sweet spot of DDR5 memory, promising 6,000MT/s frequency and CL30 latency, perfect for any gaming PC. Related 8 overhyped PC upgrades that aren’t worth the money PC upgrades don't come cheap, but some of them are simply not worth the premium Low latency matters, but only to a point You run into diminishing returns The RAM I bought was a CL16 kit, slightly more expensive than a similar CL18 model. While I was fixated on buying a DDR4-3600 CL16 kit without any rationale behind it, you don't need to commit the same mistake. RAM latency is important, but you don't need to buy the fastest kit on the market to ensure you get the most performance out of your PC. In the age of DDR5 RAM, memory is already quite a bit faster than it used to be in the DDR4 days, and you don't need anything more than a DDR5-6000 CL30 kit. Going beyond that won't improve your gaming performance in any meaningful way. Besides, higher resolutions are less reliant on faster memory anyway, so unless you're gaming at 1080p, you shouldn't chase the highest numbers. DDR5 CL26 kits have arrived on the market, but for the premium they command, the additional performance benefits are negligible, let alone worth the investment. It might feel good to buy a fancy memory kit with the lowest latency, but you'll forget about it in a few days, and the additional money you spent would be a waste. Lexar ARES RGB 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000 CL30 $115 $130 Save $15 The Lexar Ares RGB DDR5 6000MT/s CL30 memory kit is a fantastic performer due to its sweet spot of frequency and latency, plus it comes in a standout RGB design. Related RAM frequency vs. latency: What matters more? What decides how fast your RAM is? Frequency or latency? Blazing-fast RAM has its own problems You might not be able to run it at the rated speed The 7,200MT/s, 8,000MT/s, and even faster memory kits that look great on paper probably won't run at the advertised speeds on your system anyway. Every CPU and motherboard combo supports RAM speeds up to a point, beyond which you're unable to even boot to the desktop. This limit is typically 6,000MT/s for Ryzen systems, and slightly higher for most Intel PCs. Investing more money in an expensive kit only to fail to run it at the rated speed is pointless. This problem is especially true for enthusiasts trying to populate all four RAM slots on the motherboard. The more modules you install, the greater the signal load on the CPU's memory controller, and the slower the stable frequency at which you can run the memory. While I didn't face any stability issues on my dual-stick DDR4-3600 configuration, it's a genuine risk on many faster DDR5 kits. Hence, it's best to stick to the tried-and-tested DDR5-6000 kits, unless you want to experiment and deal with possible returns. Silicon Power Zenith DDR5-6000 32GB (2x16GB) CL30 $90 $100 Save $10 The Silicon Power Zenith DDR5 32GB kit offers the best balance between frequency and latency, thanks to its 6000MT/s speed and CL30 latency. Plus, the white colorway gives some flair to your DDR5 build. Related I'll never fall for expensive RAM again I knew buying expensive RAM just for the heck of it was wrong when I was doing it, but I couldn't resist the urge. Hopefully, you can be better than me when you're building your next PC or upgrading from DDR4 to DDR5 RAM. You don't need memory kits with the fastest transfer speeds, lowest latencies, or even the best designs to build a high-end and good-looking gaming PC. There's always an achievable balance between price, performance, and esthetics when buying PC parts.",

Besides, higher resolutions are less reliant on faster memory anyway, so unless you\u0026#39;re gaming at 1080p, you shouldn\u0026#39;t chase the highest numbers. DDR5 CL26 kits have arrived on the market, but for the premium they command, the additional performance benefits are negligible, let alone worth the investment. It might feel good to buy a fancy memory kit with the lowest latency, but you\u0026#39;ll forget about it in a few days, and the additional money you spent would be a waste. \u003c/p\u003e

Every \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-match-cpu-and-motherboard/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCPU and motherboard combo\u003c/a\u003e supports RAM speeds up to a point, beyond which you\u0026#39;re unable to even boot to the desktop. This limit is typically 6,000MT/s for Ryzen systems, and slightly higher for most Intel PCs. Investing more money in an expensive kit only to fail to run it at the rated speed is pointless.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis problem is especially true for enthusiasts trying to populate all four RAM slots on the motherboard. The more modules you install, the greater the signal load on the CPU\u0026#39;s memory controller, and the slower the stable frequency at which you can run the memory. While I didn\u0026#39;t face any stability issues on my dual-stick DDR4-3600 configuration, it\u0026#39;s a genuine risk on many faster DDR5 kits. Hence, it\u0026#39;s best to stick to the tried-and-tested DDR5-6000 kits, unless you want to experiment and deal with possible returns. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n
