Following the popularization of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a lot of major tech players decided that it was time for them to get their own competitors on deck. Among those was Google, releasing Gemini (initially known as Bard). Google has clearly been putting a lot of muscle into making Gemini a solid contender, and they've done a good job of that. Gemini is constantly bringing in new features, and now, thanks to an APK teardown, we've got insight into another feature that will be finding its way to your Android smartphone. Google Gemini will soon be able to analyze entire folders of code on your behalf. Software devs are definitely going to love this one. Google Gemini's Android App Will Soon Be Able To Analyze Code On A Massive Scale Image: Oppo A lot of the AI chatbots that are currently available are able to write code if you ask them to, and they can even check out code you're struggling with to point out where your bugs are. I wouldn't advise deploying what they advise into your company's multi-million-dollar platform without giving it at least a quick lookover, but they do generally do very well in that regard. However, as helpful as it might be to analyze one piece of your project's code puzzle, sometimes the real problem is in how code between different files interacts with each other. That's where most typical solutions can't really help you out (OpenAI's ChatGPT and Claude do, however). Well, at least until now, with what Google is planning for Gemini. Thanks to Android Authority doing an APK teardown on the latest beta of the Google app, we can now surmise that Gemini is going to be adding the power to analyze an entire folder of code, as opposed to just a single file. This means that it'll be able to better analyze your codebase as a whole, rather than needing to assess each file individually, which should make it a lot better at picking bugs and suggesting optimizations. This Feature Is Already Rolling Out To Some Users On The Web Version Of Google Gemini Image: TestingCatalog And to show that this isn't just a reach being made of a single string in the beta for the Google app on Android, TestingCatalog has already spotted this feature rolling out on the web version of Google Gemini. That just seems to serve as a major omen of its eventual arrival on Android. However, in both cases, it will likely be limited to Gemini Advanced. Thanks to TestingCatalog spotting the feature, we have more info on its limitations and what it'll be able to do. You'll be able to upload a single folder with up to 1,000 files in it, though the entire folder has to be less than 100MB in size. Image: TestingCatalog Unsurprisingly, Google Gemini performs a lot better when you give it smaller codebases to deal with. Once you've uploaded the file, you then have the opportunity to ask Gemini whichever questions you desire, regarding the code that you've uploaded. Whether this is giving AI what it needs to take more jobs, as common fears go, is an entirely different discussion.
