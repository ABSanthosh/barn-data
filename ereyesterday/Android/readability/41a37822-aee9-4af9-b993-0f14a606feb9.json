Windows 11 swaps the blue screen of death for a simpler black version to reduce stress and provide clearer error messages. Microsoft backs its reliability claim with telemetry data from July 2025, showing improvements over Windows 10. How do you feel about Windows 11? There's a very good chance that people will respond to that question in a variety of ways. Some people have come to love the new operating system, while others still look back at past operating systems and wish Windows 11 could draw inspiration from them. Well, however you feel about Windows 11, Microsoft seems to be pretty chuffed with it. In fact, they're so pleased that they've stated that Windows 1124H2 is the most reliable Windows yet. And as it turns out, the company isn't just making that claim on a vibe. Related Microsoft crowns Windows 11 24H2 as \"The most reliable Windows yet\" In a post on the Windows IT Pro Blog, the company discusses its recent reliability advancements with Windows 11. For instance, it goes into detail as to why it opted to swap out the blue screen of death with a simpler, black version instead. The company states that the sharp blue color was \"visually disruptive, often unhelpful, and frustrating to stall on,\" with people usually staring at the BSOD for around 40 seconds. Changing the display to a cleaner black one will hopefully make things less stressful: That’s why we’ve redesigned the experience from the ground up. The new UI is simpler, and more aligned with Windows 11’s design language. It removes the frowny face and QR code, and instead presents a short, readable message with the stop code and faulty driver information. We’ve also added a hex version of the stop code to make it easier to search for help – a common user request. However, there's one really interesting nugget in this article. Under the subheader \"The most reliable Windows yet,\" Microsoft makes this claim: We’re also proud to share that Windows 11 24H2 is our most reliable version of Windows yet. Compared to Windows 10 22H2, failure rates for unexpected restarts have dropped by 24%. These improvements reflect deep collaboration across engineering, design, and user research teams and a commitment to making Windows more resilient for everyone. In the article, Microsoft adds a footnote to the 24% claim, stating that the company obtained this information from \"Reliability telemetry collected by Microsoft, July 2025.\" As such, this isn't just a claim Microsoft threw out on a whim; it seems the company has the numbers to prove that Windows 11 24H2 is more reliable than Windows 10, at least. If you're enjoying Windows 11, but you have a strange feeling that something is missing, there's a good chance that there's a feature you could be using that hasn't been enabled yet. Check out these Windows features you can enable that aren't turned on by default, and see what kind of features Windows has hidden from you.",

For instance, it goes into detail as to why it opted to swap out the blue screen of death with a simpler, black version instead. The company states that the sharp blue color was \u0026#34;visually disruptive, often unhelpful, and frustrating to stall on,\u0026#34; with people usually staring at the BSOD for around 40 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eChanging the display to a cleaner black one will hopefully make things less stressful:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’ve redesigned the experience from the ground up. The new UI is simpler, and more aligned with Windows 11’s design language. It removes the frowny face and QR code, and instead presents a short, readable message with the stop code and faulty driver information. We’ve also added a hex version of the stop code to make it easier to search for help – a common user request.\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, there\u0026#39;s one really interesting nugget in this article.

Compared to Windows 10 22H2, failure rates for unexpected restarts have dropped by \u003cstrong\u003e24%\u003c/strong\u003e. These improvements reflect deep collaboration across engineering, design, and user research teams and a commitment to making Windows more resilient for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the article, Microsoft adds a footnote to the 24% claim, stating that the company obtained this information from \u0026#34;Reliability telemetry collected by Microsoft, July 2025.\u0026#34; As such, this isn\u0026#39;t just a claim Microsoft threw out on a whim; it seems the company has the numbers to prove that Windows 11 24H2 is more reliable than Windows 10, at least.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re enjoying Windows 11, but you have a strange feeling that something is missing, there\u0026#39;s a good chance that there\u0026#39;s a feature you could be using that hasn\u0026#39;t been enabled yet.
