Part of what makes Samsung like Apple is their exclusive apps, and Good Lock is one of them. See it as a popular toolkit that lets you customize your Galaxy phone or tablet in ways you can’t with regular settings. You can change themes, improve multitasking, and personalize the lock screen. Until now, Good Lock was only available in a few countries through the Galaxy Store, which annoyed many users. But with the upcoming One UI 7 update based on Android 15, Samsung is making it available worldwide and adding it to the Google Play Store. Good Lock is going global Samsung employees have confirmed to their community that Good Lock will soon be available globally with One UI 7. It will also be accessible through the Google Play Store in addition to the Galaxy Store. The app will initially include 15 Good Lock modules, such as LockStar, Home Up, and MultiStar, with some modules undergoing additional testing.  Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Starting with One UI 7.0 Good Lock, Good Lock can be downloaded from the Play Store as well as the Galaxy Store, and Good Lock can be used in all countries. This is something that many customers have been asking for, and we expect that this will provide more convenient accessibility to more Galaxy users. Samsung The main app’s design has also been updated to make it easier for new users. You'll now see a new search and filter tool to help you quickly find features and guides, along with a “My Page” tab for resetting modifications, adding widgets, and managing features more conveniently.  Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Samsung also didn't mention a specific timeline for Good Lock's public release. But they started rolling out One UI 7 in December 2024, and are still testing the update through the beta program for the Galaxy S24 series. The final stable version may not be come out until the Galaxy S25 is released this year in 2025. Related: Here’s everything coming your way on One UI 7 Beyond basic Galaxy customizations With the Samsung Good Lock app, you can extensively customize your Galaxy phone's interface and functionality using a variety of modules. Here are some of the key features: QuickStar: Customizes the Quick Panel, allowing you to adjust color themes, toggle visibility of icons, and modify the clock display. ClockFace: Lets you design and personalize the clock on your lock screen and Always On Display with different fonts, color schemes, and layouts. Pentastic: Modifies S Pen interactions, including the menu style, pointer icon, and double-tap shortcuts for enhanced productivity. Theme Park: Allows you to create custom themes, adjusting wallpapers, color schemes, icons, and more. Home Up: Customizes home screen layouts, grid spacing, and the app drawer, along with task switching options. MultiStar: Enhances multitasking features, especially on foldable devices through optimizing app display across different screens and orientations. Nice Catch: Logs phone events, including missed notifications, setting changes, and vibration alerts, so you can track and troubleshoot any issues. Image: S M A Sithick / X In the meantime, fans in unsupported regions are still resorting to alternatives like the unofficial Fine Lock launcher. It was designed for Samsung's Good Lock modules, and allows you to access and manage its APKs (apps) without depending on Samsung’s Galaxy Store. Basically, you'll download each Good Lock APK file manually and install them on your device. Then you'll launch them with Fine Lock.
