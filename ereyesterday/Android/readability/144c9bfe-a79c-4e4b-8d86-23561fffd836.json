It will involve \"no contracts\" and \"no credit check\". Trump Mobile is also hyping up an exclusive smartphone, the T1 Phone, which is going to be gold-colored and will set you back $499. This is coming in August or September (the website mentions both) and is allegedly \"proudly designed and built in the United States\". Nothing's co-founder confirmed that the upcoming Phone (3) will have 5 years of major OS updates and 7 years of security patches. Vivo's X200 FE will launch on June 23. It has a 6.31-inch ZEISS Master Colour Display. The phone will be available in four colors - black, blue, pink, and yellow. It's built around a punch-hole display and features a triple camera setup on the rear, co-developed with ZEISS. Infinix launched its Smart 10 series with three devices – Smart 10, Smart 10 Plus, and Smart 10 HD. The trio brings entry-level specs, DTS-tuned loudspeakers and several flashy color options. All three phones sport 6.67-inch IPS LCDs with HD+ resolution and 700 nits peak local brightness. Smart 10 HD features a 90Hz refresh rate while the other two get 120Hz panels. The Smart 10 trio also offers dual speakers with DTS-tuning and a 300% volume mode. The series launched in Malaysia. Google's Pixel 10 series will add close-up photo capabilities to the Pixel telephoto camera, finally. Expect the series' announcement on August 20 and availability on the 28. We were able to do an exclusive Poco F7 unboxing before the phone's June 24 announcement. Poco confirmed that the phone will use a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 SoC.",
