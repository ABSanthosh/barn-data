This has now been portrayed in the first leaked renders. The Galaxy S25 Slim allegedly measures 159 x 76 x 6.4 mm. That makes it just about the size of the Galaxy S24+ (and, we assume, the S25+ as well), except, obviously, it's much thinner. For what it's worth the Galaxy S24+ is 7.7 mm thick. The Galaxy S25 Slim is apparently 8.3 mm thick at the camera bump, which is just 0.1 mm more than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to be at...",

This has now been portrayed in the first leaked renders. The Galaxy S25 Slim allegedly measures 159 x 76 x 6.4 mm. That makes it just about the size of the Galaxy S24+ (and, we assume, the S25+ as well), except, obviously, it's much thinner. For what it's worth the Galaxy S24+ is 7.7 mm thick. The Galaxy S25 Slim is apparently 8.3 mm thick at the camera bump, which is just 0.1 mm more than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to be at its thinnest point (excluding the camera humps). The Slim will apparently have a 6.7\" to 6.8\" screen, again, in line with the S25+ most likely. The design seems very similar too, perhaps unsurprisingly. The phone is rumored to pack a 200 MP main camera using Samsung's ISOCELL HP5 sensor, a 50 MP ultrawide camera using the ISOCELL JN5 sensor, and a 50 MP telephoto camera with 3.5x optical zoom. It will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with 12GB of RAM. It will run Android 15 with One UI 7 on top from day one. The Galaxy S25 Slim may be shown or teased at the Samsung Unpacked event on January 22, but it's not launching alongside the other three models in the family, instead it's expected to arrive in May. A previous rumor from just a few hours ago revealed what we can expect from this phone in terms of battery capacity, and it's not good. Source",
