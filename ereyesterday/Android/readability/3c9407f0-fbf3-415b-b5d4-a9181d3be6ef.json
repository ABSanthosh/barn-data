  "text": "The European Union’s continued crackdown on Apple’s closed-off ecosystem hasn’t slowed down in the slightest – not too long after Apple began the gradual discontinuation of devices with lightning ports in European countries, new reports suggest that the EU might be going after the Cupertino giant’s AirDrop and AirPlay technologies next. A new document published by the EU now requests Apple to open the aforementioned features for other platforms, which one can assume will include Android and Windows devices. For those unfamiliar, AirDrop allows instant wireless transfer of files between Apple devices, while AirPlay allows Apple users to cast videos from their phone to other devices including monitors and TVs. READ: Here’s Why the EU Wants USB-C as the New Charging Standard While Android already has similar-functioning features in the form of Quick Share and Google Cast, these are limited in terms of compatibility between Android devices and select Windows devices, and the same can be said for AirDrop and AirPlay. With that in mind, Apple opening its connectivity features will undoubtedly improve interoperability between Android and iOS devices, such as with the implementation of RCS. On the other hand though, we can most likely expect Apple to push back against this, given how protective it is of its services and features. It’s worth mentioning though that up until now the company has had to comply with a lot of EU mandates (albeit at the base level) including RCS support, alternative app stores, and even video game emulators.
