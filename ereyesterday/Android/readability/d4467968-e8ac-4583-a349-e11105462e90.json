  "text": "Anker 14-in-1 USB-C Hub $50 $70 Save $20 A versatile USB-C hub that's great for laptops, gaming handhelds, tablets, and more. Get it now for just $50, as it drops to its lowest price yet. Looking to expand your current laptop setup on a budget? Well, this Anker USB-C hub is going to be the way to go. Not only is it ultra-compact, but it also features plenty of port options, which can be vital for a device that doesn't quite have all the options you need. With that said, this popular USB-C hub is now down to its best price thanks to a steep discount from Amazon that drops it down to just $50. This is the lowest price we've seen on this model since we've been tracking, which makes it the perfect time to pick one up. Related Best USB-C hubs Need a USB-C hub for laptop? We've selected the best USB-C hubs on the market. Our top recommendations include hubs from Anker, HP, \u0026 more. What makes this Anker USB-C hub great? Source: Anker USB hubs are a great way to expand the port selection of supported devices. And since they are slim and compact, can also be quite portable, making them a perfect accessory to take with you when you're on the go. While there are many different options to go with, this one from Anker gets a lot of things right for a great price. When it comes to ports, this model has two HDMI, one VGA, two USB-C, five USB-A, Ethernet, microSD, SD card slot, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. As you can imagine, you can plug quite a lot into this hub if you're looking to expand, and even display out to multiple monitors at one time if needed. Another great advantage of this model is that you get passthrough charging. This will allow you to plug in your charger into the hub, which can then carry that charge to your connected devices. It's a seamless connection that keeps everything powered and organized. And just in case you need some support, Anker will supply 18 months on the product just in case you run into any issues. We don't think that's going to be a problem, but it's nice to have some backing if it's needed. So if you've been looking to buy a USB hub, now's going to be a great time.",

Well, this Anker USB-C hub is going to be the way to go.

selection of supported devices. And since they are slim and compact, can also be quite portable, making them a perfect accessory to take with you when you\u0026#39;re on the go. While there are many different options to go with, this one from Anker gets a lot of things right for a great price.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to ports, this model has two HDMI, one VGA, two USB-C, five USB-A, Ethernet, microSD, SD card slot, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. As you can imagine, you can plug quite a lot into this hub if you\u0026#39;re looking to expand, and even display out to multiple monitors at one time if needed.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAnother great advantage of this model is that you get passthrough charging. This will allow you to plug in your charger into the hub, which can then carry that charge to your connected devices. It\u0026#39;s a seamless connection that keeps everything powered and organized.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAnd just in case you need some support, Anker will supply 18 months on the product just in case you run into any issues. We don\u0026#39;t think that\u0026#39;s going to be a problem, but it\u0026#39;s nice to have some backing if it\u0026#39;s needed. So if you\u0026#39;ve been looking to buy a USB hub, now\u0026#39;s going to be a great time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
