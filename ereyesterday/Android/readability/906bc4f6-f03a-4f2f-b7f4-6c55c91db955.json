Today a promo poster for offline stores has been leaked showing the two devices, with three colorways each, though it's pretty hard to make them out exactly.

But, apparently not. Both devices also get a 120 Hz refresh rate for their screen which hits 4,500 nits of peak brightness, and there is also a Wi-Fi G1 chip that will supposedly accelerate your connection. Both phones use Snapdragon 8 series chips, the poster confirms, and from past rumors we know that the Ace 5 will go with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the Ace 5 Pro will have the Snapdragon 8 Elite instead. Keep in mind that the Ace 5 is expected to be launched internationally as the OnePlus 13R at the company's upcoming event on January 7. Source (in Chinese)",
