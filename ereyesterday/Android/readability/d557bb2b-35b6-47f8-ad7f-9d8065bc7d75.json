The Fold7 has two batteries, 2,126 mAh and 2,146 mAh rated capacities, respectively, making for a total of 4,272 mAh. This is likely to be marketed as 4,400 mAh typical capacity by Samsung, which means the Fold7's battery capacity will be unchanged from that of its predecessor.

Galaxy Z Fold7 (left) and Galaxy Z Flip7 (right) UL Demko certifications The Flip7's cells are 1,189 mAh and 2,985 mAh, for a total of 4,174 mAh, which is probably going to be marketed as 4,300 mAh typical capacity. This would mark a 300 mAh increase compared to the Flip6, which isn't outstanding but it's still nice to have. It's unclear why Samsung still refuses to up the Fold's battery capacity, which has been the exact same 4,400 mAh since the Fold3 launched in 2021 (and we should also mention that the Fold2's battery was actually 100 mAh larger at 4,500 mAh). Anyway, speaking of things Samsung doesn't want to change, both the Fold7 and Flip7 will only support 25W wired charging, unchanged since the Flip4 in 2022 and the Galaxy Z Fold2 in 2020, respectively.
