October is a big month for smartphones. That's not just because of all the new flagships coming out. Nope, it's because of the new flagship smartphone chips coming out this month—arguably the reason for such a packed month. MediaTek has already shown off its new chip and now we're waiting for Qualcomm. The Snapdragon Summit 2024 starts today and extends to the 23rd, so we're going to hear a lot of news about the chip and OEMs that plan to rely on the chip. Well, that's started already, as Realme has made its SoC plans for the GT 7 Pro flagship very evident. It'll be relying on the new Snapdragon 8 Elite. Realme Has Detailed Some Of The Snapdragon 8 Elite Specifications, And It Has A Lot Of Power Realme is a Chinese manufacturer that's pretty well-established for releasing phones with impressive specifications for a lot less than the competition does. That's not the brand's only selling point, as it also considers itself an innovator, and if you don't agree with that, tell that to the fastest-charging production phone ever—the Realme GT Neo 5. Plus, we're talking about the same company that showed off 320W fast charging. Well, Realme is going to be showing its GT 7 Pro flagship phone next month, but ahead of that, it has decided to confirm that it'll come with the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside. The OEM chose today for this vital piece of info since Snapdragon Summit 2024 is currently ongoing. Thanks to Realme, we know that the chip will be built on a 3nm process, marking Qualcomm's first smartphone chip of that variety, and it will have a 2 + 6 core configuration. With a clock speed surpassing 4GHz, this will be the most powerful Qualcomm chip in a phone and it's not close. That's exciting for the performance nerds. The Realme GT 7 Pro Will Be The First Snapdragon 8 Elite Flagship In Over 10 Markets Image: Realme Realme is a Chinese manufacturer, so you might automatically assume that the Realme GT 7 Pro will stick to a China-exclusive launch, at least for now, but fortunately, that's not the case. The Realme GT 7 Pro is confirmed for a global launch and at the moment, we know it'll be coming to India, Italy, Spain, Malaysia, and Thailand. In fact, Realme wants you to know that its next flagship will be coming to more than 10 markets, which will make it the first Snapdragon 8 Elite flagship to launch on such a wide scale. However, I'll use my judgment and reckon it won't find its way to North America, so keep that in mind if you plan to wait for it. Some Realme GT 7 Pro Specs Have Been Rumored Image: Realme We're not completely in the dark regarding the Realme GT 7 Pro. We have heard a few leaks related to the spec sheet of the device, so we expect to see IP69 certification, a 6,000 mAh battery, 120W fast charging, a 3x periscope telephoto camera, and a 1.5K 120Hz AMOLED screen. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
