  "text": "TP-Link TL-WR3002X travel router Save $10 with promo code \"10WR3002X6\" $70 $100 Save $30 The router you never knew you needed is now down to its best price, just in time for your summer trips. With summer steadily approaching, you might already be making plans for upcoming trips. And while you'll already have plenty of tech with you for the adventure, there's a good chance that a travel router isn't part of your current setup. Now, we know what you're thinking, and yes, many places already provide free Wi-Fi. Related So what's the point of bringing your own router? Well, there are plenty of great reasons, with the main ones being safety and convenience. If this has piqued your interest, we recommend this top-rated travel router from TP-Link. Not only do you get something compact and powerful, but it also comes in priced well below its retail price, with a $30 discount that drops it to its lowest price yet at just $70. What's great about this TP-Link travel router? So let's get the specifications out of the way first, just in case you need something a little more powerful. This is a Wi-Fi 6 router that can broadcast at both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz, while also simultaneously connecting to up to 80 different devices. It can be used as a primary router, or an access point, which allows it to be quite versatile. There are also two Ethernet connections, along with a USB-C port that can be used for power. Furthermore, you also get a USB-A port that will allow you to connect to cellular devices so that the internet can be broadcast through the router. Naturally, you get an abundance of security that you're used to on a standard router, but this one also packs a few other perks as well. The router natively supports VPN services like OpenVPN, WireGuard, NordVPN, and Surfshark. While this is great for hotels and Airbnbs, you can also use it on planes as well if you're looking to split that network into other devices. For the most part, you really can't go wrong here. You're getting something simple, easy to use, and secure. It will provide peace of mind when surfing the web in a remote location and doesn't cost all that much right now with this huge $30 discount.

This is a Wi-Fi 6 router that can broadcast at both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz, while also simultaneously connecting to up to 80 different devices. It can be used as a primary router, or an access point, which allows it to be quite versatile. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are also two Ethernet connections, along with a USB-C port that can be used for power. Furthermore, you also get a USB-A port that will allow you to connect to cellular devices so that the internet can be broadcast through the router. Naturally, you get an abundance of security that you\u0026#39;re used to on a standard router, but this one also packs a few other perks as well. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe router natively supports VPN services like OpenVPN, WireGuard, NordVPN, and Surfshark. While this is great for hotels and Airbnbs, you can also use it on planes as well if you\u0026#39;re looking to split that network into other devices. For the most part, you really can\u0026#39;t go wrong here. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#39;re getting something simple, easy to use, and secure. It will provide peace of mind when surfing the web in a remote location and doesn\u0026#39;t cost all that much right now with this huge $30 discount.
