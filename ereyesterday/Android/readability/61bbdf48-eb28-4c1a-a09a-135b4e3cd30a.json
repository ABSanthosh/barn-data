More info. Google’s first set of pre-Black Friday deals that went live yesterday were only a taste of what was to come it seems. This morning, Google upped the fun by giving the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel Watch 3 their first discounts. There are other discounted devices too, including like the Pixel 8a and Pixel Watch 2 I know that we’re all waiting around, hoping for Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL Black Friday deals, but for now, we have everything but those. The Pixel 9 is $150 off, dropping it to a staggeringly low price of $649. Remember, this is essentially a Pixel 9 Pro without the telephoto lens and RAM. It comes so close in so many other categories (our review). Seeing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with a sizable $300 off discount is huge too. This is normally an $1,800 device, so we’ll take any price drop we can get. $300 is a significant chunk of the price that is now gone. Here’s our review on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. For the Pixel Watch 3 (review), we are seeing $70 discounts on WiFi/Bluetooth models and $100 discounts on LTE models. These are the first discounts from Google like this and give us starting points of $279 and $349, respectively. That’s not all, though. The Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel 8a are both discounted by up to $100 off. Google Pre-Black Friday Best Deals Pixel 9 – $649 ($150 off) – Amazon | Best Buy Pixel 9 Pro Fold – $1499 ($300 off) – Amazon | Best Buy Pixel 8a – $399 ($100 off) Pixel Watch 3 (WiFi) – $279.99 ($70 off) Pixel Watch 3 (LTE) –  $349.99 ($100 off) Pixel Watch 2 (WiFi) – $179.99 ($70 off) Pixel Watch 2 (LTE) – $199.99 ($100 off) The rest of Google’s Black Friday sale can be found right here.",
