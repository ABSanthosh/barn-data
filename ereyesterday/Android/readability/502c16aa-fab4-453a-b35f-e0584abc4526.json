The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is going to become official in just a little over three weeks. This close to its launch, the specifications of the devices are hardly a mystery. One of the few things that remains majorly unknown is the rumored fourth model in the lineup—the Galaxy S25 Slim—though it might not even launch with the rest anyway. There is one new rumor, however, that the entire S25 series will come bundled with free Gemini Advanced. The higher-end devices will get longer trial periods, and for some, it might be enough to sweeten the deal to pull the trigger on an S25 when the phones arrive. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Lineup Might Come Bundled With Free Gemini Advanced Image: Google The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will bring just enough over the S24 series to be considered an upgrade, but for many, it simply isn't a good enough prospect to spend your hard-earned money on, especially at the prices that last year's series launched at. Samsung wants to entice you to come to (or stay on) the Galaxy side of life, and as such, has decided to bundle in a little something extra. If you buy any phone in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it seems like you might be getting a free period of Gemini Advanced bundled in. This comes from Android Authority, where the APK for the latest Google app was torn down, revealing some strings pointing to a free Gemini Advanced subscription for the S25 series. I don't think it is enough of a reason to buy the devices, but if you've found yourself on the fence pending their arrival, it might be enough of a reason to make you pull the trigger on them. Each S25 Device Will Come With A Different Trial Duration For Gemini Advanced Image: Samsung If you buy one of the more expensive devices in the upcoming series, you're going to be comparatively rewarded compared to the vanilla S25. With the regular S25 model, all signs point to three months of free access to Gemini Advanced. However, that doubles to six months with the S25+ and a whole year of free access with the S25 Ultra. That's not a bad perk to have thrown in, to be honest. Considering Gemini Advanced costs $19.99 a month, that's about $240 in value for the Ultra phone. What Does Gemini Advanced Offer That Free Gemini Doesn't? Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid I get by with Google's regular Gemini platform and it does everything that I need. However, I understand that some people have much deeper expectations from the AI models that they work with, and in such cases, upgrading to a higher tier helps a lot. In the case of Gemini Advanced, there's a whole lot that it brings to the table over the regular Gemini tier. For once, you get access to Gemini 1.5 Pro instead of Gemini 1.5 Flash, so that instantly means faster processing and better understanding. You also get access to experimental models that excel better in complex tasks like solving math and coding problems. Gemini Advanced lets you upload your own files to have the model help you out with them directly. It can also analyze documents as long as 1,500 pages, lets you create AI-powered experts on any topic, and as a plus, you get 2TB of Google One storage. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
