Obviously the Chinese-bound version got the nod, and this one has the model number SM-A5660. Samsung Galaxy A56 leaked imageThe certification reveals that the phone will sport a battery rated at 4,905 mAh. Note that smartphone makers advertise the typical capacity, not the rated one, and the typical capacity is higher. So expect this to be around 5,000-5,100 mAh. The A56 unsurprisingly supports 5G, GPS, dual-SIM, and will run Android 15 out of the box, with One UI 7 on top. This means it's still at least over a month out at this point, since the latest iteration of Samsung's skin will make its debut on the Galaxy S25 family that is getting official towards the end of this month.
