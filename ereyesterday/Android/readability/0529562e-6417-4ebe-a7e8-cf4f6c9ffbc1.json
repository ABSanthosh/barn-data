  "text": "It's that time of year again when the world's top tech brands gather at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to demonstrate their latest products. Many devices and software products, including AI (of course), smartphones, smart home technology, and more, have been on show. We were on the ground to check out the new, exciting tech goodies, so this is TalkAndroid's Best of MWC 2025. Honor Earbuds Open Image: Honor What's exciting about Honor's Earbuds Open is the AI-powered Live Translation function, which produces real-time interpretation. Even more impressive is the ability to hand the other participant an earbud to use so that both sides of the conversation are translated in real-time, resulting in a much less awkward interaction. It should be noted, however, that this useful feature only works with compatible Honor handsets, such as the Magic 7 Pro and Magic V3. Noise-canceling is included with the Earbuds Open, as is the ‘industry-first virtual bass algorithm,' which brings a fuller-bodied bass effect to proceedings. Otherwise, there's an ergonomic design, up to 6 hours of battery life (22 in total with the charging case), a bone-conducting microphone, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. Details on pricing and availability haven't been released yet, but it's unlikely that it will be much of a wait. TCL NXTPaper 11 Plus Image: TCL TCL has been delving into paper-like displays for its tablets for a while now, and its latest addition is the AI-powered NXTPaper 11 Plus, which was unveiled during MWC 2025. Debuting TCL's NXTPaper 4.0 technology that features improved blue-light filtering and upgraded NXTPAPER Key for an enhanced digital experience. Designed for eye comfort, it offers Smart Eye Comfort Mode and Personalized Eye Comfort Mode, which adapt display settings to reduce strain and optimize viewing. The tablet supports stylus input in any text field, enabling seamless handwriting entry for more intuitive interaction. With AI-driven productivity tools, MediaTek's Helio G100 processor, a high-resolution 11.5-inch 2.2K display, and a 120Hz refresh rate in a lightweight 490g frame, the NXTPAPER 11 Plus sets a new standard for modern, affordable tablets. You'll be able to pick up TCL's NXTPaper 11 Plus starting from just €249 (US pricing is unknown for the moment) in North America, Europe, and other regions. Xiaomi 15 Ultra Image: Xiaomi The one true flagship smartphone unveiled during MWC 2025, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, sports top specifications throughout and a sleek, inviting design. These include Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a rear camera setup with a pair of 50MP sensors, a 70MP 3x telephoto lens, and a gargantuan 200MP telephoto sensor with 4x optical zoom, all of which are tuned by renowned camera brand Leica. The 15 Ultra promises to be a dream setup for photography enthusiasts. Elsewhere, you'll find a 6.73-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate and an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor. There's 16GB of RAM, at least 512GB of UFS 4.1 storage, and a big 6,000mAh battery (global variant drops to 5,410mAh) with 90W wired charging and 80W wireless charging. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra features a unique combination of Bluetooth 6.0, an IR blaster, Wi-Fi 7, and a USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port. Possibly the only and most common negative is that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra isn't going on sale in the US. It will, however, be available in Europe and beyond, with pricing starting from £1,299 (~$1,680). In our eyes, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is an early front-runner for TalkAndroid's Best Flagship of 2025. Nothing Phone 3a Image: Nothing Nothing's Phone 3a made its debut during the tradeshow, and as you might expect from the brand, there's a rather unique design aesthetic, which once again sports glyph lighting on the rear panel. It's unusual for sure, but it grows on you; as I've mentioned, it is unique. You won't be mistaken for using an iPhone, that's for sure. Unlike the Phone 2a, the newcomer packs a pair of rear cameras and a 3x telephoto lens—something you'll be hard-pressed to find on any other similarly priced smartphone. An FHD+ AMOLED display, Snapdragon 7S Gen 3 chipset, and big battery with fast charging are part of the package, as is the minimalist Nothing OS. Americans can pick up the Phone 3a for $379 but only via Nothing's Beta program, while it will be on general sale in Europe, the UK, and India from March 11th. Realme Ultra Concept Image: Realme In the past, we've seen Realme show off high-speed charging technology and innovative rear panel designs, but this year at MWC 2025, the brand has delved into the realm of pro photography. Dubbed the Realme Ultra, it looks like a regular flagship smartphone until you turn it around and see the big circular camera housing that sports a one-inch Sony sensor dead center. Image: Realme Looking more closely at the camera housing reveals a proprietary lens mounting system that adds the ability to attach a 73mm portrait or 234mm telephoto lens directly to the smartphone. This means you'll have access to lossless 10x zoom or excellent bokeh effect. Coupled with the add-on lens technology are cutting-edge AI-imaging functions, AI Voice-based Retoucher, and IA Video Eraser, which let users remove the background or change the scene from sky to sunset, as well as erase unwanted objects from the videos. While not in mass production, the Realme Ultra is a tangible sign of the brand's ambition, and we may see the technology used in an upcoming handset later this year. Tecno Spark Slim Image: Tecno Remember the days when brands fought to launch the slimmest smartphone? Well, if Tecno's Spark Slim is anything to go by, this particular contest is on its way back. Packing a chassis that is just 5.75mm thick, the Spark Slim uses modern battery technology (something we all wish Samsung would ‘discover') to give the handset a 5,200mAh capacity. In comparison, Samsung's Galaxy S25 Slim is rumored to make do with just 3,900mAh capacity, which is just not enough for modern-day usage. Despite being so thin, the Spark Slim isn't a small phone. Boasting a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate and up to 4,500 nits peak brightness, it is powered by an unspecified Octa-core processor. We don't know how much the Tecno Spark Slim will cost or when it will be released; it's rumored to be prepped for a ‘staggered' launch in 2025. Which device has you most excited to see? While some of the devices mentioned above are just concepts, others are either already on sale or scheduled to go on sale soon. And even the concepts are thought to be arriving on the market in some form or another in the future.",
