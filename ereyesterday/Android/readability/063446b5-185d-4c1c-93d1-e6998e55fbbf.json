Some rumors suggest we may see the tri-fold at next week’s Galaxy Unpacked event and we now have an actual look at the device thanks to the team over at Android Authority who discovered animation files hidden in the latest One UI 8 build. These show the device’s design, which includes three rear panels and two inward folding hinges. The more interesting bit is that the hinges on Samsung’s tri-fold feature different sizes and will reportedly fold inwards instead of the outward folding approach seen on Huawei’s Mate XT. This means Samsung’s device will have to be unfolded from right to left as shown in the following animation. A separate video shows a warning not to fold the right side of the device (which has the three rear cameras on its back) inward, as that may end up breaking the display. The device features a cover screen that will reside in the middle when the main folding screen is fully open. Samsung’s tri-fold is referred to as Multifold 7 in the One UI 8 code, while previous rumors suggest it is called Q7M internally. While its commercial name is not finalized, previous reports point to it being called Galaxy G Fold. According to previous leaks, Samsung’s first tri-fold device will feature a 9.96\" folding screen and a 6.54\" cover display. It is expected to weigh around 300 grams and may only launch in South Korea and China. Source",
