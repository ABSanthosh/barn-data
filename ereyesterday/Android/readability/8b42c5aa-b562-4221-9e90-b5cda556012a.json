Both the phone and the headphones will be offered in the US officially, and a past rumor told us to expect the Nothing Headphone (1) to be priced at $299. But what about Europe? Specifically, the Eurozone. If you live there you are surely used to a price like $299 magically transforming into €399 or even €449, so you may have been expecting something similar here.
