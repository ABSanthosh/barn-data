  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Android users can now open Microsoft Office files on their device without needing to sign-in to a Microsoft account. This function has been available to iPhone users since earlier this year. The sender will need version 16.0.18827.20066 and up of Office, but the receiver simply clicks on a link for a view-only version of the file. Microsoft is finally bringing one of its more convenient iOS features to Android. Until now, opening a shared Office file required logging into a Microsoft account. That changed for iPhone users earlier this year, but now, Android owners can enjoy the same convenience. Related The company is officially rolling out anonymous file sharing for Android (via Android Authority). Just tap the link and start reading, no sign-in required. This eliminates a long-standing hassle for Android users. Source: Android Authority The feature works with links generated from a Microsoft account. The sender shares a file by opening it in Word, Excel, or Powerpoint, and then tapping the share icon. They can then enter the recipient's email address or copy the link manually. The receiver doesn't need a Microsoft account. They simply open the link on their Android device and can see the shared document. Recipients will see a prompt to sign in, however. They can dismiss this. If they do dismiss the prompt, the file will open in view-only mode. They can read it, but won't be able to make any changes. It's perfect for on-the-go access to needed documents. This functionality arrived for iPhone users earlier this year, and proved to be popular. Microsoft Office users will need version 16.0.18827.20066 and up of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to send anonymous-capable files. Microsoft is playing catch-up Microsoft is playing catch-up with Google here, as this is something Google Drive has supported for a long time. But with Office apps still playing a major role in business and education, it is long past time Microsoft allowed it as well, especially for Android users. This is a decent quality-of-life improvement for anyone who juggles Office files. It may not be as flashy as Gemini updates, but every small, meaningful improvement to the Android ecosystem is appreciated.",
