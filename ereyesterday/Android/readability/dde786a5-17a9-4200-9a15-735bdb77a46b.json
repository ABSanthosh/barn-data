  "text": "Realme fans, rejoice—the brand recently confirmed that it will be broadcasting a global launch event for its upcoming GT 7 series phones. According to Realme, the event will be held on May 27, 2025 in Paris, France. READ: The Galaxy S25 Edge will Come with a New Gorilla Glass Variant With that in mind, the GT 7 Pro will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which has been the go-to chip for a lot of flagship and premium devices this year. The series will also come with IceSense Graphene technology, which Realme says is designed to improve thermal conductivity while providing 360° heat dissipation. Unsurprisingly, Realme hasn’t revealed too much about the GT 7 series’ specs, so you’ll have to keep an eye on the announcement once it goes live, or you know unless someone leaks everything. Additionally, the GT 7 series will be one of many premium phones that are launching this month—Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge and Sony’s Xperia 1 VII are arriving on May 13th, while the Honor 400 series devices are scheduled to make their debut on the 22nd. In any case, we’re bound to get a ton of great new hardware this month.",
