Specifically, US commuters can now add select prepaid commuter benefit cards to Google Wallet, starting with Edenred and HealthEquity. Lastly, Google announced that users can now access passes on the web at wallet.google.com. Update (Dec 6): Google announced that ID pass in Wallet is starting to roll out today.
