  "text": "Traveling can be enjoyable and inspirational. Visiting the right place with the right people can heal the body and clear the mind. Traveling can also be expensive, and I'm not only talking about the high price of plane tickets. When you're at your destination, you could easily spend more than you planned, especially if you use a different currency or adapt to the local shopping etiquette. You can travel smarter and save money on trips. You could grab food and snacks from a grocery store instead of dining out. You could bring a budget Android phone in case you lose or someone steals your daily driver. There are also many Android apps you could use to reduce expenses when traveling, and these are the ones I recommend. 7 Airalo offers cheap mobile data while abroad Get an eSIM to avoid roaming charges The best Android phones and some newer mid-range models support eSIM technology. Unlike physical SIM cards, an eSIM is physically built into a device, and you manage it via software, without visiting a physical store. Many services offer eSIMs for travelers who want to avoid hefty roaming charges. I use Airalo, but popular alternatives like Saily and Holafly do almost the same for a similar price. To get mobile data abroad, I use the Airalo app to activate a plan suitable for my destination and data needs. Then, I download the eSIM on my device, and I'm good to go. Using an eSIM is more convenient and cheaper than buying a prepaid physical SIM card at your destination, not to mention that you'll be online as soon as you arrive. Such eSIM deals and plans may include data only, without any calls or texts. Read the fine print before you pick your eSIM service plan. Related 6 My CityPASS gives discounts on top tourist destinations Pay less when you buy a bundle I discovered My CityPASS a couple of years ago during a trip to Houston. I'm glad I did because I got to see the city's top attractions with my family for about half the regular price. My CitiPASS is available in 16 metropolitan areas across the United States. When you buy a pass for a particular city, you can visit several attractions from a list within a given time window. For example, a pass to Houston grants you admission to NASA's Johnson Space Center and four of the other six places in the bundle, which you can pick at any time. The pass is valid for nine days, and child tickets are available. While I got a great deal, I can see how My CityPASS isn't ideal for everyone. I recommend its bundles only to travelers who have the time to explore all its attractions. Some places may require several hours, if not a whole day, to get to and fully appreciate. A bundle can save you serious cash if you visit for a week or more. 5 Revolut provides mobile banking Get better exchange rates when paying abroad I got Revolut to share lunch bills with friends. Then, I realized the app gave me better foreign currency exchange rates than my bank. Revolut is a fintech company, and people use its services to pay and get paid, as well as to invest in commodities and cryptocurrencies. You don't need to do any of that to benefit from Revolut's advantageous exchange rates. For several years, my wife and I have used our Revolut balances to make payments with our phones while traveling abroad, and we've rarely had issues. Currency exchange may cost more on weekends, depending on your service plan. A standard account is free to open and has no monthly fees. 4 Xe Money Transfer \u0026 Converter makes exchange rates easy Keep track of foreign exchange rates Since Revolut doesn't have an exchange rate widget, and opening it requires a PIN or fingerprint, I use XE Currency Converter to keep track of foreign exchange rates. The app is free and does not require an account if you only want to see up-to-date exchange rates for foreign currencies. While this app does not save money directly, it helps you spend wisely. It's easy to lose your perception of the value of the money you spend when in a different country and using the local currency. That's why it's good to have the current exchange rate on your home screen.

You can also enjoy a variety of experiences at a discount. I use it and its local alternatives to find cheap tickets for water parks and other summer attractions. However, you will also find all sorts of experiences, from couples' massages and cooking classes to tours and boat rides. While Groupon is most popular in the US, its services are available in many parts of Europe, including Spain and France. If you're traveling to a country where Groupon isn't in yet, look for a local alternative. Chances are you'll find one. 2 Organic Maps provides offline maps and GPS Find what's near you While Google Maps is useful when traveling with its up-to-date location information and user reviews, I keep Organic Maps installed on my phone. It's nice to have a backup solution with offline maps, and with Organic Maps, you'll easily find public toilets and water fountains. That's what I use the app for when traveling across Europe. The water is safe to drink in many cities throughout the continent, so I don't have to spend money on bottled water. Organic Maps is inferior to Google Maps in many ways. You're more likely to run into outdated information and closed businesses, not to mention that photos and reviews for places on the map are not available. On the other hand, the app is free and contains no advertisements. Related 1 Splitwise helps you track expenses Splitwise is an expense tracker with a twist. The app allows bills and purchases to be split among several people. This makes it ideal for traveling in a group and keeping track of everyone's tab. It's easy to lose count of who owes what and to whom when traveling with friends. You can't save any money with Splitwise. However, at the end of your trip, you'll be sure nobody owes money to anyone. The app is also useful for people living together who want to keep track of bills and grocery shopping. Traveling does not have to be expensive Planning a trip is essential if you want it to go smoothly. That includes having a budget, a list of anticipated expenses, and accounting for unexpected ones. These apps help you stretch your budget and avoid spending more than necessary. Perhaps the money you save will be enough to buy a must-have travel accessory.

When you buy a pass for a particular city, you can visit several attractions from a list within a given time window. For example, a pass to Houston grants you admission to NASA\u0026#39;s Johnson Space Center and four of the other six places in the bundle, which you can pick at any time. The pass is valid for nine days, and child tickets are available.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhile I got a great deal, I can see how My CityPASS isn\u0026#39;t ideal for everyone.
