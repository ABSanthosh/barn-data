  "text": "Garmin Enduro 3 $800 $900 Save $100 Garmin's new longest-lasting smartwatch is the Enduro 3, which brings many improvements over its predecessor — and it's cheaper. The watch supports GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, and others. Plus, the Enduro 3 includes plenty of sensors and now uses Garmin's Elevate Gen5 optical heart rate sensor. But it lacks a few smart features compared to the Fenix 8, like a microphone and speaker, but packs all the same software offerings.  Even the best smartwatches out right now struggle to hit up to three days of battery life. And to be fair, some may never even come close, but that doesn't really seem to bother most people when they're in the market for a new wearable. However, if you're someone that doesn't like the idea of charging their watch, going with a Garmin might be a solution — especially one that can charge via solar, extending its battery life, way beyond what you'd expect. Related The Garmin Enduro 3 is one such watch from the brand, providing up to 90 days of use. You read that right, up to three months you can keep this watch off the charger, which means you can be out and about in the middle of nowhere and feel confident it won't die on you. While it's usually pretty pricey, coming in at $900, it can now be had for much less, with a rare $100 discount that knocks it down to its best price yet. What's great about the Garmin Enduro 3? If the battery life didn't sell you, well, there's still plenty more to love about this smartwatch. With the Enduro 3, you're getting a light and durable watch that features a large 1.4-inch MIP display that looks great in a variety of conditions. Naturally, you're going to get a wealth of different sensors that will allow you to track your health, wellness, and fitness activities. The watch can even provide accurate location tracking even in the most challenging regions, allowing you to stay on course, whether you're hiking or going on a quick run. The great part is that Garmin has excellent software, providing ways to make you train more efficiently. While there are a ton of training features on this watch, the good news is that the tools available can be extremely helpful, no matter whether you're at the start or the end of your fitness journey. And since this is a smartwatch, you get to stay connected, while also getting nice conveniences like Garmin Pay. For the most part, the Enduro 3 is a well-rounded watch that really delivers when it comes to its health and fitness tracking capabilities. Plus, the battery life pretty much goes unmatched, which is probably the biggest reason why you should be buying this watch. Get it now for $100 less while this deal lasts.",

The watch supports GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, and others. Plus, the Enduro 3 includes plenty of sensors and now uses Garmin\u0026#39;s Elevate Gen5 optical heart rate sensor. But it lacks a few smart features compared to the Fenix 8, like a microphone and speaker, but packs all the same software offerings. \u003c/p\u003e\n                \n                \t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                \n        \n        \n                    \n        \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven the \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-smartwatches/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebest smartwatches out right now\u003c/a\u003e struggle to hit up to three days of battery life. And to be fair, some may never even come close, but that doesn\u0026#39;t really seem to bother most people when they\u0026#39;re in the market for a new wearable. However, if you\u0026#39;re someone that doesn\u0026#39;t like the idea of charging their watch, going with a Garmin might be a solution — especially one that can charge via solar, extending its
