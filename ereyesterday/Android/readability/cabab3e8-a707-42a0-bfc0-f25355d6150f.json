Specifically, the offer reads “purchase and activate a Tab S10 series, or Tab S10 FE series device by 7/31/2025.” We probably shouldn’t read too much into the date, other than to say that the Tab S10 FE slates will be out before then. Galaxy Tab S10 FE series mentioned on Samsung.comWhen can they launch? The Tab S7 FE duo came in mid-2021, the two Tab S9 FE models were announced in October 2023, so there isn’t a consistent timeline. They could come out in January with the Galaxy S25 phones. Another possible launch date is with the Galaxy A56 as they could use the same chipset – the Tab S9 FE and Galaxy A54 were both powered by the Exynos 1380, the Tab S10 FE and A56 could share the Exynos 1580. The Galaxy A56 is expected in March. The FE series could fill the 11” slot that was left empty by the Tab S10 models (which only come in 12.4” and 14.6” sizes), but Samsung’s official site doesn’t go into so much detail. Calling it “Tab S10 FE series” does suggest that there will be at least two devices, so there is that. Source | Via (in Dutch)",
