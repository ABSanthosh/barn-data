  "text": "We keep referring to Samsung’s One UI 7 update as “massive” or “huge” because it really is one of the biggest updates from them in their Android history. They’ve suggested that the number of changes they have made is the reason for its delay and slow rollout, and to be honest, when you see the full changelog, you might start believing their story. Since going stable yesterday and rolling out to the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 Ultra in the US, Samsung has posted the official changelog in a pretty easily-readable format. Instead of that cramped changelog you potentially tried to read on your phone, we have the desktop version that breaks it all down. For those in the US, you should receive builds of S928U1UEU4BYCH (S24 Ultra), S926U1UEU4BYCH (S24+), and S921U1UEU4BYCH (S24). These updates bring Android 15 underneath One UI 7.0, as well as the April 2025 Android security patch. To start, folks who participated in the One UI 7 beta program or with unlocked units will likely get the update first, followed by the various carrier models. So what’s new in One UI 7.0 on the Galaxy S24 series? You’ll need to dive down below to read through every single feature, but Samsung has bolded categories for you to focus in on and a list of 77 different items (features) that they’ve changed or introduced in this update. I’ve seen some folks across this vast internet suggest that this update isn’t that big – they are foolish. This update really is a wild one and there are so many changes. Will all of them apply to the way you use your phone? Of course not. Will you find something new to play with? I’d bet on it. Samsung breaks this down by Galaxy AI, access to useful info, the “Bold new look,” lock screen and always-on display changes, what’s new in the quick panel and notifications, camera enhancements, video editing tools, health stuff, and so much more. Let us know which features and changes you are most looking forward to (or are already enjoying). One UI 7.0 Upgrade (Android 15) Galaxy AI Write like a pro Let Galaxy AI help you with writing tasks by tapping the 4-star icon that appears whenever you select text.

Transcribe and summarize recorded calls It’s easier than ever to review the content of your recorded calls in the Samsung Phone app. You can view the entire conversation as a text transcript on the Recents screen or summarize the transcript for quick review. Availability of this feature may vary depending on your country, region, or lauguage. Remove or adjust sounds in your videos Audio eraser helps you get the sound in your videos just right.
