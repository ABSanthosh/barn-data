The Galaxy S25 Slim has been rumored a few times to arrive later in the year than the other three S25 devices, and today a new report corroborates this information thanks to Samsung's latest One UI 7 beta. This contains a list of US carrier-specific Samsung phone models, but the Galaxy S25 Slim's model number is not on the list. That indicates that the Slim isn't part of the first wave of devices that will be launched running One UI 7 on top of Android 15. Previously, rumors said the S25 Slim would become available in the second quarter of next year (from April to June) and that does track with what's been found inside One UI 7. The Galaxy S25 Slim will allegedly come with a 6.66-inch screen, a 200 MP main camera, a 50 MP ultrawide, a 50 MP telephoto camera with 3.5x optical zoom, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It is rumored to sport a 4,700 mAh to 5,000 mAh battery. Source",
