Bloomberg previously reported that the device would “make extensive use of glass” and feature a curved design with no display cutouts. A new supply-chain report shared by South Korea’s ETNews sheds more light on the mysterious device that’s set to offer the biggest design change since the iPhone X from 2017. Xiaomi waterfall display concept from 2021 Apple is reportedly in talks with both Samsung Display and LG Display for its upcoming “bezel-less” iPhone display panels. The new report describes a “four-sided bending display” which relocates the bezels to the sides of the device, making the device appear as a single piece of glass when viewed from the front. That sounds a lot like the Xiaomi concept device from 2021. It’s also worth mentioning that Xiaomi’s concept device had no buttons or ports, which has been a long-standing rumor for Apple. The upcoming iPhone is also said to gain an under-display (UD) camera. According to the new report, the display panel for the iPhone 19 Pro would employ an updated FinFET-based OLED driving chip fabbed on a 16nm process compared to the current 28nm planar process for current iPhone models. Apple is also expected to introduce a solid-state battery with an all-silicon cathode, delivering a drastic boost to battery endurance. As usual with these types of early reports, we'd advise you take the info with a few grains of salt. Source (in Korean)",
