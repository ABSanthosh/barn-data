Boost Mobile Summit 5GTo celebrate this milestone, Boost is introducing the Summit 5G, an Android smartphone powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. On the rear there's a 13 MP main camera and a 2 MP depth sensor, for selfies you get a 5 MP shooter, and the lights are kept on by a 5,000 mAh battery. This, thus, is definitely unlikely to feel exciting to anyone. But that's not the point. The phone is $94.99, and also free for those who switch and port their number to Boost Mobile, and it's $19.99 for those who are on Boost and want to upgrade their device. If you pair it with the $25/month 5G plan, you're getting \"the most budget-friendly option for high-speed 5G connectivity across all carriers\", Boost proudly boasts. Source | Via",
