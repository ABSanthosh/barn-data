Samsung Developer Conference Korea 2024 will be an online event on November 21. You can already sign up on the official site, if you are interested. There will be two keynote speeches and a total of 29 sessions where Samsung will share its progress in fields such as on-device generative AI, the future of healthcare and how Samsung Health fits in, bringing the Matter protocol to the SmartThings platform and more. What about One UI? The press release doesn’t mention it by name, but one keynote will focus on “Improving the user experience of Samsung Electronics' software and device platforms” and will be led by Samsung Electronics Device Platform Center Vice President Jeong Jae-yeon and Samsung Research Executive Director Kwon Ho-beom. It sounds like we might get a preview of One UI 7 or at least word on when public beta testing will start. One UI 7 will bring a brand new look for Samsung’s Android skin and is a major redesign, which is why it’s taking so long. Yesterday, we saw an unofficial video that shows off some of the upcoming changes. Source (in Korean)",
