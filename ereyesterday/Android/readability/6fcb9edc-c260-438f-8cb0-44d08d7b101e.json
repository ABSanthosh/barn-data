Google's latest iteration of Android's Battery Health feature has sparked controversy among Pixel users. The much-anticipated functionality, finally arriving in Android 16 Beta 3, will only be available on the Pixel 8a and newer devices. This decision leaves owners of older Pixel models, including the flagship Pixel 8 and 8 Pro from 2023, unable to access this essential battery monitoring tool despite Google's promise of seven years of updates. Android users have long awaited a native battery health monitoring solution similar to what Apple has offered iPhone users for years. Google has finally delivered this feature in the latest Android 16 Beta 3, but with a surprising limitation that has disappointed many Pixel owners. The battery health indicator, designed to help users track battery degradation over time, will only be compatible with the Pixel 8a and newer devices, excluding even recent flagships like the Pixel 8 series. The exclusive battery health feature explained The new Battery Health feature represents a significant addition to Android's functionality, allowing users to monitor their battery's condition as it inevitably degrades over time. Located in the Battery section of the Settings app, this tool displays an estimated percentage of charge a battery can currently hold compared to when it was new. Screenshots of the feature have emerged from Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 users participating in the Android 16 Beta program. The interface provides clear visual information about battery degradation, helping users make informed decisions about when battery replacement might be necessary. This functionality mirrors what Apple has offered iPhone users since iOS 11.3, even on models as old as the iPhone 6 released in 2014. The contrast between Apple's wide-ranging support and Google's restrictive approach has become a point of contention among Android enthusiasts and tech analysts. Why older Pixel devices won't receive the update According to information from the Google Issue Tracker, confirmed by Reddit user azmeen0google, the Battery Health feature won't be coming to older Pixel smartphones “due to product limitations.” This vague explanation has left many users questioning the technical reasoning behind this decision. The exclusion particularly affects: Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro (2023 flagship models) Pixel 7 series devices Pixel 6 and earlier generations This limitation seems particularly puzzling considering that older devices would benefit more significantly from battery health monitoring, as their batteries have likely experienced more charge cycles and degradation. Users with aging Pixel phones now lack official tools to determine when battery replacement might be necessary. Implications for Google's seven-year update promise One of the most concerning aspects of this decision is how it potentially undermines Google's much-touted promise of seven years of software updates for Pixel devices. When Google announced this extended support period, many consumers viewed it as a significant advantage over competitors. The following comparison highlights how this decision impacts different Pixel generations: DeviceRelease YearBattery Health FeatureYears of Updates PromisedPixel 9 Series2024Supported7 yearsPixel 8a2024Supported7 yearsPixel 8/8 Pro2023Not Supported7 yearsOlder PixelsPre-2023Not SupportedVaries This situation raises questions about the quality and comprehensiveness of long-term support if newer features aren't being implemented on devices within their promised update window. For many users, the ability to monitor battery health is not just a convenience but a necessary tool for managing device longevity. Alternative options for battery monitoring While Google has restricted the official Battery Health feature to newer Pixel models, users of older devices aren't entirely without options. Several third-party applications on the Google Play Store offer battery monitoring capabilities, although they typically can't access the same system information as native tools. For technical users, the following alternatives exist: AccuBattery – Provides estimates of battery health based on charge cycles Battery Guru – Offers detailed battery usage statistics Ampere – Measures charging and discharging current Developer options – Advanced users can access limited battery information through Android's developer settings These solutions, while helpful, highlight the growing fragmentation in Android's feature availability across different device generations. As Google continues developing Android 16 before its official release, users hope the company might reconsider this limitation and extend the Battery Health feature to a broader range of Pixel devices.
