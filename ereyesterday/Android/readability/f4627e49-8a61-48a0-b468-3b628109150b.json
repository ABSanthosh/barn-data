  "text": "Sony SRS-XB100 A portable speaker that delivers good sound, excellent durability, and comes in an easy-to-carry design. Right now, the Sony SRS-XB100 is down to its lowest price yet at just $38, making it the perfect accessory for summer. Summer is just around the corner, which means spending more time doing the things you love with friends and family. Of course, it never hurts to have some music in the background, and a portable Bluetooth speaker is the ideal accessory, especially when you need something that's loud and durable. Related While you can spend a few hundred dollars on something like the Sonos Move 2, that isn't always going to be necessary, especially when you have fantastic budget options like the Sony SRS-XB100. This portable Bluetooth speaker is one of the best that you can buy, and now comes in at its lowest price thanks to a discount that drops it down to just $38. What's great about the Sony SRS-XB100 Bluetooth speaker? This is the speaker to get if you're looking for something that isn't going to break the bank but won't also be a let-down. You're getting a compact and durable design, along with an IP67 rating that can keep it protected from dust and moisture, making it perfect to take outdoors. You can feel confident using it near the pool, or just taking it with you on camping trips or even to the beach. And there's even a built-in carrying strap that makes it easier to carry around. Despite its small size, you're still going to get plenty of volume here, with up to 16 hours of battery life as well. Furthermore, you can even combine two of these speakers for an even better sound if needed. The speaker also has a built-in microphone, making it possible to take and make calls, and the best part is that the audio will sound crystal clear thanks to echo-cancelling tech that will keep the conversation fluid without any clipping or bad distortion. There's even support for Google's Fast Pair technology, which makes connecting to compatible devices even easier. The speaker also has physical controls, allowing you to play and pause music, with buttons to increase and decrease the volume. Overall, not a bad Bluetooth speaker for just $38. You get something compact, powerful, and feature-packed for a great price. Grab it now, or if you're still on the fence, check out some other options that we recommend.",
