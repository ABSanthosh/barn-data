Honor Magic7 RSR Porsche Design periscope sensor specs (machine translated from Chinese) Reliable tipster Digital Chat Station chimed in, revealing the key specs of the Magic 7 RSR’s camera setup. As per the tipster, Honor is bringing a 50MP main cam with the OmniVision OV50K sensor – a 1/1.3-inch sensor with a variable f/1.2-2.0 aperture. The main cam will be joined by a 200MP 1/1.4” periscope sensor with f/1.88 aperture, 3x optical and up to 100x digital zoom alongside the aforementioned dual electromagnetic focus motor. The third shooter on the back is a 50MP ultrawide lens with a 122° field of view and 2.5cm macro mode capabilities. These camera specs are nearly identical to the Honor Magic7 Pro, which launched in China back in October, but the changes in the periscope module could deliver even better light capture and focusing capabilities.
