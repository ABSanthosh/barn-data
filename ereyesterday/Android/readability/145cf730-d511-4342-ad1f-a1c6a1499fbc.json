  "text": "Not too long ago, Amazon recently announced the launch of its Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, its first-ever Kindle model to support colored displays. While the device is impressive in general (at least compared to other Kindle models), it looks like a growing number of users have made complaints online. The problem seems to revolve around the Colorsoft’s display itself, with some users complaining about discoloration brought on by a “yellow band” which has appeared near the bottom of their displays. This has now prompted the company to temporarily delay its shipment of Colorsoft units. As per an Amazon representative: A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display… We take the quality of our products seriously — customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward. In terms of specifications, the Amazon Kindle Colorsoft features a seven-inch color display with built-in lighting, something that up until now has been missing from Amazon’s lineup of ereaders.
