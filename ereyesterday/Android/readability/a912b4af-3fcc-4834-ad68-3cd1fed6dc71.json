Across PC and mobile, Google Play Games is making more games available, celebrating players with exclusive rewards, and improving the gameplay experience. Matthew McCullough Vice President, Product Management, Android Developer Find your favorite games across PC and mobileGoogle Play Games is expanding its library with a wider range of PC games, opening up the platform to more PC-only games. On top of popular titles like “Remember of Majesty,” “Genshin Impact” and “Journey of Monarch,” we're welcoming “Game of Thrones: Kingsroad,” “Sonic Rumble” and “ODIN: VALHALLA RISING” to the platform this year. We’re also making it easier for mobile developers to add their games to PC. You can enjoy titles like “Train Sim” and “Pet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel” along with thousands of new mobile games playable on Google Play Games.The full Google Play Games on PC catalog will now also be available on more devices, including AMD laptops and desktops. Now, you can play some of the PC games you know and love on your mobile device. Starting this month, titles like “DREDGE” and “TABS Mobile” are coming to Google Play. Later this year, look forward to even more PC games on your Android devices like “Disco Elysium,” where you decide your own destiny as a mystery detective. These games have been optimized for mobile, so you can enjoy the game while you’re on the go. Get exclusive rewards on PC with Google Play PointsWe also want to celebrate our players and your gameplay on PC, so we’re making Play Points easier to use on PC with up to 10 times points boosters1. Rolling out over the next few weeks, your Play Points balance is now easier to track across mobile and PC. This means more opportunities to earn and redeem points for in-game items, discounts and more.Not a member yet? Sign up for free today. Personalize how you use Google Play GamesGoogle Play is dedicated to providing an amazing catalog of games across PC and mobile, all with the goal of helping you find the best game, wherever you play. However, we believe playing your way means more than just being able to play across devices. To make Google Play Games tailored to you, try out new custom controls for optimal comfort and performance. Rolling out this month, we’re adding a game sidebar for quick in-game adjustments and multi-account and multi-instancing support, so you can play the same game with multiple accounts simultaneously. A player accesses the game settings, including key mapping, and sets up an on-screen joystick control to use their keyboard Google Play Games on PC was designed to give you more flexibility for how you play your favorite games. Whether you're a mobile gamer who’s always wanted to try out a popular PC title, or a PC enthusiast wanting to experience your favorite Android games on your desktop, there's something exciting for everyone. Google Play Games on PC will be moving into general availability later this year, so be on the lookout for even more multiplatform games and upgrades.Enjoy smooth and improved gameplay powered by AndroidWe know a key piece of a great gaming experience is how well a game performs. We’re equipping developers with a modern graphics API called Vulkan and enhancing the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF). Vulkan allows games to make better use of a device’s graphics for smoother frame rates and more realistic visuals. And ADPF will help game developers optimize the device performance so that you can have a more stable and responsive gaming experience.
