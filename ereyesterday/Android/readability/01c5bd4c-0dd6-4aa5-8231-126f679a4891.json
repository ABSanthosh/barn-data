This makes us think it probably has IP68 or IP69 certification for dust and water resistance - or both. These have been quite trendy recently with Chinese smartphone brands. For what it's worth, the A3 Pro launched back in June came with an IP54 rating, so this would be a definite step up. According to the aforementioned certification, the Oppo A5 Pro comes with a 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 8/12GB of RAM, 256/512GB of storage, a 50 MP main rear camera with a 2 MP decorative sensor next to it, and a 16 MP selfie snapper.
