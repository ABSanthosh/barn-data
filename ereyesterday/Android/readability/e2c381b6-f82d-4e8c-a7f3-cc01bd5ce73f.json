The Redmi phone scored 3,016,450 points in AnTuTu, while the other two managed 2,832,981 and 2,738,065, so all of them had very strong performance but the winner is clear. According to previous rumors, the Redmi K80 Pro will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC and the vanilla K80 will go with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 instead. The Redmi exec also hinted that the K80 Pro will be cheaper than the OnePlus 13, which starts at CNY 4,499 (around $630). For reference, note that the K70 Pro launched at CNY 3,299 ($460), but price hikes across the board are expected this year especially for flagship devices with the chipset cost rising. The manager also explained that there will be no K80E this year, but then why did three members of the family recently get certified? That remains a mystery for now. The Redmi K80 series should be coming later this month. The K80 and K80 Pro will have the same 6.67-inch \"2K\" 120 Hz flat screen, as well as IP68 dust and water resistance. The Pro has been rumored to sport 120W wired and 50W wireless charging support, while the vanilla model will have to make do with 90W and 30W, respectively. Via",
