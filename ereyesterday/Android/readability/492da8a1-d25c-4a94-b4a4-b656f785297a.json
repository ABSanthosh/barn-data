  "text": "$200 Off Pixel 9 Pro is Going Away Soon, Google Says February 19, 2025 We may earn a commission when you click links to retailers and purchase goods. More info. The Android phone I still use every day and probably will for the foreseeable future, is wrapping up its latest sale, according to Google. If you want a Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL at a steep discount, now is the time to jump at them. All retailers are currently running a $200 off special on both the regular Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. With $200 off, you’d get a Pixel 9 Pro at a starting price of $799 with 128GB storage. The Pixel 9 Pro XL with that same 128GB would start at $899. Larger storage amounts (like 256GB) are also $200 off at the moment. For comparison, the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,299 at the moment, although you would get 512GB at that price. And of course, you can trade in a phone to Samsung to get a sizable discount from that price. But this deal on Google’s top phones is a straight-discount, with no trades required. These are tough deals to pass on. The Pixel 9 Pro series is as good as it gets for Android phones. Our review is still worth a look if you missed it all those months ago.
