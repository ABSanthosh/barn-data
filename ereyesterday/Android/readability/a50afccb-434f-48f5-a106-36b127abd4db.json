If you’ve just bought one, welcome to a world of endless creativity and innovation — but be prepared for the challenges that come with it. At first, the learning curve may seem steep, and there are mistakes 3D printing enthusiasts make when starting, but as you dive deeper into this technology, you'll become more familiar with essential aspects. Knowing what to expect beforehand can help you avoid frustration and set you up for success. I remember when I got my first 3D printer, there were various things I wished I had known before I started 3D printing, but with time, I got the hang of it and started creating functional prints. Before you start 3D printing, you should consider the following crucial things. Related 4 ways to choose the right type of 3D printer for you Not all 3D printers are alike, so here are things to think about when you're deciding what type you should buy 5 Consider buying one of the latest 3D printers that is fully assembled Pre-assembled 3D printers work out of the box with minimal setup If you haven't bought a 3D printer yet, I recommend considering getting one that comes fully assembled. One of the main frustrations that comes with 3D printers is setting them up and having them start working, especially if they come in different parts. I remember my first 3D printer with Anet A8, and it took my brother and me a whole weekend to get up and running. Even after that, it had many other issues, like improper wiring and misaligned components, that took time to diagnose. Currently, there are pre-assembled 3D printers that work directly out of the box without the hassle of complex assembly and calibration, and getting one will save you a lot of time. 4 You need to learn CAD software 3D model repository websites are not enough Even though there are many 3D printing websites where you can get files for 3D printing, like Thingiverse, Printables, and Myminifactory, they are not enough. You may not always find exactly what you need, or the 3D models you download may require modifications to suit your needs, and you will need to have skills at using 3D modeling programs. Learning 3D design will allow you to create unique and functional 3D models customized to your specifications. You can download any file and tweak it to your precise needs, and this will enhance your creativity and allow you to get the most out of 3D printing. Related 5 reasons your 3D prints keep failing (and how to fix them) If you're bothered by 3D print failures, these are some of the most common issues to look for 3 Be prepared for more failures than successes in the beginning 3D printing is a world of troubleshooting issues Even though nowadays, there are 3D printers that work directly out of the box, like Bambu 3D printers, and don't need many adjustments, you will still need to do some tinkering at one point. However, if you are using other versions of 3D printers, you should be ready to take some time to calibrate and tweak the settings in the slicer and the printer itself. You will need to level the bed properly, and this can be time-consuming if your 3D printer uses a manual bed-leveling technique. The first layer might fail to stick to the bed, and the frustration of clogged nozzles and shifting layers might test your patience. When I was getting started, my first print looked like spaghetti, and it was a frustrating experience. But I finally got it right after several attempts and searching for solutions online. So, you need to be prepared for failures, but the good news is that each failure will teach you something valuable about how your 3D printer operates. With time, you will learn how to fine-tune your settings, troubleshoot common issues, and optimize prints for better quality. Related 10 accessories you can 3D print for your home office Organize your setup with these cool and functional 3D prints 2 You will need upgrades and replacement components over time 3D printer parts wear with use While you might not need one immediately, you will realize you need one as you progress. I experienced clogs on my machine after 3D printing for a while, and I tried almost every method to unclog it. Even though it worked, I learned that buying a replacement would have been much better than trying to fix it because of the time it took. If you are struggling with bed adhesion, you will need to upgrade other parts, like the PEI spring sheet, and you can install a fan duct for proper cooling. If your 3D printer doesn't have an enclosure, you can get one, especially if you are 3D printing with materials like ABS that produce toxic fumes and are prone to warping. If your 3D printer doesn't have an auto-leveling feature, you can add sensors to avoid the frustrations of manual bed-leveling. You will need many upgrades and replacement parts, but they are worth it. Related 5 filaments that are better than PLA for serious 3D printing projects While PLA definitely fills the 3D printing needs for many projects, other filament materials are better for more serious projects 1 Use the right material and store it properly Define your specific needs and choose the most suitable material Each 3D printing filament has its use cases, and you need to define what you want to 3D print before deciding which filament to use. PLA or PETG are the best options for simple and functional models and prototypes. ABS is the best option for strong and durable parts that are heat-resistant. TPU filament, on the other hand, is great for 3D printing flexible parts because of its rubber-like properties. It's great for applications that require elasticity, like phone cases and shoe soles. You need to store 3D printer filaments in areas where they can't absorb moisture, as this can affect the print quality. I recommend using airtight containers with desiccants or using filament dryers. If you want to 3D print intricate and highly detailed files that require a smooth finish, using resins is better than filament, but you will need a resin 3D printer. The only challenge with resins is that they're messy, and you must wear gloves when working with them. You must also store them in UV-protected, sealed containers to prevent curing and contamination. Related 5 3D printing myths you should stop believing Plenty of myths surround 3D printing, from cost to required technical expertise. Let's debunk some of those Build a proper foundation in 3D printing When you learn the above five crucial things before you get into this fascinating hobby, the rest of your journey in 3D printing becomes smoother and enjoyable. You will also avoid the common pitfalls beginners encounter when getting started. Print failures are common in the early stages, and the frustrations may test your patience, but you won't compare that to the joy of finally achieving a perfect print. Take every failure as a learning experience to improve your skills, and soon, you will be mastering your 3D printer, and you will start enjoying the journey and producing high-quality 3D prints.",

assembled. One of the main frustrations that comes with 3D printers is setting them up and having them start working, especially if they come in different parts. I remember my first 3D printer with Anet A8, and it took my brother and me a whole weekend to get up and running. Even after that, it had many other issues, like improper wiring and misaligned components, that took time to diagnose. Currently, there are pre-assembled 3D printers that work directly out of the box without the hassle of complex assembly and calibration, and getting one will save you a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e

adjustments, you will still need to do some tinkering at one point. However, if you are using other versions of 3D printers, you should be ready to take some time to calibrate and tweak the settings in the slicer and the printer itself. You will need to level the bed properly, and this can be time-consuming if your 3D printer uses a manual bed-leveling technique. The first layer might fail to stick to the bed, and the frustration of clogged nozzles and shifting layers might test your patience.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was getting started, my first print looked like spaghetti, and it was a frustrating experience. But I finally got it right after several attempts and searching for solutions online. So, you need to be prepared for failures, but the good news is that each failure will teach you something valuable about how your 3D printer operates. With time, you will learn how to fine-tune your settings, troubleshoot common issues, and optimize prints for better quality.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n

If your 3D printer doesn\u0026#39;t have an enclosure, you can get one, especially if you are 3D printing with materials like ABS that produce toxic fumes and are prone to warping. If your 3D printer doesn\u0026#39;t have an auto-leveling feature, you can add sensors to avoid the frustrations of manual bed-leveling.

need to define what you want to 3D print before deciding which filament to use. PLA or PETG are the best options for simple and functional models and prototypes. ABS is the best option for strong and durable parts that are heat-resistant.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTPU filament, on the other hand, is great for 3D printing flexible parts because of its rubber-like properties. It\u0026#39;s great for applications that require elasticity, like phone cases and shoe soles. You need to store 3D printer filaments in areas where they can\u0026#39;t absorb moisture, as this can affect the print quality. I recommend using airtight containers with desiccants or using filament dryers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to 3D print intricate and highly detailed files that require a smooth finish, using resins is better than filament, but you will need a resin 3D printer. The only challenge with resins is that they\u0026#39;re messy, and you must wear gloves when working with them. You must also store them in UV-protected, sealed containers to prevent curing and contamination.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n
