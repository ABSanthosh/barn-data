  "text": "8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller $25 $30 Save $5 The 8BitDo Ultimate 2C delivers premium features at an affordable price. It includes two extra remappable buttons for quick in-game commands and uses Hall Effect tech to prevent stick drift for smooth, precise control. It connects wirelessly to gaming PCs via a 2.4 GHz USB dongle and works seamlessly with Android devices and media players via Bluetooth. If you're someone that loves to play games on their phone or tablet, a physical controller is going to be a pretty solid investment. Not only do you get more accurate controls, but nothing really beats the feel of holding a controller and mashing buttons. With that said, this one from 8BitDo is now down to its best price so far, with a small discount that drops it down to just $25 for a limited time. Related Best Bluetooth game controllers in 2025 Game wirelessly with these controllers What's great about the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C wireless controller? Source: 8BitDo When it comes to compatibility, you're getting a controller that can work with most Android devices and also Windows PCs as well. It can work using Bluetooth, or you can also use the included 2.4Ghz connector if your device permits it. The latter is going to provide a better connection, with up to 1000Hz polling rate, so we recommend going with that option if you can. The controller looks and feels good, offering a comfortable fit that houses the usual things you'll find on a controller, like a D-pad, buttons, triggers, and shoulder buttons. But 8BitDo takes things a step further, utilizing hall effect sticks and triggers to ensure you get the best experience that will last a long time. The controller even features extra bumpers on the rear that can be configured using the included software, which is great if you're looking for some customization. Overall, not a bad controller that's both robust in features but also highly affordable. Just be sure to grab it while it's still on sale.",

you\u0026#39;re getting a controller that can work with most Android devices and also Windows PCs as well. It can work using Bluetooth, or you can also use the included 2.4Ghz connector if your device permits it. The latter is going to provide a better connection, with up to 1000Hz polling rate, so we recommend going with that option if you can.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe controller looks and feels good, offering a comfortable fit that houses the usual things you\u0026#39;ll find on a controller, like a D-pad, buttons, triggers, and shoulder buttons. But 8BitDo takes things a step further, utilizing hall effect sticks and triggers to ensure you get the best experience that will last a long time.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe controller even features extra bumpers on the rear that can be configured using the included software, which is great if you\u0026#39;re looking for some customization. Overall, not a bad controller that\u0026#39;s both robust in features but also highly affordable.
