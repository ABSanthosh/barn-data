But when looking for the best Wi-Fi adapter for your computer, there's a ton of information to consider, depending on your existing network, what type of computer you have, and what you want to do with it. The decision is more complex if you have a Wi-Fi 7 router, because, of course, you'll want a compatible Wi-Fi adapter, but not every Wi-Fi 7 adapter works with every computer. Your old laptop or PC might have an old Wi-Fi standard, and you want to swap to something more recent, which is understandable, but you'll want to know which type of add-in card to get, or decide if you want to use a USB port for the upgrade. Related How to turn your Windows PC into a Wi-Fi hotspot If you have no wireless or uncovered areas on your network, you can turn your Windows PC into a hotspot. 5 What form factor do you need Do you need USB, PCIe, or M.2 to attach the adapter to your computer Depending on the computer you're buying the Wi-Fi adapter for, you might need one of three types. USB: The most compatible option, likely to need drivers installed and space around the USB port. PCIe: If you have a desktop PC with an older motherboard and a spare PCIe slot, you can use one of these cards. M.2: For most laptops and modern motherboards that have existing onboard Wi-Fi to upgrade. USB Wi-Fi adapters might not even need drivers as modern operating systems should be able to get them running as plug-and-play devices. They're easy to use, but you do lose the use of that USB port for other peripherals. Plus, they're generally slower and don't have as good range, as they only have a single antenna in them. Technically, PCIe and M.2 use the same protocol to connect, but the difference is whether the Wi-Fi adapter is a small 2230 M.2 card compatible with either Key E or Key A + E or if the smaller board is mounted on a PCIe x1 carrier board to use the main motherboard slots. Neither is a bad way to go, and it depends on the motherboard you're using, whether you have spare PCIe x1 slots available, or whether you prefer the hidden M.2 approach.

We tend to suggest upgrading to a mesh network for better coverage, but you can get a single router if your home doesn't need the expanded reach. But you'll absolutely need to decide on which Wi-Fi version you want that new router, and your new PC Wi-Fi adapter to use, so here's a quick rundown: Wi-Fi 6/6E: Otherwise known as Wireless-AX, Wi-Fi 6 uses the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands but aims to boost data speed, especially in crowded wireless environments. Wi-Fi 6E adds a third radio band in the 6GHz range that is faster but has a shorter range. It also brings better power handling and lower interference. Wi-Fi 7: This version also uses the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands and focuses on increasing speeds, efficiency, and latency across the network. It's up to twice the speed of Wi-Fi 6E per device, but it's also relatively new and the equipment is still expensive. For most people, Wi-Fi 6E is more than enough for now. The speeds and bandwidth available rival gigabit Ethernet speeds, and the 6GHz band ensures less interference from your neighbor's Wi-Fi signals. But early adopters will want Wi-Fi 7, even if they might have to upgrade again if better adapters come out or if Wi-Fi 8 makes an early appearance. Related 3 Compatibility with your PC Not every adapter will work with your CPU or operating system Wi-Fi versions are designed to be backward compatible, so the latest Wi-Fi standards can still work on equipment made for older Wi-Fi. But the signal is only one part of compatibility, and here's where it gets tricky. USB adapters are fine; they should work on any system, regardless of which CPU, motherboard, and other hardware is involved. That makes them great for quick fixes or as a backup option, but they're not great for long-term use. PCIe adapters on an x1 add-in card have only one thing you have to watch out for right now, and only with one Wi-Fi version. The bulk of Wi-Fi 7 adapters available right now are only compatible with Intel-based systems. The only Wi-Fi 7 adapters that are AMD-compatible are those from Qualcomm, and only a couple of companies make add-in cards using them. For Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, you can use any PCIe card in pretty much any PC. If you're upgrading the Wi-Fi adapter in a laptop, or the onboard Wi-Fi on a desktop motherboard, there is one other thing to look for. AMD and Intel motherboards and laptops can use M.2 PCIe Wi-Fi adapters. The tricky part is that many M.2 Wi-Fi adapters are made to Intel's CNVio or CNVio2 standard, which is only compatible with certain Intel CPUs. That's because the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hardware is actually on the CPU, and the M.2 card is simply the signaling and the RF components. If in doubt, get a Wi-Fi card that's PCIe only, like the Intel AX200 Wi-Fi 6 or AX210 Wi-Fi 6E, as these will have the best compatibility. Related 6 convincing reasons to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 (or Wi-Fi 6E) if you haven't already If you haven't been thinking about it already, maybe this is the year you upgrade your router to Wi-Fi 6. 2 If it needs drivers Some Wi-Fi adapters can work with Windows drivers, others need you to install a driver package Most PC hardware needs some level of driver installation to work, so it shouldn't be unsurprising to find Wi-Fi cards fit into this category as well. Except for USB Wi-Fi adapters these days, which, for the most part, use the generic Microsoft drivers when plugged in, so you can get Wi-Fi without having to download anything. Which is nice, because it means you can add internet connectivity to a device that doesn't have it, without needing a device with internet connectivity in the first place. For PCIe and M.2 adapters, you'll want to download the driver package before you start swapping the Wi-Fi cards, from whichever manufacturer the Wi-Fi adapter was from. Related How to update drivers in Windows 11 If you find that a peripheral attached to your PC isn't working right, or a part of your PC isn't working, you'll have to update the drivers. 1 If you want Bluetooth Most adapters have this onboard, but some don't if you prefer Wi-Fi only Bluetooth is pretty handy on modern computers. It is handled by a part of the in-built Wi-Fi adapter in motherboards or laptops. It's not always present in Wi-Fi adapters, though, with USB Wi-Fi not having enough space for the extra electronics needed. PCIe adapters often include it, but you need to snake a cable from the card to an internal USB header to use it, while M.2 Wi-Fi cards use one of the three sets of pins they're keyed with to handle Bluetooth over USB. It's always better to have it and not use it, than to find you want it but don't have the capability, and Wi-Fi adapters with Bluetooth built in are not really any different in price to those without. Related Best Bluetooth adapters for your PC in 2024 Want to add some extra wireless connectivity to your computer? It's an easy fix, with USB, M.2, and PCIe solutions. Upgrading your computer's Wi-Fi card is fairly simple, once you've got the correct card Adding a Wi-Fi adapter to your computer or upgrading the one that's already inside will bring increased convenience and faster download speeds. It might not bring any more range, though, as 2.4GHz is still king for longer-distance communications. 5GHz and 6GHz are shorter in range but make up for it in speeds. You don't need the latest Wi-Fi standard, either, as it's more expensive and you'll need to upgrade your router to get the most from it.",

the latest Wi-Fi standards can still work on equipment made for older Wi-Fi. But the signal is only one part of compatibility, and here\u0026#39;s where it gets tricky. USB adapters are fine; they should work on any system, regardless of which CPU, motherboard, and other hardware is involved. That makes them great for quick fixes or as a backup option, but they\u0026#39;re not great for long-term use.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePCIe adapters on an x1 add-in card \u003cspan\u003ehave only one thing you have to watch out for right now, and only with one Wi-Fi version. The bulk of Wi-Fi 7 adapters available right now are \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ecompatible with Intel-based systems\u003c/strong\u003e. The only Wi-Fi 7 adapters that are AMD-compatible are those from Qualcomm, and only a couple of companies make add-in cards using them. For Wi-Fi 6 or 6E,\u003c/span\u003e you can use any PCIe card in pretty much any PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re upgrading the Wi-Fi adapter in a laptop, or the onboard Wi-Fi on a desktop motherboard, there is one other thing to look for. AMD and Intel motherboards and laptops can use M.2 PCIe Wi-Fi adapters. The tricky part is that many M.2 Wi-Fi adapters are made to Intel\u0026#39;s CNVio or CNVio2 standard, which is only compatible with certain Intel CPUs. That\u0026#39;s because the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hardware is actually on the CPU, and the M.2 card is simply the signaling and the RF components. If in doubt, get a Wi-Fi card that\u0026#39;s PCIe only, like the Intel AX200 Wi-Fi 6 or AX210 Wi-Fi 6E, as these will have the best compatibility.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n

into this category as well. Except for USB Wi-Fi adapters these days, which, for the most part, use the generic Microsoft drivers when plugged in, so you can get Wi-Fi without having to download anything. Which is nice, because it means you can add internet connectivity to a device that doesn\u0026#39;t have it, without needing a device with internet connectivity in the first place. For PCIe and M.2 adapters, you\u0026#39;ll want to download the driver package before you start swapping the Wi-Fi cards, from whichever manufacturer the Wi-Fi adapter was from.\u003c/p\u003e

It is handled by a part of the in-built Wi-Fi adapter in motherboards or laptops. It\u0026#39;s not always present in Wi-Fi adapters, though, with USB Wi-Fi not having enough space for the extra electronics needed. PCIe adapters often include it, but you need to snake a cable from the card to an internal USB header to use it, while M.2 Wi-Fi cards use one of the three sets of pins they\u0026#39;re keyed with to handle Bluetooth over USB. It\u0026#39;s always better to have it and not use it, than to find you want it but don\u0026#39;t have the capability, and Wi-Fi adapters with Bluetooth built in are not really any different in price

It might not bring any more range, though, as 2.4GHz is still king for longer-distance communications. 5GHz and 6GHz are shorter in range but make up for it in speeds. You don\u0026#39;t need the latest Wi-Fi standard, either, as it\u0026#39;s more expensive and you\u0026#39;ll need to upgrade your router to get the most from it. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
