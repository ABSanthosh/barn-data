When it comes to smartphone designs, it's hard to argue against foldable phones being the most cutting-edge form factor that there is. You're allowed to be more concerned with aesthetics in that category, especially as they fight to reach a design that ensures ease of use on par with regular bar phones. The Oppo Find N5 released a few days ago, taking the crown as the thinnest foldable available. In fact, it's so thin that when closed, it rivals some popular bar phones in thickness. Despite that, it doesn't compromise on flagship specifications. Sadly, as what might be the best foldable ever, and despite a “global” launch, most people can't buy it. Even Europe Won't Be Getting the Oppo Find N5, Despite a Global Launch Image: Oppo When the Oppo Find N5 launched on February 20th, the OEM marketed it as a “global launch” event. That was a relief, since many times, some of the best phones in the world simply don't get the chance to make it out of China. While a lot of phones never get to North America, Europe tends to be a common stop for them. It seemed like that was going to be the case with Find N5, especially as the Oppo Find X8 Pro was just like that. The sad thing is, a statement that Oppo shared with The Tech Chap revealed a truth about the device's launch. Instead of the usual “global” launch pattern which breaks out of China into other Asian regions and Europe, this one is going to be a lot more limited than usual. Europe will not be included this time around, which is a big surprise, especially for a device as high profile as this one. Image: The Tech Chap The reason why isn't that clear, but according to Oppo, they've run the numbers and done market research and looked at the statistics; all that jazz. We can assume from that that the device simply wouldn't hit the numbers that they'd desire in Europe as a whole. This means that Europe will be getting the North American experience when it comes to highly-anticipated device launches. Sad stuff. Which Regions Will the Oppo Find N5 Launch In? Image: Oppo Quite obviously, we know that the Oppo Find N5 will be available in China, which will likely be its biggest market. However, its price in Singaporean Dollars was made clear, so it is easy to assume Singapore will be another region. Besides that, Oppo hasn't announced the other launch marktes for the phone, but we can assume that the rest will be Asian regions. It just seems that there was a better way that Opoo could have marketed the launch event, besides “global”. It just doesn't seem accurate enough given what we know now. What Global Foldables Can You Actually Get Your Hands On? Image: Samsung We expected to see the Oppo Find N5 followed up by the OnePlus Open 2, which would have certainly been available in North America and Europe. However, with OnePlus shocking us by putting its foldable plans on hold, that's not going to happen. If you want a global book-style foldable, there are few other options. The most notable is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is available almost everywhere on the globe. Accessibility has never been Samsung's problem. You can also opt for the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which isn't hard to get your hands on either. The only other major option that you can get outside Asia, is the Honor Magic V3, which is available in several European countries. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
