  "text": "OnePlus just announced its latest flagship tablet, the OnePlus Pad 3. It’s a powerhouse of a device, and if you’re interested, the OnePlus Pad 3 pre-order is now live, and it’s packed with solid perks. Place your order before July 15, and you’ll get to pick two free gifts from the following: OnePlus Pad 3 Smart Keyboard ($199.99 value) OnePlus Stylo 2 ($99.99 value) OnePlus Pad 3 Folio Case ($49.99 value) That’s up to $299 in freebies (or CA$399 in Canada). It’s not just a random bundle, either—you actually get to choose which accessories you want with your Pad 3, which is rare. There’s more. Students can stack an extra 10% off their order if they buy before July 31. And if you trade in an eligible device, OnePlus throws in a $100 (or CA$100) bonus, making the upgrade a little sweeter. Extra perks: Students: Save an extra 10% until July 31 Trade-in: Eligible device nets you a $100 (CA$100) bonus What you need to know about the OnePlus Pad 3 If you’re curious about the hardware, the OnePlus Pad 3 doesn’t hold back. The 13.2-inch display is crisp, with a 3.4K resolution and 12-bit color depth. It packs in a pixel density of 315 PPI and uses a 7:5 aspect ratio, so everything looks sharp, whether you’re streaming, working, or multitasking. Under the hood, you get the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s more than enough muscle for gaming, heavy multitasking, or just about anything you’d throw at a tablet. Battery life shouldn’t be an issue, either. The Pad 3 has a massive 12,140mAh battery that OnePlus says can handle long sessions—up to 17 hours of video or 6 hours of high-end gaming. When you need a top-up, 80W SUPERVOOC charging gets you back in action fast. Audio isn’t an afterthought. There are eight speakers on board (four woofers, four tweeters), so you’ll actually notice a difference when watching movies or playing music. Software-wise, it runs OxygenOS 15 out of the box. That means you get features like Gemini, Circle to Search, and a bunch of new AI tools like AI Writer and AI Summarize. Plus, OnePlus is promising three major Android updates and six years of security patches, which is way better than most Android tablets.",
