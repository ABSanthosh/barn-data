I used to consider Google Gemini to be an analog to Google Assistant, but as the months have gone by, it has become extremely clear how much of its own thing it is. Gemini brings the AI smarts of platforms like ChatGPT and Claude, and integrates it beautifully with the Google ecosystem, including Android. There are multiple models available to use, and the higher the number, the smarter it is and the more capabilities it possesses. In the case of Google Gemini, the best model that it has available in Gemini 2.5 Pro, but you have to pay to use that… Well, until today, as Google has just made it available for free users. Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Is Available to Use for Free on Desktop Image: Google I use AI tools here and there, primarily to replace lengthy Google searches when looking for an answer to a particular question. For me, Google Gemini was the easiest option to hop onto, thanks to its pretty seamless integration with my Android phone and Google apps and services. For the most part, it hasn't let me down in basic use, and that's enough for me to recommend it. About a week ago, Google announced its newest Gemini model, which is Gemini 2.5 Pro. It was cited as the “most intelligent AI model” from the tech giant, and for those who pay for Gemini Advanced, it was music to their ears as they instantly got access to it. Image: Google However, interestingly, less than a week after its launch, Google has decided to make its Gemini 2.5 Pro model available to all users, including those who don't pay a dime, and I think that's pretty cool. I'm not quite sure if Google plans to keep it free for an indefinite amount of time, or whether this is just some kind of scheme to get free users to try it out (and then eventually subscribe to Gemini Advanced). Either way, it's music to my ears. Gemini 2.5 Pro Has a Lot of Solid Capabilities One thing to keep in mind is that Gemini 2.5 Pro is in its experimental phase, which means it can't quite be called a finished product. However, that doesn't mean that you might run into issues using it, especially if your needs aren't too complex. However, despite being experimental, it brings a lot of exciting magic. Image: Ayomide Sadiq/Talk Android For one, Gemini 2.5 Pro will be able to show you its thinking process. This gives you some insight into how Gemini deconstructs the query that you send its way, which can be very useful if you're trying to refine your query structure or you're simply just interested in a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the logic system of AI chatbots. You also get the expected access to features like Extensions, file uploads, and Canvas—an interactive space for building essays, posts, and reports, and well-suited for coding tasks. Gemini 2.5 Pro is currently only free for desktop users, but it'll find its way to mobile soon. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
