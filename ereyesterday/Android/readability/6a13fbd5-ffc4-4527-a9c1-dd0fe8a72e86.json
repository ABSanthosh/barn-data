Compared to the original Gorilla Armor featured in the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the second-generation combines even better toughness with excellent clarity thanks to its anti-reflective properties, which \"dramatically reduce surface reflections in both indoor and outdoor ambient settings\", Corning says.

Compared to the original Gorilla Armor featured in the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the second-generation combines even better toughness with excellent clarity thanks to its anti-reflective properties, which \"dramatically reduce surface reflections in both indoor and outdoor ambient settings\", Corning says. Furthermore, the anti-reflective properties \"can enhance the display contrast ratio\", \"in various lighting conditions\". Gorilla Armor 2 is also \"over four times\" more scratch resistant compared to unnamed \"competitive lithium-aluminosilicate cover glasses with an anti-reflective coating\". In Corning's lab tests, Gorilla Armor 2 survived drops from up to 2.2m (7.2 feet) onto \"a surface replicating concrete\". The company says \"alternative ceramic glass materials\" failed even when dropped from 1m (3.2 feet), though it has failed to name those alternatives. Anyway, Gorilla Armor 2 is definitely very scratch and drop resistant, and on top of that also brings the anti-reflectivity. That's a great package in our book.
