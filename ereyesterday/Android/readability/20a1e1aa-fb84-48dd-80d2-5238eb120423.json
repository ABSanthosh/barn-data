One UI 7 is Samsung’s latest custom update to the Android 15 interface, building on what One UI 6 offered with new features. The final release should've been ready since July, but you can blame it on Google also delaying the Android 15 developer release. It makes sense for Samsung to need more time in fine-tuning One UI 7 for its Galaxy phones. On the bright side, a recent leak gives us a peek of what's to come. Major UI redesigns are coming to your screen According to Android Headlines, the first beta of One UI 7 is expected to come out before the end of the year, possibly this November. A stable version should be ready in 2025 with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. The blog has shared features we should expect from the new OS, redesigned icons.  Image: Mobile Wala Bhai on YouTube In a six second video, Samsung teases the interface with minor changes to icons that make them pop out, almost in a 3D-like way. You'll see these changes across the settings, Gallery, Camera, and more icons. It's all to give them sharper edges, so that you’ll know them at a glance. Another improvement is in AI Portrait Studio where you can now add effects to photos with just a tap. You can quickly switch between effects or filters as you edit and they'll show up right below the photo. This way, you can see exactly how they will look before you apply them. Samsung has also introduced a new Cloud app that pulls together all your backups. There are even more widgets. Pill-shaped animations appear at the bottom of your screen when you're charging, playing music, and receiving alarms or other notifications. Although the design hasn't changed much, it makes a world of difference from the previous interface where everything looked cramped. Image: Mobile Wala Bhai on YouTube The Quick Panel now has two pages, which many people aren't fond of. It basically defeats the purpose of having something quick to set with both notification panel and settings on different sides and still so many tiles. Hopefully, Samsung has made them more customizable, so that we can reduce all that visual noise. Added to these changes are fresh toggle buttons and an updated music player widget that shows an icon for Galaxy Buds when they’re connected. The sliders for adjusting brightness and volume are also adopting the pill design. Circle to search those tough homework questions If you're the parent often helping with homework, Samsung’s Circle to Search feature in One UI 7 is for you. It lets you quickly pull up explanations, videos, and resources on math, physics, and history. Now, you can guide your kids through tough questions without overworking your brain in trying to do the work for them. Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Speaking of kids, keep them safe online with Parental Controls. You’ll choose which websites and apps they’re allowed to open and block the ones you don’t want them using. You may also check their location to ensure they’re getting home safely from school or anywhere else.  Samsung is also improving the Sketch to Image feature to let you become a pro artist. Draw something, and your phone improves the finished picture with styles ranging from 3D Cartoon, Sketch, or Watercolor options. Finally, the Energy Score feature on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, Galaxy Watch 7, and Watch Ultra will help you see how your daily activities affect your health, as well as provide wellness tips.
