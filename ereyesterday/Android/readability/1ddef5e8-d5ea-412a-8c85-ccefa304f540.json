  "text": "The continued popularity of short-form video content over the past decade has proven to be a highly-lucrative field especially in a world that functions greatly via the internet, and it’s no surprise that social media platforms have continuously discovered ways to capitalize on this trend. READ: ByteDance reportedly working on AI smart glasses to rival Meta With that in mind, Meta recently announced the launch of Edits, a mobile-first video creation app designed to compete with the likes of ByteDance’s CapCut mobile editor. It’s feature packed with functions including extended camera capture (up to 10 minutes), support for a frame-accurate timeline, auto-enhancements, green screen effects, and even transitions. Meta adds that Edits also offers data-driven insights on factors affecting distribution, and supports direct sharing to platforms including Instagram and Facebook, with watermark-free exporting to other platforms. Additionally, Meta plans to add updates which will include keyframes, AI-powered modifications, collaboration tools, and expanded creative assets. Part of the company’s announcement reads: Today, we’re launching Edits, a new video creation app that helps you make great videos directly on your phone. If you’re passionate about making videos, Edits has the tools you need to support your creation process, all in one place. This is just the first step in making an app that helps you create your best videos, and we plan to keep evolving and improving Edits based on your feedback.",
