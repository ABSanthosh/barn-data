With CPU and GPU manufacturers steadily eroding what was once known as the budget segment, saving yourself money can be tempting by opting for the cheapest pre-built PC from Amazon that \"looks\" okay. This could, however, prove more trouble than it's worth. Building a gaming PC isn't for everyone, so many users turn to pre-builds for plug-and-play convenience, but many vendors count on fleecing uninformed buyers. With cheap pre-built PCs, you always run the risk of uncertainty, poor quality, overspending, minimal upgradability, and a lack of post-purchase support. The more you know about these risks, the better you can protect yourself against them when buying a pre-built gaming PC. Related Here's how to check if a PC will be good for gaming before you buy it Buying a prebuilt gaming PC without knowing your stuff can be disastrous. Here's how to go about doing it right. 6 You don't always know what you're getting (into) Press shuffle and prepare to be surprised One of the biggest yet surprising concerns when going pre-built is not knowing exactly what you're paying for. I'm talking about basic things like the complete specifications and product names of the components inside the PC you're about to spend your hard-earned money on. You might say that someone buying a pre-built machine doesn't know enough about PC components or isn't willing to get into the details, but the uncertainty can cost you dearly. Fortunately, the CPU and GPU are shown clearly on the product page of most of these PCs, but if you're curious to know which motherboard, RAM, SSD, PSU, or case the vendor is using for a particular build, you'll hardly get a squeak about that. This makes buying a pre-built the luck of the draw, where you hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Expecting to know what I'm getting is an essential condition when buying anything. Even if you choose to go with a better-known PC builder like CyberPowerPC or Skytech on Amazon, you can't expect to get every single piece of info about the internal components of the PC. The vendor might be using an 80+ Gold PSU, Gen4 NVMe, or decently-specced RAM, but the problem is that you don't know with certainty if that will be the case before you actually buy the thing. Related Always answer these 6 questions before choosing a prebuilt gaming PC Choosing your ideal prebuilt gaming PC isn't hard at all if you can answer these 6 questions honestly 5 The component quality is usually bad That's why they're hiding it Most vendors don't like to be transparent about the components they're using inside their machines because the stuff isn't the best. No one will recommend an off-brand power supply, no-name SSD, or feature-deprived mini-ITX motherboard on a $700-$800 build, which you get in many pre-builds to date. Just spend 10 minutes on Amazon browsing sub-$1000 pre-builds, and you'll struggle to find the RAM speed, SSD specs, motherboard chipset, or even the PSU wattage in some cases. The pre-built PC business hinges on sourcing cheap and often poor-quality components in bulk and marking up the machine's price, essentially selling you sub-par hardware for a premium. Not all vendors do this, of course, and the biggest pre-build players offer decent value. Still, consumers looking for budget gaming PCs on Amazon and similar marketplaces get taken for a ride by companies you would never have heard of. If you're choosing the convenience of a pre-build over the benefits of a custom PC, you aren't signing away your right to get your money's worth, are you? That's exactly what cheap pre-build vendors assume you're doing when they configure sub-par PCs masquerading as powerful gaming rigs. Related Build this 4K-ready gaming PC instead of buying a $700 PS5 Pro The PS5 Pro boasts some massive improvements. Can a similarly priced gaming PC compare? 4 Misleading product names can trick you into overspending Want a Core i7? Oh, it's a 4th Gen, by the way Oh, I love to talk about this scam. Somehow, even in 2025, pre-built PC vendors are allowed to trick consumers by providing incomplete or completely false component names. For instance, you'll easily find machines with Intel Core i7 and 16GB RAM listed proudly in the product title and even in the product details, but dig deeper, and you might just find that it has an antique Core i7-4770 and DDR3 RAM — on a $500+ gaming PC. These product listings also make unbelievable claims, such as 60+ FPS performance in games like Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring, and The Division 2. I challenge anyone to get that kind of performance on a Core i7-4770 and RX 580 without using the absolute worst in-game settings possible. These cheap PCs somehow have near-perfect reviews praising the performance and quality of the machines. I don't know if these are paid reviews or if there still are gullible buyers thinking they're buying great PCs for their money. You have a better chance of getting fair value for your money by buying a used PC on Facebook Marketplace or eBay than from these scummy Amazon vendors. Not all buyers will know how to find the actual components being used on a pre-built PC (the vendors make the info hard to find anyway), so the chances of overspending remain high for our less tech-savvy friends. Related 5 ways to protect yourself before buying used PC parts Buying used PC products seems scary for a newcomer. But you can minimize your risk by following these tips. 3 Post-purchase service and warranty might be non-existent Hope nothing goes wrong with your PC Someone buying a pre-built gaming PC instead of building one themselves is likely to rate post-purchase support quite high on their priority list. While most pre-built vendors offer at least a 1-year warranty on the product page, you don't know what kind of support you'll get if anything goes wrong with your PC. The vendor might ask you to ship the PC or the faulty component to them at your own expense, or worse, they might not even respond to your queries. Some vendors don't even list any warranty information on the product page, and Amazon recommends asking the seller directly about it. This doesn't exactly fill a prospective buyer with confidence when purchasing a gaming machine, irrespective of whether it costs $500 or $1000. Also, post-purchase support isn't limited to warranty; a customer also needs a way to contact the brand regarding doubts about the functioning of the PC. And this is a big question mark when buying from unknown sellers on Amazon. Related 2 You might not be able to upgrade it the way you want Artificially limited compatibility is a major challenge This might not be a big concern to many pre-built shoppers since they're looking for a gaming rig that just works and have no intentions of making any hardware changes to it. However, if you're someone who wants the option to upgrade the power supply, storage, or CPU cooler, you might be limited by a proprietary motherboard or case that isn't compatible with standard components. Many pre-build vendors do this to limit flexibility when you want to upgrade any component of your PC so that you're forced to reach out to them for said upgrade. Other components, such as the CPU, GPU, and RAM, might be standard, but most pre-build shoppers will hardly think of replacing the CPU or GPU on their PC, preferring to buy another pre-built years later instead. Related How long should you wait between PC upgrades? Let's (try to) answer the age-old question: how many years should you wait before upgrading your gaming PC? 1 You can often build a better PC for the same price And smoke the cheap pre-build to oblivion You have probably heard it already — building a PC yourself is often cheaper than buying a comparable pre-built one. This is because pre-build vendors add the build fee, marketing costs, OS license costs, and other overheads to the price they charge consumers. Building a PC yourself eliminates each of these costs (even the OS license if you don't activate it). However, even after adding all the overheads, many pre-build vendors offer objectively terrible value for the price. I've already mentioned how some vendors outfit their PCs with generations-old hardware and sub-par components to increase their margins. By doing some research and choosing your own components for your gaming rig, you can ensure you aren't getting duped. Besides, you'll be able to build a much more powerful PC for the same price as that of a pre-built PC. For instance, CyberPowerPC offers a Ryzen 5 5500 and Radeon RX 6400 (ouch) build for $650 on Amazon. You can easily build a Ryzen 5 5600 and RX 6800 build with a much better SSD, RAM, motherboard, and power supply for around $700 and easily crush anything the CyberPowerPC can do. You can even get help with the assembly process from a friend or reliable service provider if you aren't confident enough. Related Here's how to build yourself a killer PC with old and used parts Scouring for bargain deals and putting together a killer PC is almost a lost art If you're going the pre-build route, avoid the cheapest options In a nutshell, if you have a budget of $500 to $1,000, I would suggest avoiding a pre-built gaming PC and going custom instead. This segment doesn't offer good enough value, and you run the risk of getting poor-quality and outdated components. You can easily beat a pre-built PC in this price range by building a custom PC yourself, with help from friends or professionals if needed. If, on the other hand, you can spare around $1,500-$1,800 for a PC, the pre-built option is much more favorable. That said, going custom will still be better from a price-to-performance standpoint, but at least the pre-built PCs in this range fare much better on the factors we discussed in the article.

I\u0026#39;m talking about basic things like the complete specifications and product names of the components inside the PC you\u0026#39;re about to spend your hard-earned money on. You might say that someone buying a pre-built machine doesn\u0026#39;t know enough about PC components or isn\u0026#39;t willing to get into the details, but the uncertainty can cost you dearly.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/match-cpu-and-gpu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCPU and GPU\u003c/a\u003e are shown clearly on the product page of most of these PCs, but if you\u0026#39;re curious to know which motherboard, RAM, SSD, PSU, or case the vendor is using for a particular build, you\u0026#39;ll hardly get a squeak about that. This makes buying a pre-built the luck of the draw, where you hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Expecting to know what I\u0026#39;m getting is an essential condition when buying anything.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEven if you choose to go with a better-known PC builder like CyberPowerPC or Skytech on Amazon, you can\u0026#39;t expect to get every single piece of info about the internal components of the PC. The vendor might be using an 80+ Gold PSU, Gen4 NVMe, or decently-specced RAM, but the problem is that you don\u0026#39;t know with certainty if that will be the case before you actually buy the

Somehow, even in 2025, pre-built PC vendors are allowed to trick consumers by providing incomplete or completely false component names. For instance, you\u0026#39;ll easily find machines with Intel Core i7 and 16GB RAM listed proudly in the product title and even in the product details, but dig deeper, and you might just find that it has an antique Core i7-4770 and DDR3 RAM — on a $500+ gaming PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThese product listings also make unbelievable claims, such as 60+ FPS performance in games like \u003cem\u003eHogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eThe Division 2\u003c/em\u003e. I challenge anyone to get that kind of performance on a Core i7-4770 and RX 580 without using the absolute worst in-game settings possible. These cheap PCs somehow have near-perfect reviews praising the performance and quality of the machines. I don\u0026#39;t know if these are paid reviews or if there still are gullible buyers thinking they\u0026#39;re buying great PCs for their money.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou have a better chance of getting fair value for your money by buying a used PC on Facebook Marketplace or eBay than from these scummy Amazon vendors. Not all buyers will know how to find the actual components being used on a pre-built PC (the vendors make the info hard to find anyway), so the chances of overspending remain high for our less

While most pre-built vendors offer at least a 1-year warranty on the product page, you don\u0026#39;t know what kind of support you\u0026#39;ll get if anything goes wrong with your PC. The vendor might ask you to ship the PC or the faulty component to them at your own expense, or worse, they might not even respond to your queries.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSome vendors don\u0026#39;t even list any warranty information on the product page, and Amazon recommends asking the seller directly about it. This doesn\u0026#39;t exactly fill a prospective buyer with confidence when purchasing a gaming machine, irrespective of whether it costs $500 or $1000. Also, post-purchase support isn\u0026#39;t limited to warranty; a customer also needs a way to contact the brand regarding doubts about the functioning of the PC.

\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou have probably heard it already — building a PC yourself is often cheaper than buying a comparable pre-built one. This is because pre-build vendors add the build fee, marketing costs, OS license costs, and other overheads to the price they charge consumers. Building a PC yourself eliminates each of these costs (even the OS license if you don\u0026#39;t activate it). However, even after adding all the overheads, many pre-build vendors offer objectively terrible value for the price.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve already mentioned how some vendors outfit their PCs with generations-old hardware and sub-par components to increase their margins. By doing some research and choosing your own components for your gaming rig, you can ensure you aren\u0026#39;t getting duped. Besides, you\u0026#39;ll be able to build a much more powerful PC for the same price as that of a pre-built PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, CyberPowerPC offers a Ryzen 5 5500 and Radeon RX 6400 (ouch) build for $650 on Amazon. You can easily build a Ryzen 5 5600 and RX 6800 build with a much better SSD, RAM, motherboard, and power supply for around $700 and easily crush anything the CyberPowerPC can do. You can even get help with the assembly process from a friend or reliable service provider if you aren\u0026#39;t confident enough.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n

This segment doesn\u0026#39;t offer good enough value, and you run the risk of getting poor-quality and outdated components. You can easily beat a pre-built PC in this price range by building a custom PC yourself, with help from friends or professionals if needed.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf, on the other hand, you can spare around $1,500-$1,800 for a PC, the pre-built option is much more favorable.
