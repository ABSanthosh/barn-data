The fourth update essentially means that developer APIs as well as app-facing behavior are in their final phase. READ: Android adds auto reboot after 3 days of inactivity With that being said, it looks like we’re on track for Android 16’s big launch in June, a much earlier shift versus previous versions of Android which usually launched during the fall. Google adds that Beta 4 is available to install on supported Pixel devices enrolled in the beta program, including the newly-launched Pixel 9a. In addition to Google’s own Pixel handsets, several models from Android phone brands including Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, vivo, and Xiaomi will be compatible with the Android 16 Beta 4 update. For developers, this also means that all the latest optimizations for Android 16 are available with the update, allowing them to complete their app testing.",
