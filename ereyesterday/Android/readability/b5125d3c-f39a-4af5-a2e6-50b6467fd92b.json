  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account With so many different phone carriers to choose from, it can be hard to make a decision based on which one is the best, solely based on performance and coverage alone. The reality is that most major carriers are pretty neck and neck, with the only real differences being the additional perks and discounts that each one offers. Related 3 reasons your 'unlimited' plan isn't really unlimited Your unlimited plan is only unlimited until your carrier decides it is not T-Mobile has had a pretty good 2025 so far, ushering in a large number of new subscribers, while others have managed to struggle and lose customers. And it appears that the brand is poised to be in an even stronger position as it just announced its plans to roll out its T-Satellite service starting on July 23. T-Satellite is finally here T-Mobile's satellite journey started back in 2022, with the announcement of a partnership with SpaceX. And while the service has been in testing for some time, things are now going official, with the carrier touting new connectivity in previously areas where it wasn't even possible. This new network will allow devices to connect to satellite networks without the need for special equipment. So long as you have a phone that was made in the past few years, you'll be able to utilize this new network. As far as what to expect when this goes live for everyone, well, you'll have the ability to SMS using both Android and iOS devices. Android devices will have a small leg up, with the ability to send MMS and audio clips as well. According to T-Mobile, these features will also roll out to iOS devices as well. Perhaps more exciting is that on October 1, 2025, data services will also be available for use over satellite as well. That last part is huge because data is such an important part of the mobile experience today. Those on the Experience Beyond plan will have this service included. Those that aren't on that plan can pay $10/month to gain access to the satellite service. It's really going to depend on your use, but if you're someone that goes into remote areas, we recommend having this service as a part of your plan. In addition, T-Mobile is also giving away a year of DashPass by DoorDash. This perk is going to be available to customers starting on July 8, and will be a promotion that goes live via the T-Life app on T-Mobile Tuesdays. DashPass will provide $0 delivery fees on DoorDash orders, along with discounts on deliveries from other supported stores. So if you're interested, be sure to download the T-Life app and access the perk when it goes live next month.",

lose customers. And it appears that the brand is poised to be in an even stronger position as it \u003ca href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/best-network-in-america?norewrite=UUapUeUpU1028601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejust announced\u003c/a\u003e its plans to roll out its T-Satellite service starting on July 23. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"t-satellite-is-finally-here\"\u003e\n                        T-Satellite is finally here\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eT-Mobile\u0026#39;s satellite journey started back in 2022, with the announcement of a partnership with SpaceX. And while the service has been in testing for some time, things are now going official, with the carrier touting new connectivity in previously areas where it wasn\u0026#39;t even possible. This new network will allow devices to connect to satellite networks without the need for special equipment. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSo long as you have a phone that was made in the past few years, you\u0026#39;ll be able to utilize this new network. As far as what to expect when this goes live for everyone, well, you\u0026#39;ll have the ability to SMS using both Android and iOS devices. Android devices will have a small leg up, with the ability to send MMS and audio clips as well. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAccording to T-Mobile, these features will also roll out to iOS devices as well. Perhaps more exciting is that on October 1, 2025, data services will also be available for use over satellite as well. That last part is huge because data is such an important part of the mobile experience today. Those on the Experience Beyond plan will have this service included.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThose that aren\u0026#39;t on that plan can pay $10/month to gain access to the satellite service. It\u0026#39;s really going to depend on your use, but if you\u0026#39;re someone that goes into remote areas, we recommend having this service as a part of your plan. In addition, T-Mobile is also giving away a year of DashPass by DoorDash. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis perk is going to be available to customers starting on July 8, and will be a promotion that goes live via the T-Life app on T-Mobile Tuesdays. DashPass will provide $0 delivery fees on DoorDash orders, along with discounts on deliveries from other supported stores. So if you\u0026#39;re interested, be sure to download the T-Life app and access the perk when it goes live next month. \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
