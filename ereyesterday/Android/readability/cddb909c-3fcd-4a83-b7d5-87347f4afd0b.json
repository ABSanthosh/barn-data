  "text": "Not too long ago, OnePlus unveiled the OnePlus Pad 2 Pro in China, which packed a pretty impressive set of hardware and software features. One caveat with the tablet however is that it’s exclusive for Chinese markets, but OnePlus is now bringing over the tablet to global markets as the OnePlus Pad 3, set to launch on June 5. READ: OnePlus Pad 2 Pro debuts with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 3.4K display It should be noted though that this is different from the China variant of the OnePlus Pad 3 which was launched late last year. As such, the “Western” OnePlus Pad 3 comes with the same specs as the Pad 2 Pro, including a large 13.2-inch 3.4K display (3392 x 2400) with a variable 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision, and up to 900 nits of brightness, as well as the Snapdragon 8 Elite with 8GB, 12GB/16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 256GB/512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. As for software, we might see Oxygen OS instead of ColorOS as on the Chinese version, although it’s likely that the OnePlus Pad 3 will also feature the same 12,140 mAh cell with 67W charging. No word on pricing yet, as it’s unlikely that OnePlus will do a direct price conversion for different markets. In any case, we’re bound to know everything once the company holds its launch event on June 5th.",
