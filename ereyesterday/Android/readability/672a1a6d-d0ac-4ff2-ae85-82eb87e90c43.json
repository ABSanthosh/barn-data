  "text": "Summary Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge to be unveiled on May 12th at 8 PM ET with a virtual event. Leaks suggest Samsung is pairing its ultra-slim design with a 200MP main sensor, Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a relatively small battery. You can save $50 now by reserving your unit, no strings attached. The Galaxy S25 series might've launched a few months ago — I myself was in attendance during Samsung's San Jose-based blowout — but the newest member of the family has, as of writing, not yet appeared on store shelves. In fact, despite a post-credits tease that would make Kevin Feige smile, the ultra-slim Galaxy S25 Edge has yet to appear outside of various closed events. Well, after months of waiting and an unofficial delay, Samsung's finally ready to show off the Edge in all its glory, and you won't have to wait too long. Rather than hold yet another Galaxy Unpacked between the S25 launch and, presumably, a foldable-centric event this summer, Samsung is throwing it back to the pandemic era with a virtual launch for the Edge. The company will stream its announcement — where, presumably, the Edge will finally be detailed in all its glory — on Monday, May 12th at 8 PM ET. You'll be able to find the stream on Samsung's YouTube channel. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is set to be unveiled on May 12th, and you can save $50 now by reserving your smartphone ahead of time, absolutely free. Months after its initial announcement, the Galaxy S25 Edge remains a mystery Unless you've been keeping up with the many, many leaks Or, you know, you could just read through all of the various leaks that have filled websites like ours for the past few months. In addition to what we know about the S25 Edge — it's slim, it's got two cameras, it's reviving the \"Edge\" brand Samsung used for a couple of years in the mid-2010s — leaked spec sheets have pointed towards a 200MP main sensor, a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12GB of RAM, and, unfortunately, a measly 3,900mAh battery powering the whole thing. I'm not going to try to predict whether this might deliver a good or bad experience, even if that battery size is undoubtedly concerning. Frankly, this first-gen Edge — no matter what the \"S25\" in its name implies — is bound to feel like a first-gen product, and without something like a carbon silicon battery packed inside, this ultra-slim chassis is going to come at a cost. There's a reason Samsung is launching this phone later than the rest of its family, and that's because it's going to appeal to early adopters and not much else. For its part, Samsung is referring to this launch as \"more than a slim smartphone,\" promoting the device as \"setting a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone\" while also bringing about a \"new era of growth for the mobile industry.\" So, you know, maybe you should forget what I said above and buy into the hype. Either way, we'll find out together on May 12th. Not that you have to wait until next Monday if you're exciting for the Edge. Right now, you can head over to Samsung's website to reserve your own phone. Handing over your email address nets you a $50 credit for your eventual preorder. These bonuses usually only stick around up through the actual airing of Unpacked, so if you're remotely interested in picking up the Galaxy S25 Edge at launch, make sure you click the link below to get your coupon.

In addition to what we \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e about the S25 Edge — it\u0026#39;s slim, it\u0026#39;s got two cameras, it\u0026#39;s reviving the \u0026#34;Edge\u0026#34; brand Samsung used for a couple of years in the mid-2010s — \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leak-spills-details-waiting-for/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eleaked spec sheets\u003c/a\u003e have pointed towards a 200MP main sensor, a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12GB of RAM, and, unfortunately, a measly 3,900mAh battery powering the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m not going to try to predict whether this might deliver a good or bad experience, even if that battery size is undoubtedly concerning. Frankly, this first-gen Edge — no matter what the \u0026#34;S25\u0026#34; in its name implies — is bound to feel like a first-gen product, and without something like a carbon silicon battery packed inside, this ultra-slim chassis is going to come at a cost. There\u0026#39;s a reason Samsung is launching this phone later than the rest of its family, and that\u0026#39;s because it\u0026#39;s going to appeal to early adopters and not much else.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor its part, Samsung is referring to this launch as \u0026#34;more than a slim smartphone,\u0026#34; promoting the device as \u0026#34;setting a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone\u0026#34; while also bringing about a \u0026#34;new era of growth for the mobile industry.\u0026#34; So, you know, maybe you should forget what I said above and buy into the hype. Either way, we\u0026#39;ll find out together on May 12th.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNot that you have to wait until next Monday if you\u0026#39;re exciting for the Edge. Right now, you can head over to Samsung\u0026#39;s website to reserve your own phone. Handing over your email address nets you a $50 credit for your eventual preorder.
