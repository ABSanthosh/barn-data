As one of the big three carriers in the United States, Verizon gets a lot of respect from consumers. In fact, it is literally the largest mobile carrier in the country, so it has a very unique position compared to the competition. However, it seems that it is using that unique position in the worst possible way. Verizon has just announced another price hike. Yes, there was a price hike just last month. If you're insuring your smartphones through Verizon Protect and you have four or more devices on the plan, you're about to see a pretty substantial price increase. It might not make the plan worth it any longer. Verizon Protect's New Pricing for Multi-Device Plans Will Cost You $8 More Each Month Image: Verizon Smartphones are expensive, and smartphones are fragile. Those are the only two reasons you need to convince yourself to put a case and a screen protector on your smartphone. However, if you prefer a naked device, or you want extra protection on top of the protection you've already put on your phone, an insurance plan, such as Verizon Protect, can be incredibly helpful. Verizon Mobile Protect provides a way to pay a monthly premium to insure your device against any damage that might occur, and if you have more than one device to protect, you can bundle all of them under one plan for a discounted price. Unfortunately for you, if you're insuring four or more lines, you're about to see a price hike courtesy of Verizon. Currently, users who have anywhere from 4 to 20 lines that they want to enroll in the plan will only pay $60 a month. However, with this change, that goes up to $68 a month. That's an $8, or a 13.3%, price hike. The pricing for users with one, two, or three lines on Verizon Protect will remain the same as before, so at least there's that. This Price Hike Will Take Effect on March 27th, 2025 Image: Verizon The good thing is that you won't need to worry about the extra $8 on your bill just yet. However, there isn't that much time left. Starting on March 27th, 2025, the new pricing will take effect. This is annoying, since Verizon just recently introduced another price hike for multi-line users. If you're on a multi-device Verizon Mobile Protect plan with at least four devices, you need to ask yourself whether it continues to be worth it under the new pricing, or whether it is time to find an alternative. Here Are Other Protection Options You Can Consider for Your Smartphone Image: Talk Android The good thing is that Verizon Protect will never be the only option for protecting your phone (though it might still be the most cost-effective if you have more than four devices on the plan). If you have a Samsung smartphone, there's Samsung Care, which comes with numerous protection tiers. The only problem there is that you have to have signed up soon after buying the phone. That's the same story if you want to get AppleCare. It has to come soon after getting the new device. Of course, there are third-party options like Progressive and Allstate. And if you want to keep it in the family with Verizon, its Verizon Phone Protection plan offers basic protection for just about $8 per device. That could potentially be more your speed.
