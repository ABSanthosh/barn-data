OnePlus has quickly rolled out its Android 15-based OxygenOS 15 update for the OnePlus 12. They skipped the beta stage in some areas, including North America and India. The update is now available worldwide OxygenOS 15 brings AI tools, smoother animations, and the Open Canva feature that was only on the OnePlus Open before. However, not all AI features are in this first release but will be added over November. You also get a refreshed interface with updated icons, rounded corners, and themes.  Refreshed features on rushed OxygenOS 15 update  OnePlus was set to release OxygenOS 15 on October 24th last month. But it seems competitive pressure has pushed them to launch the update faster. With Google Pixel and Vivo phones already receiving it, there's no time to waste. We won't get to experience some advanced features just yet until later in the month. However, the update still brings a lot of exciting changes.  The team has been working tirelessly to ensure our users across the globe can try out OxygenOS 15 as quickly as possible. Now I am thrilled to share that we have started the global rollout of OxygenOS 15 one week earlier than previously anticipated. The rollout begins TODAY across IN/NA/EU/GLO regions and will continue to reach more users in batches throughout this week. We’ll keep you posted on progress in this thread. OnePlus Image: OnePlus For starters, updated icons and rounded corners give the Home screen and system a sharper, cleaner look. Another welcomed feature is Open Canvas, a multitasking tool that lets you open up to three apps on the same screen, showing each app in either full or compact size. The Canvas was most useful and natural on the OnePlus Open's wide, foldable display. Now that it's rolling out to regular non-foldable phones, the experience will be a bit different.  More control and a 6GB Patience test There are new customizable themes and gestures that apply to the Home screen, lock screen, and Always-On Display. Swipe down on a notification banner and you'll open a small floating window for the app. If you want it bigger, swipe down again. To close it, swipe up, and to hide it, swipe sideways. For Split View, you can resize the windows by dragging a divider between them or tapping on it to make the display area larger.  Image: OnePlus The Fluid Cloud now allows information to update in real-time. When you tap on alerts, they expand into detailed cards that show more information. Charging has improved, as the limit keeps the battery at 80% for longer life. If your phone stays plugged in for too long, it will stop charging once it reaches that amount. Holo Audio also boosts sound quality for your online calls and meetings. In photo editing, you can save the changes you made to a picture and apply them again later. So, you don't have to start over each time. OnePlus cares about your privacy and security. That's why OxygenOS 15 now introduces a new safety hub where you'll control privacy settings and use the Private Safe feature. It keeps your personal data and apps secure, although it's unclear how. We'll know more about it in the future.  Image: OnePlus Community There’s a new Two-Tone theme that changes the look of the Quick Settings menu and the Settings app icon to make them appear in black. Already, some users in the EU have started receiving the stable version 15.0.0.204 (C.53) and seeing these changes. It's a heavy one around 6GB, so you'll need a stable internet connection.   Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
