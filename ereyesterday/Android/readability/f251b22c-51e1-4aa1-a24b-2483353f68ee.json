Oppo Find X8Sure, it's no Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge or iPhone 17 Air, but it's probably going to be thin enough for most people. Let's not forget that the phone is rumored to pack a 50 MP main rear camera with a 1/1.56\" sensor and OIS, a 50 MP ultrawide, and a 50 MP periscope camera with 3.5x optical zoom. The Find X8 Mini should employ a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED flat screen with 1,216 x 2,640 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate, an optical in-display fingerprint sensor, and it will be powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 SoC. OnePlus could be releasing a version of this phone under its own name in the coming months. Source (in Chinese)",
