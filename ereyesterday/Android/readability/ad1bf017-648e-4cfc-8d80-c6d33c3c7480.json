There are, however, two catches. The first one is that you can't do this in the EU, UK, and India, for some reason. The biggest catch is that you can only migrate purchases from a secondary account to a primary account. The primary account is the one signed into iCloud and most other features, and the secondary one, if you have it, is the one you use for what Apple describes as \"Media and Purchases\".

If all of this sounds incredibly (and, dare we say it, needlessly) convoluted, that's because it is. Apple's account management has always had strange restrictions and while it is now relaxing one of those, there are plenty more still there. The procedure for migration is also incredibly convoluted (what did you expect?). If you're interested, and are in the very specific situation that allows for it (having two Apple accounts, a main one for iCloud and a secondary one for purchases), make sure you go through all of the steps detailed at the Source linked below. Fair warning, though - there are a lot of steps and prerequisites and such. Source",
