There are plenty of toys and plushies inspired by the character, but wouldn’t it be awesome if you had one that could walk and talk? That’s what Disney and Pixar have done, where in a collaboration with Robosen, they have launched a Buzz Lightyear robot toy. The Buzz Lightyear robot toy stands 14.6-inches tall and weighs 3.7 pounds, so it is not a small or light toy by any means. It also features over 3,000 parts that helps provide more lifelike movements, along with 23 servo motors that enable a full-range of motion, along with facial expressions. There are also 75 microchips that help power the various interactive features that users can look forward to. The robot comes with an accompanying app. This app allows users to control the robot and “play” with it by taking it on pre-built missions. They can also create their own custom scenarios using the Robosen Studio. There will also be support for voice control, so you can talk to Buzz if that’s always something you’ve wanted to do. It’s actually a pretty cool toy and it’s perfect for students and kids who want to try their hand creating custom scenarios. It’s also perfect for collectors who want a more interactive Buzz Lightyear toy. That being said, it won’t come cheap. It is priced at $599 and you can actually purchase it from Robosen’s website or the Disney Store. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Writer of tech with over a decade of experience. Juggles between using a Mac and Windows PC, switches between iOS and Android, believes in the best of both worlds.
