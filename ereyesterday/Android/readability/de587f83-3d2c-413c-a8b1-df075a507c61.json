  "text": "As far as smart security cams are concerned, the Wyze Cam V4 doesn’t do much to break the mold—in fact, it comes with a lot of the same features seen on the other security cameras, such as two-way audio communication, IP65 dust and water resistance, 2K video recording capabilities, and even colour night vision footage. So what makes it special, exactly? Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) Well, the Wyze Cam V4’s biggest strength is its price—while it’s usually priced at below $40, it’s on sale right now for less than $30, making it less than half the price of competing devices like the Google Nest Cam, for example. It’s also compatible with both Google Home and Alexa software, so you’re pretty much covered on all fronts with this one.
