With that in mind, the brand recently announced its latest addition to its product lineup with the AYANEO Gaming Pad, which runs on Android, as well as a new dedicated Snapdragon chip (which we’ll talk about later). READ: The Future of Android Gaming: What to Look Forward To The AYANEO Gaming Pad comes in a sleek-looking design which combines a metal frame and a glass front and back, with the rear showing a bit of the device’s internals. The device’s main highlight is its 8.3-inch LCD display, which manages to look sharp thanks to the 1440p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. There’s also a cooling system and a large battery inside, although AYANEO hasn’t specified the latter’s capacity. Going back to its chipset, the AYANEO Gaming Pad is powered by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3. Part of a trio of new chips alongside the G2 Gen 2 and G1 Gen 1, Qualcomm states that the G3 Gen 3 offers a 30% improvement in CPU performance and a 28% boost in GPU performance, and includes baked-in gaming features like Snapdragon Game Super Resolution and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Other features include a dual-camera setup with  a 50MP main camera and a 13MP ultra-wide camera, a 5MP selfie camera, a six-axis gyroscope for motion controls, as well as a quad speaker setup. AYANEO hasn’t specified a release date or pricing at the moment, however.",
