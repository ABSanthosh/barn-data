With that said, it looks like new details now add a bit more as to what we can expect from the Pixel 9a’s camera. Recent info from the folks over at Android Headlines (which has consistently been pumping out 9a leaks) predict that the phone will ditch the 64-megapixel main sensor seen on the Pixel 8a and 7a. Instead, Google’s 2025 midranger will feature the same 48-megapixel main camera from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which features a physically larger sensor. READ: Android 16 could come much earlier than expected The 9a will also come with newer camera features, such as Google’s “Add me” feature which stitches group photos to include all subjects (including the person taking the photo) in a single shot. Other leaks claim that Google will announce the Pixel 9a as early as March 2025, a couple of months earlier than the usual launch window for its A-series devices. It can be remembered that the Pixel 8a and 7a were both announced during May, but given that Google’s flagship phones have moved to a new launch schedule, it’s a bit unsurprising to see this change.
