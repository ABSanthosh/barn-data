And that would make sense since the Fold line is the more enthusiast-focused of Samsung's foldables, whereas the Flips are more mass-market oriented and style-focused. So if this wild speculation of ours pans out, it might be that the company doesn't want to offend the enthusiasts with its choice. The Exynos 2500 was supposed to debut in the Galaxy S25 series in January, but the yield problems encountered so far have meant Samsung had to switch to Qualcomm for those models, the report goes on to state.
