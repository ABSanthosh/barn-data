Flip7 does get a higher expected battery life on a single charge – at 42 hours and 4 minutes. Galaxy Z Flip7 EPREL label and detailed listing The detailed listing shows that Flip7 features a 4,174mAh rated battery capacity which should be marketed as 4,300mAh. The same set of details is also available for the Z Flip7 FE, which is certified with a rated battery capacity of 3,887mAh. That will likely be marketed as 4,000mAh. Galaxy Z Flip7 FE's EPREL listing Galaxy Z Fold7 is also seen and features a 4,272mAh rated capacity which will most likely be marketed as 4,400mAh. Galaxy Z Fold7's EPREL listing In related news, Z Flip7 also appeared in an early listing on a Romanian retailer’s website. We can see the device in its three official colors - Jet Black, Blue Shadow and Coral Red. Galaxy Z Flip7 listing The listing also contains some key specs which confirm the device’s 6.9-inch main screen and a 4.1-inch cover screen as well as its Exynos 2500 chipset and 4,300mAh battery capacity. We also get a pricing of RON 3,059 (€604) for the 12/256GB trim, which seems a bit too low so it's most likely incorrect. Source (in Romanian)| Via 1 • Via 2 (in Romanian)",
