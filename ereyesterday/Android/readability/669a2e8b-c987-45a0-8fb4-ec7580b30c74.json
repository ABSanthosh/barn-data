That said, OnePlus recently announced that it has pushed forward with its stable Android 15 (via OxygenOS 15) update for the OnePlus 12, which has started to arrive for users worldwide. As per the announcement: The team has been working tirelessly to ensure our users across the globe can try out OxygenOS 15 as quickly as possible. Now I am thrilled to share that we have started the global rollout of OxygenOS 15 one week earlier than previously anticipated. The rollout begins TODAY across IN/NA/EU/GLO regions and will continue to reach more users in batches throughout this week. We’ll keep you posted on progress in this thread. There’s a lot that OnePlus has included with the update, including changes and tweaks to the user interface and gesture navigation, new additions to themes and personalization including the home screen, lock screen and AOD, as well as updates to Fluid Cloud for expanded app compatibility. READ: Here are the First OnePlus Devices that will Get Android 15 For productivity, OnePlus has added support for globally reversible photo editing, new floating window gestures for resizing, opening notifications and closing them, and a Split mode for notifications and quick settings. Charging now comes with a charging limit feature that halts charging at 80%, and there are new battery protection reminders in place. OnePlus says that it’s also improved audio performance. For safety and privacy, OnePlus has added a universal hub for emergency calls, disaster alerts and even access to first aid information. Private Safe meanwhile adds organized views for media and documents, and the home screen now comes with a password-protected homescreen shortcut for hidden apps.
