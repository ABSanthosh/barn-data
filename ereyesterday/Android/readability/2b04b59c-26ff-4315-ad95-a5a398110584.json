  "text": "Anker Charging Station $36 $46 Save $10 A charging station to handle all your devices without breaking a sweat. Grab it now for just $36, which is the lowest price we've seen for this. Phone chargers are getting better and better, offering more ports, and plenty of power. But what if you need a lot of charging ports, something that's going to stay at your home or office to power all your devices? Related Well, that's where a charging station comes into play, offering a wealth of ports, so you can reduce clutter and keep all your devices topped up with ease. With that said, this one from Anker, which features nine ports and 100W of power, can now be had for dirt cheap as it drops to its best price yet at just $36. What's great about this Anker charging station? Source: Anker So the important thing here is knowing what type of ports this charging station comes with. You get up to 100W of power, and the device features two USB-A and four USB-C ports, which should be enough to charge most devices. In addition, the charging station also has three AC outlets as well, which means you can plug pretty much anything you want into this charging station, just in case you have a device that doesn't run off USB power. What's important here is the design, which has the ability to keep all your cord clutter in order, no matter how many devices you plug in at one time. Furthermore, it also comes with a long warranty that can provide support for 18 months. In addition, Anker also provides a $200,000 connected equipment warranty, just in case something were to get damaged at some point. For the most part, there's not a lot to complain about here, especially at $36, which makes this a great charging station to pick up.",
