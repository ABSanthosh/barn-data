  "text": "Crucial T705 Gen5 SSD $390 $714 Save $324 Crucial T705 claims to be the fastest SSD, with read and write speeds up to 14,500 MB/s and 12,700 MB/, respectively. it also supports Microsoft DirectStorage, offering you faster gameplay and sharper graphics.  If you're looking for one of the best SSDs available, then Crucial's T705 SSD is going to be in the mix as one of the fastest out there. While we loved this SSD in our review, we did think that it was pretty expensive. Luckily, we're now seeing some excellent promotions on the drive, with the 4TB model getting a hefty discount from Amazon that knocks $324 off. That means you can now score this drive for just $390, which is the lowest price we've seen yet. Related Crucial T705 SSD review: The new king of SSDs, but it'll cost a prince's ransom This PCIe 5.0 SSD promises the fastest speeds around, but does it live up to those claims? What's great about the Crucial's T705 SSD? There's not much to say here, expect that this SSD is exceptional. The drive can deliver sequential read speeds of up to 14,100MB/s, with sequential write speeds that can top out at 12,600MB/s. This is way faster than anything you'll find with a Gen4 SSD, making it a worthwhile upgrade if you're going to Gen5. As far as other hardware, you will need an M.2 slot that can support Gen5 to get the best speeds. But this SSD is backwards compatible, which means you can still use it in a Gen4 slot. Just don't expect to get the same speeds. Of course, while this is going to be great for gaming, you're also going to get excellent use of productivity apps as well. Of course, if you're saving this much, you might want to consider grabbing an SSD heatsink in order to ensure better performance and reliability with the drive. So if this sounds like what you're looking for, you'll want to be quick because a rare deal like this won't be around for long.",

not much to say here, expect that this SSD is exceptional.

This is way faster than anything you\u0026#39;ll find with a Gen4 SSD, making it a \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-to-buy-gen-5-ssd-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eworthwhile upgrade if you\u0026#39;re going to Gen5\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs far as other hardware, you will need an M.2 slot that can support Gen5 to get the best speeds. But this SSD is backwards compatible, which means you can still use it in a Gen4 slot. Just don\u0026#39;t expect to get the same speeds. Of course, while this is going to be great for gaming, you\u0026#39;re also going to get excellent use of productivity apps as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if you\u0026#39;re saving this much, you might want to \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/pcie-5-ssd-need-heatsink/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econsider grabbing an SSD heatsink\u003c/a\u003e in order to ensure better performance and reliability with the drive.
