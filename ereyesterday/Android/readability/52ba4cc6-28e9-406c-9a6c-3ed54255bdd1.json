Sony has halted sales of its flagship Xperia 1 VII smartphone in Japan. The company confirmed widespread power failures and random reboots affecting the device as of early July 2025, releasing an official statement with interim guidance for affected users while conducting a full investigation into the critical issues that have shaken customer confidence in the premium Android market. Sony Issues Official Statement on Xperia 1 VII Issues Sony publicly acknowledged the crisis in early July 2025. The Xperia 1 VII suffers from unexpected shutdowns, random restarts, and complete power failures. The company confirmed these devastating issues through official support channels, noting the flaw may be tied to certain production batches that have created widespread customer frustration and mounting support requests across Japan's Android community. Sony immediately suspended all sales and shipments of the Xperia 1 VII in Japan. This emergency pause affects major Japanese carrier versions and SIM free models sold through Sony Stores. The company emphasized its commitment to resolving the issue and promised regular updates as their investigation progresses, though no timeline has been provided for resolution or sales resumption. Sony What Users Are Reporting: Shutdowns and Reboots Xperia 1 VII owners flood forums with severe power complaints. Devices shut down unexpectedly during normal use. Random reboots plague users throughout the day, while some phones become completely unresponsive bricks that refuse to power on despite standard recovery attempts using power and volume buttons. The affected variants span carrier specific and SIM free models, concentrated primarily in Japan where the device launched first. These persistent failures have generated mounting frustration and triggered a surge in support requests that overwhelmed Sony's customer service channels. Current troubleshooting advice fails to resolve all occurrences, highlighting the severity of what appears to be a fundamental flaw in Sony's flagship device. Sony Sony's Interim Guidance and Software Update Sony issued specific emergency steps for affected Xperia 1 VII owners. Users should perform a soft reset by holding power and volume up buttons for about 20 seconds. If the device restarts successfully, installing any available software updates through the settings menu becomes crucial for potential stability improvements. Backing up important data is strongly recommended. Sony warns that further intervention may become necessary as the investigation continues. For users whose phones remain completely unresponsive, the company directs them to contact customer support channels for manual assistance, though wait times have increased significantly due to the volume of affected users seeking help. Sony Technical Context and Current Investigation The technical root cause remains unconfirmed. Preliminary indicators point to a probable software or firmware bug, as incidents cluster around certain models sold primarily in Japan, though Sony has not ruled out hardware faults and continues reviewing both software and hardware components for potential manufacturing defects. Sales suspensions affect Japanese regions most severely. The company advises owners to update devices and back up data pending further information from ongoing investigations. Sony's swift action and transparency demonstrate damage control efforts, but customers face uncertainty as a definitive fix could require additional weeks or months of development and testing before any resolution emerges. What Xperia Owners Should Do Next Immediate action is critical for Xperia 1 VII owners experiencing these issues. Back up all valuable data immediately. Attempt the recommended forced restart procedure. Install any available device updates that might contain interim fixes. If problems persist, contact Sony support for potential repair or replacement options, though processing times may be extended due to high demand. While Sony's transparency has been welcomed by some industry observers, user confidence has been severely shaken, especially since stability represents a fundamental expectation for premium Android devices competing against established rivals like Samsung and Google in the flagship smartphone market. Sony's investigation into the Xperia 1 VII's power failures will determine both its reputation and customer loyalty in the premium Android space. The temporary sales halt demonstrates commitment to safety and transparency, yet long term trust depends entirely on delivering a swift and thorough resolution. Xperia owners and potential buyers should monitor Sony's official updates closely, as the company's handling of this crisis will establish whether it can maintain relevance against strong competitors in the increasingly competitive flagship smartphone market. With over a decade's experience covering the world of Android and having reviewed more devices than he can count, Peter is excited about where the world of tech is heading. He is currently packing the Oppo Find X8 Pro, OnePlus Pad 2, and an ASUS Chromebook Plus. Previous Post",
