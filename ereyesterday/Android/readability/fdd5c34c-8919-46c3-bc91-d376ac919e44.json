Verizon was planning to shut down its Message Plus app on November 7, but it has now delayed it until December 9, 2024. The mobile carrier wants users to switch to Google Messages, which has more advanced features. Among them is support for high-quality photos sending, Rich Communication Services (RCS), and read receipts, similar to Apple’s iMessage. If you haven't already, now's the time to start. You have more time to say goodbye to Message+ Verizon Messages (Message+) is a preinstalled app on many Verizon-powered Android phones. It lets you send texts, pictures, videos, and more. It works across different devices, so you can continue your conversations on your phone, tablet, or computer. The app supports group messaging, multimedia sharing, and even location sharing. You can also set up Auto-Reply messages when you're busy. Image: Verizon The company initially announced that they'd shut down the app for good on November 7, much to the dismay of many users. The app’s customizable lock screen pop-ups, among other features, set it apart from other messaging apps. Worse, they're pushing you towards Google branding, who don't have the best track record of handling user data.  According to Verizon, messaging is changing, and they want to give you the best experience. Right now, Message+ doesn't give you that and Google Messages offers a better, more interactive way to text through RCS. It comes preinstalled on all Android phones. Starting with iOS 18, iPhone users will also be able to use RCS for messaging on Apple Messages.  While it's not a happy news, the December deadline extension is much needed as the decision caught many people off guard. The official website has been updated to reflect the new date. The real problem is that not everyone owns a smartphone.  Some Verizon users own devices that have Message+ as their only texting option. With no app stores to download new texting apps and zero support for RCS, they'll lose texting capabilities and it forces the user to buy a more expensive phone just to send messages. Related: Verizon Will Buy Frontier For $20b; Will Gain Fiber Assets What happens after Message+ is gone forever? When Verizon shuts down the Message+ app completely, you can no longer send or receive messages through it or use your email alias. Any messages you scheduled to send after December will not be delivered, and the app will leave the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

They also said that during the system maintenance before the shutdown, you may notice group texts carrying a 588 area code, indicating that their number has been removed from the group. It's a technical notification, and it doesn't require any action from you. You can either delete the message or ignore it. Image: Irene Okpanachi / Talk Android It's not just messaging features that will see permanent changes. Starting in April 2024, Verizon will stop offering eGift cards through the app, although you can still redeem any cards you bought before then. On the bright side, you can still access your old text message through Google and Apple's messaging apps, and website versions.  Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
