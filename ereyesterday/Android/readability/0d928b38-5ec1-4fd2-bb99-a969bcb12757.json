So if you buy a Samsung you're no longer a sheep trying desperately to fit in, but can blaze your own path, blah blah blah. Get it? It's all so subtle - Samsung is now the one that \"thinks different\", referencing an Apple tagline from the 90s. And that in itself is incredibly cringeworthily unoriginal, as everyone on the internet has basically read at least one diatribe chastising Apple for not \"thinking different\" anymore. Yawn. Anyway, remember: \"if you try to fit in, you won't stand out\". As if that's ever a binary choice in real life. As if one person exists, or has ever existed, that only ever wanted to fit in and never to stand out or viceversa.",
