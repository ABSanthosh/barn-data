Google Pixel phones, like the Pixel 9, have been pushing AI-powered experiences with Gemini, with features like Add Me, Call Screen, and Magic Eraser, while Samsung’s Galaxy AI boasts Circle to Search, Live Translate, and Drawing Assist. Google and Samsung approach AI in smartphones differently, but which brand is leading the AI revolution? Related Google’s AI-first strategy The Pixel’s edge in the AI market The Google Pixel 8 Pro was the first smartphone with Google AI built in. However, the Pixel 9 lineup sees a generation of smartphones centered around the Gemini technology, making it the focal point of future devices. Leveraging Google’s expertise in machine learning, we’ve come to love features like Pixel’s Call Screen (released in 2018 alongside the Pixel 3), Hold for Me (released in 2020), Magic Eraser, and Live Translate (released in 2021). Gemini, Google’s built-in AI assistant, takes the pressure off users in many ways. For instance, you can take a photo of an item and ask Gemini what it’s used for, or ask it to find a restaurant for your next date night, brainstorm ideas for your current project, use it as a personal fitness coach, and identify LEGO pieces. One advantage of Google’s AI approach is how seamlessly it works without additional apps or services. Native integration with Google Cloud and Google Services makes using your smartphone a breeze. With AI processing done on-device with Tensor chips, you can expect improved speed and privacy across your devices. With a heavy focus on AI, Google’s hardware has struggled to keep up with competitors like Samsung. Google’s Tensor chips prioritize AI over raw performance. The Tensor G3 (seen in the Pixel 8 series) was outperformed by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in raw speed, gaming performance, and efficiency. While Google’s AI features are impressive, they can feel held back by hardware limitations, which seems to be a consistent theme when comparing benchmarks. Samsung’s AI push Galaxy AI takes center stage Samsung’s Galaxy AI was introduced in 2024 alongside the Galaxy S24 series and takes center stage among the S25 series with features like Now Brief, Circle to Search, Audio Eraser, and Call Transcript. There is some overlap between AI features seen in Pixel and Samsung phones, like Circle to Search, which allows users to identify an object in a photo and search for it with Google Live Translate, which provides real-time translation for phone calls, and generative AI-powered photo editing. However, Google also offers features that Galaxy AI doesn’t. One of Samsung’s biggest strengths is that it doesn’t limit AI-powered features to its flagship phones. The Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6 boast an AI approach. Features like Live Translate, which was introduced with the Galaxy S24 series, have been rolled out to older Galaxy devices like the S23 and S22 series via software updates. This means that the millions of users who don’t buy flagship phones can still enjoy Samsung’s AI features, having a broader impact on the Android ecosystem. Samsung’s AI integration feels natural within One UI. When One UI 6.1 launched with Galaxy AI, it was easy to access within native apps like Samsung Notes, Gallery, and Messages. For example, Circle to Search is deeply integrated into Samsung’s S Pen and gestures, making them feel like a native feature rather than an add-on. The same can be said for Live Translate, which happens within Samsung’s dialer app rather than needing a separate app like Google Translate. However, despite branding its AI features as “Galaxy AI,” many of Samsung’s significant AI-powered tools are developed by Google (such as Circle to Search, Live Translate, and Samsung’s Generative AI for Photo Editing), making it less independent in the AI race while leveraging Google’s AI ecosystem. Although this isn’t a problem, if Google shifts AI priorities away from Samsung and decides to keep its AI features exclusive, Samsung’s AI progress could stall. Which brand has the smarter AI? As AI becomes one of the defining factors of modern smartphones, the battle between Pixel and Galaxy AI comes down to which brand offers the smartest, most useful AI experience. Google, with its AI-first approach, has led the way in AI-driven automation and personalization, while Samsung’s Galaxy AI focuses on enhancing user experience through practical, everyday tools. Related AI for communication Google and Samsung take different approaches to revolutionizing how we handle calls and messaging with the help of AI. Google’s AI-powered Call Screen feature automatically filters spam calls, allowing users to see transcriptions before answering. Hold for Me is a useful feature that keeps users off hold by listening for a human agent and alerting them when the call is ready. If you receive many spam calls or don’t like being on hold, these features enhance the user experience and are a time-saving tool. Samsung’s Live Translate uses real-time AI-driven translation to translate phone calls between two people speaking different languages. Leveraging the Samsung phone app, no additional apps or software need to be downloaded. For travelers or international business users, the ability to handle multilingual communication is a must. Pixel phones dominate call management, whereas Samsung’s Live Translate is a game-changer for international communication. The winner here comes down to personal preference rather than AI ability. Photography Google and Samsung use AI-powered tools to enhance smartphone photography, but their execution is different. Google’s well-known Magic Eraser tool seamlessly removes unwanted objects and distractions from photos using AI. Similarly, its Best Take feature allows you to merge group photos to create the best shot. However, Pixel cameras rely on AI processing, compensating for smaller sensors than Samsung’s. Samsung takes a more aggressive approach to AI-powered transformations. Its Generative AI Photo Editing allows users to move, resize, or extend photo elements using AI. Tools like Generative Fill can replace or generate missing parts of an image. Samsung’s approach is more like Photoshop on your phone. While Samsung gives you more creative freedom, if you’re a beginner, some edits may look a little unnatural compared to Google. Related Search and assistance Google’s Gemini AI is a fully-fledged AI assistant capable of assisting in multiple tasks, whereas Samsung’s Circle to Search feature focuses more on enhancing search functionality. Gemini is built into the Pixel 8 Pro (and above) devices, replacing the traditional Google Assistant in certain tasks. It can summarize content, generate text, answer queries, and automate tasks. If you’re looking for a way to manage tasks, Gemini is one of the smartest AI assistants for the job, providing insights and streamlining workflows. Powered by Google AI, Samsung’s Circle to Search lets users circle or highlight anything on their screen, including photos and videos, to get instant search results. Since the feature is deeply integrated into One UI, it works with almost any app. This means you can perform a faster, more intuitive search without switching apps. Like many AI features across Google and Samsung, choosing the best option here is down to the use case. Gemini is smarter for automation and assistance, whereas Circle to Search is a faster way to get contextual information. Who is leading the AI smartphone revolution? Google’s Pixel devices are still the leaders in AI-powered software, but Samsung’s AI approach is more user-friendly and available across more devices. Samsung’s AI feels more accessible, whereas Pixel’s AI is more advanced in particular areas like call screening and photography. Samsung’s reliance on Google AI could hold it back. However, it has the hardware capability to dominate the AI smartphone market. If you want the most AI-powered smartphone, Pixel seems to be the clear winner, but if you want to use AI tools that enhance daily usability, Samsung is the more user-friendly choice.",

\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Google Pixel 8 Pro was the first smartphone with Google AI built in. However, the Pixel 9 lineup sees a generation of smartphones centered around the Gemini technology, making it the focal point of future devices. Leveraging Google’s expertise in machine learning, we’ve come to love features like Pixel’s Call Screen (released in 2018 alongside the Pixel 3), Hold for Me (released in 2020), Magic Eraser, and Live Translate (released in 2021).\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGemini, Google’s built-in AI assistant, takes the pressure off users in many ways. For instance, you can take a photo of an item and ask Gemini what it’s used for, or ask it to find a restaurant for your next date night, brainstorm ideas for your current project, use it as a personal fitness coach, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/things-i-had-no-idea-gemini-could-do/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eidentify LEGO pieces\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOne advantage of Google’s AI approach is how seamlessly it works without additional apps or services.

With AI processing done on-device with Tensor chips, you can expect improved speed and privacy across your devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWith a heavy focus on AI, Google’s hardware has struggled to keep up with competitors like Samsung. Google’s Tensor chips prioritize AI over raw performance.

For example, Circle to Search is deeply integrated into Samsung’s S Pen and gestures, making them feel like a native feature rather than an add-on. The same can be said for Live Translate, which happens within Samsung’s dialer app rather than needing a separate app like Google Translate.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, despite branding its AI features as “Galaxy AI,” many of Samsung’s significant AI-powered tools are developed by Google (such as Circle to Search, Live Translate, and Samsung’s Generative AI for Photo Editing), making it less independent in the AI race while leveraging Google’s AI ecosystem.

users to see transcriptions before answering. Hold for Me is a useful feature that keeps users off hold by listening for a human agent and alerting them when the call is ready. If you receive many spam calls or don’t like being on hold, these features enhance the user experience and are a time-saving tool.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSamsung’s Live Translate uses real-time AI-driven translation to translate phone calls between two people speaking different languages. Leveraging the Samsung phone app, no additional apps or software need to be downloaded. For travelers or international business users, the ability to handle multilingual communication is a must.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePixel phones dominate call management, whereas Samsung’s Live Translate is a game-changer for international communication.

Google’s well-known Magic Eraser tool seamlessly removes unwanted objects and distractions from photos using AI. Similarly, its Best Take feature allows you to merge group photos to create the best shot. However, Pixel cameras rely on AI processing, compensating for smaller sensors than Samsung’s.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSamsung takes a more aggressive approach to AI-powered transformations. Its Generative AI Photo Editing allows users to move, resize, or extend photo elements using AI. Tools like Generative Fill can replace or generate missing parts of an image. Samsung’s approach is more like Photoshop on your phone.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile Samsung gives you more creative freedom, if you’re a beginner, some edits may look a little unnatural
