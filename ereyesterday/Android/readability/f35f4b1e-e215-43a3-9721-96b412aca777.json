  "text": "As a PC user, you probably already appreciate the crucial role of a power supply unit (PSU). It's not only responsible for routing the correct voltage to every component inside the PC, but also keeping everything operating at peak performance. Without adequate and clean power, your CPU and GPU can easily encounter issues that you might fail to diagnose at first glance. For those overclocking their CPU, having a quality power supply becomes even more important. Hence, if you are noticing some strange behavior related to your computer's power, looking to upgrade your graphics card, or simply still using an ancient PSU, it might finally be time to upgrade it to something capable, modern, and long-lasting. Related 5 Your PC shuts down during heavy loads The PSU might be the root cause Many users encounter this issue — as soon as they launch a game or some other relatively intensive program, their PC inevitably shuts down within a span of minutes. It is natural to cast doubts on the CPU or GPU in such scenarios, but the fault often lies with the PSU. If your PSU is overheating due to a faulty fan or otherwise nearing failure, it will not be able to support heavy workloads, shutting the system down as a result. You might not notice anything amiss during light use, such as browsing the web, watching videos, or working on documents, but that doesn't mean the PSU is hale and hearty. Whether it's due to a fault or plain age, you should look into a PSU replacement if you see similar signs on your PC. Delaying a replacement might become a bigger problem if the PSU's internals fail and render your system unusable, or worse, permanently damage some other component inside the PC. Related 4 Your PSU emits an abnormal smell or noise Act before it gets fiery You might remember a burning smell coming from your brand-new PSU when you first put your PC together. This smell is perfectly normal, as the first few hours of usage heats the flux, adhesives, and other materials inside the PSU. This smell goes away in a few days, but if you notice a similar smell months or years into your PC, it could be cause for concern. A burning smell could simply be caused by excess dust deposited on the outside of the PSU. Try cleaning the dust (without opening the PSU) and check if the smell is gone. If not, your PSU might not be long for this world, and you should consult a repair technician or look for a replacement. Similarly, if you suddenly notice strange crackling or whining noises coming from your PSU, something might have gone wrong inside it. Usually, a broken fan or aging internal components are behind the issue. Related How to clean the dust out of your PC tower Dust buildup is bad for your system, so you should regularly clean your PC tower to keep it free of dirt and grime 3 Your aging PSU might be nearing end of life Even if it's working now, don't count on it Power supplies consist of a host of internal components like capacitors, resistors, inductors, diodes, and more that are prone to wear and tear, just like any other electronic device. Depending on its age and how much load you put it through during those years, your PSU could be nearing its natural end of life. PSUs are designed to last as long as 10 years, so if your PSU has been in operation close to that, it's best to start looking into a replacement. In this case, it's not because your existing PSU is exhibiting issues, but because it will likely soon start to do so if it's old enough. Before you get surprised by unexpected faults or system failures, try to get a newer, well-reviewed unit to replace your trusty old PSU. Related 5 used PC components you should avoid buying if you can help it Used PC parts can be a great way to go when on a budget, but there are some components you should always buy new 2 It's not compatible with newer hardware Your new GPU might need a new PSU If your existing PSU is older, chances are it might not have enough wattage to support the new graphics card you've been eyeing for some time. The PSU might have been more than enough when you built your PC years ago, but with the rapidly advancing power requirements of graphics cards and even CPUs, it might not be enough for your new upgrades. If you're already planning on a full PC upgrade, you'll probably be fine with buying a new PSU as part of the process. On the other hand, if you only intend to replace your GPU or CPU with something that demands a lot more power than your existing PSU can provide, then you'll also need to make sure to set aside some money for a PSU replacement. Even if your old PSU can supply enough wattage for the latest graphics card, it might not physically support it due to newer power connectors on some of these graphics cards, such as the 12VHPWR or 12V-2x6 connectors now being seen on many of the latest products. An adapter might be able to bridge the gap between a new GPU and your old PSU but, depending on the card in question, it might not be the safest or most efficient solution. Related How do I select the right PSU for my PC? Choosing the right PSU for your PC will save you a lot of wasted time and money 1 A poor-quality PSU might damage your PC Don't risk the life of your precious PC Even if you have a newer PSU that's been in use for just a year or two, if it's a low-quality unit, you might be sitting on a ticking time bomb. And I'm not even exaggerating. Power supplies have been known to catch fire, explode, and take many other components down with them. Worse, if you have a PSU that's been notably acknowledged to be of poor construction or part of widespread failures, you should replace it as soon as possible. In the past, Gigabyte's GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM power supplies have been investigated after users claimed failures and damaged hardware, and they were found to contain questionable internal components. Whenever you are picking a PSU for your PC, ensure that you limit your search to reputed brands, look for a decent 80 Plus or Cybenetics rating, check reviews and PSU tier lists if possible, and research a bit about the specific unit's track record. Related 4 reasons why you should always go for quality PSUs While they might seem tempting when you're on a budget, cheap PSUs from no-name brands aren't worth it in the long run Don't cling to your old PSU for no reason Your old PSU might not be due for a replacement yet, but if you see any of these signs of failure, you should rule out other causes and definitely consider replacing the PSU if needed. Additionally, if you know your PSU is a low-quality unit, it's best to get it replaced, especially if you're doing any gaming on your PC. You might also need a new PSU if it doesn't support a new component that you wish to upgrade to. When choosing a new PSU, estimate your PC's power consumption, narrow down the features that you need, pick a well-regarded unit with a good 80 Plus rating, and try to get a newer model if it fits your budget.",
