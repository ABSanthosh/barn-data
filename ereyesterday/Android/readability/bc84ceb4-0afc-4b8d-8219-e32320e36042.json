  "text": "The graphics card on your PC does all the heavy lifting when you play your favorite games. Therefore, it's one of the first components you should consider upgrading to improve your PC's gaming performance. Unlike smartphones, though, most users don't upgrade their PCs every two years or so. In fact, I try to hold on to my graphics card for as long as I can. But how do you know when it's time to get a new one? Look out for these signs. Related How long should you wait between PC upgrades? Let's (try to) answer the age-old question: how many years should you wait before upgrading your gaming PC? 4 You can't play the latest games optimally Subpar frame rate is a sign of an aging graphics card Think about some of the best AAA games that came out in the past year. Can you play them at a consistent 60 FPS or higher? Sure, if you have a 4K monitor, getting 60 FPS might be tricky. However, with upscaling technologies like NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR, you should be able to achieve this frame rate on modern graphics cards after lowering some visual settings. Many of you may prefer competitive games like Valorant and Fortnite, which are far less demanding on the hardware than AAA titles. However, high frame rates are crucial in these games to stay on top of your game and have a competitive edge. So, if you have a high refresh rate monitor, you should be able to play them at 144 FPS or higher. If not, it's a clear sign that your graphics card is aging. Don't forget the games you regularly play and the resolution you play them at. If your graphics card simply cannot maintain the frame rates you expect, whether that's 60 FPS or 120 FPS, you should consider getting a new one. 3 Enabling ray tracing isn't really an option Because your graphics card wasn't built for it Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the lighting in a 3D environment to deliver more realistic shadows and reflections. This process is very demanding on graphics cards, but fortunately, modern GPUs have dedicated ray-tracing cores to handle these workloads. Ray tracing was a cutting-edge feature back in 2018, with only a handful of graphics cards and games supporting it. Fast-forward to 2025, and ray tracing is now the industry standard. We now expect ray tracing in all major AAA games. NVIDIA uses the marketing term \"RTX\" for its graphics cards with ray tracing support. These cards have dedicated ray tracing cores to handle real-time illumination and reflections. But if you have an older GeForce \"GTX\" card, any game you play will become almost unplayable the moment you enable ray tracing from the in-game graphics settings because they lack the dedicated ray-tracing cores. Sure, you can get away with this if you don't care about ray tracing at all and play most games at low settings to maximize your frame rate. Regardless, it's a telltale sign that you might need a new graphics card sooner rather than later. 2 Frequent crashes, stuttering, black screens, and overheating You're spending more time troubleshooting than gaming Crashes aren't exactly uncommon in the world of PC gaming. And in many cases, the graphics card isn't really the culprit. Unoptimized games can stutter, crash, or cause a black screen more often than you think. However, if this occurs in several games you play regularly, it's time to get to the root of the problem. Install a tool like MSI Afterburner and monitor the frame rate, GPU usage, and GPU temperature. If you notice your graphics card overheating (temperature higher than 85C) and the GPU usage fluctuates heavily, thermal throttling might be the culprit. More often than not, replacing the thermal paste on your graphics card should alleviate this issue, but I don't recommend doing this yourself because you might damage the card and void your warranty in the process. 1 Your GPU doesn't meet the game's recommended requirements Meeting minimum requirements isn't enough For an ideal experience, you should ensure that your graphics card meets the game's recommended requirements rather than the minimum specs. Otherwise, you're in for a disappointment. If your system only meets the minimum requirements for a particular game, you'll certainly not get 60 FPS when playing it. If your graphics card is two or more generations old, for example, you own an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti, you may not even find it mentioned in the minimum or recommended system requirements. However, you should be safe if you see a newer-gen lower-end card listed in the recommended specs. For instance, Black Myth: Wukong recommends an RTX 2060, but the GTX 1080 Ti is more capable in every department except ray tracing. Ideally, if you want a consistent 60 FPS experience, you should make sure your graphics card is more powerful than the one listed in the recommended specs. If not, be prepared to lower the visual settings or buy a new graphics card. Don't be quick to upgrade your graphics card, though It's important to get the timing right when you buy a new graphics card. Both NVIDIA and AMD release their flagship line of graphics cards every two years or so. So, if you buy a current-gen card, especially when new ones are a couple of months away, your hardware is going to get outdated sooner rather than later. We've already discussed why right now is the worst time to buy a new graphics card. The main reason is that next-gen cards like the NVIDIA RTX 5000 series and the AMD RX 8000 series are right around the corner. So, unless you're planning to buy a used RTX 4000 series or RX 7000 series for cheap, you should probably wait. Related",

the minimum specs. Otherwise, you\u0026#39;re in for a disappointment. If your system only meets the minimum requirements for a particular game, you\u0026#39;ll certainly not get 60 FPS when playing it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf your graphics card is two or more generations old, for example, you own an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti, you may not even find it mentioned in the minimum or recommended system requirements. However, you should be safe if you see a newer-gen lower-end card listed in the recommended specs. For instance, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Myth: Wukong\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e recommends an RTX 2060, but the GTX 1080 Ti is more capable in every department except ray tracing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, if you want a consistent 60 FPS experience, you should make sure your graphics card is more powerful than the one listed in the recommended specs. If not, be prepared to lower the visual settings or buy a new graphics card.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"don-39-t-be-quick-to-upgrade-your-graphics-card-though\"\u003e\n            Don\u0026#39;t be quick to upgrade your graphics card, though\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s important to get the timing right when you buy a new graphics card. Both NVIDIA and AMD release their flagship line of graphics cards every two years or so. So, if you buy a current-gen card, especially when new ones are a couple of months away, your hardware is going to get outdated sooner rather than later.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve already discussed \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/3-reasons-why-right-now-is-the-worst-time-to-upgrade-your-gpu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhy right now is the worst time to buy a new graphics card\u003c/a\u003e. The main reason is that next-gen cards like the NVIDIA RTX 5000 series and the AMD RX 8000 series are right around the corner. So, unless you\u0026#39;re planning to buy a used RTX 4000 series or RX 7000 series for cheap, you should probably wait.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
