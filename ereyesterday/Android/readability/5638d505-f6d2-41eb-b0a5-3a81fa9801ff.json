Score $250 off the Galaxy Ring with this current trade-in promotion from Samsung while it lasts. If you're looking for a wearable that isn't as intrusive as a smartwatch or fitness tracker, but packs the same tech to track your health and fitness metrics, then a smart ring is going to be a fantastic option. The Galaxy Ring is currently one of our top smart ring picks, and is now down to one of its lowest prices to date. Samsung's latest trade-in promotion knocks up to $250 off, making this the best price we've seen, and an absolute no-brainer at just $150. Related What's great about the Samsung Galaxy Ring? Samsung really hit it out of the park with its first smart ring, delivering a product that does most things you need without any added costs like a subscription service. The Galaxy Ring feels good on the finger, and the premium materials allow it to stand out from other smart rings produced by some competitors. While it's not much to look at, it does deliver when it comes to health and fitness tracking, although we do wish it did more in the latter category. As far as battery life goes, you can expect up to seven days, which is quite good for such a small device. The cool part is that it comes with a charging case, which makes it possible to charge while on the go. Of course, durability is also a big part of the Galaxy Ring, offering ample protection against dust and moisture. So you can feel confident taking it with you on a long hike, or just hopping in the shower in the morning. But what makes the ring more appealing now is the special promotion from Samsung that allows you to trade in a device to save up to $250. As far as what you can trade in, it's a bit limited, but Samsung is accepting smart rings and smartwatches. So be sure to head to the Samsung website to see what your device is valued at and if it's worth trading in. The maximum Samsung is offering is $250, which is quite good. But you'll want to be quick because this promotion won't be around for that long.",

really hit it out of the park with its first smart ring, delivering a product that does most things you need without any added costs like a subscription service. The Galaxy Ring feels good on the finger, and the premium materials allow it to stand out from other smart rings produced by some competitors.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026#39;s not much to look at, it does deliver when it comes to health and fitness tracking, although we do wish it did more in the latter category. As far as battery life goes, you can expect up to seven days, which is quite good for such a small device. The cool part is that it comes with a charging case, which makes it possible to charge while on the go.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, durability is also a big part of the Galaxy Ring, offering ample protection against dust and moisture. So you can feel confident taking it with you on a long hike, or just hopping in the shower in the morning. But what makes the ring more appealing now is the special promotion from Samsung that allows you to trade in a device to save up to $250.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs far as what you can trade in, it\u0026#39;s a bit limited, but Samsung is accepting smart rings and smartwatches. So be sure to head to the \u003ca href=\"https://howl.link/zk4bwtfr4i1tn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSamsung website to see what your device is valued at\u003c/a\u003e and if it\u0026#39;s worth trading in. The maximum Samsung is offering is $250, which is quite good. But you\u0026#39;ll want to be quick because this promotion won\u0026#39;t be around for that long.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
