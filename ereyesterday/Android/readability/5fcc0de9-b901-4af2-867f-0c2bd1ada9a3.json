  "text": "Ever since personal computing became a common fixture in our lives, the PC modding scene has existed. I can think back to the heydays of LAN parties when many participants would compete to show off their modded systems, and in an era when PC cases were either beige or black, they were eye-opening. Modern PC cases are very different from those early chassis, which might have you thinking the PC modding scene has gone away. But it hasn't. It just grew up along with the manufacturers and found new ways to push the envelope on what a mod could be. Related Watercooling your PC: What is it and should you do it? When it comes to cooling computer components, water cooling is the most premium option, but it's not just for high-end systems. PC modding hasn't gone away Easy access to desktop CNCs, 3D printers and other technologies meant it evolved The current landscape of PC modding is very different from how it used to be. Modding used to be done with hand tools and other manual methods, and it still is to some degree, but the proliferation of 3D printers, home-sized CNC milling machines, and the availability of other advanced manufacturing processes has made PC mods more involved. That also means the initial cost for many mods increases, and PC modders often have side businesses either making custom cables or custom distroplates for water-cooled builds to recoup the costs of their machinery. The design thinking has changed as well, from ways to add features to existing systems, to creating exciting scratch builds that don't use an existing PC chassis as the base. Even the sponsored builds that need to be done in a particular chassis often start by cutting out the internals, so that only a small part of the case is still used in the final product. And the commercialization of the PC modding scene has brought other considerations to the fore. When component manufacturers sponsor modders, they often have a list of stipulations that need to be followed, such as graphics cards that need to be used in their OEM configuration to show off the cooling system that was designed and not stripped and placed under a waterblock. Related 5 ideas to build a PC that stands out without going overboard Crafting a PC with a unique aesthetic might have become harder, but it's not impossible Modern PC cases mean many common mods are unnecessary Improved designs and a move away from physical media changed the landscape forever PC modding started out adding features to cases that the manufacturers weren't putting in as standard. This could be simple airflow holes with mesh over them to enable more fans to be used, so that the hardware inside could be overclocked further. Or adding more hard drive bays to unused space, or replacing the 5.25\" CD-ROM drives with displays to monitor temperature and fan speeds, and other tweaks. Another common mod was to cut the side panel open and replace it with mesh or acrylic so that you could see the internal components and replace the OEM cabling with custom jobs. But then something changed two decades ago when Half-Life 2 launched, and Steam changed how we bought PC games. With fewer titles being launched with physical discs, case manufacturers stopped including 5.25\" bays, and then SSDs became more affordable, so fewer 3.5\" HDD bays were included. Case manufacturers were keen users on the forums that PC modders congregated on to watch for trends and see which mods they could incorporate into future designs. PC cases with side windows and all-glass constructions wouldn't exist without the PC modding community showing that they had a market. It's possible that the ARGB LED lighting in most cases and components wouldn't exist without modders playing with lighting. Related 4 ways manufacturers innovated to create the modern PC case We look back at all the times PC case makers innovated in the competitive space. PC modding has moved on to different things Source: eBay When the hobby first started, it was a way to hack features (often literally) into old cases. When every case was a beige or black monolith with no airflow, every modder started by cutting holes in the front and sides of their case to add fans, windows, and cold cathode lighting tubes. Modern PC cases have included most, if not all, of the conveniences that PC modders used to create, from cable management to better airflow. The landscape still has plenty of modders and competitions, but the bar to entry for competitive modding is also higher, as everyone is using CNC'ed parts and other advanced manufacturing techniques to create scratch builds, which use as little of the original PC case as possible, or in many cases, use none of it.

Or adding more hard drive bays to unused space, or replacing the 5.25\u0026#34; CD-ROM drives with displays to monitor temperature and fan speeds, and other tweaks. Another common mod was to cut the side panel open and replace it with mesh or acrylic so that you could see the internal components and replace the OEM cabling with custom jobs.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                        \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"2400\" height=\"1598\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"cable sleeving tools and supplies on a desktop\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/cable-sleeving-tools.jpg\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut then something changed two decades ago when \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/20th-anniversary-of-half-life-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHalf-Life 2\u003c/em\u003e launched\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-changed-pc-gaming-forever/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam changed how we bought PC games\u003c/a\u003e.

way to hack features (often literally) into old cases. When every case was a beige or black monolith with no airflow, every modder started by cutting holes in the front and sides of their case to add fans, windows, and cold cathode lighting tubes. Modern PC cases have included most, if not all, of the conveniences that PC modders used to create, from cable management to better airflow.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe landscape still has plenty of modders and competitions, but the bar to entry for competitive modding is also higher, as everyone is using CNC\u0026#39;ed parts and other advanced manufacturing techniques to create scratch builds, which use as little of the original PC case as possible, or in many cases, use none of it.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n
