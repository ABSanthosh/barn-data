The OnePlus 13R is only days away from launching globally, and a major leak has revealed what the device fully looks like. Before now, OnePlus has been teasing the camera module and snippets of other areas. Now, images show the new phone in two stunning colors of silver and space gray. The official names for the models are actually cooler, with the lighter model being Astral Trail and the darker one being Nebula Noir. We also see that Oneplus has gone with a more rounded style from the OnePlus 12R. Here's more on what's to come. OnePlus 13R: Every important detail so far The OnePlus 13R is confirmed to arrive on January 7th, with the latest OxygenOS 15 and a flat screen. It’s about time. Not everyone was on board with curved screens anyway, and it seems the world is finally realizing that. If you know your OnePlus phones well, you can tell from the leaked images that it looks just like the Ace 5 phone they released recently in December 2024.  Image: Arsène Lupin / X There were speculations that the phones were rebranded copycats, but differences cause us to now believe otherwise. The 13R phone will have two 50MP cameras: one telephoto lens and one wide lens. Meanwhile, the Ace 5 has a single 50MP wide main camera. For clarity, a wide lens captures a broader field of view, while a telephoto lens has a longer focal length for you to zoom in on distant subjects. OnePlus 13R camera infoRear:– 50MP LYT-700 (main)– 8MP Ultrawide– 50MP JN5 (2X Telephoto)Selfie: 16MPIndian model gets:– 12GB/256GB– 16GB/512GB(LPDDR5X / UFS4.0)Thoughts on the pricing?— Yogesh Brar (@heyitsyogesh) December 31, 2024 On the surface, they really do look the same, with the hole-punch cutout at the top for the front camera. On the right side, you'll find the volume rocker and power button, while the left side carries the alert slider. The top edge has an infrared (IR) sensor, and the bottom edge holds a USB Type-C port, a SIM card slot, a speaker grille, and microphone. On the rear side is a triple-camera system, and the Gorilla Glass 7i. There's also the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip running under the hood, which isn't surprising considering the past instance. OnePlus used a one year older chipset (the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2) for the OnePlus 12R compared to the regular OnePlus 12, which used the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13 uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Bigger battery on OnePlus 13R A much welcome specification on the OnePlus 13R is the massive 6,000mAh battery, which the website confirms. It exceeds the typical smartphone battery capacity, usually ranging around 4,000mAh to 5,000mAh. The OnePlus 12R was 500mAh shorter, but the Ace 5 is 400mAh better. Unsurprisingly, all these upgrades will add to the price of the newer phone. The figures haven't been announced yet, but there's an early bird offer you'll want to keep an eye on. Pre-pay $50 to get an additional $50 off the phone's price, plus a free gift worth up to $229.  Image: OnePlus The gift options include the OnePlus Watch 2R in either Gunmetal Gray or Forest Green. You will need to pay the remaining balance between January 7th and January 14th. The full price of the OnePlus 13R will be revealed on the launch date. Additionally, trade-in options will be available. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
