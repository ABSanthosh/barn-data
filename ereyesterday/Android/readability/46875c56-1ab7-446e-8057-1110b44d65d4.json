That has been the case for each Z Fold since then, but a new rumor suggests that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 may feature a more limited S Pen experience in terms of features. The main culprit? Slimness. As per the tipster, the Z Fold7 will be the slimmest Fold from Samsung to date, surpassing the Z Fold Special Edition, which comes in at 4.9mm in its unfolded state and 10.6mm when folded back up.

This means Samsung will have to remove certain features to make up for the space constraints inside the upcoming Fold. There’s no mention of which feature will be removed just yet. A more limited S Pen experience on the Z Fold7 would make sense as we saw a similar approach on the S25 Ultra, which comes with a Bluetooth-less S Pen. The S Pen for the Z Fold 5/6 already lacks Bluetooth functionality, while the more expensive S Pen Pro features the coveted Bluetooth support. The new rumor comes from a Korean source and is yet to be confirmed by other publications so make sure to take it with a few grains of salt. We’ll make sure to keep you updated once more details emerge. Source",
