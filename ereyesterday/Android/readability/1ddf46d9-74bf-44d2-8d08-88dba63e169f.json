Then again, if vivo can deliver a similar experience (and even better in some areas) for a much lower price, it might have a hit. The vivo MR device is going to undergo \"high-fidelity prototype experiences\" in several cities across China by late 2025, but it's still unclear when it will actually go on sale, as that will depend on the readiness of supporting content ecosystems, according to a vivo exec.
