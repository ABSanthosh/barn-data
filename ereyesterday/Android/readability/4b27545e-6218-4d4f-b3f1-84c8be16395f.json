In fact, new image renders showing the design of the Galaxy A56 have surfaced online, giving us a look at the upcoming midranger. In terms of design, the photos – courtesy of the folks at Android Headlines – show a rather familiar-looking style, with flat sides all over and the same button ramp for the power and volume keys. One key distinction though is that the camera island now features an integrated look for the lenses, in lieu of individual camera bumps as seen on earlier A-series models. This is actually similar to the camera island design seen on the Galaxy A26, another wallet-friendly A-series Samsung phone. READ: Renders of the Samsung Galaxy A26 have leaked! It’s expected that the Galaxy A56 will feature an Exynos 1580 chipset inside, 45W charging speeds, and might launch sometime in March 2025. Not much else is known about the device, although given the abundance of tech leaks nowadays it might not be too long until we hear more details of Samsung’s 2025 midranger.
