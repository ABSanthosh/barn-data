One of the reasons why I enjoy the foldable market, even without the intention of buying a foldable smartphone anytime soon, is that the segment has the kind of competition that I'm a big fan of. It reminds me of the early days of smartphones; the days I fell in love with. Year after year, everyone wants to be the one with the thinnest or lightest device. Honor has established itself as the king of thin foldables, but with the Oppo Find N5 earlier this year, that crown was unceremoniously snatched. Honor refuses to let that happen without a fight, and it seems that its next device, the Magic V5, will potentially reclaim that crown. The consumers certainly aren't complaining about this. The Honor Magic V5 Is Confirmed to Be Arriving on the Scene By Next Month Image: Honor Honor was the company that really piqued my interest in foldable devices. All the things that I didn't like about them, like their thick builds and prominent screen creases, were solved by Honor's Magic V series, or at least improved upon. The Magic V3 was the culmination of all their effort, and generally, was an excellent flagship smartphone. I'm still not sure I'll buy a foldable just yet, but I'm getting closer. That was last year, though, and this year, Honor is going to unleash the Honor Magic V5 (likely skipping over V4 due to tetraphobia, a common fear in Asia). To be exact, it'll be arriving next month, in June, and that comes straight from Li Kun, an exec at Honor. To be exact, he said it will come in the “first half of the year”, and next month is all that's left of that. Image: Honor It is going to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor, that much, we're sure of. I'm excited to see how much it will improve in that regard, considering the device was already killer in that regard. At the moment, we know this about the device: 6,000mAh battery 66W wired charging \u003c9mm thickness The Device Is Expected to Usurp the Oppo Find N5 as the Thinnest and Lightest Book-Style Foldable While we're talking about how thin and light this Honor smartphone is expected to be, it is going to have quite a notable challenge ahead of itself. It's not going to have only its predecessor to surpass, but Oppo too. Image: Honor Earlier this year, the Chinese OEM released the Oppo Find N5, and that device, quite frankly, is exceptional. It is the thinnest and one of the lightest foldables in the world, and the mark it has set will be tough for Honor to surpass. Regardless, it has chosen to do that, saying that it will return to being the “lightest and thinnest” option on the market.
