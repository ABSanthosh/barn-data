From long-awaited sequels to brand-new IPs, 2025 is stacked with titles causing fans to refresh Steam pages and watch reveal trailers on repeat. Although not all of these games have been released yet, these titles are the most wish-listed games currently on Steam. Related 8 games I'm most excited about in 2025 2025 looks absolutely stacked with stellar titles, but here are my personal favorites 20 Hollow Knight: Silksong End of year, 2025 Hollow Knight: Silksong has been on fans’ minds since its announcement in 2019, and after showcasing its gameplay on the new ROG Xbox Ally, it has now been given a rough release date, \"Some time before Christmas day\" in 2025. In this sequel, players will return to the beautifully drawn, bug-filled world, but this time as Hornet — who moves faster, fights more aggressively, and brings new tools to the table. The game keeps the Metroidvania style of the original Hollow Knight while expanding the scope of the world with new regions, enemies, and lore. While details remain scarce, every bit of gameplay shown so far promises fluid combat and fun platforming. When it drops, it’ll likely dominate the indie scene for the next few years. Hollow Knight: Silksong Play as Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, and adventure through a whole new kingdom ruled by silk and song! Captured and brought to this unfamiliar world, Hornet must battle foes and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. 19 Deadlock To be announced Deadlock is the next big competitive shooter from Valve, which means expectations are sky-high. It’s a 6v6 third-person hero shooter with fast-paced traversal mechanics, sci-fi weapons, and a strange blend of magical and tech-fueled characters. Maps are large, vertical, and more MOBA-like than anything Valve has done before. Think Overwatch meets Dota with a little bit of Valorant thrown in there. Even without a launch date, it’s already one of the most talked-about games of the year, and fans are eager to see how Valve approaches this genre in 2025. Deadlock is currently in the invite-only early access testing phase, so it is not available to the masses yet. Deadlock is an upcoming game from Valve which seemingly combines elements of the MOBA and hero shooter genres. As it is still in early development, gameplay and assets may be incomplete. Access is granted via friend invites. 18 Subnautica 2 To be announced, 2025 Subnautica 2 is bringing players to a new underwater planet, but this time with co-op. Explore a new alien ocean, filled with strange creatures, gorgeous environments, and a survival loop built around crafting, exploration, and base-building. The sequel aims to improve nearly everything from the first game, while also offering optional multiplayer for players who want to explore the deep with friends. It’s still being developed by Unknown Worlds, now with support from Krafton, and fans are especially excited about the new biomes and creatures that have been teased so far. Subnautica 2 Developer(s) Unknown Worlds Entertainment A new world awaits alongside an all-new story. You are a pioneer traveling to a distant world, but something is amiss. The ship's AI insists you carry on the mission. This world is too dangerous for humans to survive… Unless you change what it means to be human. What creatures, intelligent or otherwise, await your arrival? 17 Dune: Awakening June 10th, 2025 Set in the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune, this open-world survival MMO puts you on Arrakis, in the same style as the movie adaptations. Players build, explore, and survive on deserted maps filled with profitable spice, but be aware of the sand worms and other players, as they will all pose a constant threat. Dune: Awakening blends survival and RPG mechanics into a sandbox game. While still being true to the story's dense lore, the game really captures the feel of both Dune’s political tension and its deadly desert ecosystem perfectly. You can align with different factions to shift the political landscape, and you can also create your own bases or outposts. It looks ambitious, and that’s probably why so many people are keeping their eye on it. Dune: Awakening Your journey begins on Arrakis, with its vast deserts and colossal sandworms. Meet characters from the movies and books as you follow your story across Dune. Discover new allies and enemies and exploit your relationships to uncover the mystery that lies just beneath the surface of the sands. 16 Mecha BREAK July 2nd, 2025 Mecha BREAK is a fast-paced multiplayer mech game where players customize giant robots and clash in huge 3v3 and 6v6 battles. It features a mix of aerial combat, third-person shooting, and melee combat, all with great visuals and a unique anime-style. There's also a battle royale mode where dozens of players drop onto a battlefield in mech suits and scrap it out for survival. The designs look great, the action is flashy, and all of this results in a rare blend of competitive shooter and mech sim that feels arcade-ish but still very modern. Mecha BREAK Customize your mech down to its individual parts with precision. Personalize every detail, from full-body paint jobs to unique hues for armor, internal framework, and weaponry. Choose from a variety of colors, wear levels, glosses, and metallic finishes to showcase your unique style. Enhance your mech further with patterns and decals to create a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. 15 Light No Fire To be announced From the creators of No Man’s Sky comes Light No Fire, a survival RPG set on a fantasy \"Earth-sized\" planet. The game promises seamless exploration across mountains, oceans, forests, and ancient ruins. You can build, tame creatures, discover civilizations, and play with friends in multiplayer. Like Hello Games’ previous work, the scope of the game is impressive, and Light No Fire is aiming to be a truly massive open-world sandbox. There’s no release date yet, but the scale and ambition shown off in the games reveal trailers are why it’s made its way onto so many Steam users' wishlists. Light No Fire Systems Light No Fire is a game about adventure, building, survival and exploration together. Set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth, it brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox. 14 Borderlands 4 September 12th, 2025 The greatest looter-shooter franchise is finally back with Borderlands 4. Expect more of what made the series famous: chaotic gunplay, absurd weapon variety, and broken 2000s humor. This time, there are new Vault Hunters, a fresh setting, and a deeper focus on character builds. Gearbox is keeping many details under wraps, but the trailer hints at improved visuals and bigger/better co-op experiences. Whether you’re here for the story, loot grind, or just the over-the-top mayhem, Borderlands 4 looks like it’s returning to its roots while still shaking up the formula. Borderlands 4 Released September 12, 2025 Crash into Kairos as one of four new Vault Hunters seeking wealth and glory. Wield powerful Action Skills, customize your build with deep skill trees, and dominate enemies with dynamic movement abilities. 13 ARC Raiders October 30th, 2025 ARC Raiders is a cooperative third-person shooter set in a ruined sci-fi future where players battle mechanical invaders called ARC. It combines team tactics with fast gunplay as you scavenge, craft, and fight your way through post-apocalyptic environments. Matches can shift between PvE and PvPvE depending on the mission. It’s got a retro-future aesthetic and high mobility, encouraging vertical movement and incentivizing outmaneuvering enemies over direct combat. Originally delayed, the game has seen a lot of polish in its previews and seems to be gunning for a late 2025 launch. ARC Raiders Little remains of the world we know today. The mysterious machines of ARC threaten any possible settlement on the surface and communities are forced below the ground to survive. Most people are content just to see another day. Others have chosen a bolder path. They are known as Raiders. 12 Stellar Blade June 11th, 2025 Originally a PlayStation exclusive, Stellar Blade has finally landed on PC. It’s a stylish action game that mixes fast combat with a cinematic sci-fi story. You play as Eve, a soldier fighting against grotesque alien creatures on a ruined Earth. Combat is similar to games like Nier: Automata or Bayonetta, and there's also a light RPG progression system. The environments are a mix of dystopian cities and alien terrains, with a Final Fantasy-esque visual style throughout. Stellar Blade’s PC release is expected to include updated graphics, new features, and all post-launch content. Stellar Blade Stellar Blade is an action-RPG developed by Shift Up and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game follows protagonist Eve as she attempts to save a devastated Earth from invaders called Naytiba. 11 Arena Breakout: Infinite To be announced Arena Breakout: Infinite is a hardcore tactical shooter where you risk everything for high-value loot. It follows the extraction shooter formula popularized by games like Escape from Tarkov. Matches are tense and punishing. If you die, you lose everything you brought in. The gun customization is deep, ballistics are realistic, and stealth is key. Arena Breakout: Infinite is a more polished PC version of the popular mobile game. It’s free-to-play, making it easy to try and tough to master. Arena Breakout: Infinite Systems Arena Breakout: Infinite is the definitive immersive tactical military extraction shooter on Steam. Join a fair and competitive community to shoot, loot, and raid your path to fortune. With realistic visuals and true-to-life audio, push through tough battles where the stakes are high and the rewards even higher. Get in, get rich, and get out… but be prepared to fight for survival.",

new \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-xbox-branded-handheld-reveal/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eROG Xbox Ally\u003c/a\u003e, it has now been given a rough release date, \u0026#34;Some time before Christmas day\u0026#34; in 2025. In this sequel, players will return to the beautifully drawn, bug-filled world, but this time as Hornet — who moves faster, fights more aggressively, and brings new tools to the table. The game keeps the Metroidvania style of the original \u003cem\u003eHollow Knight\u003c/em\u003e while expanding the scope of the world with new regions, enemies, and lore. While details remain scarce, every bit of gameplay shown so far promises fluid combat and fun platforming. When it drops, it’ll likely dominate the indie scene for the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n                \n                                \n                    \n    \n        \n

It’s a 6v6 third-person hero shooter with fast-paced traversal mechanics, sci-fi weapons, and a strange blend of magical and tech-fueled characters. Maps are large, vertical, and more MOBA-like than anything Valve has done before. Think Overwatch meets Dota with a little bit of Valorant thrown in there. Even without a launch date, it’s already one of the most talked-about games of the year, and fans are eager to see how Valve approaches this genre in 2025. Deadlock is currently in the invite-only early access testing phase, so it is not available to the masses yet.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n                \n                                \n                    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n                    \n                \n                                            \n    \n        \u003cdiv data-show-streamrentbuy-links=\"true\" data-include-community-rating=\"true\" id=\"1841-4e35-934c5277646c\"\u003e\n            \n            \n            \u003cp\u003eDeadlock is an upcoming game from Valve which seemingly combines elements of the MOBA and hero shooter genres.

Players build, explore, and survive on deserted maps filled with profitable spice, but be aware of the sand worms and other players, as they will all pose a constant threat. \u003cem\u003eDune: Awakening\u003c/em\u003e blends survival and RPG mechanics into a sandbox game. While still being true to the story\u0026#39;s dense lore, the game really captures the feel of both Dune’s political tension and its deadly desert ecosystem perfectly. You can align with different factions to shift the political landscape, and you can also create your own bases or outposts. It looks ambitious, and that’s probably why so many people are keeping their eye on it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n                \n                                \n                    \n    \n

It features a mix of aerial combat, third-person shooting, and melee combat, all with great visuals and a unique anime-style. There\u0026#39;s also a battle royale mode where dozens of players drop onto a battlefield in mech suits and scrap it out for survival. The designs look great, the action is flashy, and all of this results in a rare blend of competitive shooter and mech sim that feels arcade-ish but still very modern.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n

It combines team tactics with fast gunplay as you scavenge, craft, and fight your way through post-apocalyptic environments. Matches can shift between PvE and PvPvE depending on the mission. It’s got a retro-future aesthetic and high mobility, encouraging vertical movement and incentivizing outmaneuvering enemies over direct combat. Originally delayed, the game has seen a lot of polish in its previews and seems to be gunning for a late 2025 launch.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n                \n
