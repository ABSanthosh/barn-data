  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Source: Google Google One now offers a yearly subscription for Google AI Pro at a lower overall price than paying monthly. Google One provides value with its Premium plan at $100 per year, offering 2TB storage without AI features. Higher-priced plans with Gemini offer advanced features, showcasing the latest developments in AI technology. For the internet’s power users, living today without some sort of cloud storage subscription can prove to be quite difficult. Sure, you can have loads of hard drives and take them wherever you go, but having another on-the-go backup is a great idea. Google One, the cloud storage service through — you guessed it — Google, gives users 15GB of free storage just for having an account. This storage is shared all across Google’s products, so utilizing Drive, Gmail, and Photos can quickly lead to a lack of cloud storage space. There are a ton of Google One subscriptions available, and each tier gives you some sort of additional storage or feature that the other doesn’t have. The higher-priced subscriptions include access to advanced versions of Google Gemini, the company’s multimodal AI, but not all of those subscriptions included yearly subscriptions until now. Related How Google One ended my constant phone storage panic Phone storage worries are gone, and peace of mind is here to stay First spotted by 9to5Google, and perhaps, other keen-eyed Google One subscribers looking to re-up their service, Google AI Pro is now available as a yearly subscription. Previously, it was only available as a monthly subscription at $20 per month, making it a $240 subscription over the course of one year. The now-locked-in annual price is set at $200, representing a 16% decrease (or two months for the price of 12, or $40 off, whatever way that most works for your cost-saving brains). When the plan launched last year, the 5TB storage version of Google AI Pro (which is only 2TB) launched with a yearly subscription price of $250, making it only $10 more expensive over the course of 12 months for a monthly AI Pro subscription. We’re not sure what Google was thinking, but for those users looking to grab a yearly Google AI Pro subscription, the time has now come. Google One is a solid investment, especially for non-AI users Source: Lucas Gouveia/Android Police | F8 studio/Shutterstock While Google AI Pro is the cheapest plan on the Google One hemisphere with access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, we’d reckon that most people have no use for the Pro version of Gemini (plenty do, however, as shown by Google One’s rapid growth). Basic Gemini functionality does just enough, and it’s free to use regardless of whether you subscribe to Google One. However, we think Google One offers great value when you slice the price of a yearly subscription to AI Pro in half and instead get the Premium plan at $100 per year. You still get 2TB of storage and all the non-AI features. Overall, Google One has ended some of our constant phone storage panic. For those who want to buy into the higher-priced plans with Gemini, you’ll be able to see the highest public — and somewhat private— capabilities that the LLM has to offer. Every day, new developments are showcasing themselves, and we attempt to cover all the latest updates here on Android Police. From an upcoming Gemini for Android change that will let you use more apps with fewer privacy concerns, to Gemini Live bringing live captions to the screen during conversations, this is both an exciting and nerve-racking time in the tech world.",

subscription. Previously, it was only available as a monthly subscription at $20 per month, making it a $240 subscription over the course of one year. The now-locked-in annual price is set at $200, representing a 16% decrease (or two months for the price of 12, or $40 off, whatever way that most works for your cost-saving brains). When the plan launched last year, the 5TB storage version of Google AI Pro (which is \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e 2TB) launched with a yearly subscription price of $250, making it only $10 more expensive over the course of 12 months for a monthly AI Pro subscription.
