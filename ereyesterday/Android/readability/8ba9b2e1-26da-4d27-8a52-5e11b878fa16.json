Everyone needs the internet these days. Whether your device of choice is a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or even your smart TV, you're going to need to have access to the internet to make the most of any of these devices. A lot of internet usage goes down at home too, which explains why home internet plans are so popular. Verizon has several home internet options, and one of the best choices among them is the 5G Home Plus plan, which normally costs $80 monthly. However, Verizon typically offers a $35 discount to bring it down to $45 a month. Unfortunately, a quiet change means that new customers are going to have to pay more every month. Verizon's 5G Home Plus Reduces Its Discount for New Customers Image: Verizon There are a lot of things that the average person has to pay for these days—your cellular carrier, video streaming, music streaming, internet, cloud storage, home internet, and so on. The burden of all those subscriptions is why a “measly” $5 increase on one shouldn't be shrugged away as something inconsequential. Over the course of a year, several price hikes can take a toll on your finances. I think that's what makes it even more annoying that Verizon has decided to find a way to hike the price of one of its 5G home internet plans but in one of the least obvious ways that it could find. Spotted on Reddit, the mobile carrier has decided not to actually increase the price of its service but to reduce the amount offered with the discount. The Verizon 5G Home Plus plan is the one affected in particular. Normally, customers would get a $35 discount on the plan, which typically cost $80 each month. That would mean you'd only pay $45. However, that discount has been slashed for new customers and has now dropped to $25. That means new customers will be paying $55 each month—that's $10 more and that's hardly negligible. The Price Hike Isn't All for Nothing, at the Very Least Image: Verizon While price increases almost generally suck, the blow can be softened a bit when you know that you're getting additional value in some way or another. That seems to be the case with this Verizon price hike. In the same Reddit post exposing this increase, one user states that paying $55 monthly now comes with the minor perk of offering you a free subscription worth at least $10. It wasn't there before, but it is now, so at least there's something making that extra $10 worth it. Unfortunately, there's no way to opt out of this perk and restore the $10 discount, so you might as well just take advantage of it. This Isn't the First Price Increase That We're Seeing From Verizon in 2025 Image: Verizon One thing that makes this quite annoying is that it will be the third price hike that we've seen from Verizon this year. We're in March so that pretty much comes to a hike a month so far. Those aren't very consumer-friendly numbers. The first of the bunch was a reduction in the multi-line discount that myPlan users were enjoying, and the second was a hike in pricing for multi-device Verizon Protect plans. And now, we have another discount being sliced for more favorable numbers on the company's balance books.
