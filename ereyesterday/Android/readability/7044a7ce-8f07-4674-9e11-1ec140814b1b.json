Paired with Gemini, they can see and hear what you do, so they understand your context, remember what's important to you and provide information right when you need it.These glasses are equipped with a camera and microphones, giving Gemini the ability to see and hear the world while speakers let you listen to the AI, play music or take calls. And an optional, in-lens display privately shows you helpful information. The glasses also work with your phone, letting you access your apps while keeping your hands free.We've started gathering feedback on our prototype with trusted testers. For now, you can sign up for our newsletter for updates on device availability and watch our I/O demo of how helpful Android XR glasses can be in the real world.",
