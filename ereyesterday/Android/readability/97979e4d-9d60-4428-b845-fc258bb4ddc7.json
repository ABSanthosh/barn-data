You can now grab the Sony WH-1000XM4 (Certified Refurbished) for just $159 on Amazon—down from the original $349 MSRP. That’s nearly 55% off one of the best wireless headphones around. 👉 If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is a solid time to act. Check current pricing on Amazon while it’s still available. These aren’t just good headphones. They’ve been consistently recommended for years, even as newer models like the WH-1000XM5 have entered the market. And for good reason. What Makes the WH-1000XM4 So Good in 2025? Even though newer models have been released, the WH-1000XM4 still stands out as one of the best all-around wireless headphones you can get. The sound profile is warm, detailed, and surprisingly immersive—whether you’re listening to music, taking calls, or just zoning out with a podcast. It delivers that rich bass and clarity you want without overdoing it. What really makes them shine, though, is the noise cancellation. It’s powerful enough to quiet a busy office, a noisy train, or even the dull roar of airplane engines. Once you put them on, the outside world fades, and it’s easy to focus, relax, or just enjoy whatever you’re listening to. Comfort is another huge win here. You can wear them for hours without needing to adjust or take breaks. The ear cups are soft and breathable, and the whole frame feels light without being flimsy. Combined with the foldable design, they’re incredibly easy to toss into a bag and take on the go. You also get around 30 hours of battery life on a full charge, and if you’re in a rush, a quick 10-minute top-up gives you about 5 hours of use. Pairing is quick and stable, and you can connect to two devices at once—so it’s easy to jump between your laptop and phone without fiddling with settings. All in all, this is one of those rare products that keeps delivering long after newer models have come out. It hits the sweet spot between performance, comfort, and everyday reliability. 💡 Considering what you’re getting at this price, it’s a tough deal to beat. See if it’s still live on Amazon before it disappears again. Why Pick the XM4 Over the XM5? If you’re wondering why not just go for the newer WH-1000XM5, it really comes down to design and comfort. Many users prefer the XM4’s foldable design, which makes it much more travel-friendly. The XM5s might offer slightly better ANC in lab tests, but most real-world listeners won’t notice a major leap. If you’re wondering whether to go for the WH-1000XM4 or spend more on the newer XM5, it really comes down to what you value most. For most people, you’re not missing much. Unless you absolutely need the latest hardware every time, the XM4 delivers everything you’d want—and at a better price. For most people, you’re not missing out on much. Unless you’re someone who absolutely needs the latest hardware every time, the XM4 delivers everything you’d want in a pair of premium noise-canceling headphones, and then some. Who Is It Perfect For? Whether you fly often and want peace on a plane, work in a noisy office, or just need reliable, all-day listening, the XM4 handles it all with ease. It’s the kind of gear that doesn’t draw attention to itself—it just works, day after day. Battery life still clocks in at a solid 30 hours, and fast charging gets you 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes. Add intuitive touch controls and multi-device pairing, and it’s easy to see why so many reviewers still crown these the “everyday king” of noise-canceling headphones. $159 is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the WH-1000XM4 outside of Black Friday. Whether you’re upgrading from older ANC cans or grabbing your first premium pair, this deal delivers maximum value. 👉 Grab yours now on Amazon before the price jumps Note: this article may contain affiliate links that help support our authors and keep the Phandroid servers running.",
