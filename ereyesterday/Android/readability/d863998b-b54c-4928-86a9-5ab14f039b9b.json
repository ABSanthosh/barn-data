  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account At some point, Android just got boring. It drifted away from its customizable roots, became too polished, and ended up with a stale look and feel. Fortunately, Google's Android 16 update brings a lot of welcome changes and Material 3 Expressive has been a breath of fresh air, offering a well-balanced mix of a refined OS and support for your customization needs. Related The best part about this is that Google has been slowly introducing Material 3 Expressive elements to its other apps and services, bringing welcome UI enhancements. We've known for some time that these updates would eventually find their way to Wear OS, with the beta giving us an early look, and it now appears that users are finally seeing changes roll out on their wrists with new look in the Phone app. A small but welcome change The folks at 9to5Google have pointed out that the Phone app on Wear OS is getting a UI refresh, bringing small but welcome changes to the look and feel. While the previous UI stuck with circular design elements, this new change brings a more elongated end button. Users on Reddit have been posting about the new change, showing off images of the update on their wearables. In addition to the above, the mute and three-dot menu button when on a call are more centered with the new update, bringing a more balanced look. Again, this isn't a huge change by any means, but it's better than nothing. Recently, Google also updated Keep with Material 3 Expressive, along with the Phone app on Android. We anticipate that more UI updates are coming, but it's anyone's guess where the changes will land. In addition to its latest OS update, Google is set to launch its new phones on August 20. While the brand hasn't confirmed what's coming, we have a pretty good idea thanks to months of leaks and rumors. In addition to the new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, we also anticipate that Google will unveil a new foldable Pixel phone as well. Fans of Google's foldable will be happy to know that the latest model should come in with a larger screen and battery. While there might not be huge changes to the phone, there's a good chance that it could end up beating Samsung in the battle of foldable phones. Again, we'll just have to wait to find out.",
