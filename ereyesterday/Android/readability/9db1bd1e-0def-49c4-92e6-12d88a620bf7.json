  "text": "We live in an era where remasters can breathe new life into beloved classics, making them accessible to new generations while preserving their legacy for longtime fans. But not every remaster is created equal. Sometimes, developers and publishers take the lazy route, slapping on minor visual updates or halfhearted tweaks without respecting what made the originals special. These games deserved far better treatment, and fans deserved far more respect. 5 Mafia II: Definitive Edition Bugs, laziness, and lost potential An empty sandbox in 2010 wasn’t exactly a rare occurrence, but even back then, Mafia II felt underwhelming compared to the open-world standards being set. Still, the game carved out a special place in many gamers' hearts thanks to its gripping story, rich atmosphere, and unforgettable characters. A decade later, however, Mafia II: Definitive Edition proved that sometimes, a remaster can actually make a game worse. After the fantastic full-blown remake of the first Mafia game — a remake that made me believe firmly in the significance of modern-day retellings — I had high hopes for Mafia II. Sadly, the so-called remaster amounted to little more than a few extra NPCs sprinkled in and a fresh batch of game-breaking bugs, many of which still haven’t been fixed. Performance issues, strange lighting, awkward character models — it all added up to a remaster that felt rushed and careless. In the end, instead of elevating Mafia II for a new generation, it buried the original's best qualities under layers of technical problems. It wasn’t just lazy — it was borderline disrespectful to the story and the world that made the game beloved in the first place.

After all, we were supposed to get the classic feel of the Pro Skater series on our powerful Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles — a dream for anyone who grew up with the originals. Alas, that wasn’t to be. The HD collection promised the same addictive flow and smoothness of the older games, but a new physics engine almost ensured that fun wouldn’t be on the menu, thanks to the core gameplay — the skating itself — feeling stiff and awkward. Add to that the baffling decision to leave out beloved levels like Chicago, The Bullring, and Skate Street, while introducing new bugs and glitches, and it became painfully clear that this was little more than a lazy cash grab. Even basic features like local multiplayer, something the original games proudly had, were missing. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 would later come along as a brilliant apology. Still, Pro Skater HD remains a sad reminder that nostalgia alone isn’t enough — the soul has to be preserved too. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is unavailable on online storefronts.

Over the course of the 12 years since GTA V’s release, Rockstar has seemingly refused to move the franchise forward, instead re-releasing it for newer consoles time and again. Meanwhile, when gamers desperately wished for something to celebrate, they were served the so-called Definitive Edition of the original 3D trilogy — GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. Now, GTA III alone was one of the most important games in history, and I can never gush enough about just how magical and formative this trilogy was for millions of players. But what we got was a disaster: enhanced lighting masking horrific texture work, iconic characters turned unrecognizable, broken cutscenes, cut animations, and once-meticulous details ruined by lazy AI upscaling. It was painful. I remember pausing my San Andreas playthrough to start over with the remaster, full of hope, and abandoning it halfway just to go back to my old, dusty laptop where the real magic still lived. A masterclass in how not to handle a beloved legacy.

Promising to bring Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 into a new era of modern gaming and hardware, the HD collection ultimately ended up being significantly inferior, largely due to Konami losing the original games’ source code and being unable to provide it to the remaster's developers, Hijinx Studios. As such, the devs had to pivot, writing their own code for the game in many parts. Unsurprisingly, it resulted in bugs and glitches galore, where the iconic fog of Silent Hill was either not present or way too thick to see even a couple of feet ahead. This either served to take away the fear factor of walking through the streets of Silent Hill or make the experience too frustrating. Not only were these remastered editions inferior in visuals and presentation, but they even performed terribly. These remakes failed to capture the atmospheric tension of the original games. It’s such a relief that Silent Hill 2, arguably the best entry in the franchise, received its flowers through a proper remake in 2024, and delivered the best, most definitive version of the game.

Now at 25, I wonder — was the fear part of the fun all along? Just go emulate it The Metal Gear Solid franchise is older than I am, and that alone is enough for me to put massive amounts of respect on the series’ name. Sadly, that wasn’t the case for the game’s Master Collection, released in 2023. By that time, the precedent — and pitfalls — for a remaster were known industry-wide, and the bar had been set by excellent remasters. Why then did Konami call this a ‘remastered’ version when they didn’t even bother upgrading textures or even the resolution, which didn’t even run at full HD? Sure, the games played stably, but the controls remained janky, and not a single game in the collection played at 60fps… in 2023. Calling the MGS Master Collection Vol 1 a lazy remaster is still a bit of an overstatement, as this was nothing short of a shoddy port made to sell for new machines. It’s honestly a better experience emulating these older games without having to shell out $20 for them, which is about $20 more than what one should pay for this ‘remaster’.

Let's take a dive into the past and remember them. What makes a good remaster? Remasters of iconic games must remember that the goal is always to preserve the original games’ essence while never losing respect for the atmosphere and soul that made them worthy of a re-telling in the first place. Visual overhauls and graphical upgrades are certainly nice to look at, but they quickly lose their luster if the other core elements — gameplay, physics, performance, and immersion — haven’t been treated with the same care and love. When remasters are handled lazily, they don’t just tarnish the memory of great games — they betray the players who carried those memories with them for years. We deserved better.",

dog were excited for \u003cem\u003eTony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD\u003c/em\u003e to hit modern hardware in 2012. After all, we were supposed to get the classic feel of the \u003cem\u003ePro Skater\u003c/em\u003e series on our powerful Xbox 360 and \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/i-tried-emulating-ps3-games-on-the-raspberry-pi/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlayStation 3 consoles\u003c/a\u003e — a dream for anyone who grew up with the originals. Alas, that wasn’t to be. The HD collection promised the same addictive flow and smoothness of the older games, but a new physics engine almost ensured that fun wouldn’t be on the menu, thanks to the core gameplay — the skating itself — feeling stiff and awkward.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAdd to that the baffling decision to leave out beloved levels like Chicago, The Bullring, and Skate Street, while introducing new bugs and glitches, and it became painfully clear that this was little more than a lazy cash grab. Even basic \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/co-op-games-to-play-with-non-gamer-partner/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efeatures like local multiplayer\u003c/a\u003e, something the original games proudly had, were missing. \u003cem\u003eTony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2\u003c/em\u003e would later come along as a brilliant apology. Still, \u003cem\u003ePro\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Skater HD\u003c/em\u003e remains a sad reminder that nostalgia alone isn’t enough — the soul has to be preserved too.\u003c/p\u003e

Meanwhile, when gamers desperately wished for something to celebrate, they were served the so-called Definitive Edition of the original 3D trilogy — \u003cem\u003eGTA III\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eVice City\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eSan Andreas\u003c/em\u003e.

Promising to bring \u003cem\u003eSilent Hill 2 \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eSilent Hill 3\u003c/em\u003e into a new era of modern gaming and hardware, the HD collection ultimately ended up being significantly inferior, largely due to Konami losing the original games’ source code and being unable to provide it to the remaster\u0026#39;s developers, Hijinx Studios. As such, the devs had to pivot, writing their own code for the game in many parts.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnsurprisingly, it resulted in bugs and glitches galore, where the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/everything-about-silent-hill-f-so-far/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiconic fog of Silent Hill\u003c/a\u003e was either not present or way too thick to see even a couple of feet ahead. This either served to take away the fear factor of walking through the streets of Silent Hill or make the experience too frustrating. Not only were these remastered editions inferior in visuals and presentation, but they even performed terribly. These remakes failed to capture the atmospheric tension of the original games.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s such a relief that \u003cem\u003eSilent Hill 2\u003c/em\u003e, arguably the best

Sadly, that wasn’t the case for the game’s \u003cem\u003eMaster Collection\u003c/em\u003e, released in 2023. By that time, the precedent — and pitfalls — for a remaster were known industry-wide, and the bar had been set by excellent remasters. Why then did Konami call this a ‘remastered’ version when they didn’t even bother upgrading textures or even the resolution, which didn’t even run at full HD?\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSure, the games played stably, but the controls remained janky, and not a single game in the collection played at 60fps… in 2023. Calling the \u003cem\u003eMGS Master Collection Vol 1 \u003c/em\u003ea lazy remaster is still a bit of an overstatement, as this was nothing short of a shoddy port made to sell for new machines. It’s honestly a better experience emulating these older games without having to shell out $20 for them, which is about $20 more than what one should pay for this ‘remaster’.\u003c/p\u003e

When remasters are handled lazily, they don’t just tarnish the memory of great games — they betray the players who carried those memories with them for years. We deserved better.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
