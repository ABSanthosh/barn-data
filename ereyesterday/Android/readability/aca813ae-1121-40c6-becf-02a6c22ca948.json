And according to leaks, these earbuds could show up with higher battery capacity than the FE. Allegedly, the upcoming Galaxy Buds Core will feature a 500mAh battery in its charging case, while each earbud will have a 100mAh battery capacity.That said, Gadgets360 seems to have spotted these new buds on Samsung's UAE website briefly before it was taken down. However, the publication got its hands on the possible specs of the buds. They noted that the Galaxy Buds Core earbuds will show up in two colorways: black and white. They will also reportedly offer active noise cancellation (ANC) and Galaxy AI features, \"including Interpreter and Live Translate for real-time translation when paired with compatible Samsung Galaxy devices.\"Galaxy Buds Core batteries have leaked• Case: 500mah battery • Buds: 100mah battery (each)Buds have 34mah larger batteries and 21mah larger case battery than the Buds FE pic.twitter.com/y0Bo4UogMeMay 23, 2025Additionally, Galaxy Buds Core will supposedly come with Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity and will include a touch sensor on each bud, with an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.
