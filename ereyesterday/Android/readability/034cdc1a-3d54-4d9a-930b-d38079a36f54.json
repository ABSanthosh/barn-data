  "text": "If you own a Xiaomi 14, then you might want to check your phone for the latest software update, which finally comes with Android 15. New reports indicate that global models of the phone have started receiving the stable version of Android 15, which interestingly still features HyperOS 1.1, in addition to some behind-the-scene changes and tweaks to the UI. Users in Europe can expect the update to come with software version OS1.1.4.0.VNCEUXM; for other regions, the update comes with version number OS1.1.3.0.VNCMIXM. From the looks of things, HyperOS 2.0 with Android 15 is still exclusive for Chinese markets, although it has since been available for other Xiaomi 14 series models. Recently, Xiaomi also unveiled the Xiaomi 15, one of the first Android flagships to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip from Qualcomm. It also packs a 6.36-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and comes in a “custom edition” with 20 additional colors. There’s also a choice of up to 16GB RAM and 1TB of storage; this entire setup is powered by a 5,400 mAh battery with support for 90W wired and 50W wireless charging speeds. Source: GSMArena",
