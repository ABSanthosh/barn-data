  "text": "Oppo recently unveiled the F29 series, which includes two smartphones - Oppo F29 and Oppo F29 Pro. We've received the Pro model, so let's take a closer look at it. The Oppo F29 Pro arrived in a white retail box, including a clear case, a SIM ejector tool, some documents, a charging cable, and an 80W power adapter. The Oppo F29 Pro packs a 6.7\" 10-bit FullHD+ quad-curved AMOLED display with 1,200 nits peak brightness and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. The panel has a 240Hz touch sampling rate and a 120Hz screen refresh rate. The display settings let you select between Auto, Standard, and High refresh rate modes. The first mode chooses the optimal refresh rate that strikes a balance between a smooth experience and battery efficiency. The second mode refreshes the screen at 60Hz, while the third mode refreshes the screen at up to 120Hz. The panel supports three refresh rates - 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz. Moreover, the display is advertised to work even when you are wearing gloves or have wet hands. The Oppo F29 Pro also supports HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG codecs and comes with Widevine L1 certification, allowing 1080p video streaming in supported apps. Its screen also has a punch-hole in the center for the 16MP selfie camera with an f/2.4 aperture and an FOV of 85°. The camera can record videos in up to 1080p resolution at 30 fps. Underneath the display is an optical fingerprint scanner, which is fast and accurate. But, as is the case with optical in-display fingerprint scanners on most other phones, this one's also placed close to the lower bezel. Placing it a tad higher would've improved the phone-unlocking experience. Around the back, we have a circular camera island surrounded by a shiny plate that picked some fingerprint smudges during the short time we spent with the phone. Oppo F29 Pro These are the best offers from our affiliate partners.

The additional circle you see is just for aesthetics. The 2MP monochrome unit has f/2.4 aperture and an FOV of 89°, while the 50MP primary camera has f/1.8 aperture and 76° FOV. It has both OIS and EIS and can record 4K videos at 30 fps. The Oppo F29 Pro comes in Marble White and Granite Black colors, and it's the former that we've received which is the subject of this article. The Marble White model's back panel has a matte finish, which did a good job at resisting fingerprint smudges, and while the name has \"marble\" in it, the design actually looks like the top of the snow-capped mountain peaks when light falls on the cover at different angles. The F29 Pro is slim and sturdy, and we like its overall build. However, like the Oppo Reno13 Pro, its back panel is flat, which, when paired with the quad-curved AMOLED display, made for a not-so-great in-hand experience for the author of this article. Perhaps adding a bit of curvature to the edges would've been nice. The smartphone's frame looks shiny, but it is not glossy, meaning no smudges. The right-side frame features the volume rocker and power button having good feedback. At the bottom is the USB-C with a SIM card slot, primary mic, and a speaker grille. Up top is the IR blaster. Ports and controls The Oppo F29 Pro is powered by the Dimensity 7300 Energy SoC and comes with up to 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. It boots Android 15 with ColorOS 15 on top. The smartphone is pre-loaded with 20 third-party apps and games. While these can be uninstalled if you want, it's still too much, and we'd like Oppo to reduce the number of pre-installed third-party apps on its phones.

Oppo says the bundled adapter can juice up the battery up to 45% in 20 minutes. Other highlights of the Oppo F29 Pro include dual stereo speakers, IP66, IP68, and IP69 rating, and underwater photography. It also has MIL-STD-810H certification.

Its 8GB/128GB version is priced at INR27,999 ($330/€305) while the 8GB/256GB and 12GB/256GB models cost INR29,999 ($350/€325) and INR31,999 ($375/€345), respectively.",
