  "text": "Garmin Forerunner 255 $200 $350 Save $150 Heart Rate Monitor Yes Color Screen Yes Notification Support Yes Battery Life Up to 12 days (41mm); Up to 14 days (46mm) Onboard GPS Yes This is the smartwatch you need if you're looking to track your health and fitness metrics without it costing a lot of money. The Garmin Forerunner 255 delivers everything you need and more, and now comes in at just $200. Summer's here, which means it's a great time to soak in some sun and get outdoors to enjoy the fantastic weather. With that said, if you've been looking to get a better reading on your health and physical activities, and want a simple and affordable way to track them all, then a smartwatch is going to be an excellent tool. While smartwatches from Samsung, Google, and Apple are all pretty good, none of them come close to a Garmin when you factor in its ability to track data and battery life. Although there are plenty of great Garmin smartwatches to choose from, we think that the Garmin Forerunner 255 provides a lot of bang for your buck, especially with its newly discounted price for Prime Day. What's great about the Garmin Forerunner 255? The Forerunner 255 is a watch built for runners, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have the ability to track other activities as well. This watch comes in at 46mm and has a lightweight design that weighs just 1.7 ounces. Perhaps most important is that it can last up to 14 days on a single charge, which is far more than most competitors. The Forerunner 255 helps you stay on track with a morning report, tailored for you, that provides an overview of your body. It can produce this data thanks to the heart rate and other sensors that are onboard the watch, which also provide insight on your stress levels and sleep quality. There are over 30 activities that are built into the watch, providing you with a variety of ways to track your data. The watch can even suggest daily workouts to improve your performance. There's even a Garmin Coach, which can help you train for running events. Perhaps one of the more powerful tools is the recovery monitor, sharing just how much time you'll need to be at peak again. Just in case you like to go off the beaten path, you'll be happy to know that the Forerunner also features multi-band GNSS for pinpoint accuracy when it comes to tracking. And since this is a smartwatch, you're also going to get notifications from a connected device straight to your wrist. Garmin Pay will even let you pay for things at supported check-out terminals. As stated before, this is a powerful tool to have if you've been looking to track your health and fitness metrics. Not only does it do a great job, but it also doesn't require you to charge it every few days. And the price right now can't be beat, as it falls to just $200 for a limited time during Prime Day.",

With that said, if you\u0026#39;ve been looking to get a better reading on your health and physical activities, and want a simple and affordable way to track them all, then a smartwatch is going to be an excellent tool.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-prime-day-2025-deals/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Amazon Prime Day 2025 promotional banner from Android Police\" src=\"https://static0.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_0103.png\"/\u003e\n \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-smartwatches/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esmartwatches\u003c/a\u003e from Samsung, Google, and Apple are all pretty good, none of them come close to a Garmin when you factor in its ability to track data and battery life. Although there are plenty of great Garmin smartwatches to choose from, we think that the Garmin Forerunner 255 provides a lot of bang for your buck, especially with its newly discounted price for Prime Day.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-39-s-great-about-the-garmin-forerunner-255\"\u003e\n                        What\u0026#39;s great about the Garmin Forerunner 255?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Forerunner 255 is a watch built for runners, but that doesn\u0026#39;t mean it doesn\u0026#39;t have the ability to track other activities as well. This watch comes in at 46mm and has a lightweight design that weighs just 1.7 ounces. Perhaps most important is that it can last up to 14 days on a single charge, which is far more than most competitors.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe Forerunner 255 helps you stay on track with a morning report, tailored for you, that provides an overview of your body. It can produce this data thanks to the heart rate and other sensors that are onboard the watch, which also provide insight on your stress levels and sleep quality.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThere are over 30 activities that are built into the watch, providing you with a variety of ways to track your data. The watch can even suggest daily workouts to improve your performance. There\u0026#39;s even a Garmin Coach, which can help you train for running events. Perhaps one of the more powerful tools is the recovery monitor, sharing just how much time you\u0026#39;ll need to be at peak again.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eJust in case you like to go off the beaten path, you\u0026#39;ll be happy to know that the Forerunner also features multi-band GNSS for pinpoint accuracy when it comes to tracking. And since this is a smartwatch, you\u0026#39;re also going to get notifications from a connected device straight to your wrist. Garmin Pay will even let you pay for things at supported check-out terminals.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs stated before, this is a powerful tool to have if you\u0026#39;ve been looking to track your health and fitness metrics. Not only does it do a great job, but it also doesn\u0026#39;t require you to charge it every few days. And the price right now can\u0026#39;t be beat, as it falls to just $200 for a limited time during Prime Day.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
