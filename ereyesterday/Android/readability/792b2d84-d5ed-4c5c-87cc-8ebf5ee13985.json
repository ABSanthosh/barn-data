Either way, vivo led in shipments for the full year - that's pretty much a given at this point. Also, Huawei was in second place and even the percentages of the pie are similar. According to CR, Huawei grew the most compared to 2023 at 36.4%, followed by Xiaomi with 10.2% and vivo with 7%. All the other brands shipped less units than in 2023, with Apple falling the hardest (12.6%), followed by Oppo (10.4%) and Honor (2.8%). If we look at just Q4 (October to December), CR says Huawei took the lead with 18.1%, followed by Xiaomi with 17.2%, Apple with 17.1%, vivo with 16.3%, Honor with 13.6%, and Oppo with 12.5%. In Q4, compared to Q4 of 2023, Huawei grew the most (15.5%), followed by vivo (8%) and Xiaomi (3.9%), while Apple lost the most (18.2%), followed by Honor (12.8%) and Oppo (9.3%). Source",
