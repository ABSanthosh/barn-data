  "text": "(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) After a year with the amazing Onyx Boox Palma, I was looking forward to seeing a big Black Friday sale so I could recommend it as the go-to e-reader this holiday season. Unfortunately, Amazon only slashed the price by 12%, meaning it's not much cheaper than the Boox Palma 2 that just came out.While I normally would recommend picking up a year-old device for a great discount, the Palma 2 is the better buy even though it's currently $279. How does this make any sense? Simply put, newer can be notably better in the world of cheap e-readers for a few hidden reasons, most of all is software support.The Boox Palma 2 runs Android 13 while the original Palma is still on Android 11 and likely won't get updated to anything newer. Aside from some nice new features, that means the Palma 2 can run apps for at least two years longer than the original Palma because there's going to be a point where apps no longer support Android 11. Considering apps are THE reason to pick a Boox over other e-readers, this is enough for me to recommend the newer unit.✅Recommended if: You're looking to give your eyes a rest from your phone's harsh display, or you just want a more pocketable e-reader that's capable of running full Android apps.❌Skip this deal if: You only read books through Amazon's Kindle service. There are cheaper Kindles that are less than half the price of this.I called the original Onyx Boox Palma \"the perfect bedtime device\" in my review, and the second iteration improves the experience in a few small ways. Onyx didn't try to reinvent the wheel or radically alter the experience for the Palma 2, but it did include a faster processor, better speakers, and a fingerprint reader nestled in the power button.The processor improvement makes everyday computing a little quicker and just generally improves the overall experience. Onyx also added a few extra new features to the device including an AI assistant that can answer questions, keeping your phone in your pocket (or in a cabinet) while you stay as distraction-free as possible.The Palma 2 features the same amazing super fast refresh e-ink display as the original, which means it's perfect for scrolling through web pages, books, and plenty of other apps without having that classic e-reader refresh jank. Plus, it's super friendly on the eyes with no nasty PWM dimming or flickering backlight.And while the Palma 2 is certainly capable of playing games, you're probably going to want to stick to crossword puzzles or Wordle-type games because it's tough to play most modern games on the black-and-white display. There's a reason the original GameBoy had simplistic games, so stick to those if you really want that from this device.
