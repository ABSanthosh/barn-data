For years, Android users have been unable to officially access Apple TV, but it looks like the Cupertino company has had a change of heart. Android users who are interested in the app can now download it via the Play Store. The app is compatible with Android phones, tablets, and foldable devices. Users can subscribe to Apple TV+ directly through their Google Play accounts, with a seven-day free trial available for new subscribers. They will also be able to use features such as offline downloads and saved watchlists. For those unfamiliar, Apple TV+ is the company’s answer to streaming services like Netflix. However, Apple TV+ typically focuses on original content. This means that its library of shows won’t be as extensive compared to Netflix or Disney+. However, Apple has created quite a number of popular series including Severance, Slow Horses, The Morning Show, Presumed Innocent, Shrinking, Hijack, Loot, Palm Royale, Masters of the Air, and Ted Lasso. The app also provides users with access to the MLS Season Pass, offering live coverage of Major League Soccer matches without blackout restrictions. That being said, we can understand why Apple didn’t really think an Android release was a top priority. Apple definitely wants more users on its platform where the Apple TV app is already available, so it’s not surprising that the Android version was a low priority development. In any case, we suppose better late than never! A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Writer of tech with over a decade of experience.
