This has been leaked today in a couple of live hands-on images, which you can see below. We also have specs to talk about. Intriguingly, the 70X Lite will be powered by a Snapdragon chipset, unlike the 70X which uses the Kirin 8000A.

This means the Lite version won't have 5G support since Huawei can't use 5G Snapdragon chips due to the US sanctions against it. Huawei Enjoy 70X Lite leaked hands-on images It will be offered in black, white, and blue with 128/256/512GB of storage. It has a 6.78-inch curved OLED screen with 1224x2700 resolution, a 50 MP main camera, a 2 MP depth sensor, and an 8 MP selfie snapper. Keeping the lights on is a 6,100 mAh battery with support for 40W fast wired charging. It runs HarmonyOS 4.2. Compared to the 70X, its main camera sensor isn't RYYB, it doesn't have NFC, and while it does support Beidou satellite messaging, it can't send pictures via satellite messaging. The 128GB model will also not have any kind of satellite messaging support whatsoever, and will be sold online only. So, this is basically an Enjoy 70X with a different chipset, a lesser main camera, less capable satellite messaging (or none at all in its cheapest iteration), and no NFC. Otherwise the two seem identical. As the name implies, the Enjoy 70X Lite should be cheaper. Source (in Chinese)",
