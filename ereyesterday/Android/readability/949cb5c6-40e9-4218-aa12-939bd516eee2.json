The Galaxy S25 Slim is rumored to join the unsurprising S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra with slimness obviously being its main selling point. Today a prototype Galaxy S25 Slim has been spotted in the Geekbench online results database. Specifically, it's the model headed to North America - the SM-S937U. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC paired with 12GB of RAM, and runs Android 15 with One UI 7 on top.

As you can see in the screenshot above, it managed a single-core score of 3,005 and a multi-core score of 6,945. That's a very low multi-core score for this chipset which generally goes up to the high 9,000s, but we do usually caution you not to take benchmark scores by prototype devices very seriously. That said, on this occasion we can't help but wonder whether the S25 Slim's thinness may be negatively impacting its heat dissipation capability to such a big extent. Whether that theoretical compromise is worth it or not remains to be seen - the Galaxy S25 Slim is rumored to be under 7mm thin, and that will undoubtedly create a striking look. Until you go ahead and put a case on it, that is. Source",
