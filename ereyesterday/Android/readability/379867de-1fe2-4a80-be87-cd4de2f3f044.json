  "text": "Introduction This year, Sony released a new addition to the high-end active noise-canceling (ANC) WH-1000X series, following a three-year hiatus. The new WH-1000XM6 model comes with a promise of \"the best noise cancellation\" (according to Sony's official website), but also a $50 price hike. I've been an avid user of the series since the WH-1000XM2, so it was a joy to test out the new XM6 and see how well they're performing in comparison to Sony's older models. Design and comfort The Sony WH-1000XM6 are a full-sized pair of over-ear headphones. They come in three colors: Black, Midnight Blue, and Platinum Silver. They feature the standard two buttons on the left ear cup - on/off and a noise-canceling/ambient mode button alongside a 3.5 mm jack and a USB-C port for charging on the right ear cup. With the XM6, Sony has redesigned the power button to a round shape, making it easier to locate by touch. The touch controls remain unchanged from previous models. The headphones are made from the same carbon fiber composite material. The earpads cover my ears perfectly without squishing them. The ear cups are more fingerprint-resistant than the XM5. Overall, they're comfortable to wear and don't seem to cause undue sweating or discomfort during long-term usage. Although the headband has noticeably less padding than the XM5, it remains comfortable and doesn't cause any unpleasantness. The headphone case is slightly more compact and easier to open, thanks to a magnetic handle that's more convenient than the zipper used on previous models. Inside, there's the standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable alongside a short USB-C cable for charging. While the design in general is similar to that of the headphones' predecessor, the hinges make a big return with the XM6. The headphones can be folded and placed in a more compact case, like models older than the XM5. Arguably, removing the hinges from the XM5 was among the most controversial design decisions Sony made when designing the series. Sony WH-1000XM6 folded. Personally, I found the folding process finicky and cumbersome compared to previous models. On top of that, the case isn't that much more compact - it's only 3 cm shorter and 2 cm narrower. Additionally, the hinge enables the top band to pivot asymmetrically, while the ear cups curve upward and inward from the base of the headphones. Possibly due to this curvature, I found the XM6 to be a bit more challenging to put on correctly, often resulting in the earpads not sealing properly around the ears. A snug fit is important not just for comfort but for optimal ANC performance. More on that later. Sony WH-1000XM5 and WH-1000XM6 cases side-by-side. Overall, the Sony WH-1000XM6 are well-built and comfortable to wear. In my opinion, the folding feature is somewhat overrated, although that ultimately comes down to personal preference. Software and features The Sony WH1000XM6 use the Sony Sound Connect app on iOS and Android. The app, previously known as Sony Headphones Connect, has been indispensable for Sony wireless headphones for a number of years. I personally find the app too bloated and buggy; for example, it'd persistently forget specific settings I've turned on or off (such as Speak-to-Chat). On a fresh installation, the app guides the user through cumbersome, unskippable tutorials and other initial setup steps until they can access the device settings. Lately, Sony appears to have removed some impractical features, such as the badges under the Listening activity tab. At the same time, they have introduced \"Scenes,\" which allow users to customize headphone behavior, such as switching on or off, at a specific time of day or location. Arguably, such a feature is useful, although some may consider it unnecessary, given how simple it already is to turn the headphones on or off or control playback manually. A familiar feature from previous models is Adaptive Sound Control, which automatically switches between ANC and Ambient mode depending on user activity. Personally, I don't use Adaptive Sound Control or Speak-to-Chat, as I struggle to hear people speaking clearly in Ambient mode. Therefore, I simply remove the headset when conversing. Sony Sound Connect app for Android, the Scenes feature. Sony has introduced a Listening mode in the app, which is exclusive to the WH-1000XM6. There's a choice between \"Standard\", \"Background Music\", and \"Cinema\". \"Background Music\" adjusts the sound to simulate a distant environment, such as a living room or a caf√©. \"Cinema\" is designed for video content and simulates a movie theater environment, made possible by Sony's 360 Reality Audio Upmix technology. In addition to that, the Sound Connect app offers familiar features from previous models, including a custom equalizer, 360 Reality Audio Setup, and Spatial Sound and Head Tracking, all of which enhance the listening experience. The headphones support Bluetooth multipoint, allowing them to connect to multiple devices simultaneously. They also offer voice assistant integration (with a choice between Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa) and the option to customize the ANC/Ambient mode button on the set. Sony Sound Connect app features: Listening Mode, various device settings. Like previous models, the WH-1000XM6 can also automatically pause playback when the headphones are removed from your ears. They also automatically turn off after a short time of inactivity. While the headphones feature a 3.5 mm jack, they don't support USB audio playback, which may put off some users. Performance Audio quality The WH-1000XM6 sound superb. They offer warm tuning, a strong bass presence and improved clarity. There is definite improved midrange clarity, and overall, the headset sounds softer and much fuller than its predecessors. The Sony Sound Connect app features a customizable equalizer control, making it particularly useful for those who prefer to personalize their sound. The app also features a user-friendly \"Find Your Equalizer\" function, enabling users unsure of their sound preferences to select a custom EQ setting easily. Sony Sound Connect app EQ settings. Generally, Sony's latest headset provides an excellent audio experience. Tuned with input from professional mastering engineers, the XM6s strike a balance between studio-grade precision and everyday listening enjoyment, making them ideal for both casual listeners and even some audiophiles. Microphone The Sony WH-1000XM6 come equipped with a six-microphone AI-based beamforming system that isolates your voice and filters background noise. While this is a technical upgrade over previous models, the microphone remains the headset's weakest feature. In a studio setting, the mic quality is good enough for headphones of this caliber. But outdoors, especially in noisy environments such as public transit, the microphone remains abysmal. Sony's algorithm successfully isolates background noise, but that process makes voices almost impossible to hear. The XM6 have an additional toggle in the Sony Sound Connect app that turns on voice capture during phone calls. Voice capture is supposed to improve voice quality, but our tests didn't show a significant improvement. It claims to offer AI-based voice isolation, but in our experience, it behaves more like a noise gate, cutting off sounds below a certain threshold, which sometimes includes your voice as well. Other companies, such as Nvidia, are miles ahead in AI voice isolation. Ultimately, while the Japanese company has made gradual improvements to the microphone setup in recent models, there's still room for improvement in terms of voice clarity. Noise cancellation As expected, the WH-1000XM6 have excellent noise cancellation. They come with an HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3, which is 7x faster than the Q1 in the XM5. ANC excels in reducing repetitive noises, such as running engines and trains, so the headphones perform terrifically on an airplane, public transit or a busy street. Where the technology often falls short is the occasional accidental loud noise, such as a train announcement, although faster processing has made canceling out such noises much better. The XM6 demonstrate improvement over previous models in suppressing accidental noises, although the technology remains imperfect. Having said that, Sony produces some of the best, if not the best, ANC headphones on the market, and the XM6 is currently their best offering. Regarding Ambient mode, at its maximum setting, external sounds are noticeably clearer, and voices come through crisper compared to previous models. The only problem I encountered was the difficulty in finding a comfortable fit, as mentioned earlier. The curvature of the ear cups, plus the fact that I'm wearing glasses, made the fit worse than in previous models, which in turn resulted in a poorer noise-canceling experience. This is not a significant issue; it simply means users must be more cautious when putting the headphones on. Latency and Connectivity We tested the WH-1000XM6 using the AAC and LDAC codecs, and there was no noticeable latency. The headset had excellent connectivity performance during testing. There were no connection drops or stutters during audio playback or phone calls. Battery life Usually, the headphones from the WH-1000XMX series offer outstanding battery life, and the XM6 is no exception. Sony advertises up to 30-hour battery life, and the headset supports fast charging (3 minutes charge for 3 hours of playback). Our tests yielded even more impressive results: using a combination of music playback and voice calls with ANC enabled, the headphones lasted approximately 40 hours on a single charge. Conclusion In conclusion, the Sony WH-1000XM6 is undoubtedly among the best ANC over-ear headphones available. They're lightweight and relatively compact. The noise-canceling experience and audio quality are better than ever. The headset boasts a long and reliable battery life, ensuring it will last through even the longest flights. While the new model is an upgrade over its predecessor in terms of audio quality and ANC, the design remains largely unchanged, if not slightly inferior. The hinging mechanism makes the headset feel less sturdy, yet provides little benefit in terms of compactness. The microphone remains subpar at best when used outdoors. The higher price tag of $499.99 should give buyers pause. While it may be reasonable given global inflation, we find it difficult to justify the value proposition. Especially considering that older models are available at discounted prices or second-hand, for instance, the WH-1000XM5 currently sell for $299.99 on Sony's official website. In this reviewer's opinion, the WH-1000XM6 is a great buy for those upgrading from models older than the XM5 or midrange ANC over-ear headphones. In the end, Sony has delivered a strong addition to the WH-1000XMX family. The XM6 set a solid benchmark for travel headphones and over-ear headphones overall.",

The app also features a user-friendly \u0026#34;Find Your Equalizer\u0026#34; function, enabling users unsure of their sound preferences to select a custom EQ setting easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ca onclick=\"javascript:ShowImg2(\u0026#34;news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/sshots/-1080/gsmarena_004.jpg\u0026#34;); return false\" href=\"#\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/sshots/-216/gsmarena_004.jpg\" height=\"468\" alt=\"Sony Sound Connect app EQ settings. - Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca onclick=\"javascript:ShowImg2(\u0026#34;news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/sshots/-1080/gsmarena_005.jpg\u0026#34;); return false\" href=\"#\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/sshots/-216/gsmarena_005.jpg\" height=\"468\" alt=\"Sony Sound Connect app EQ settings. - Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSony Sound Connect app EQ settings.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, Sony\u0026#39;s latest headset provides an excellent audio experience. Tuned with input from professional mastering engineers, the XM6s strike a balance between studio-grade precision and everyday listening enjoyment, making them ideal for both casual listeners and even some audiophiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMicrophone\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sony WH-1000XM6 come equipped with a six-microphone AI-based beamforming system that isolates your voice and filters background noise. While this is a technical upgrade over previous models, the microphone remains the headset\u0026#39;s weakest feature. In a studio setting, the mic quality is good enough for headphones of this caliber. But outdoors, especially in noisy environments such as public transit, the microphone remains abysmal. Sony\u0026#39;s algorithm successfully isolates background noise, but that process makes voices almost impossible to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe XM6 have an additional toggle in the Sony Sound Connect app that turns on voice capture during phone calls. Voice capture is supposed to improve voice quality, but our tests didn\u0026#39;t show a significant improvement. It claims to offer AI-based voice isolation, but in our experience, it behaves more like a noise gate, cutting off sounds below a certain threshold, which sometimes includes your voice as well. Other companies, such as Nvidia, are miles ahead in AI voice isolation. Ultimately, while the Japanese company has made gradual improvements to the microphone setup in recent models, there\u0026#39;s still room for improvement in terms of voice clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/lifestyle/-1200w5/gsmarena_015.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" alt=\"Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNoise cancellation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, the WH-1000XM6 have excellent noise cancellation. They come with an HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3, which is 7x faster than the Q1 in the XM5. ANC excels in reducing repetitive noises, such as running engines and trains, so the headphones perform terrifically on an airplane, public transit or a busy street. Where the technology often falls short is the occasional accidental loud noise, such as a train announcement, although faster processing has made canceling out such noises much better. The XM6 demonstrate improvement over previous models in suppressing accidental noises, although the technology remains imperfect. Having said that, Sony produces some of the best, if not the best, ANC headphones on the market, and the XM6 is currently their best offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding Ambient mode, at its maximum setting, external sounds are noticeably clearer, and voices come through crisper compared to previous models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/lifestyle/-1200w5/gsmarena_003.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" alt=\"Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only problem I encountered was the difficulty in finding a comfortable fit, as mentioned earlier. The curvature of the ear cups, plus the fact that I\u0026#39;m wearing glasses, made the fit worse than in previous models, which in turn resulted in a poorer noise-canceling experience. This is not a significant issue; it simply means users must be more cautious when putting the headphones on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLatency and Connectivity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tested the WH-1000XM6 using the AAC and LDAC codecs, and there was no noticeable latency. The headset had excellent connectivity performance during testing. There were no connection drops or stutters during audio playback or phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBattery life\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, the headphones from the WH-1000XMX series offer outstanding battery life, and the XM6 is no exception. Sony advertises up to 30-hour battery life, and the headset supports fast charging (3 minutes charge for 3 hours of playback). Our tests yielded even more impressive results: using a combination of music playback and voice calls with ANC enabled, the headphones lasted approximately 40 hours on a single charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/lifestyle/-1200w5/gsmarena_009.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" alt=\"Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, the Sony WH-1000XM6 is undoubtedly among the best ANC over-ear headphones available. They\u0026#39;re lightweight and relatively compact. The noise-canceling experience and audio quality are better than ever. The headset boasts a long and reliable battery life, ensuring it will last through even the longest flights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/25/07/sony-wh-1000-xm6-review/lifestyle/-1200w5/gsmarena_019.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Sony wh-1000XM6 review\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the new model is an upgrade over its predecessor in terms of audio quality and ANC, the design remains largely unchanged, if not slightly inferior. The hinging mechanism makes the headset feel less sturdy, yet provides little benefit in terms of compactness. The microphone remains subpar at best when used outdoors. The higher price tag of $499.99 should give buyers pause. While it may be reasonable given global inflation, we find it difficult to justify the value proposition. Especially considering that older models are available at discounted prices or second-hand, for instance, the WH-1000XM5 currently sell for $299.99 on Sony\u0026#39;s official website. In this reviewer\u0026#39;s opinion, the WH-1000XM6 is a great buy for those upgrading from models older than the XM5 or midrange ANC over-ear headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Sony has delivered a strong addition to the WH-1000XMX family. The XM6 set a solid benchmark for travel headphones and over-ear headphones overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
