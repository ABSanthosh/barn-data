Take for example the JBL Tune Buds, which are currently on sale right now for around $79, much less than their usual retail price. Available in four different colors, the JBL Tune Buds come with 10mm drivers with powerful-sounding bass, Bluetooth 5.3 with LE audio support for better power efficiency, active noise cancelling with smart ambient mode, a quad-mic setup for clearer phone calls, and up to 10 hours of usage on a single charge, with an additional 30 hours if you top up using the charging case.
