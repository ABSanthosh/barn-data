  "text": "A month ago, Nintendo finally teased fans with a video trailer for the highly-anticipated Switch 2 console, showing off the system as well as its accessories including the newly-designed JoyCons and console dock. Aside from this video however, not much was mentioned regarding the actual specifications of the system, although that might all change soon. The Japanese gaming giant confirmed that it will be holding a dedicated online Direct presentation for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is scheduled on the 2nd of April (that’s how we know it isn’t an April Fool’s gig, heh). The presentation will be shown on Nintendo’s official YouTube channel at 6 AM PT, 9 AM ET, and 2 PM UK time. The Switch 2 was the subject of countless leaks over the past few years, which in a way was unsurprising given that the original Switch is eight years old at this point. The video revealed a design that confirmed earlier leaks shared by tech informant @OnLeaks on his Twitter page a while back, including an all-black look with colored accents for the analogue sticks. The removable controllers will now feature a magnetic mechanism to be able to stay attached to the Switch tablet. Other new changes include a USB-C port at the top of the console as well as some redesigned elements including the volume rocker and exhaust vent, a U-shaped kickstand at the rear, and a much larger size this time around, with many speculating an 8-inch display. It’s still not clear if Nintendo is ditching AMOLED for the Switch 2, although there’s some talk about such a possibility. With all that said, we’ll probably get other details such as pricing and availability for the console once Nintendo streams its Direct presentation.",
