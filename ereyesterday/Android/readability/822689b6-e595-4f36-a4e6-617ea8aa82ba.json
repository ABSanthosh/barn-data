Samsung releases several phones each year. Naturally, its flagships, being the big and fancy models in the fleet, get the most attention. However, they're far from the only phones that the South Korean manufacturer releases. They also have their hand deep in the sweet pot that is the budget and midrange markets. We've seen leaks on the Samsung Galaxy A36 already, so that makes for perfect timing for the Samsung Galaxy A35 to go on sale. It's one of the best mid-rangers that Samsung sent to the market this year, so getting the chance to buy it for even less doesn't hurt. Amazon Is Offering The Samsung Galaxy A35 With $100 Slashed Off Image: Samsung For many people, getting a flagship smartphone isn't the best financial decision. They don't need that level of performance or cameras that can capture the moon in high detail. If all you need is a phone with a camera that's “good enough” and performance that can handle most 3D games smoothly, the right mid-range device is bound to make both you and your wallet very happy. Today, you can get your hands on one of Samsung's very best mid-range devices. The Samsung Galaxy A35 is currently on sale on Amazon, taking 25% off the usual price of the device. The A35 typically costs $399.99, but for a limited amount of time, you'll save an entire Benjamin—that's $100 off—bringing the device down to $299.99. Image: Samsung Keep in mind this deal is only available for the Lilac colorway for the device, so if you consider it “girly”, either walk on by or get a case. The Navy colorway gets a smaller 22% discount, bringing it to $313.99. It's up to you whether the color you want is worth $14 more. For $300, The Galaxy A35 Is A Very Solid Device In The Mid-Range Honestly, going for the A35 at its current sale price is a very easy-to-make decision if you want something from a bigger brand without spending too much. You get the same design language as Samsung's current flagships. However, the build quality won't be comparable since the frame is plastic. You at least maintain a glass back though. Image: Samsung The phone has a 6.6-inch 120Hz FHD+ AMOLED screen. An octa-core processor, the Exynos 1380, runs the show, paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. However, you do get the rare microSD slot in case you need more space. The device is also IP67 certified, which is a very nice touch in this price segment. The battery is a 5,000 mAh unit with 25W wired charging, which in the Samsung world, isn't that bad. In the camera division, the primary sensor is a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS, joined by an 8MP ultrawide and a 5MP macro. On the front is a 13MP snapper. It's generally a respectable setup and if you're a content creator, it can record 4K at 30fps, whether you're using the front or rear cameras. Finally, One UI 6.1 with four years of major updates isn't bad either. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
