Back in 2022, OnePlus launched the OnePlus 10T. That was the last time it used the “T” moniker for a phone, though, switching to “R” soon after. According to some rumors, the “T” OnePlus smartphone could be making a return this year, though this time around, it will indicate that the phone is smaller than the rest. Some sources say it could be called the OnePlus 13 Mini instead of the OnePlus 13T, but either way, it is going to be a compact flagship. Despite its diminutive build, it's rumored to beat the big S25 Ultra in some aspects of the spec sheet. While there's nothing official on its launch date, it seems we can expect the device to arrive late next month. The OnePlus 13 Mini Is Expected to Launch in Late April Image: OnePlus The last time that OnePlus released a small phone with a flagship chip was probably when it released the OnePlus X ten years ago. The company has never established itself as one that provides you with compact options, but with the current trends in the smartphone space, there's no better time to get into that than right now. OnePlus has plans to launch a device with a 6.3-inch screen—that size passes as compact these days—and it'll be called either the OnePlus 13T or the OnePlus 13 Mini. Either way, it is meant to be a small flagship, in the same boat as options like the upcoming Oppo Find X8S or the Vivo X200 Pro Mini. Image: OnePlus While the Chinese OEM hasn't acknowledged its existence, once leaks pass a certain threshold, it's hard to doubt things any longer. According to Digital Chat Station on Weibo, the smartphone is expected to arrive on the scene in late April. That is about a month away, and though there's no exact date, it's a good enough window to look forward to. We'll be marking our calendars over here. The OnePlus 13T Will Beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra in the Battery Department, Despite Being Much Smaller The OnePlus 13T is expected to launch with a 6.3-inch screen, and as far as flagship phones go, that's the absolute minimum that you'll find, perhaps with the exception of the Galaxy S25 (6.2 inches). Gone are the days of flagships with screen sizes below the 6-inch mark. Smaller bezels do ultimately give the device a much smaller footprint than years before, and with a flagship chip inside, you're really not compromising. Image: OnePlus The OnePlus 13T is expected to come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite, just like all the other top flagships in the market right now (the Dimensity 9400 is the only other acceptable choice). That puts it on par with a device as heavy-duty as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Yet, despite the massive chasm in size, the OnePlus 13T actually beats out Samsung's king in battery and charging. The upcoming compact device is expected to have a 6,200mAh battery, which is 1,200mAh bigger than what Samsung offers—that's nearly a 25% increase despite having a much smaller footprint. It's even a bigger battery than the OnePlus 13. It is also going to have 80W wired charging, which is almost double the speed that Samsung offers. I do hope Samsung will take things seriously in 2026—I have no heart left to defend it. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
