Not many of us do, especially when we can save so much cash by catching a deal on the previous-generation Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. They are still impressive cans, and you can get them for just $198 right now, which is a $150 discount over their retail price. Buy the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones for just $198This deal is available from Amazon. That said, Sony has also kicked off its early Black Friday sale, offering the same model for $199.99.

These include Bluetooth multipoint, auto-pausing when you remove the headset, touch gesture controls, and more. Battery life is also quite amazing at about 24 hours per charge. Again, it’s not as impressive as the XM5’s 32 hours, but it’s still very good. We haven’t really seen this price since Amazon Prime Day, so it might be time to snatch these up if you’re looking to get a great pair of over-ear headphones without spending too much money on them. Act quickly! We’re not sure how long Sony will be feeling jolly. Extra deal: The Sony WH-1000XM5 are also on sale!

Battery life also gets a nice bump up to 32 hours. And if you turn off ANC, that extends to an impressive 53 hours on a full charge!Of course, you still get Bluetooth multipoint, touch gestures, a really nice EQ, and even Find My Device support.
